Had been up 4 days, didnt quite realize how wired i was and kept chasing a rush like an idiot. Took my last dose around 2:30pm, around 4pm started having chest pains. By 6pm, my heart was racing, and my left arm went numb. I was at a family gathering, Ha. I obviously hadnt been smoking any cigarettes by that time, and i had taken an aspirin, because i knew what was going on. I didnt allow myself to exert any physical energy, stayed that way until about 8pm and then made it home. I took a shower, to see if my circulation got any better, but it was only worse. At 9:30pm my wife took me to the ER where I told them I was Overdosing on meth, and i needed to be monitered, i showed them the massive amount of crystals i was sweating from my palms. They werent surprised, i guess its frequent in my area. They were so nice to me surprisingly. I got to my room, and then had an xray, and blood work.  My Heart Rate and Ekg  actually were decent, but my BP was through the roof. By 11 or 12, i dont even know, i was in so much pain, i really thought that was it. My entire body was numb, and severely tingling, like when your foot falls asleep to the point where it hurts, but 100x worse and in my whole body, i mean stomach, face everywhere. I thought i was having a heart attack by this point my heart was racing and my vision was getting blurry my body was turning grey and i felt like a dumptruck was on my chest. I was insanely weak, could barely call for the nurse. I hit the button, and managed to say "get somebody in here please". What seemed like forever, the nurse finally came in, i saw her approach me and then i passed out. Woke up 40 minutes later, heart stable, but still in pain, and really really high on meth nonetheless. I was stable flr a while, and they sent me home. I didnt have a heart attack. I have an appoint with my family doctor this week. I also quit smoking cigarettes. Im still in pain, still sweating fuckin rocks basically. My circulation is back, which was the worst part of the whole thing. Im going to be taking it very easy the next little while. Gave my stash to a homie. Got me some really really good bud. Gotta take aspirin for a while. Yall be safe out there. Dont chase that fuckin rush yall. Do your shit  and get on with it. Much love.First and foremost... no judgement. I don't care what anybody does with their time, you do you, I'm just curious about things.

I've never done meth and have zero plans on doing so, well... I smoked some weed that was laced once and that was fun but it wasn't for me. With that said, I saw this sub linked from another post and started reading. I've known people who have gotten into meth and it's destroyed their lives. On the other hand, I see all of you guys (somewhat) glorifying its use.

Can you actually live a normal life while using meth? From my understanding, you start using, then use more and more. You eventually pawn your shit and start living in a meth house with other people to support the habit. Is that just one subset of users?

Are there suburban moms and dads who hit the pipe after a soccer game then go to their normal 9-5 jobs the next morning?

A lot of people on this sub seem to be taking this subject pretty lightly like it was weed. 

Maybe I've thought about meth users in a narrow mindset (thanks to media mostly). 

Or, are all you guys on the brink of financial hardship and joke around about things because it's easier than facing life.

*Thanks baes*I was going to the bathroom 2 times a day at Almost the exact same times without even realizing it and bustin a line to carry me through the first 2 half’s at work and go back to the line standing by the grill and standing by a hot grill off the G funk lemme just tell you I was SOOPPING WET like chain sex on the Mayflower. I’m about to leave work and mans said “ I needed to Talk to you I can see You’re struggling (cause he’s sober now) I’ve lived it man we share the same struggle but I don’t wanna see you fail you needa get your shit in order I’m not gonna fire you cause I know what it’s like but you have to start being at 100 instead of what you’re doing now and being spun out at work struggling” damn mans isn’t wrong I been He’s a dope dude to even pull me aside and let me know what was up and being real and giving me da chance to do what I needa do instead of just saying alright later you tweaker junkie hit the road!It's been roughly a year since that very first half gram I picked up. Roughly a year since I foolishly uttered the words "I'll be fine." I knew that statement was bullshit, but I didn't feel like that statement was bullshit. It's hard to scroll through this subreddit and see the slew of posts from people considering doing meth for the first time. They all share the same ominous light-hearted undertone. It's like a bluntly placed bit of foreshadowing in a low budget movie. It's sad and sticks out like sore thumb to anyone who has even slightly seen or experienced what the twack dust is capable of doing to a human. So here I am, four days in with a only laughable amount of sleep. I decided that I'll be stopping for good, before things get worse. I think to myself that it's really not too bad relative to how it could be, and I catch myself once again forming those famous last words in my mind. "I'll be fine."Smoked a point of crystal and without even thinking I immediately descend into a panic state....my girlfriend will be coming home from work soon, I need to wank, I need to watch porn I MUST, I don't wanna fuck I don't wanna deal with other ppls shit...I frantically book a hotel room on Agoda.. I pack my things in a hurry, lube, buttplug, pipe, lighter. I drive high as fook to the hotel, I check in, I smoke an unholy amount, bring up the porn on my phone, HD well produced shit from sinfulxx CURSE THAT SITE,...it's a land of pleasure...I smoke, sneakily to not offset an alarm or smell, I smoke more than 2 points, txt dealer get another 2 points, fap, smoke that shit, fucked outta my mind.... buttplug inserted, in that state I would die for it...even when I feel my body trembling, sweating, feeling like I'm on the brink of overdose I fukin smoke till my lips are bleeding and peeling from being so dry and covered in yellow residue and when I cum, I don't even cum, I have an out of body experience seeing myself in third person, no control of my motor functions, having a seizure while the flood gates of my dick blast open, my phone turned off for hours on end...not telling anyone where I am or where I went, the pleasure...a world of it. Other worldly, like we invaded pleasure planet and mined it for all it's worth, it's unholy, even if I deny it I know the pleasure is other worldly, I smoke so much that I burn through 2 fucking new Bic lighters.... I cum like the fkin girl in the exorcist movie....god help us all.And I've come to terms with the fact that I have become a fucking raging maniacle psychopath. Time to put the fuckin pipe down. Never in my life would I have thought I would become the person I am today and it's making me sick to my stomach coming to grips with it.   


The moral and ethical guidelines I spent years forging for myself were so easily substituted for debauchery, deception, irresponsibility, apathy...and a complete disregard for anyone around me's well being.   


It's generated a deep seeded selfishness that I have never felt before in my life and I am ashamed and disgusted with myself. The money I could have used fueling my passions in music and gaming, wasted. The time I could have spent honing artistic and creative skills....gone. I know it doesn't help whatsoever to despise ones self but if I was standing in front of me I would beat the fucking snot out of myself.   


I'm disgraced. I'm gonna get better. I'm gonna annihilate the walls I have built up around myself and become a respectable human being as I once was in my community. Fuck this.I’m 23 years old, and there’s a 50% chance I’ll be dead within five years. Congestive heart failure, my doctor said. I didn’t believe him at first. I’d only been using for five months, aren’t there people who use for decades? 

That’s the thing. I knew the statistics and numbers. I just never thought it’d be me. I used and used and ignored the chest pains, the shortness of breath, the numbness. “It’s just anxiety, I’ll be alright.” And I was. Until I wasn’t. Spent 30 days in rehab after losing my friends, family, home, and sanity. 

I started to feel better, so I figured what’s one last time gonna hurt? Turns out it can hurt a lot. My “one last time” gave me a heart attack. I’m sitting here hooked up to machines and IV’s still wondering how it ended up like this. Even if I stay 100% sober, the damage is irreversible and will get worse until I die in extreme pain. 

I’m the least anti-drug type there is. All I’m saying is take this shit seriously. Because it can kill you. During my heart attack, I actually prayed for God to save me. I’d never prayed in my life. It’s funny how things work out. I got another chance, but it’s only gonna be spent suffering. My friends never came back. The damage I did in my addiction did not heal.

I thought my actions didn’t matter, that I had nothing left to lose. But trust me. You’ll lose things you didn’t even know you had.Some people want meds to take the unpleasantness away after using methamphetamines. Others want to take “something” to keep from getting the same reactions before using meth. The wiser will be the second group. For those of you who know little or nothing about the upkeep of your body and what meth is doing to it: There is NO magic pill.

Obviously, we can’t cover every condition or medical problem associated with using meth, but we can give you an essential guide to using the basics of vitamins, minerals and even herbal supplements that can be used preventatively, during and after use.

We won’t discuss any chemicals that may be found in other sections of Drugs-Forum dealing with bringing down the high, forcing sleep or in any way induces the body to react in a manner you might like it to. We are not polyusers and don’t advise doing so. Combining uppers with uppers, or uppers with downers can become quite dangerous—and that is not Harm Reduction. 

The use of meth causes a rapid chemical change in the mind and body, and the body reacts to it as a toxin, which it is. Our idea is to reduce the damage caused.

Preparation for a meth session is extremely important. If the body is not ready for this onslaught, the damage comes on faster and with more force. Two things we might not find in the medicine cabinet, but more likely the refrigerator, are the essentials you need, in liquid and solid form.


**Keeping the body hydrated is the #1 rule.** 
What does this mean? Simply making sure we have consumed enough water and metabolites, and continue to do so, while meth does its thing. Water is the base liquid, but the addition of metabolites such as potassium and sodium, are critical to maintain your body’s fluid, regulate blood pressure and heart function. Sports drinks are recommended by many.

Once meth enters the body, it’s a fight for survival and blood is routed to the organs that cleanse the body. The blood has to be moving fast—free-flowing—and that means it’s not sticky and dehydrated. Those organs need to remain healthy to do the job at hand and survive while doing it.

**Eating.** 
A nutritious diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as high protein foods such as red meats will give your body the majority of vitamins and minerals you need to keep you healthy. Fatty foods such as French fries and deep-fried cheese sticks do not contain them.

**Hydrating and Eating are your 2 top priorities, bar none.**

Now, let’s go see what’s in the medicine cabinet. On the top shelf—the most important one–the first item is Multivitamins (and minerals). Do you really need them? Do you eat 3 nutritiously balanced meals a day along with drinking 3, 8-oz. glasses of homogenized milk, including a good workout regimen in the sun? Most people don’t, and that’s why you need a multivitamin.

Many meth users have asked what kind of a multivitamin they should take. If you research them on the internet, it seems the ratings on each chart are somewhat dependent on who is sponsoring the charts of the best. I’ve looked around, read reviews, and come up with two that actually rate somewhere better than the middle of the charts and aren’t that expensive. Just remember: take one per day, and only one.

For Men: **Centrum Silver Men 50+**. The experts say you should ignore the “men 50+,” because the combination is correct for any male. These multis don’t contain any iron and you already get enough from your food. Go to the Centrum Silver website and get a $3.00 off coupon for them!

For Women: **One-A-Day Women’s** contain the amount of iron needed for premenopausal women, in addition to the other essentials you should find in a multi. Go to the One-A-Day Women’s website and get a $1.00 off coupon!

While included in the multis, there is one other vitamin that needs to be increased in the meth users’ diet, as well as those who also smoke cigarettes. It is **Vitamin D3**. You need vitamin D3 to properly absorb calcium. Meth leaches the body of calcium and it’s vital you maintain blood calcium levels. You also need D3 to help your body continue to build strong and healthy bones all throughout your life. It also can reduce inflammation and hold your immune system in check. The most natural way the body gets Vitamin D3 is from the sun. Milk is also fortified with Vitamin D3. But since you didn’t drink your milk and didn’t go outside to exercise in the sun, you really need these. I take one 5,000I.U. soft gel every day.

The next bottle on the top shelf is **Calcium, Magnesium & Zinc**. Even though they are already included in your multi (but only at 25%-30% of daily recommended value for Calcium and Magnesium), the way meth uses these minerals up, you really need more. Calcium, of course, builds strong bones, but it also makes muscles move and contract, allows nerves to carry messages, keeps blood vessels throughout the body healthy, and helpsneurotransmitter release! If you know and love dopamine, then you know how really important this is. Unless you are on a heavy fig and rutabaga diet, then you need this supplement.

**Magnesium** is important for the functioning of your heart, muscles, kidneys, and balancing other nutrients such as calcium and potassium. It also improves blood pressure. Once you know what the deficiencies of magnesium cause, you will ask no more questions. They are: anxiety, weak bones, low energy, weakness, inability to sleep, PMS and hormonal imbalances, irritability, nervousness, headaches, abnormal heart rhythm, muscle tension, spasms, cramps, and fatigue. Now get this—one of the biggest complaints we have—TEETH CLENCHING, or Bruxism, is also a Magnesium deficiency. And it seems the magnesium does a better job resolving it when it has a fresh supply of calcium helping it.

**Zinc** helps you maintain a healthy immune system and fights infections. (Take note, IV users.) Zinc is necessary for the functioning of more than 300 different enzymes and plays a vital role in an enormous number of biological processes.

What a one-two-three knockout punch these guys have. And only two tablets a day will take care of all these things for just pennies. 

**Potassium Gluconate.** I think I was taking these tablets before meth was invented. Potassium is an electrolyte (along with sodium), which is why I encourage people to use sports drinks, as they are included. The potassium helps regulate (lower) blood pressure and heart function. As you know, when using meth, your blood pressure skyrockets, so why not help curb the possibility of a stroke? As a matter of fact, there was a Harvard study that showed taking potassium supplements along with a diuretic (yeah, give me a couple of those potassiums with a cup of coffee), reduced the incidence of a stroke by 60%. Potassium is what makes our cardiovascular and nervous systems function. I’ve found it also works with magnesium to prevent cramping, and it aids during the recuperation part of your meth escapades. 

The tablets contain 595mg of potassium, which is slightly more than the potassium found in a medium-sized banana. Take your pick. Have one of each. But be sure to double that number over the period of a day. Potassium doesn’t stay in the system for a long time. Oh, and one more very important thing: potassium is one of the prime movers, along with zinc, in elimination of wastes. That’s where all of those toxins the body is trying to get rid of are hanging out. And if they hang out inside of you too long, you become a recipient of toxic buildup—not a good thing.

Those, believe it or not, are your “prepping for meth use” essentials. Food, drink, and 4 bottles of vitamins and minerals. And when you look at it, and how complete it really is, it reminds me of prepping for the flu. You know the invader is coming, and you are prepared. 

Before we have a look at the 2nd shelf, let me tell you that the supplements industry brings in over $60 billion a year. Once some people start taking them, it becomes almost an…addiction. “Horny Goat Weed sounds good. I think I’ll try that along with the Horsetail Shavegrass.” About $1,000 later and a cabinet full of supplements, these people realize all they are doing is taking supplements. They can’t even remember the last time they cooked a meal. So, let’s not get too carried away and fill the shelf too full.

Another point of view involves human nature. If we make a list of things to take every day that is too long, because of the hassle and time involved, a lot of people will fall out of the program. However, if we have simply the essentials that will do the job, the tablets or capsules can be assembled and swallowed in less than a minute. 

My first two personal picks not only are helpful when using meth, but also fulfill a couple of other needs I have. The first is **L-arginine**. It’s a dietary supplement that produces Nitric Oxide (NO). Nitric Oxide should not be confused with Nitrous Oxide, the laughing gas. But it’s still a gas and what is does is enter the bloodstream and drop off these little bubbles on the insides of the vein walls, stretching them out, making them wider. My primary use is because I have a slight high blood pressure condition, and it allows the blood to flow smoother. But, if you’re a meth user, too, you might have figured out it works against vasoconstriction, or tightening of the veins. Many men cope with vasoconstriction when high. The more meth they use, the tighter the blood vessels, until no more blood can get through to make an erection. Relief is possible with just a couple of capsules a day, two times a day. Also, for IV users who have a difficult time finding veins, I have discovered that as the veins plump a little, they also become more visible in some areas.

The next supplement is **HGH Dopa 400**, also known as mucuna pruriens. I don’t bother with the HGH (human growth hormone) efficacy as it is small, even if true, but the plant material ground up and put in these capsules is full of L-dopa, a precursor to making dopamine. Now why would anyone want their brains to produce more dopamine? Besides the fact I’m getting a bit old and maybe the dopamine production isn’t as good as it used to be (normal), maybe I just don’t want to run out of dopamine when I’m high and want to stay that way. 

The next couple of bottles contain supplements that are popular, and effective. 

**Omega-3 fatty acids**. Omega-3s are not produced by the body and naturally are derived from eating fish. Research shows that omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and may help lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and arthritis. Omega-3 fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and appear to be important for cognitive (brain memory and performance) and behavioral function. It may also assist in controlling high blood pressure and, in people with Bipolar disorder, reduce mood swings. Symptoms of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency include fatigue, poor memory, dry skin, heart problems, mood swings or depression, and poor circulation. Daily dosing should be based on the amount of EPA (180mg) and DHA (120mg) acids, not total amount of fish oil. 

**Coenzyme Q10**, or CoQ10 vitamin supplement, is naturally made in the body, but sometimes (especially with aging) the necessary levels of this enzyme-protein that speeds up the rate at which chemical reactions take place in the body, drop to below what is considered normal. Its main function, however, is as an antioxidant. While many trials have been run, peer reviews have not been overwhelmingly positive, due to the lack of further studies. The antioxidant function of CoQ10 appears strongest in reducing neurological damage or decline, including that of dopamine neurotransmitters. My next door neighbor, who is 80, says this is the closest thing to a miracle drug. Do you want to live that long? My answer is that I take this stuff. Since it is fat-soluble, I take it at the same time as my Omega-3. Daily dosage is 200mg-600mg.

At this point in time, I am satisfied with the above list. The dietary regimen that we started off with, along with these vitamins, minerals and supplements, are really the glue that binds in keeping our bodies whole, especially for the meth user. They are also the most protective and restorative additions we can make without breaking the bank.

There are other supplements that seem to be common with meth users. Perhaps the most often mentioned is **melatonin**. This is a hormone that is found in all biological organisms, and as such, we know we produce it ourselves, in the pineal gland from the raw material Tryptophan. Melatonin regulates our internal clock and maintains the Circadian Rhythm of our body. But we know what happens when we start using meth. All of a sudden our internal clock is shattered and we are officially on “Meth Time.” Depending on usage patterns and amounts, we find one Meth Day can extend itself past 24, 36, 48 hours and even beyond. At some point, the user may decide to end this prolonged day and get some sleep. But the meth is still active and sleep is hard to arrive. 

Melatonin turns off the meth clock and helps reset the body to the biological clock function. It also promotes sleep and affords the body a long restful period, where deep sleep begins and allows the body to start healing itself. Taking the recommended tablets returns the body to normal levels of Melatonin where sleep becomes automatic.

Melatonin is also used by some people along with benzodiazepines; however there is a possibility of creating a benzo dependency with long term use. (As mentioned earlier, I can’t talk about or recommend using uppers with uppers or uppers with downers as there sometimes are consequences that cannot be predicted.) There are also several other chemical interactions with a supplemental dose of melatonin which can reduce the efficacy of other medications you may be taking. It was for that reason, I decided not to use melatonin.

If we were to look at the lower level of the *”Meth Medicine Cabinet”*, we also might find other things that might be used. For instance, that bottle ofisopropyl alcohol, which is mostly used to sterilize any areas of the skin that might be met by an IV needle, a broken piece of a glass pipe or other minor cuts and scratches. A tube of **Hydrocortisone 1% Cream** used to treat itching and small burns, and a tube of **Triple Antibiotic Ointment (Neosporin)** to be applied on a damaged area to prevent infection are a couple of great first aid musts. Not to mention only accidents that happen when doing your drug, think of all of those times you’ve experienced spun out people pulling things apart, moving things around, falling on their butts and creating minor mayhem.

What’s this bottle? **Viagra!** For those men who have really serious consequences trying to get their manhood going while under siege from vasoconstriction, a half-tab of this stuff may do the trick. The caution is that it’s trying to relax those veins while the norepinephrine release is doing just the opposite. There’s a tug-o-war going on here that can stress the body, especially the heart.

**Yohimbe 2000** is over there in the corner. It’s a natural stimulant, what I call “Poor Man’s Meth.” One of the better features of this herbal product is that it actually acts as a vasodilator, while still stimulating the body. Yohimbe has been known as an aphrodisiac for centuries, which most likely has been based on how it stimulates. Let’s say you are all out of your man-made stimulant but still feel ready to go that extra mile. Using one or two of these capsules may just let you make it to the finish line. But be careful, as there is a very thin line between being good and being bad. Too much of this stuff, and the nausea and other bad vibe reactions kick in, simply spoiling the moment.

Sitting up behind the Yohimbe bottle are a couple of sanitary wrapped prophylactics. They are there as a reminder that meth users, as a group, become a pretty high percentage of people who spread STDs, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases along with assorted cooties, which are not the same as meth bugs.

Below the Meth Medicine Cabinet, there’s a basket full of goodies. Let’s investigate. I see a couple of **toothbrushes**, some **toothpaste** and **dental floss**. I think we’re onto something! Taking care of your teeth and mouth are extremely important, whether a meth user or not. But when meth gets ahold of your mouth, the damage can increase at the speed of light. Next to those items is a big bottle of **ACT Restoring Mouthwash**, great for restoring enamel and it helps mineral recrystallization on the teeth. Next to the ACT is a bottle of **Biotene**, a mouthwash specifically made for dry mouth. Meth dries out the mouth and gives you the common “Meth Mouth.” A dry mouth means bacteria can form, causing ulcerations—mouth sores. Biotene also comes in gel form, which is designed to keep your mouth from going dry for 6-8 hours. There’s also a salt shaker and an empty glass. Falling short of the commercial methods, you can always gargle with warm salt water to kill off the bacteria. Just do it more often.

Recommendations—Good and Bad

Here are a couple of items I have seen people recommend, but they come with some advisories. There are many of our multivitamins that are also sold individually as Super Paks or under other marketing names. Let’s take the Vitamin B Complex group as one such item. And I am sure they have some benefits that your multis don’t have. But the fact remains that they are already in your multis at 100% Recommended Values. Before proceeding to take the both, and therefore at least doubling recommended amounts, I would want to research them to see at what level they become toxic. 

Here’s another that I see recommended from time-to-time, and for the life of me I can’t understand why, except whoever started this trend did not do their homework. L-tyrosine is abundant in our foods and we get more than enough of it without supplementation. But, it’s also known to convert to L-dopa. And that’s where the research must have ended. They didn’t read how it also produces a lot of norepinephrine, that Dark Knight of Vasoconstriction–that bugaboo of irony created when using meth. But there’s more. It just might be that adding the supplement puts you over the top and actually shuts down your production of dopamine. That’s what L-tyrosine can do in larger amounts.

Some people simply cannot eat when high, due to other conditions they may suffer, or their own body chemistry. There is an alternative in liquid form that you can use to replace the solid food. Many meth users prefer to use protein shakes, such as Ensure.

Before we end this, let’s talk about dosages. More people than I want to imagine must believe that if one tablet is good, two must be better. That is not the case. Even vitamins and minerals have toxic levels. Always read recommended dosages and warning labels on any vitamins, minerals, supplements, and medicines you may also be taking. As I had to remind a friend one time: taking too many vitamins is not going to get you high, but it might get you sick. 

There’s still more room in the Meth Medicine Cabinet. Maybe you have something you’d like to recommend. If you have something neat you have discovered and use, then let us know. But just don’t name it. Tell us how it helps your body, if there are any contraindications, and if there are any downsides to using it. You should at least be able to explain this, since you are using them.Below I’ve compiled a small list of helpful resources that should answer the majority of questions that get asked on the subreddit.

*If there is any informative research not already posted, please feel free to DM me, and I’ll see to it’s validity~*Idk why I didn't believe this since I've heard it constantly since I was a kid but usually I'm pretty good about being sensible and responsible with drug usage. Meth fucked me up in about a month, suddenly I was doing dumbass shit and finding myself in awful situations and fucking random people. Retarded thing is I know I'm not done. My alcohol intake has also skyrocketed. Evil drug.I deleted my previous post about relapsing and getting some meth. I decided not to buy any, I want to maintain my clean time. If my dealer does call me (he has my second number from text now doesnt have primary number) I'll just tell him I'm busy. 

I don't see point in losing clean time and possibility of another full blown psychosis.I always said I would never touch this garbage because no matter how much I hate myself, I don’t hate myself enough to do meth. However my two “best friends” from elementary school finally convinced me to try it last year one drunken night and haven’t turned back since. 

Over the past year or so I’ve slowly started to lose more and more of myself. I used to beat myself up a lot for using because I know I’m worth so much more. But now it’s just like I accept this for myself. 

I see my body deteriorating and my mind slipping. My memory is shit. My patience is paper thin. My teeth are becoming brittle and yellowing no matter how much I brush and whiten them. My once rosy chunky cheeks and soft skin I would always get complimented on is now sunken in and dull. 

I work in the health field so I’m well aware of all the terrible things that are currently happening to my body but I avoid taking care of myself so I can continue living in denial of my problem. I don’t want to know that my blood pressure is 158/92. I don’t want to know how extremely malnourished I most likely am. 

Meth has totally and utterly consumed me. It’s quite literally it’s own evil entity. I’ve never seen such dark and evil things like I have while surrounding myself with the people that use this shit. However there is a small part of me that grounds me. An inner voice crying out for help saying it’s not too late. Saying I deserve self love and care. I deserve to be healthy and happy. Clean from this atrocious drug. 

I don’t care what anybody says, you cannot sustain on this drug. I have been lucky enough to be able to somehow maintain my job, continue paying all my bills, and stay mostly under the radar but my luck won’t last forever. If you’ve never tried this shit and are offered, DONT FUCKING DO IT. I BEG YOU. If you’re clean from this shit and thinking about relapsing. DONT FUCKING DO IT. it’s not worth it you aren’t missing out on shit. And if you use this shit and negligently tell people it’s okay to use, shame on you. Just because you don’t care for yourself, don’t try to burn other people down with you. Meth will do that fine on its own.It's almost like life turned around on a dime. 90 days later I can't believe I made it back from where I was at. I can't believe how everything just fell into place. I used to post here a lot and I used to post on FuckingTweakers a whole bunch. I just want to tell you guys that I know some of you don't want to be doing this anymore and you come here out of habit. Your old life is gone. You're never going to go back to what it was. Everything is going to be completely different. But everything is going to be so much better. I promise you.I am 22, never touched meth and never will. i just have some questions for the crowd because i miss my mom so much, she is addicted to the same vice you all are. does she miss me? does she ever think about when she was sober and how much fun we would have? why can she not come back? how can she look me in the eyes and say to me "i could quit if i really wanted to"??? i am her only son how the fuck am i not reason enough to quit? i remember i would get embarrassed on school field trips because my friends could see her track marks or notice that she just can't stop moving/talking/fidgeting.. will there be a day where i can tell her every reason i love her, without it being at her funeral? will i ever be able to ask my mom to bring me a pair of work pants without being scared of a needle poking me again? is there truly even a way out? shes been gone for 12 years.. i've raised myself to the point where i can't even credit her for my upbringing.. i just miss her, i hate this addiction and i hate that it took my mother away from me, and you all know how bizarre it is because she isn't fucking dead, she is 43 and alive but not truly living.

UPDATE: thank you all for your generous words and kind thoughts, there are more responses than i can respond to without sitting on my phone for an hour hhaha but like i said thank you all and i wish all of you the very bestMy girl and I have a history of using together. 3 years ago she showed me another side of life, where she was most familiar and my curiosity threw us into a heroin habit which in turn allowed us to royally fuck up our lives in the time span of less than a year. To spare you all the unnecessary bullshit we became piece of shit junkies with no jobs and an addiction that was never satisfied. We hustled and stole whatever we could get our dirty hands on to feed the monster inside of us. I went from an outgoing, fun, genuinely happy, confident and intelligent 21 year old woman to a soulless shell of a person whose body had been pumped so full of poison from skin popping in my arms that I was constantly oozing pus and blood. 

We got arrested for shop lifting, we started our detox in jail, I was released early but she had to stay for a while longer. I realized that I couldn’t get off the dope if we were together, and I had to get clean in order to get my life back on track. I didn’t have another choice. So I broke off the relationship which was devastating in itself. She was my light when everything was dark. I had to let go of the love of my life, we’ll call her Q, and my best friend, heroin. 

We both get into new relationships, I had a few relapses but finally committed to my recovery and I had 2 and a half years clean from heroin.  She had also been working on her sobriety and had just gotten back into town after spending some time in rehab away from the triggers of our city. She had really struggled with her sobriety, which I expected seeing as she had 8 years of prior drug abuse under her belt before we had even initially met. 

So I’m at work one evening and I look at two customers walking in the door and immediately lock eyes with Q and her mother and walk over to hug them both. Q explains that she had a job interview in the area and they had hoped I would be working. I was shocked to see her and she looked fucking gorgeous. She gets a cell phone two days later and I was excited to see a message from her.  One thing leads to another and that following weekend Q is at my apartment and we’re catching each other up on all we had missed during our time apart. She tells me how she spent this past summer living on the streets, jumping from trap to trap, and pimping out her prostitute girlfriend as well as other women selling their body for a few dollars. She’s banging meth in one arm and heroin in the other, she was always searching for a better rush, a longer high. She was kicking in doors, robbing innocent people of their money and possessions, stealing cars, and living the lifestyle that she craved from this kind of fucked up and dark environment to support her habit. We have a couple drinks, stay up all night talking, and eventually end up fucking in my bed. Next thing I know we’re on 71 south from my apartment headed to the god damn west side where we end up banging crystal fucking meth at 7 am. 

So now, not only had she introduced my sheltered ass to heroin just 3 years prior, but I once again find myself in the driver’s seat of my car with her riding shotgun, and I’m tying off my arm to cut off the blood supply, searching for veins on my scarred arms and eventually banging this ice. 

Fucking Deja vu. 

So here we are, it’s been over a month of using nonstop with not even a full weeks worth of sleep to keep our heads on straight. 
Today we decided that we need to take a break for a week or so and get our tolerance back down because at this point we’re shooting a gram a piece, feeling a little heartburn but the euphoria is fucking gone and the high doesn’t last all night like it had in the beginning. And I find myself questioning my brain. Am I seeing shadows of people in my house or is my mind playing tricks on me? Are there strangers talking in my kitchen or people breaking into my home and destroying my living room? Or am I just hearing things again? Because I honestly am at the point where I cannot tell the difference. Is this the meth fucking up my brain? Or could it be the fact that we’ve gone 9 days without a single hour of sleep? 


Now listen, meth is...... unreal... like god damn. That rush is nothing short of divine. As soon as that dark red blood poured into my rig, and I had emptied the syringe into my bloodstream I was thrown into a literal orgasm and we fucked all night and then turned around and fucked all day. I was able to function at work and still pay my bills. Q never went home to her mothers place, she was basically moved in and we were getting close to each other again after being apart for so long. We didn’t withdrawal or get dope sick like we did with the tar... we thought we could just do this shit all the time. 


So we do our last shot this evening before we take a break for the week, I get a little heartburn and my clit finds a pulse but Q quickly realizes something isn’t right. She had cotton fever last night which lasted almost 7 hours and started feeling pain tonight after her injection. Her back was in tight, agonizing pain which brought her to tears and made it hard to catch her breath. She wasn’t over dosing because we only had half a gram that we split when yesterday we were doing double that amount. 


So I start googling the symptoms of chronic meth use, looking for answers and it hit me..... her fucking body is shutting down right in front of me... this is real. We are facing the consequences of our actions. The ice racing through her veins has been breaking down her muscle tissue, melting her brain which is causing severe memory loss, and her kidneys are giving up. The human body’s only job is to keep you alive... but it can only take so much punishment. 9+ years of drug abuse and neglect.....she will not live to see her 30th birthday if she doesn’t give up the absolute love of her life and her only confidant.. the fucking drugs. 

I went out and bought her excedrin for her migraine and body aches as well as motrin for her fever. She’s asleep on my lap which is great because she doesn’t have a high pain tolerance so she’s been crying in pain for hours now it seems. I keep staring at this familiar face and I can’t help thinking of how lost I’d be if she were to die at 27 years old.. she is my soulmate and best friend. This kind of connection is once in a lifetime and I’m not letting her go, especially without me. 

Drugs are fucking fantastic, I’ll never think  otherwise. It is euphoric and down right heavenly. Total mind and body numbness, you truly feel at peace when you’re in its relentless grip. You become invincible, untouchable. Who needs friends and family for happiness, support and comfort when that ice floods my brain with dopamine and I literally cum without even touching myself. Who needs emotions? Especially shame and guilt about my drug use and the fact that I AM KILLING MYSELF FUCKING SLOWLY WITH EVERY GOD DAMN FUCKING NEEDLE I SHOVE INTO MY SKIN. Who needs to live when an eternal slumber would allow me to rest my exhausted and deteriorating body? 


And yet, here we are after all this time. 


I refuse to believe that we were created to suffer through this life in pain until we die.. we are here for a god damn reason and I know with my heart and soul that Q is my reason, she gives me a purpose and I am nothing without her by my side, my twin flame. 



Meth is fucking amazing..... till it isn’t. And you control your life and your destiny... until you don’t. 


All my love, 
xxxxxx
he had a meth induced heart attack, and before that it ruined his life and his relationship with me. 


please consider the harsh ramifications of how the use affects you and your family. you're free to do as you want, but don't be my dad. Don't leave a child fatherless, don't put using meth over your childrens health and safety, don't allow it near pets, and please if you're going to do it be safe, please. 


don't be my dad. i loved him with my whole heart and to see the downward spiral because of some crystals breaks my heart. don't do it for you, do it for everyone else. 


((not encouraging quitting, encouraging smart and safe use 💖))


edit: ya'll i am a teenager, I do not and never once used meth. I don't want to, I never will. I think it's a horrible drug but it is not up to me what other people put in their bodies. I wrote to write about my experience with it in my family because I don't want there to be more children victims of meth use. please stop being mean, i just lost my father and this was a way for me to vent how I felt to people who understand how damaging the drug can be. I am not trying to encourage or preach to anyone to quit.If you are going to use, LIVE by the rules. 

(You don’t have to listen to every single one. These are more or less just tips, so you can create personal rules that correlate best for your lifestyle.)

TAKE FUCKING CARE OF YOURSELF OR EVERYBODY IS GOING TO FIND OUT AND YOU’LL LOOSE EVERYTHING. 

HYDRATION: 

- Carry a reusable water bottle with you at all times. 
- Put flavor packets in your bag, it’ll help you WANT to drink water. 
- Your goal should be to drink 8 glasses a day. Normal people drink this much.. and they aren’t using an insanely dehydrating substance.  
- Try to get your hands on anything with electrolytes & sodium in it. Gatorade is good, Body armor is AMAZING. 
- Set an alarm on your phone for every two hours. Label it “HYDRATE.” Whenever this alarm goes off, drink as much water as you can stand (within reason, don’t overdo it)
- Coconut water & Aloe Vera water are super good for you. 

NUTRITION:

- Set an alarm on your phone to remind yourself to eat SOMETHIN MAN. It’s super fucking weird when people don’t eat. Even worse, it makes YOU super fucking weird after awhile. 
- Try to eat more red meats.. beans.. or certain cereals even. Us users tend to be a bit low on iron/Anemic 
- Try to eat one fruit or vegetable a day. ❗️Don’t ignore this one, yes I’m talking to you, lay off the fucking sweets and eat a fucking carrot. It’s not that hard, you little bitch. Take care of yourself. 
- Try to shoot for calories and proteins. Carbs/starchy foods are great, too. Peanut butter, nuts, yogurt, cheese, boiled eggs, etc. These are all really cheap and easy ways to stay healthy.
- If you’re really having a hard time eating, use meal replacement shakes. I like Carnation Instant Breakfast.. NAKED +protein.. & Fair-life Core Power Protein Shakes. 

VITAMINS:

- Ibuprofen is your friend. Take advantage of her kindness to your sore muscles and stiff neck. 
- Ok, this one i cannot stress enough. If you are prescribed medications for your mental health, you still need to take your fucking meds. If you are worried it will affect your high, just look up “(Name of medication) and Methamphetamine” Google will tell you if there’s a legitimate concern or not. Just because you are self medicating, does not mean you have to ignore your mental illness. 
- I personally take an antipsychotic, and I recommend a lot of other people to do so as well. There’s a lot of controversy over this, because SOME antipsychotics interact with meth in a strange way, Or act as a blocker. But there are many antipsychotics that don’t, and all it takes is a therapeutic amount (2-5mg) to change your entire experience. If you find yourself constantly paranoid, or falling into delusions, you would benefit from an antipsychotic. If you have experienced psychosis, I am BEGGING you to do your own research and strongly consider a prescription. (Feel free to message me if you are interested in knowing more.) 
- Magnesium helps with cramps. (Damn Charlie Horse’s) 
- L-Tyrosine improves brain function. Also helps regulate mood, if you’re a cranky bitch like me. 
- Fish oil..Do I even need to explain this one? It’s good for everything. Just take the fish oil, trust me. 
- I recommend finding a Prenatal vitamin without Vitamin C in it. (Or men’s daily vitamin)
- Vitamin C: great for comedowns, not great for highs. Use accordingly.  

SELF-CARE:

- Take showers daily U smelly little ball of meff. 
- Remember, society assumes drug-users dress poorly, Use this to your advantage. If you don’t want to worry about others catching onto your high, just do the pure minimum. Throw on a lil makeup, comb your hair, brush your teeth, and put a nice formal shirt on every day. You will feel better about yourself AND be less paranoid! 
Lol, People wonder why they’re so paranoid...well? Do you look like you just came from Trappy Crackpipe Land? Fix it. 
- Carry an emergency essential bag around with you, keep it in your car or something. Pack things like; deodorant, (meff makes you stinky) facial wipes (your pores are fullll of meff too) perfume/cologne, tooth brush, mouthwash, extra underwear, vitamin pack... Etc.Etc.
- Eye drops constrict your pupils more than you realize. Every. Morning. Make sure your eyes look hydrated, and like you haven’t been up for 3 day’s straight. 
- BRUSH YOUR TEETH. TWICE A DAY. Use a soft bristled brush, with sensitive-teeth toothpaste. These are more gentle on your enamel. 
- Can’t get to a toothbrush because it’s 4am and you’re at the trap? We’ve all been there! Rinse your mouth with warm salt water. It gets rid of bacteria, and helps fight dry mouth. Win, win.
- Moisturize that flaky-ass skin and face of yours!! It’s begging for hydration! Plus, Facial moisturizing clean skin helps fight acne more than you think. 
- Chapstick helps when your cracked ass is hyper-focused and you don’t realize you’ve been licking your lips for the past 5 hours. Carry it everywhere. 


Last but not least.. 
The one and only piece of life advise I PREACH;

- Find one thing in your life that keeps you sane, and helps you feel normal. This one thing is going to keep you from diving off the deep end into addiction. 
- When we try to maintain relationships, jobs, family, hobbies, kids..all at once, we end up failing in one category and completely giving up everywhere. 
- So really think, what’s the MOST important normal thing you should always take care of at all costs? What’s the one thing you never want to sacrifice for this drug? 
- Mine personally, is my work life and future career goals. If I ever don’t have a job because I’d rather be a bum that’s using constantly? I officially can recognize I have gotten in too deep. And I cannot maintain this lifestyle any longer. (Not everybody Can. And that’s okay.) Make a promise to yourself, right now. If you reach this point, you WILL reach out and ask for help. 
- P.S. This doesn’t mean you have an excuse to give up on every single other category, either. This means that you don’t have to beat yourself up for cancelling on your friend one time. Why? Because you’re a functioning adult that has a busy fucking job. (Or whatever your life priority is) 


Meff is love. Meff is life.
Boof dat shit baybay, dont IV.I know its a long shot but if everybody who reads this could just upvote it so he may see. This guy who saw me on here was a lot of help and  had recovered from a similar situation and he was a real good dude to get advice from.  We lived in the same state and you recommended me a rehab, your wife had a lot of trouble handling it just like mine was. When I deleted my account I didn't realise right away itd delete touch with you and if you see this please message me. Everyone else please upvote this so it can stay ip for a day or 2 and maybe he'll see. Your username with a U i believe and you once worked in san fran and now are in ma to narrow things down even more.i know this isn't gonna be a popular post but it needs to be said.

ive been involved in or witnessed several instances where fellow sub members post cloud videos for us to enjoy, and creepy sick fucks like to make threats after having video proof of them and their illegal actions. 

i recently had a friend i met on this sub have this happen to him, and it wasn't pretty. now you're obviously to post whatever you please, and the general community will be supportive 99% of the time.

but please be aware that the 1% who isn't, are degen shit stains who don't give a rats ass about you. don't give them the possible leverage.

please continue to post your videos and have a "blast" ;), but (possibly) consider wearing a mask, a hat, some sunglasses, etc!

this is no way meant to antagonize or upset anyone, but this community needs to realize we need to help avoid this like this for the future of this sub. i doubt got a great name around the reddit universe 💀I have something to say and don’t worry it’s not negative don’t worry I just wanted to say I hate how people who use other drugs always shit on you guys like just let people get high how they wanna get high but fr have a fun trip and stay safeIn the end, you gave me nothing but shit. Suffering, collapsed veins, od's, lost everything and fucking lied to everybody and myself.

So yeah, i've been clean and sober for 3 months now, my parents tought i would never see my 23rd bday wich is tomorrow. And here i am, clean, sober and free from fucking drugs. Im so thankful for every day! I sincerely hope you people will get to the point where you wanna be in life! It's gonna be my first sober bday in 8 years, wish all of you the best and please.. BE CAREFUL AND TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER!!!! My prayers go aout to all of yall! 🙏🏽😊❤️Hey guys. About a year and a half ago I was on this subreddit high out of my mind on twack, well first it was meth... Then I started doing heroin and where I'm from pure fentanyl is considered heroin. Then I was homless and even sold my own phone for a bag. I was homless living at shelter an my only goal in life was to find atleast 10 bucks everyday so I could feel normal and function. Now I've been clean for a year and I feel great. I'm a manager at a tacobell and even tho I fucking hate working it's a hella lot better then getting high.Boofed a ten sack and two hours later had the worst fucking headache. Started to get out of my car and I realized I could not move my left leg. After some disbelief and a few falls, I called an ambulance. I’m  in the emergency room with a bleed on my brain and my left arm is progressively disobeying me. BP was 240/160 btw. Neurosurgery is about to lifeflight me to a different hospital. I am completely fucking ,,, I don’t know. Fuck man. I’m scared.Fuck you torch you piece of shit. Trying to smoke discreetly in here so my roommate don't know I'm getting spun. You already are loud as fuck. Shit how loud do you need to click just to make a spark? Just take her down a notch bud. You're practically shouting from the rooftops you fuck. We don't need the neighbours knowing we're getting methed up in this bitch. 

Worse still is when I click you and you don't even spark. There's only so many times I can cough over your loud ass before a mother fucker is going to make me get a covid test. I don't need your shit torch, do your fuckin job like fuck. I've seen fantastic four movies with better torches. I've seen Michigans with better flints. Figure your fuckin life outAs some of you may have noticed, yesterday someone posted from rxbandit's account claiming that bandit had been arrested and was in jail and that he needed $500 so he could make bail. He provided no confirmation or verification that this had happened, and he did not contact any of the other moderators to make us aware of the situation. Then sometime today, he made another post with a screenshot of some arrest report with the picture cut off, and the name blurred out but the case number was still visible. Upon further investigation, the case charges found on the actual case number   did not match the charges in the screenshot, and the date from the actual case number on the police departments website did not line up with the one in the screenshot either. 

Once made aware of the situation, I commented on the original post stating that the information given was unverified and that his posts were not approved by any of the other mods in any form, and then I locked the thread. Within ten minutes of this, bandit had deleted his reddit account entirely.  It is also worth pointing out that Bandit recently was complaining to me about losing about $500 from the Empire exit scam. 

To summarize: Bandit recently lost $500 from the Empire exit scam, and yesterday bandit made a post asking for the community to send him $500 because he had supposedly been arrested and needed the money to make bail. When several members of the community called him out on the fact it seemed like he was trying to scam the community, he deleted his reddit account entirely. All of this was done without him ever contacting any of the other subreddit moderators. 

**I would like to genuinely apologize to the community, particularly anyone who may have sent him money. Let us all take this as a lesson to be wary of people asking for money over the internet.**It really is. I've been looking for the answers to all of my problems, and it is: methamphetamines. It reaps benefits and it's really a fuckig God send. The more u take it, the more it reaps it benefits. It's a God send. I recommend everyone in the world gets on meth right now What could go wrong if we all do this right at this moment?He told me that I have great customer service but today it was shining through and he wanted to say something to me, and it’s great to see me in such an awesome mood and he hopes it sticks around for me. He fist bumped me. 

There goes the rest of my life, lol.I made me hyper horny for 6 hours, but I was stuck on page 432 on porn hub searching for that perfect porn video, but I never found it.

😤

Then I had to leave for work and wasn't able to start masturbating 😢This is a friendly reminder to unclench your jaw, relax your shoulders, eat something, drink some water, and brush your teeth. In that order! It’s crazy how this substance can make it so easy to forget or not care about those basic life needs. This concludes your friendly reminder. Have a nice day and be safe out there!

Edit: I forgot 2 extremely vital tasks! Take a shower and get some sleep too!For prior covid users UPVOTE if meth increased and down vote if you decreased. Leave a comment with how you do meth . I.e slam , smoke , bolt, snort , booty bump, hot rail .I wrote this in a comment on a post tonight, but now feel like I will post this to signal boost it in case it’s helpful for any of you. Essentially, I said....

Remember that building a life that is fulfilling, a life worth living, comes not from filling yourself with feeling good all the time from drugs, but from living through and managing painful experiences. Without pain, without low points, without perspective, the highs will not even have meaning, anyway. You cannot have a hill without a valley. So if you are trying to get clean, remember that the pain and hard parts are what will *create* the fulfilling and rewarding and satisfying sense of accomplishment, mastery, and self worth for us humans. Try to remember that in a time of need, it may help.It’s awful how bad I wanna talk to someone and be around people but I live with my aunt and cousin and they know I’m fucking up again lately so it’s not like I can go talk to them. I really don’t like hanging out with like hardcore meth addicts because I always end up in sketchy situations with sketchy people and I got 10 years of that behind me and I am done with it. I can’t hang out with my normal friends who don’t use hard drugs because.... I’m on hard drugs! Haha i really am beyond grateful for these forums. I saw someone post about how awful this and r/stims are and that we promote amphetamine use and all this negative shit. These forums have literally saved my life. I don’t know most of you from a hole in the ground but I find a way to connect on here when I need it most. I know 80% of you are probably locked In your bedroom atleast 2-3 days a weeks craving some sort of affection from humans. We all know meth is not always a good thing and it’s extremely hard to walk away from but what makes it harder is when you hide away from everyone and everything and lose contact with the world. If you think these forums are bad, well I think you should smoke some meth and browse them and get off your high horse. Cheers mates to another long night 🥂 We will all get where we are going eventually.Fuck this drug. Fuck IVing and fuck IVing meth. 
Im done with the fucking psychotic episodes. 
Im done with the paranoia. 
Im done with the intense impending doom feelings and I'm fucking done with the anxiety and isolation. 
Im going to fucking end up dead. 
Fuck this shit guys. Im out.It shouldn’t annoy me as much as it does but when people come on here just to shit on people using meth it makes me so mad. Especially since you can tell these people have no lived experience with drugs or addiction - they’re sheltered and have a very narrow view on drugs. Addiction doesn’t discriminate. And that young pretty girl you’re judging for using? You have no idea what she’s been through. The father that uses to keep going and support his family. Every single one of us knows a person who uses drugs and we have no idea about it. Maybe even someone you love. 

Stop with the hate comments - you clearly haven’t suffered thru addiction. You think addicts are weak but we’re the strongest people you’ll ever meet. 

Search up softwhiteunderbelly on YouTube for interviews of addicts, prostitutes, etc… maybe then you’ll think twice about talking down to an addict. 

Thx for coming to my Ted talk xoDo you remember when you were a little kid, and you tried to ride a bike for the first time? Before you knew how to follow all the rules of the physical universe, you sucked at bike riding and probably fell on your ass a lot. Eventually you learned how to work in tandem with gravity in order to balance and stay upright. 



The same thing can be said of smoking meth. Methamphetamine is a fragile chemical compound that's impacted by numerous factors in the physical environment. Until we learn how to play by the rules of the physical world when it comes to meth, chances are, we're going to make some mistakes. Mistakes = wasted product, less of a high, and a less pleasurable experience overall. 



The good news is that we humans have been gifted a rule book of the natural world around us, which we can use to smoke more effectively in a safe and enjoyable way. That rule book is called science, and with a little research and brainpower you can be sure to maximize your stim experience. I've been wanting to make a detailed guide on a couple of difference subjects for a while now, so I've decided to combine them all into a master post here. A fair amount of research went into this guide, and all of my sources are cited if you wish to continue down the rabbit hole and learn more about anything discussed below. So without further ado...



*You Got Some Meth, Now What? A Guide to Determining Quality, Cuts, Creating the Perfect Crackback, and Getting the Biggest Hits*



# Section 1: Determining Quality and Cuts

 

In this section, we will discuss how to determine the quality of your product and talk briefly about various cuts and how they affect the overall compound.

Meth has a recrystallization point of between 170 and 175 degrees Celsius. If the meth is cut with iso, MSM, or other impurities, the recrystallization point is lowered. That means that if your shit is cut (ESPECIALLY if it's ISO), it will spend more time as a liquid and recrystallize slower than pure methamphetamine.

One Reddit user u/HeisenbergSpecial described how to do a heat test of your shit to determine quality:

Get a glass thermometer than can measure up to at least 200˚C, a test tube, and a vial or a small beaker or something, that you can put the test tube in without it falling over. Put as much of the alleged drugs in the test tube as you can. Don't worry, it's a nondestructive test. Put mineral oil or cooking oil or some other clear liquid with a high boiling point in the beaker, then put the test tube in that and heat it on a stove burner or a flame or something. Eventually, the stuff in the tube will melt, and when it does, insert the thermometer. Wait for it to all melt, then turn off the heat and start monitoring the temperature. As soon as it starts to form crystals, make a note of the temperature. Pure methamphetamine should begin crystallization between 170˚C and 175˚C, and with cut methamphetamine this would happen at a lower temperature. If it's pure, this temperature should not change much at all during solidification. If it's highly-cut, then this number will be about ten degrees lower by the time it's fully solid. 

When it does recrystallize, if it's methamphetamine, the crackback pattern will be a bunch of disjointed, jaggedy lines or a sheet of white, instead of clear fractals like you have with methamphetamine.

Also take notice of the taste and odor, of course. Pure meth has a very specific flavor that seasoned users will come to know and be able to discern. MSM has its own flavor, as does ISO. If it ever tastes *bad* , acidic, like plastic, etc...you can probably assume it's cut (unless you're just burning your product). Meth vapor should also have little to no odor associated with it. If there's a lingering stank left behind everytime you smoke, you can assume it's cut (unless, again, you're burning your shit consistently).

Another way to test for cut is by an evaporation test. Dissolve as much as possible in a small amount of distilled water, then put a few drops on a smooth flat surface, like a mirror or a plate. N-iso takes forever to evaporate, and when it does, there will be a geometric-looking crystal left behind, that's wet in the middle when you crush it. Methamphetamine will leave behind white crusty stuff that only consists of small crystals, and will evaporate considerably faster. Even if it's cut with something besides ISO, you'll know it's meth if it leaves behind white, crusty, small crystals.

Part of the reason ISO is such a popular cut is because a) it's very hard to remove once it's introduced to the compound b) it mimics the effects of meth in a very close way, but most importantly, c) ISO creates large, clear, impressive looking crystals.

It's *difficult* to get large, dramatic crystals from pure methamphetamine. People who judge purity based solely on crystal clarity and size are the reason ISO is so prevalent these days, especially with dark net vendors. If a vendor is advertising the color and size of their crystals, it's most likely cut with something.

Crystal hardness is also a determining factor. Meth is a very, very hard compound that is difficult to physically seperate. It takes a bit of effort to break apart a meth crystal, it's more like a small pebble of sedimentary rock. If meth is like sedimentary rock, I would compare ISO to limestone. It flakes off very easily in little sheets, as if the crystal was peeling. It takes almost no effort to crumble a crystal that has been cut, since the cutting reagants weaken the chemical bonds in the substance.



**Tl;dr: You can determine if your shit is cut a variety of different ways.**

1. **Discern how long it takes for the substance to recrystallize when heated**
2. **Boiling point test**
3. **Evaporation test**
4. **Looking at crackback pattern**
5. **Noticing odor and taste of vapor**
6. **Observing crystal size, clarity, and hardness.**



**Isopropropylbenzylamine - what is it?** 



Isopropoylbenzylamine (commonly referred to as iso or n-iso in stim communities) is a common diluting agent found in street methamphetamine. Diluting agents can also be called "cut". Iso and meth have similar boiling points (only about 10 degrees Celsius in difference) and the same molar mass, which causes their hydrochloride salts to behave in a similar way. This means that iso can be added to meth (or even sold as pure methamphetamine) without the consumer being aware of its presence. Iso has not been shown to have any stimulant effects of its own, but anecdotal evidence has shown an increase of side effects related to "tweaking" on meth, including headache, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, muscle spasms, and cognitive distortion/confusion. 

"For anyone unfamiliar, Mexican cartels have been heavily cutting the meth they make before smuggling it into the US. This has been happening since about February 2017. Not only are the crystals of this shit super huge and super clear, but people have to buy a lot more to get the same effect! The effects are usually mild, but since there's not much methamphetamine at all in most of this bullshit that's being sold, those effects can add up." 

Observing your crackback is one way to determine if you have iso on your hands. Once it recrystallizes, the crackback look like a white sheet with jagged lines cut into it, whereas pure meth looks more like transparent, clear fractals. Compare these two images, the first is an n-iso crackback, and the second is methamphetamine crackback: 

 [https://i.imgur.com/f6Uv90j.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f6Uv90j.jpg)  \- this is an n-iso crackback. Note how the pattern isn't a fractal with straight lines. Instead, the lines are jagged and the composition is random. 

 [https://imgur.com/zeHb1jZ.jpg](https://imgur.com/zeHb1jZ.jpg) \- this is a meth crackback. It reminds me of shattered glass, or at least that's the best thing I can compare it to for the sake of description. Notice the clear color, the fractal pattern that originates from a common point, and how it disperses over the glass like a coating. 

Another, more scientifcally sound, way to determine if you're smoking meth cut with n-iso is by doing an evaporation test. Iso takes wayyyy longer than meth to evaporate. We explained how to do a proper evaporation test in the section above. Based on how long it takes for the water to evaporate, you'll know what your chemical compound is. N-iso should take hours, if not overnight, to evaporate completely. To reiterate, "when it does \[evaporate\], there will be a geometric-looking crystal left behind, that's wet in the middle when you crush it. Methamphetamine will leave behind white crusty stuff that only consists of small crystals, and will evaporate considerably faster."



**What is MSM?**

 Methylsulfonylmethane, commonly called MSM, is a white crystalline solid at room temperature that is regularly used as a cutting agent in the manufacture of methamphetamine.  NMR studies, which are similar to MRI's,  have demonstrated that oral doses of MSM are absorbed into the blood and cross the blood brain barrier. An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources. 

This means that our bodies already contain trace amounts of MSM due to the foods we eat, but if you ingest more, it has the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect your brain activity. Published clinical trials of MSM did not report any serious side effects, but there are no peer-reviewed data on the effects of its long-term use in humans. In July of 2008, the FDA designated MSM with GRAS status, meaning it is in the category of Generally Regarded as Safe.  The designation allows MSM to be added to meal supplement and meal replacement foods, fruit smoothie-type drinks, fruit-flavored thirst quencher-type beverages, and food bars such as granola bars and energy-type bars. 

As a cutting agent for methamphetamine, MSM offers many advantages. Pure MSM is an odorless, white, crystalline powder that is highly soluble and mixes readily with most substances without leaving a residue. MSM usually is added to methamphetamine during the final stages of production. Methamphetamine cut with MSM often appears to be uncut because after the chemicals are combined and the mixture cools, the MSM recrystallizes, resembling pure methamphetamine.

MSM is readily available in powder and tablet forms at livestock feed and equine tack stores, "super" pet food chains, warehouse stores, human nutrition centers, and upscale grocery stores. MSM is available through mail order equine and veterinary supply catalogs and on numerous Internet sites.

You can determine if your meth is cut with MSM based on the crackback and taste of the vapor. The crackback should  look more geometric in its pattern. MSM crackbacks make a series of little squares stacked one on top of the other, instead of an off-shooting fractal pattern like methamphetamine. These are two good examples:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/9qbbdj/the\_secret\_to\_crack\_back\_pattern\_w\_txt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/9qbbdj/the_secret_to_crack_back_pattern_w_txt/) 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/904xps/anyone\_see\_crackback\_like\_this\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/904xps/anyone_see_crackback_like_this_before/) 

In the second image, notice how the picture ont he right shows the geometric squares that makeup the crackback. 



**Separating Meth from MSM:** 

To determine if what you have is cut with MSM, consider doing an acetone wash. MSM is acetone-soluble, while methamphetamine is not. This means that the MSM will dissolve into the acetone, while the meth will sink to the bottom of the acetone container. The acetone will eventually evaporate, leaving behind some yummy, yummy meth.

Acetone washes are really simple. First you would crush your meth into smaller crystals. You wouldn't need to grind it into a powder, but smaller particle size is better. This is because the acetone wash only removes the MSM on the surface of the crystals.

Put all of it into a glass jar or container with an air tight lid. Plastic of any kind will dissolve in the acetone and end up contaminating the meth. Ground glass fittings on a boiling flask work best. Add acetone to the meth until the liquid is just above the meth. Seal the container and give it a good shake and then swirl it around for a minute or two.

The MSM will dissolve into the acetone while the meth will remain in the bottom of the jar. Let the jar settle for a couple minutes and then carefully pour the liquid into another jar leaving the solids in the original jar.

Leave the solids in a well ventilated area without a lid until all of the residual acetone evaporates off. You will know it has evaporated off by smelling it. If it still smells like acetone it hasn't evaporated off completely.

Do not add heat or flames of any kind to speed up the evaporation. It will ignite easily. Be patient and wait until it's evaporated. Then, pour the acetone through a coffee filter or screen. What you have left behind is meth. You may want to do a few acetone washes to remove all of the impurities, since the acetone wash only removes MSM from the surface area of the crystal. 



**Other Types of Cut:** 

A VICE news article tells the story of "Mark", a 37 year old meth dealer from Australia who cut his product with regular epsom salts if he was ever in a financial bind. 

Recent overdoses have also been caused by meth laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opiate that is 90-100 times stronger than morphine. The CATO Institute reports that in the United States, "There were [1887](https://www.drugwarfacts.org/node/3960) meth-related deaths reported in 2011. By 2017 more than 10,000 deaths were [reported](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) related to meth and other chemically-similar psychostimulants. The Drug Enforcement Administration has seen a 118 percent increase in meth seizures by law enforcement between 2010 and 2017." 

A big reason for these meth seizures are because of meth laced with fentanyl. The short-term euphoric effects of fentanyl may be a reason why it is added to methamphetamine, due to the fact that it increases the initial euphoric rush.

Caffeine is another common additive to crystal meth, which decreases purity of the product. The U.S National Library of Medicine did a study with lab mice where they measured the effects of caffeine and methamphetamine. Meth is often cut with caffeine powder, due to its similarity to crystal meth and its effect on the body. The study found that caffeine enhanced the effects of meth on the body, leading to even more energy, increased focus, and euphoria. This is a common reason why manufacturers choose to add caffeine to their meth. 





# Section 2: Creating the Perfect Crackback: 



So now you have gained the tools to effectively evaluate your supply and determine whether or not what you're about to smoke is pure methamphetamine. You have also learned a couple of different methods for cleaning any impurities out of the product before you ingest it. Now that you have some clean, uncut meth on your hands, it's time to smooooke!

For me, figuring out how to properly crackback by meth changed the smoking game for me. It was so much more enjoyable to smoke when my meth wasn't burnt and had been properly melted down. Unfortuantely, crackbacks are something that just takes practice. I can try and give you as much information as possible, but it will be through a process of trial and error that you figure out exactly what works for you. 



**Why Are Crackbacks Important?**



Acetone washes do a good job of removing cuts from your methamphetamine, such as n-iso or MSM. That being said, acetone washes ONLY clean whatever surface area of the crystals it touches, and not the entire substance. This means that impurities may still remain even after washing. Also, there are impurities in the meth besides cutting agents. These are ingredients that are necessary to the synthesis process, but are not removed by the time the product reaches its final stages. In a perfect world, all of the impurities would be removed during the synthesis process and what you were sold was pure methamphetamine. Lazy or unknowledgeable cooks, cutting corners to save money or materials, or contaminated labs could all result in an impure product. 



Crystal meth is synthesized with acetone, ammonia, ephedrine, hydrochloric acid, lithium, red phosphorous, toluene, lye, and sulfuric acid. First, either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is sourced illegally or extracted from cold and diet medicines. A chemical reaction is created by adding either anhydrous ammonia and lithium, or red phosphorous, iodine crystals, and water. Either method will create meth. A solvent is added to extract the meth from the waste. Bubbling acidic gas through the meth forms it into crystals. 



The additives that are necessary for the synthesis process have a lower boiling point than the methamphetamine. This means that when you do a crackback, the additives vaporize before the meth does and are subsequently released into the atmosphere instead of being absorbed by your lungs. 



Crackbacks are also useful because you are physically changing the composition of the meth through a combustion reaction. In other words, you're adding heat which causes the crystals to take on a different form. After your crackback, the crystals are no longer separate pieces, but one uniform run that clings to the side of the glass and is easily reheated and vaporized for the purpose of smoking. 



**Tl;dr: Crackbacks help vaporize any leftover impurities with a lower boiling point than meth and gets your shit into a state where it can be smoked effectively.** 



**Materials:** 

Bic Lighter (don't use a torch to heat when you're first starting off. The flame is harder to handle and the heat is more intense, meaning that when you're learning, you're more likely to burn your product. Yes, in my opinion, using a torch heats the product more evenly and produces bigger clouds, but let's start simple and work our way up.)

Long-stemmed oil burner

Plastic straw

Scissors

Gram scale



**A Note on the Importance of Gram Scales:** 

On this sub over the months, I've seen a lot of people doubting whether or not it's worth it to invest in a gram scale. To those people, I say a hearty YES YES YES!! I recommend the My Weigh Triton T3 Gram Scale. If you live in a place that has smoke shops (for tobacco or cannabis), I've seen them sold there for around 10$ USD. Amazon sells this exact scale for $20  USD. For 10-20$ you could have the additional security of always knowing the exact amounts of what you're buying and exactly how much you're using. 



The Triton T3 is a respected instrument that I've heard multiple professionals in the cannabis industry stand behind. The only issue is that occasionally they need to be re calibrated, which is an easy and painless process.



In terms of harm reduction, scales can help a lot with appropriate and responsible dosing. Before I got my scale, I had to eyeball and guess how much meth I was smoking per bowl/per day/per week/etc. These days I can weigh and measure EXACTLY what's going on down to the .001



If your dealer is an asshole and decides to short you by a couple points, you'll know. You'll also get an idea of how much you're really smoking. I personally go through about .35 g per day, and I'm able to track my tolerance easier because I notice when that dosage is going up in order to recreate the same effects.



**Tl;dr: GET A GRAM SCALE, IT'S WORTH IT, YOU CHEAPY CHEAPSKATE.** 



**Directions for the Perfect Crackback:**



\- Begin by using the scissors and plastic straw to make a plastic scoop. You're going to cut the straw hot-dog style (horizontally along the straw) part of the way down, carving the top half of the straw off to expose the concave interior. When you're done, it should look like this:  [https://www.amazon.com/J680-Plastic-Spoon-Straws-100ct/dp/B00AN6UIQ2](https://www.amazon.com/J680-Plastic-Spoon-Straws-100ct/dp/B00AN6UIQ2) 



\- Using your gram scale, weigh out no more than .05 g to be used in your bowl. Most people typically like packiing bowls that are between .1 g - .3 g. Personally, I think .3 is wayyy too big for a single bowl. While you're practicing crackbacks, keep the bowls small (again, at about .05g). The less product you have, the less heating it takes to melt down completely, which means the less likely it is that you'll accidentally burn your product. The other advantage to packing smaller bowls is that if you DO happen to burn something, you're wasting less in the end. 



\- Use your straw scoop to load the meth into your oil burner through the hole at the top of the pipe. If you load your product through the stem, you run the risk of stray crystals being left behind and sticking to the exterior of the pipe. The first time you go to hit the pipe, those crystals will get on your lips/tongue and taste absolutely vile. Speaking from experience, please be smarter than me and spare yourself that pain.



\-Now you have a pile of crystals sitting at the bottom of your pipe. Raise the pipe above your head, so that you're looking up through the bottom of the bubble. You should be able to clearly see the crystals. It also helps if you're holding the pipe up to a light source, so you can clearly see what you're doing. 



\-While still looking up through the bottom of the pipe, light your Bic and hold it so that the top of the lighter flame is about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about .5 to 1 cm) below the bottom of the pipe. Your flame should never be touching the glass. I've seen some people use that technique and not only does it cover your glass with black soot, it highly increases the chances of you burning your product. 



\-While still looking up through the bottom of the pipe, start moving the lighter in a small circle, so that the flame is circling the perimeter of your crystal pile. Keep circling the lighter as the crystals begin to melt. They will likely sizzle and pop/crackle a bit (hence the term CRACKback) before melting down to a liquid. 



\-When the crystals first start to pop, start twirling your pipe. You want to twirl in small, controlled movements. If you get too liberal with your spinning, you'll end up with a huge spread that's hard to smoke, and you run the risk of your product rolling out the hole at the top of your pipe. It sounds ridiculous, but I've seen it be done. Think about your pipe as a clock, with the hole at the top pointing towards 12. When you spin the bowl, spin it so that the top hole goes from 10:30 to 1:30. When you get better at the process and more confident you won't burn your shit, you can twirl from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock for an even more uniform puddle. 



\-As soon as the crystals have melted down completely to a liquid, remove the heat source immediately. If you keep the lighter on it, you'll burn your shit. The liquid should be completely clear and transparent like H20, but the texture is thicker, more viscous, and just slightly more syrupy than water. While water drips, meth \*rolls\* , if that makes any sense. You should be able to watch your liquid puddle roll from one side o the pipe to the other with relative ease. If you see any tinge of yellow or brown in the puddle, it means you left the heat source on for too long and the bowl is now burnt. 



\-Once the heat source has been removed, bring the stem of the pipe to your lips and exhale through the pipe. The liquid meth is at a temperature of 338 degrees F or 170 degrees C. Your breath is at 98 degrees F or 37 degrees C. Because your breath is so much cooler than the liquid meth, exhaling over the liquid puddle helps speed up the re-crystallization process. Continue to spin the bowl from 10:30 - 1:30 and exhale gently, until you see the liquid recrystallize. 



\-You should be left with a U-shape along the bottom of the pipe of transparently clear meth that has an obvious fractal pattern, assuming that your supply isn't cut with anything or has already been washed.



\-Looking up through the bottom of the bowl once more, start spinning the bowl from 10:30 to 1:30 again, while circling the crackback with your lighter the same way you did before. You should be able to see the crystals melt down into a puddle once more. 



\-Repeat the previous steps, spinning and exhaling the way you did previously until the liquid recrystallizes into a crackback. You're basically repeating the entire process over again. I always like to do this process 2-3 times to make sure that my product has been cracked back fully before I take my first inhale. You may lose some of the meth to the atmosphere, but it's worth it to be smoking cleaner stuff. 



\-By the end of round 2 or 3, you should have a U-shape run along the bottom of your bowl that climbs partially up the side walls. The meth should be transparent, not stained brown or yellow in any way, which is an indication that you've burned your bowl. A clear fractal pattern should also be obvious, which tells you that your stuff is free from cutting agents such as MSM or n-iso. 



Congratulations, you've successfully completed your crackback! 





# How to Get the Biggest Clouds Possible and Actually Smoking Your Shit:



We've determined purity, completed evaporation tests and acetone washes, gathered our materials, cracked back our supply...at long last, it's finally time to take that first, sweet hit of Tina. 



Do you struggle with burning your shit while smoking, never being able to get big ripper clouds, or experiencing a bad taste when you smoke? These could all be due to the fact that you just don't have the technique down yet. Meth is a fragile compound and smoking it is a fickle activity, you have to have some amount of awareness and put in some practice before you really get proficient at it. I'm defining "proficiency" as someone who can hit the pipe every time and blow consistently big clouds while avoiding any burning or color changing. 



**Instructions:** 



**-** Looking up through the bottom of the bowl, start spinning the bowl from 10:30 to 1:30 again, while circling the crackback with your lighter the same way you did before. You should be able to see the crystals melt down into a puddle. 



\- Bring the bowl to eye level, and keep spinning the bowl from 10:30 - 1:30 with the lighter flame STILL ON the product. Spinning the bowl will keep you from burning the meth, even though the heat source is still on it. 



\- Once the liquid meth raises in temperature by about 15 degrees, the liquid will begin to vaporize and you will see a trail of vapor rising towards the top of the pipe. It's tempting to start hitting the pipe as soon as you see vapor, but for the biggest clouds, you want to keep spinning the bowl from 10:30 - 1:30 and \*wait\* until the vapor has completely filled the chamber of the oil burner. That is to say, the bowl of your pipe should be filled with a semi-thick foggy vapor before you begin inhaling. This is one of those parts that just takes practice and a painstaking trial and error process to really get down. You'll eventually learn just when to start inhaling at the perfect moment. Inhale too soon and your meth cools quickly, leading to smaller cloud. Wait too long, and you'll burn your bowl. Because the melting point of meth is a good 15 degrees lower than the vaporization (boiling) point, it means that you are afforded some time in terms of how long you can wait for the vapor to fill the chamber without being in danger of burning your bowl. 



\- Once the vapor has filled the chamber, bring the stem to your lips and start ***slowly*** inhaling. One of my old dealers used to tell me to act like the stem of the pipe was a straw that you're sipping water through. That's how gentle your inhale should be. If you try and take a big ass bong rip or inhale with your lungs instead of pulling with your mouth, the meth will cool down too quickly which results in a smaller cloud. The more gentle you can be on your inhale, the bigger the cloud.



\-While you're "sipping" off the stem of your pipe, continue to rock the bowl slowly and deliberately over the top of the lighter flame, remembering to keep the top of the flame about 1/4" away from the bottom of the pipe. This keeps the heat consistent so you have more vapor to inhale. 



\-When you're running out of air on your inhale, it's easy to accidentally start sucking harder. This creates more air flow which results in a smaller cloud. Even if you feel like you're running out air, focus on not panicking and continue to pull on the pipe with a low-flow, small sip instead of a giant, sucking inhale. 



\-Don't stop spinning your bowl, ever. This is what keeps your supply from burning as you heat it for inhalation. 



\-Think of your inhaling as if you were pulling on a cigar or a cigarette, using the muscles in your cheeks to pull the vapor into your mouth, instead of using your lungs to pull the vapor into your esophagus like you would with marijuana.  



\-Once you've inhaled as much as possible into your mouth, breathe it into your lungs and hold for a moment. When you exhale, you should be exhaling a monstrous cloud that gets you positively gacked as fuck. If you've followed these directions correctly, the vapor should be odorless and tasteless. The meth should still be clear or a foggy white when it recrystallizes on the pipe. If you packed .05 g into your bowl, you should be able to practice taking a few good hits before it's time to reload the bowl. 



**Pro Tip: I always clean out my pipe after every bowl. There is usually a stain left behind that I feel affects the taste of the next bowl. To avoid cross-contamination between used and unused product, I either torch the bowl clean or rinse it out with water and scrub the inside of the glass  with a Q-Tip after every  bowl.** 





\- Okay, big sigh, and with all of THAT, it is here that I sign off and leave you to your own devices. This shit took me almost four hours to put together, so hopefully someone can benefit at least a little from it. I guess these are the things I wish someone had really explained to me when I was first starting out; it would have saved me a lot of time, money, product, and bad experiences.

You will be absolutely astounded by, not only how much better you feel, but how many of your present problems can be solved with a bit of good rest. 


So put the pipe down. Put the phone down. Close your eyes. And sleep. 





.



And drink some fuckin’ water while you’re at it too, you dehydrated fuck. Ffs._________________________________________ 

I walk a lonely road, a road scattered with illusions, misfires, indulgence, secrecy and shame. 
I've started doing it again, and even though I hide it and try not to go over the line. I'm still testing myself. I notice my memory becoming more and more like a pair of headphones in your pocket; crisscrossed and unbelievably tangled.
I notice myself getting pale, I notice myself getting skinny, I notice myself withering away. 

My crutch, my superfood, my kryptonite, no matter the stress, no matter the situation it makes things okay. 

It opens my eyes to potential, but in reality I'm just using a telescope. Im far from potential, but all I can see and feel is potential. 

I dont want to continue this forever, but I'm letting my guard down, letting it dig its sweet shiny crystalline hooks straight into my heart and mind. 

I use what seems like everyday now. Throughout the day, from when I go to work, till when I go out to my car for my last 'smoke'. 

I take advantage of every second I'm in the clear. I wait anxiously for my next moment. I go about my day, my work, my relationships, with that next hit stirring up a storm in my mind and in my body. 

I avoid eye contact with the woman I love. I make up excuses for taking longer than necessary. 

I play a dangerous game of skimming off the top, blowing my money into the air. 

I don't have a plan to stop, but I damn well know I'll make a plan in the moment to continue. 

Should I have a plan? Should I surrender and work damage control? 
Damage control won't work forever, and everything can fall apart in a split second.
Will having a plan fix me? Will I stay committed to my plan? Do I have the ability to look through the clouds and fly towards the atmosphere? 

Saying no would be easy, it would be just like flicking the lighter, wincing at the burn you just gave yourself and watching the boiling nuclear bomb like a hawk swooping down to kill its next meal. 

It makes me take care of myself more than I ever have.
It makes me adapt and excell in situations I would freeze in.
It makes me think; hard.
It makes me plan, and act.
It makes me experience more day.
It kills my memory.
It makes me isolated.
It makes me hide
It makes me stack pleasures
It makes life bearable
It gives me a sick, self deprecating purpose.. who knew it felt so good to destroy yourself. 

It makes me conflicted.
I go through episodes of whatever this writing is, contemplating its place in my life.
I contemplate the pros, the cons, the risks and the rewards.
Half of me comes to the conclusion that I need to stop.
Half of me comes to the solution that the benefits outweigh the risks, because I work hard at damage control. 
Is that delusional? Yes. Is it manageable? Not quite. 

So what should I do lord, should I continue.. or should I stop. 

I've fallen into the hole once. It was a dark time in my life, and I was nowhere near mature enough to handle the limitless power and destruction. 

I slipped up once, I admitted my fuck up, although I did not tell the whole truth. Within a month, it was under the rug and the skies were blue again. 

I've engrained in my mind that telling the truth about it only works against me. But in the big picture it saves me. But- I don't care too see that. 

I've built a slight tolerance in the past month, I hide it from those close to me, I manage my money without suspicion, I practice extreme self care, I use excuses about what I did with my time. It goes right over their heads. 

I dont believe I can keep this up, as it will only grow to be more and more of a burden. 

But I want to keep it up, because life is just so motherfucking dull, and I have not found a purpose that fulfills me. 

No one was ever supposed to experience such a level of confidence, energy, desire and speed. Not even once they said.... for good reason. 

My biggest problem areas are sleep and being too spun to make eye contact or truly connect. 

Time is flying as fast as a rocket into soaring into space. 

Memories get scrambled and power lines touch.
Seconds get absorbed like minutes, minutes get absorbed like hours, and hours vanish into a sweet, thick, white fog of paranoia, nervous ticks and unprocessed thoughts. 

As much as it takes a toll on my mind, I cant help but feeling mentally and physically superior and quicker. 

I wish I could sleep, I wish I wasnt paranoid, I wish i wasnt getting skinny, I wish my thoughts and surroundings wouldn't blur. 

I wish I could sit on top of the world, smoking a cigarette, listening to good music and ever so slightly circling the bottom of the glass, tilting left; tilting right; and back again. 

I wish I could never stop living 1000 miles an hour; not worrying about a nearly empty gas tank and oil darker than the night sky holding me back. 

So, its 2am now. I work at 6. 
I'm going to try to fall asleep, and hopefully show up to life tomorrow like I had a Thanksgiving dinner and 8 hours sleep. 

I'm getting high tomorrow, fuck this. 

So that leaves me here... 

I surrender, just for one more day...... Or many tens, hundreds, or thousands of days. 

Hopefully I'll survive, Hopfully I dont fall in the hole or admit/reveal one of my darkest secrets. Goodnight world, and god speed.. with speed. Be safe ❤It’s gross I don’t know who you think you’re trying to impress here 😐Hi, I am Party McFly, and I am addicted to crystallized methamphetamine. Why did I become addicted to crystal meth? Because the pain of a lifetime of misery and woe asked for it? Well, yes. But, no. If not to numb myself out, then is it to feel anything at all? Sometimes, maybe. Depends on the day I guess. I dunno. Honestly it's mostly just because it feels pretty cool I guess. Like your brain just titty fucked God's tits or like your dick can shoot lasers. What I mean to say is it feels pretty fucking good. 

How did I become addicted to methamphetamine? The first time I tried it was about 4 years ago, when my friend, Jimmy, introduced it to me. The first thing you should know about Jimmy is he had a pretty bad brain injury when he was young. The second thing to know is he likes to piss people off. The friends who could or would tolerate him were few and far between. Honestly I think it was just me and one other guy. The 3rd thing to know is he a hopeless addict. He took me to meet the other guy once. Smithy happened to be a homeless man who slept behind a dumpster. He offered us crystal meth saying it was the best shit in the world. Accepting that whatever decisions had been made that resulted in hanging out behind a dumpster with fucking Jimmy and Smithy could not have come from a brain worth preserving, it was there I first tried crystal meth. I remember thinking "if this is crystal meth, then crystal meth really sucks." Smithy and Jimmy didn't seem to think so. Said they were high as fuck. By the way, if you're getting offered a hard drug you've never tried before by a homeless man who ain't got shit to his name but an enthusiasm for said hard drug and you say yes, you might actually be retarded. 

I didn't touch it for years afterwards. The 2nd time I tried it was last summer with my older brother. I remember he had just recently started it a few months back himself. How did I know he was smoking crystal meth? Partially because we had been working together all throughout Spring and he would routinely come in constantly sleep-deprived, and partially brain-dead. His words, not mine. Mostly because he told me he had been smoking crystal meth as of recent. Why? Because he's a fuckin' dumbass retard. My words, not his. At the time, anyways. 

He's always been straight edge, didn't even smoke weed or drink. He's gay though and evidently it is big in the gay community, and he likes to sleep around, so it didn't take long for someone to introduce him to meth. Within a month he was IVing. He told my whole family for some stupid fucking reason, they all had an intervention. I sat with the rest of my family (who have all but ostracized him now) as we each took turns trying to talk some sense into him. I had literally just smoked it with him the weekend before, by the way. I'm a piece of shit, I know. 

In my defense, I didn't really feel much of anything that time either. I got a decent buzz but I thought "if this is crystal meth, then crystal meth kind of sucks." He didn't seem to think so. Said he was high as fuck. After that I did genuinely believe that he was being a moron by using this drug. I'd seen how the guys like Smitty were. Though my idea of your average methhead was an amalgamation of the Smithy-types I had seen in the street, and the distorted image of the disparate tweakers who I'd seen through the embellished lense of tv and movies. The ones who's over-the-top characters mimicked the scab-ridden, sunken-cheeked mug shots that adorned the propaganda posters I'd seen on the internet. The ones with before and after pictures of people who had somehow become dirty, toothless lepers after first trying meth 6 months prior. 

I thought the crystal meth users I knew had fried their brains, which to be honest Smithy kind of had and Jimmy, now a long time user, hadn't been working with a full load in the first place. So, yes I did have a bit of an ignorant view on the effects of this drug, and yes I did tell my brother that he should stop. That he was dumb for doing this. Why wouldn't he just drop this overhyped drug and do the more glamorous drugs like me? They were less fucked up. Don't you want to be like me and battle whats looking like what is going to be a life-long coke addiction? I was already over 10 years and easily over $100,000 deep into it by then but at least it wasn't meth. Meth is for suckers, brother. Just do every other drug like me, so you won't need interventions. 

The third time I tried it was with this chick I used to bang while it was convenient for me. I broke my hand and wasn't working. She's a piece of shit who was defrauding all kinds of social assistance systems across Canada to collect money from them all and lived with her Mom who was a great cook. Well I was broke, hungry, and horny so we did that for a while. Then my hand healed and I went back to work and I decided I no longer needed the convenience, not from her specifically anyways, and we were better off as friends. I know, I'm an asshole. If its any consolation she's a fucking bitch to be honest, but don't worry; she got her revenge. 

We legitimately did become just friends after that. Though really we didn't hang out much, she'd just call me up when she needed a favor. One time it had been a few months since I'd last seen her and she called me up and asked me to stay at her place for a week or so. So I did. She told me about her usage and asked if I wanted to try some. I did. I remember thinking "Jesus Christ does anybody sell decent meth around here? How fucking hard is it to get your hands on some fucking quality drugs for fucks sake? If this is crystal meth then crystal meth sucks." She didn't seem to think so. Said she was high as fuck. At this point I was more just pissed off that here I was 3 times in, and I still didn't get to feel this supposed life-destroying fucking drug. I was determined to at least feel the fucking high now because that was some definite bullshit. 

I asked her if she had any better plugs. She gave me a few numbers and I called up one after the other after determining that the previous guy's bag was shit. I didn't really feel much. Lightly stimulated, but not much. Figured those were all bunk. So I called an old friend and got a few plugs and a bag from each after determining the previous guy's bag was shit. It was at this point I was like, "whatever man, fuck it. Waste of money this shit was," and gave up on trying to get meth. Thing is, by that point I was already using every day for about a month straight just from trying different bags in my quest to get zooted. By the second day of not using I was craving meth so badly. What the fuck? Did I become addicted to crystal meth without realizing it? Yes. Yes I did. 

I called up Jimmy and got a plug from him. Best shit he's had he said. "Yeah, sure" I thought ready to be disappointed. I was. Said fuck it though and I just kept smoking bowl after bowl, and after a bit I realized I actually had a pretty good body high. Finally I smoked meth and thought, "Whoa..." I felt not too bad, still not the euphoria I expected to feel but I wasn't having a bad time. Anyways I figured out later that I was ADHD and thats why I wasn't getting high like other people I knew, which is a blessing and a curse. I also figured out that the euphoria needed to be coaxed out. For me anyways. I needed music and good times. Anything that gave a natural dopamine hit would stack onto the dopamine I had flowing already until eventually I would have a pretty good euphoria going on. This was the crystal meth I know and love today. This was the drug I haven't been able to put down since I got addicted; whenever the fuck that was. 

Thing is, I don't really feel all that bad about it. Sometimes I do. Its a really moody drug. For the most part though, I kind of feel good about it. I wish I could sit here and talk shit about it like some people do; like its the fucking devil. And don't get me wrong, for some people it is. It affects everyone differently. But for me, its not all bad. I know its got more than its fair share of ways it is a detriment to your health. However, those costs seem a bit small to me. However that might be the drug talking. Probably. 

Basically the only major downside is having to hide it from everybody. I spend way less than I was on whatever other drugs I was addicted to and all dropped since regularly using meth. I can use it to crush it at work, for a time, anyways. Not sustainable, I've learned. Always been able to sleep on it, should I choose to. Just hard to choose to. Always been able to eat, though I "choose" to eat like I choose to blink and if I don't blink its really fucking uncomfortable. It makes me more creative and artistic. I never used to write before, and now its like my favorite thing to do. Most importantly its made me more empathetic and to act on it. I actually care about others more and doing something about helping them, instead of just observing and feeling shitty for 5 minutes. End of the day I have nothing to show for it save for some shitty writing to evidence my cognitive decline, pre-mature wrinkles in my gaunt face, and protruding bones so clearly defined that Merriam and Webster would be envious. But I'll have a had a good time too I hope.My fucking pants don't fit anymore. I tried going out for a walk in the woods the other day. I was wearing jeans for the first time in a minute. I couldn't keep them around my waist to save my life. Like God damn I thought I was skinny before but shit if my waist is any indication, I am *waist*-ing away. Heh. Ok fuck me, I'm sorry. 

But for real, my belt didn't do shit even. I had that motherfucker pulled into his very tightest hole. He was like "please, go slow. It's my first time for that hole." I eased the buckle stick thingy into the leather's soft hole ever so gently while my belt let out a pleasured moan but that belt was still loose as shit and still ain't didn't do shit. Like I held up my end of the bargain, now you hold up my God damn pants. Dont make me walk around with one hand in my pocket to hold up my pants like a fucking idiot, you genuine leathered genuine fuckhead. My belt was like "nah, how about I just add some weight to this bitch and give gravity even more of an upper hand so all the wild fauna out here can see the root of your penis, bitch." Thanks belt, its not like I don't already got a bunch of meth and various smoking apparatuses in my pockets already weighing this shit down as is, you piece of shit. I smoked some meth in hopes of it offering some guidance. Like in those mentos commercials. Mentos? More like *meth*-tos. What the fuck is wrong with me? Fuck. 

I tried to MethGyver a new hole by trying to hammer the buckle stick thingy through the leather with a big rock but I just broke the buckle entirely cause I'm a fucking idiot. Now i got nothing to hold these up. My best bet was to get a woody and hope the tension keeps my pants from falling down but alas, I was too high to get hard. I then had to MethGyver my MethGyvered fuck up by obtajning wood of another kind and finding some branches made of willow or some god damn shit to tie my belt loops together to hold up my pants. Sweet redemption. How resourceful I was, using the offerings of the land to survive. I felt like a methy Bear Gryllz now. Bear Chyllz. You know, cause *ice*. Heh. Ok fuck me, I hate myself. 

After giving all the innocent wildlife a good view of the base command of my cock rocket I made my way back in civilization. Found my way to the nearest haberdashery and bought a belt and put it on in the parking lot because who gives a shit? Still, some bitches laughed at me. Like it was fucking hilarious to them, which was fucking weird. Like fuck you, fucking bitches. Not like any of you got asses yourselves. Why you wearing yoga pants like you do? Not cause you got asses to show off, that's for sure. Probably cause they skin tight, negating the need for a belt. Well men's fashion hasn't jumped that hurdle yet and I ain't about to pioneer that shit. Not today, anyways. So I'm putting on a belt in the parking lot instead. Yeah keep on laughing, hoes. Not like you got anything to lose cause you clearly have already laughed your asses right off, you no-ass having bitches. Seriously though, wtf? Like they literally *belted* out in laughter. Heh. Ok, yes if this belt wasn't holding up my pants I would hang myself with it. I need to do some fucking squats.Ever wonder why you aren't getting high anymore? It might be time to take a break. If you're blowing all of your precious dopamine away throgh beautiful massive clouds, you're probably not going to feel any better by increasing your dose. Put it down for a bit.

I've been through this plenty of times, and its why I stopped ^(smoking) it. Increasing your amounts is going to increase the negative effects that come from higher doses, and have you wanting to cry from depression and how shitty you feel.

I know this isn't news to seasoned tokers, but I think there's been a lot of newer people here lately and I just want to be helpful when I can.Dude, so I've noticed that IV users on here, and other subreddits seem to just ONLY speak about how good the high from shooting is.

You'll see a post that was obviously written by someone who is new to meth, asking for suggestions on what the best method for getting high is;
And the comments will be like "IV. SHOOTING UP FEELS GREAT. ITS THE BEST. ITS BASICALLY THE ONLY WAY YOU SHOULD EVER USE METH"

But they don't ever seem to mention how shooting up meth the first time ruins peoples lives more often than not? I don't know if i've even noticed anyone explaining the kind of demon shooting up is to someone with no experience in it?

Dude, in real life, (at least here) giving someone their first shot is super super frowned upon.
And its seen as deliberate evil. Convincing someone to shoot up the first time also isn't okay.


All of the people here who have been in this world for years know all about it. We know injecting is almost it own little world in the dope game.

But DUDE THESE NEW PEOPLE ASKING FOR OUR ADVICE DO NOT KNOW ALL THAT. 
Like you know for a fact some people will see how highly recommended the IV is by some of yall, go get rig, and go home and try doin it.
Not knowing what they're doin, or wtf they're getting into.

If anyone reading this has considered trying the needle, I highly suggest you just don't. Even if its out of pure curiosity. Because it won't take everyone, but the risk of it taking your soul is way too high. 
Yes, it gets you crazy high. Like nothing you've ever felt in your life. 
But no, experiencing that high isn't worth losing yourself.

 Thanks for comin' to my ted talk.
Holy fuck I hate buying drugs as a woman. It's fucking impossible to find a hookup who isn't just trying to hookup. Like no, I won't suck your dick for an 8-ball. I'm a nurse, I've seen what kinds of bacterial culture have probably sought refuge on that destitute wasteland you call a dick – the only culture you have beyond Eminem's shittier albums and butchered Rick and Morty quotes, I'm sure. Besides I make plenty enough money to be able to afford an 8-ball without having to have your black balls slamming against my chin for a whole 45 seconds you fuckwit. Seriously why can't I just find a plug who isn't going to offer me a light bag of iso and an unrestrained case of mouth herpes? Fuck this drug.Well shit...

Showed up at Christmas about 40 lbs lighter, looking fresh and everyone was asking me how, so I said I went vegan. My sister-in-law is now trying to go vegan because she has been trying to drop weight for years after seeing my "success", and my mom rubbing it into her hard. If they only fucking knew, I feel shitty about it.Hey folks, I messaged the mods to see if it's okay and got radio silence for a week, so we'll try posting and see what happens.  
I created r/EndOfTheParTy about 6 months ago for those of us who are gay and trying to leave the parTy scene. Meth use is unfortunately at an epidemic level in the gay community, and it feels like we in that community often resort to joking and stigmatizing each other about this issue rather than supporting and encouraging each other to make decisions that serve us well. This will continue to be (I hope) a judgment free space where tweakers who are/are trying to get sober can find help through shared experiences and shared resources/approaches. Because relapse is so common, I advocate a harm-reductive approach, with people defining wellness for themselves.

Please be respectful of the courage it takes to be open about this problem and to seek out help when the party isn't fun anymore--some of my friends have died from meth overdoses, others are stuck in a living nightmare of permanent and irreversible psychosis. I still endure stigma routinely from other gay men because I've been frank on Reddit about my drug history and the mental health issues that have arisen from it, for being gay within recovery spaces, or for my drug of choice.

I hope this is received well, as it's my first time posting here. We have had some extremely triggering content shared on our sub in the past, but I'm trusting you all to respect those who are trying to make changes in their lives. How we respond to people who are vulnerable can make all the difference for them. Please share the subreddit--or maybe [this link](https://www.actoronto.org/health-information/young-people/staying-off-crystal.pdf) about ways to limit negative consequences from meth use--to anyone you think could use help in creating a life that works better for them.Turned 18 a lil bit ago and just moved into a diff town. Needed plugs hella bad I was fucking fienin for some anything. Mostly some painpills or weed. I hit up grindr since I heard it got plugs. So this dude hits me up and gonna give me a half ounce and some meth If i let him suck my dick. I didn't respond. After a few hours jonesing hella hard I caved in a let this dude suck my dick, most awkward and uncomfortable 5-10 minutes I've ever had. I left after that with a car with some goodies but my dignity is forever gone.Omfg! All I can I say is. Woooow. Please quit smoking meth. Replace It with gardening 😍 you wont regret it! I have been reborn. I'm so much happier and kick depression in the a$$. I never crave it anymore. Eating well and working out. Yoga and meditation. Everything is more beautiful and my energy levels more than meth could ever give me. My addiction is.. being the best me I can be, seeing life progress,  beats meth any day .

If you’re smart you know that you WILL BE OKAY , YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE , THE FEDS ARE NOT FOLLOWING YOU, and LIFE AS YOU KNOW IT IS GONE. Welcome to an entirely new, beautifully fucked up, porn infested , jerk till the bacon aint shaken , thought about your sister once or twice didn’t ya , type of life : you chubby fuckers .pretty good imo try itWell, it's true. They say you will lose everything on this drug. My girlfriend found my pipe and is currently packing all of her things and leaving. Next is the job, place to live, on and on if I don't stop. If you are new to this drug, I urge to just quit it's not worth it. Did you hear me? IT'S NOT WORTH ITI am currently a recovering addict. This sub has entertained me the past few months, reminding me of my old self. As I sit on here this Christmas Day, I find myself doing a lot of reflecting about not only 2020, but 2021.

I envy those of you that can do drugs like meth and still maintain a functioning lifestyle.  Even though I am sober today, tina’s icy grasp is still firmly planted in my mind. 

Today is the day I must leave this sub. I wish everyone a merry Christmas and happy new year! Keep doing what makes you happy.Did meth for the first time and I feel so normal its scary. I just feel happy and comfortable talking to people I don't know and it all just feels normal. I hate that because I feel like I won't be able to feel normal without meth. It doesn't help that I've been depressed for awhile and this just makes me feel good.Meth sex is a level of pleasure that not many humans will ever get to experience. 
Many ppl especially women don't always correlate sex with meth because no one has guided them to it.

Once you do associate the two you will never seem to do meth again without wanting, having, or thinking about sex after immediate dose. 

My personal description. . .

After immediate large dosing, preferably (snort , parachute , booty bump , and intravenous) you become tingly. 
In a females case, her pussy could swell up twice the size and become extremely sensitive when simply a soft touch sends shivers down her spine. 

The journey up to orgasmic release feels pretty much like an orgasm. Phenomenal, it's not just an means to and end it's highly stimulated the entire time.

With every penetration, vibration, stroke, and touch feels like adding to a ball of fire from deep within. 

Sometimes for a female a pocket of fluid inside feels as if it's swelling with juices waiting to squirt out. 

Everytime you feel like you're going to cum you somehow don't so this can go on for hours.

While engaged you don't care about anything else, you are strictly in personal gratification mode.

If something or someone interrupts you react with absolute rage or complete irritation.

Once the orgasm comes through it's fucking mind-blowing, it's like convulsing out from a deep core within our body like a volcano eruption. Our eyes roll in the back of our head and time practically stops. 

This lasts  substantially longer than the average non-meth orgasm. 

The decimal of noise that which we emit from our bodies is more animalistic because for a short while we have transcended from our physical form.

It's not fake nor can it be.
Like a moan that sounds similar to  dry-heaving. Expelling, vomiting an invisible force from out of our bodies

After we're brought back to reality and question ourselves "what came over me" , we notice pile of sweat left behind and surprised at the amount of work we put in. 

The intensity is phenomenal and and extremely addicting. 

Your addiction has progressed and it's harder to kick the dope because now you're addicted to both.

The memories and triggers that will send you to a relapse would be fantasizing about the meth sex.

Sober sex get boring and ppl end up wanting it to end after so long, meth sex . . . 
You don't ever want it to end and will avoid, ignore, or shrug off any plans to engage in it and won't stop until you reach satisfaction.

Ever wonder why meth users are sex-obsessed? Well here it is , one of the best most pleasurable feeling you will ever experience in a lifetime.


Here we go . . . back down the rabbit hole.So it's been a while since I went on a public masturbation meth adventure like probably three months to long. Well any I've moved into the big leagues and I've moved onto shooting instead of smoking. Smoking has nothing on shooting anymore it's just such a massive waste of time rolling the pipe instead of banging a fat quarter gram shot feeling the insane rush and then going for it!

Anyway doubt you guys and gals remember but I'm the guy that likes to do meth in public and then jerk off in public. I know I know I'm a weird mother fucker but I never do it around kids.

But anyway so I go to my local starbacks buy myself a nice double shot vanilla espresso. Then set it down on my table real quick go to the bathroom with my pre prepped meth shot and find a vein and pow! I'm all good to go I open up my laptop go over in my corner spot and pop on over to porn hub. Head phones in sweat pouring from my forehead in anticipation of what gang bang video I'm going to be watching today. I already feel my cock getting hard at the thought of what I'm about to witness.

I've found my prey " five way black train on teen thai" my blood begins to boil at the sight of all of these well hung black men being serviced by this adorable thai girl! My cocks fully hard now and people are starting to come in the starbucks as I'm rudding my cock against my thigh. I'm covered in sweat now and I think people are starting to stare at me or maybe it's just the paranoia. Then about five minutes later one of the baristas comes to up me to and begins to question me. In my porn focused haze I forgot to close my laptop and she sees my screen with porn playing. She begins to freak out and runs over to call the cops I jumped up instantly out of my seat laptop in hand and rock hard cock outline in full bulging against my pants.

I make a run for the nearest door and begin to cum a little because of the friction of my cock rubbing against my thigh as I'm running. A couple of male paetrons chased me out of the door and I feel like a gazelle running for its life across the open African planes with lions in chase who want to devour and hurt me. I begin to have a full body orgasm as I'm running I sprint down the nearest alleyway and manage to lose them having drenched my pants in semen as I run away..

I hop on the nearest bus and make a clean get away covered in jizz,sweat and the accomplishment of knowing I survived my first close call. I'm a still a free man to masturbate another day.It’s incredible how loud apple skin is while it is being  broken by your teeth when it’s dead quiet and someone is sleeping close by. Especially when you dont want to have to explain to that someone  why your silently eating an apple in the dark at 4:00 AM 

Don’t even think about trying to make a boat. Might as well be ringing the liberty bell in your living room with a jack hammer. 

I always thought when I was an adult I wouldn’t have to do this kind of shit anymore.  Maybe when  I retire.one of my closest friends has been on a meth rampage for about a year now and it’s made me numb at this point. three years ago we were band nerds in high school and it was perfect when we found weed together and would just get high and have fun all the time as kids, yeah that shit doesn’t last. flash forward two years to when he was copping some bud and his plug convinently offered an 8ball for free with the weed. one bump and down the rabbit hole he went. i remember him walking a few miles to my house just to ask me for a dollar so he could snort a line on his phone. coke was very quickly not enough for him, with the addictive personality he has. literally had my back turned on him for one second and he switched from coke to meth like it was changing clothes. i was tripping on acid and at 3am or so got a text from him telling me he just boofed meth for the first time. let me tell you, that is not something you want to hear from your best friend while tripping balls. at this point he was just spending his time at crack houses around our neighborhood (he smokes a lot of crack too) sending me dumb ass videos of him hitting dirty crack pipes... every time i came to his house he would eat his meth in front of me and it would burn his fingers because of how much he touched the stuff. constantly covered in meth sweat, just watching him crawling on the ground and smoking crumbs, telling me extensive stories about the shadow people and how he had to slam on his brakes when he was driving (on meth) because he almost ran a shadow person over. he was constantly slicing his wrists and contemplating suicide. it was too much for me. he was like my brother and i had to do something, so i called the police and told them he was threatening to kill himself and that he needed psychiatric help, because i didn’t want him in jail i wanted him in rehab. so some people came and took him from his house and brought him to a psych ward for a 24 hour suicide watch. when he was in there it was left to me to clean the drug mess he had in his house. i filled an entire gallon bag with needles and boof syringes, and found a huge pile of shotgun bullets in a box under his pillow. so many dirty spoons. i think he did heroin once too. but anyways i cleaned everything and made it look nice and he came home so fucking mad and hasn’t talked to me since, because i don’t support his addiction. it’s been a year and i’m permanently fucked from all this shit. we’re 19 i wasn’t fucking ready for this. he just got out of jail for a crack possession but i’m just kinda sitting day by day waiting to get the phone call that he od’d. that won’t be a fun funeral. i don’t want to have to go to yet another kid’s funeral. the fuck is my life turning into.I force myself to eat one KETO friendly meal at least once every 24 hours.  

I only Eat, smoke, snort or anal insertion. NO injecting it. 

Must sleep at least 8-15 hours every 2 days... No 7 day trips... 

Force my self to hydrate with water... No sugar or fruit juice drinks

Take my potassium and magnesium along with vitamin C and multi vitamin. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I honestly don’t understand what you’re getting out of it, or what you think we are benefiting from it? 

If anything you’re leaving some very incriminating evidence behind if by chance you run into legal trouble and your phone gets snatched or they do a deep dive into your web browsing habits..

It’s all fun and games until you get pulled over for something stupid like a missing tail light and you just so happened to be sloppy that day… get popped/sentenced to 6months to a year for the bullshit. 

Even though realistically with tweakers… it would be stopped because you had a expired tag dating back precovid, along with suspended license, while on day 4 doing 88mpg in school zone as you swerve the wrong side of the road because you couldn’t keep your chameleon eyes off that Samsung Galaxy S5 with a cracked screen blasting pornhub pegging videos. And start with the “AM I BEING DETAINED!??” Bullshit… 

Just saying, at least try being a functioning addict… it’s a lil extra work but It’s the least you could do for everyone, including yourself…If you ever were wondering what happens when you get meth your eye lemme be the first to enlighten you lmao 😂 

You’re probably wondering how this dumb ass managed that, right? I’m a contact wearer and was putting my contacts in for the morning after just finishing a line. For some reason this morning, I decided to do a line without being able to see and was fumbling around trying to find my contact case. 

Well I FUCKIN rubbed my index finger, of all fingers, across the table where the residue was leftover. Put my contact in and my eye got wicked red and burned a lil but I thought it was just the shitty brand of contacts I’ve been using cuz they have been bothering my eyes. Hahaha well when my focus came in I realized that right before that, out of my right eye, I saw slight little opaque grainy dots and was like wtf is going on man. Then I looked down and see a break in the line of residue perfectly fitting of my damn finger. 

I was like omg I just put meth in my eye. I look in the mirror and I shit you not, the emoticon people make:

#o.O

Yeah, those were my pupils. It dilated one of my fucking eyes! This was a couple days ago and I had to work, and it went allllllllllll day. I work at a bank and am a teller and had a little brat with her mom not minding her fucking business point at me and say  “what is wrong with your eye” and her mom dead ass in front of me said “honey it is not nice to talk about people with birth defects” and now I’m the joke (in a good way) of the place 

Thanks methCan't tell anyone in my actual life this, but I thought I'd tell y'all here on r/meth. Long time lurker, first time posting here since I made this account. Today is the last day I partake in the crystal. My lady and I are ready to stop using it, our tolerances are way too high, and we are seeing the negative effects outweigh any positives now. It's been fun y'all, though. It's made the past several months much more interesting and bearable. Gonna finish off as much of 1.5g as we feel comfortable, then flush the rest down the toilet. Anywho, no one in my life can be told this, as we have kept our habit as private as possible. Hoping the next month or so will go okay, we are looking forward to this long tolerance break. Hope everyone enjoys their day, and thanks to anyone who reads this. On to a new chapter!I posted on here last week about debating whether to flush the bag I had just bought. Went against a bunch of people's advice and didn't. Ended up eating a tiny bit trying to take "therapeutic" doses to help me with school and it did wonders. I am trying to graduate college this semester and I thought I would use it to help me get all this shit done, which it might have, I guess. Problem was that this shit is just too fucking good for any human to handle. I mean I felt like I could do anything and my whole life was about to change. Turns out I was just high as all fuck and this stuff could very well cause immeasurable damage to my life if I let it. 

Today I woke up, had my coffee, and immediately started craving it. Kinda felt like a really strong nicotine craving. I thought "nuh-uh, not gonna play this game. I see where this is headed." Got on my phone, scrolled to the dealer's contact info and deleted it (without having to look at the number. Thank God, because I can memorize phone numbers like it's nothing) and proceeded to take my bag to the toilet for swift disposal.

Turned around and got in the shower and immediately felt better. I just don't need this shit in my life right now. I'd rather have normal ups and downs and be able to sleep and eat without having to manage yet another addiction (already have a problem with alcohol and nicotine). So there's that, I'll probably end up regretting my decision at some point, but who cares. I got rid of it and have no easy way of getting it again and for that I am very thankful and relieved. Stay safe and take care of yourselves, my friends!Y’all remember when we used to have hopes, dreams and goals? 

Y’all remember how the sunrise used to look before we got used to looking up and realizing it’s light out?  

Y’all remember when we used to enjoy family dinner before we were worried about how our eyes look?

Y’all remember when you were the popular one in highschool everyone used to bet on that would finally make it out of this town?

Y’all remember when you could sit around in a circle with your friends without there needing to be a piece of glass being passed around?

Y’all remember what it was like to look at someone and feel like nothing mattered as long as you were with them?

Y’all remember you didn’t see the ugly side of the world because you didn’t even know it existed?

Y’all remember what it was like to be able to trust someone with anything and they’d trust you back?

Y’all remember when people would talk about you they’d start with “He/she is” instead of “He/she was”

Fuck you meth. Fuck youYou're coming off a 5-day binge and feeling as lifeless as the depths of space, with zero dopamine-firing in your brain and the urge to do nothing overpowering your urge and will to eat or take a piss. But after enough time, the pain in your bladder becomes a sufficient enough motivator to get out of bed, and as the golden stream begins to tinkle gently against the porcelain, you remember useless factoid number 70049 that you learned while twacked-out using the internet for non-pornographic purposes (imagine the porn/non-porn ratio and shear amount of consumption of it - to have gained 70k factoids of non-porn knowledge - if actually true. Which it isn't, id be like 100+ years deep in viewing hours ffs)...

That 62% of methamphetamine is excreted unchanged in your urine. You then begin to quantify how many balls and teeners you burnt through over the last 120 hours, realize that you've got over a quarter-zip in your piss - and are even *entertaining* this thought-pattern in any capacity other than laughing about the absurdity and patheticness of some dude drinking his own urine who isnt a) Bear Grylls, doing so into the freshly-skinned pelt of a snake he caught and killed, filming for his tv show, or b) someone who needs to drink their urine due to the imminent threat of death via dehydration, in a real-world survival situation. 

Then, well - *you're a fucking degenerate meth-addict* or a degenerate piss-fetishisist, both of which will probably die of an overdose/heart-attack due to shear quantity of urinary meth consumption (at least they died doing something they loved, in either scenario though, right?). Hi guys, my name's u/excitotoxix and I'm a meth-addict!You don’t have to be a piece of shit just because you like to get high. Be a person of your word and always be genuine. Don’t take from your friends or some other bullshit like that. Yeah we’re fucked up sometimes maybe all the times. If your not having fun then maybe don’t get spun.Each and every one of you, no matter your past or mistakes or what coulda/shoulda happened; you are worthy and most definitely worth loving too, past and all.
I’m not in the best mood tbh so I hope y’all’s night is better than mine, and if today sucked, it’s an opportunity for tomorrow to be your best day yet, or atleast better <3
Hang in there <3 we all got this shit. Life can’t get us down, we’re strong, We’re fighters. We’ll always be okay<3 I love each and every one of u as people, and I’m so happy you’re all still here.so my parents just had their 31nd anniversary so i thought i'd do something nice for them. neither of them do drugs, and my dad is ex marines. My mom is extremely christian. so i bought $300 worth of meth for them each. i sat in their house as a suprise and i smoked some meth and waited for my parents. then once my dad walked in i gave him the pipe and i said, "happy anniversary. try it." and he freaked the fuck out and he grabbed his shitty nokia phone and called the cops ASAP. i got so fucking mad i threw the  meth in my bag and ran out of there. Now they wont answer my phone calls idk what thw fuck i did wrong.Got a good job recently and going back to school. I’m not fucking that up.Meth doesn’t even give me a “high” anymore. But when I’m off meth for 12+ hours I get so depressed, unmotivated, anxious, and sad that I smoke again just to avoid that feeling. 

Then the second I smoke meth, the depression just goes away. It doesn’t make me high or happy, but “that sadness” (you all know what I’m talking about) goes away. And that’s enough for me to keep smoking.

Anyone else do this? I hate that I can’t deal with a little depression that I have to resort to this fucking drug.

Doing drugs not to chase the high, but to avoid the comedown… that’s a sign I’m really addicted I think.I'm noticing an increasing trend lately involving our subreddit. That trend being a plethora of comments from people who don't even use this drug yet still coming here to ridicule or chastise us users and leave negative comments on all the shit we post anyways. Even reposting our cloud videos elsewhere so other people can get in on it too which is pretty fucked up if you ask me. Regardless, I don't mind if people want to just come ogle the zoo animals, but when you start tapping on the glass or throwing shit over the fence, animals is going to get pissed off. And that's fucked up. And maybe it's really all harmless but it isn't. One day one of these assholes is going to do something that will do a lot of damage to one of us animals and the next thing you know, we are going to have another Harambe on our hands. 

So like I said, I don't care if they want to come in and be respectful and just satisfy their curiosities. And I'm sure many of them do. Maybe even most. After all we only see the comments from the commenters who comment right? But those motherfuckers who do comment can honestly all go hop in a spaceship and go try and colonize the sun. Some of them truly do mean well, however their attempts to convince us are futile and misguided. Annoying, sure. But not as annoying as the other dickheads we see around here. Most of the time when they comment, it's quite obvious that they don't have altruistic intentions. It might seem like it but really it's judgment disguised as concern. They just want to feel better than you are. Which they do. They just want to validate it for themselves. 

You ever try and argue with these guys? They don't actually try and see your point of view. They just double down and when they realize most of their argument is based on misconceptions or their own biased feelings, they just write you off and send you a nasty PM. 

Now this is fine. I don't care about some neckbeard getting butthurt. But some of these guys just get off on feeling superior. And they repost shit elsewhere. You can tell when the top comment on a cloud video is some asshole non-user with 13 upvotes that there are a lot of these dickheads kicking around. They screenshot conversations to post elsewhere and then people get talking. When I used to mod here, I'd get notifications when this subreddit is mentioned in other subs. 90% of the time it was people making fun of us. Then 30 people going "wait, what? There's a sub for r/meth?" Then 100 more people are in here lurking, wanting to be assholes to us. There's a reason this sub's membership count has shot up like 10,000 people in like a month and they ain't all meth heads.

The worst thing we can do is give them what they want by trying to argue with them. You're not going to convince them of anything. Just shut them down immediately. 

"This is fucking sad. Have fun looking like absolute shit in 3 months." 

"K." 

Or don't even reply. That's all you have to do. Just don't engage with them. Most of them will get bored and fuck off. They won't be reposting your exchange to make fun of you on some other subreddit. Because I can tell you from firsthand experience, how it can fuck you. A few months back I posted a video of me using some crazy straw hot rail glasses I had constructed. I wore a mask beneath the glasses to conceal my identity. However people that know me know I have some some very distinguished, long, golden locks. Well some motherfucker reposted my video to another subreddit for some podcast. It wasn't even popular. Yet my buddy, who is very good buddies with my roommate, happened to come across it like a month later and sold me out to him. Because he recognized me by my hair sticking out from underneath the mask. It was some grade A bullshit. 

So don't think posting something means "well anyone who sees anything I post is going to have to explain their reason for coming here as well." Because people come here for a lot more reasons than because they have an affinity for meth evidently. I just don't want to see someone think they're safe when they're not. The other day someone's video got posted elsewhere and luckily she's a fucking stone cold killa and completely owned that shit but it was heavily upvoted with a ton of eyes on it that otherwise wouldn't have been. 

Back to my main point though. The less attention we give to these fuckfaces, the less attention they'll bring to us. They don't know us. They don't know how most of us take care of ourselves and are functional, everyday professionals. They don't know how most of us are honest, caring, and respectable people. They just think meth and want to judge. I guarantee Lord u/foulblood is a better person than each and every one of those jabronies who comes in here to judge. Did you know that guy writes down the names of everyone he interacts with and some stuff about them to remember them by? If you click on his profile he doesn't have a link to whatever "send me money" services people use. Just a link to buy the book a friend of his made. They don't know that that guy shows more empathy and care for others in a day than any one of them does all year. 

So fuck those guys. They don't deserve your time or your patience. They don't want to be convinced. They want to feel superior. Well they're not. And really neither are we. None of us are. We're all just people. People trying to get by with what we've been given. Or what's been taken. People on a rock hurtling through space that one day is going to burn to a crisp as the increase in the sun's size and luminosity makes this planet completely uninhabitable, long after the entirety of the human race is probably all already dead. So don't even waste your time arguing with them. One day we'll all be dead and nothing anybody ever did will have ever mattered. As long as you ain't hurting anybody and you can look yourself in the eye at the end of the day, do whatever the fuck you want. But let's keep these motherfuckers from trying to hurt us and stop giving them what they want. 

K?Or symptoms of overamping, same thing.

-Feeling like your eardrums are blocked (sounds are muted for a few seconds to minutes and you may hear a light ringing)

-Hands and feet are extremely cold

-Fingers and hands are “munching up”(you feel your muscles tighten up until your fingers get stuck in a weird shape that you can’t unfold)

-You catch yourself holding your breath and have to remind yourself to breathe out every few sec 

-You catch yourself sighing/making moaning noises from discomfort

-You see something move from your peripheral vision but when you actually turn to look at it, nothing is moving 


These are a few notes I took from my own overamps. Different for everyone of course but thought some new users might find it usefulI'm not like other meth heads saying "oh meth is the best shit ever, you feel amazing and powerful..". I admit that I am hooked to the shit but by no means I'm saying is good. I'm trying not to relapse but I do every two-three weeks especially on weekends. Fuck meth I hate it, whish I would never said yes the first time I was offered to try it. It drives me crazy how a person like me can't get out of this shit. I used to be a normal kid, pretty intelligent according to people and very good at solving problems... I used to play chess in tournaments and even won a few. My dad is a bussinesmen and he wants me to take his place as soon as possible. Now at 21 I'm throwing all my achievements away and wasting my time shooting up drugs.

For real, people who still haven't tried it please don't do it.. U really don't know in how much risk you're putting your future on by only trying it once. It's just not worth it.

Just do weed and mushrooms and acid, that shit good. Meth, coke, Heroin and above are fucking trash. Don't do it.

Fuck methA shot of meth feels like you've finally crossed that line you swore you'd never cross. You know the one--it looked impossibly far away back when you were naive enough to promise yourself you'd always stick to smoking. When you truly believed you would never allow yourself to become one of those needle freak losers. It feels like you can longer fool even yourself into thinking you're just a casual user who can walk away at any time, no problem. I did eventually just walk away from it & then come back and then restart the cycle. I'm not the exception, nor the rule. A shot of meth feels like ecstasy, disgust, & the beginning of the end in an insulin syringe. It feels like despite promising yourself you'd only try it once to see what all the fuss is about, you need to try again because maybe the first wasn't quite big enough. You've already crossed the line so what's the big deal? It feels like realizing its suddenly a week later & you're still using that same dull & dangerous syringe because you can't get more. It's ok, it's still doing the job well enough & that hard infected area on your arm is just a coincidence. It feels like another week of putting that same syringe through hard labor until the needle snaps off. In your arm. And you try to literally melt it back into place on the syringe barrel. No biggie, you tell yourself, I'll just go back to smoking. The pipe laughs at you, mocking you for thinking it would take you back after your brief affair with the syringe. You snuck behind that pipe's back & cheated on it like Trump cheats on his wives. You're tired, frustrated, disgusted with yourself & what you've become. A nap would help you feel better but you can't sleep with that baggie in the dresser calling out to you. Fuck it, make some calls & see if anyone can help you out. Yes!!!! Steve says he'll be here in 15 min with what I'm looking for! Three hours later Steve finally shows up & the rage you've been feeling about his tardiness melts away. You can't stay mad at your salvation. Only Steve doesn't have anymore new syringes because something something blah blah blah happened on the way over & he had to use his last clean one. He only used it once though, it's still in great shape, you're crashing hard, & Steve swears he doesn't have anything so it'll be fine. It'll only be this one time. Later on down the road you hear that Steve's had Hep C for years & the panic sets in. Your blood test is negative but what if it was wrong? You test again 6 months later & it's still negative but what if it's still wrong? You did use Susan's needle a few weeks ago & she's a proud meth banger so who knows what she has? The paranoia continues, even years after you've walked away from that lifestyle. How long does it take to go away? I'll let you know when I get there.
 Yes it’s entirely accurate to say it’s bliss loaded into a syringe. Humans were not meant to feel that. You'll never find a physical sensation that even comes close to it. IV Fentanyl is still SEVERAL rings down the latter. Is it really worth it knowing every other pleasure in life will feel like a cheap substitute when compared to a good bell ringer. You're never gonna forget that feeling, not even years after leaving it all behind. Everything else pails in comparison. It will always be your standard of comparison. After awhile (months to years, not days to weeks) you'll be able to experience physical pleasure from normal things again, if you can manage to hold out long enough to get there. Which you won’t your first try. Or second. Or tenth. Many don't make it that long without outside help in the form of drug treatment if you're lucky, prison if you aren't.
Shooting up isn't something to fuck around with. If you don't have a fairly serious problem before that first shot you will after. I've made a lot of wrong turns in the bumpy road of my life but that first shot was one of my major ones. That one threw me off the road altogether, down a steep ravine, & into a river. There are a lot of things in my life I shouldn't have done but few of them were true life changers. I wish I'd never picked that goddamn needle up. I wish I'd never tried meth in the first place but that needle really fucked me over. It's been 6+ years and I still can't have my blood drawn without that taste and warmth coming up my throat. I’m fucking twenty-two. 
It's a hallucination but it feels disgustingly and deliciously real every single time.
That whole lifestyle is a delusion—while you're involved you see it & yourself as fun, exhilarating, maybe even glamorous. You look down on the people who try to help you come back to reality before it's too late & pity them because they don't know what they're missing. The world is yours for the taking & the glamorous life you're leading will last forever without consequence. Eventually the excitement fades, the glittery mask cracks then false off altogether, & you see what all the non-users have been seeing all along. The truth is hideous & terrifying in the beginning but after awhile it becomes a way of life; you find comfort in the misery and prefer it to the lies sold to you by meth.All the little sewer rats sniffing around leaving comments along the lines of "waahahaha i have never done a meff in my life but this subreddit is hilarious"

The comments are unnecessary and come off fairly tone deaf in my opinion. Maybe because im on a bad one and irritated to no end. But why are you going to come around some addicts and point and laugh at us while exclaiming that you are pointing and laughing?

I get it, long posts, run-on sentences, bouncing from subject to subject, sometimes ending the novel on a totally unrelated note. Its comedy gold, right?

Except the intent isnt to be a comedian. We are actual people, actual addicts. Sure, there are people who very obviously crack jokes for entertainment on this subreddit. Cool. But it doesnt seem very kind in nature to comment on every post about how you are laughing at us, simply because meth and how it has us acting and living is funny to you, while you have never came close to the addiction in your life.

Im gonna put my hardass hat on and clue yall in on a perspective..sometimes, i am too high, and uncontrollably type out, erase, type, erase, type type type, for much too long and feel i cannot stop. But i still feel the desire to share with the world whatever it is ive set out to say, so i work on that shit anyway. At times this entire process is a bit miserable to be stuck in. We all just want to finish and successfully convey our thoughts. Its harder than you know.

I can admit it seems a bit funny, but to laugh in my position is to cope and accept. In your position, it is to make a fool of.

We arent monkeys, we are addicted to meth whether you find that batshit retarded or not. It is what it is- you and i are both only human and make mistakes others would never come close to making out of stupidity. 

Is it that difficult to laugh without declaring you are only here as bystanders giggling like schoolgirls? I see your presence as laughing at someone struggling. it seems a bit inhumane.Shes going through a lot right now, as she kind of explained some of it to me. Im sure some (probably a lot) of what shes dealing (ha) with, is a consequence of her life choices.
But props to her. She isn't a mobile dealer, so she has to find a driver & pay them (because my lazy ass isnt going all the way to her without my car.)
She was also out of product today for the first time in years -- due to one of her current problems.
On top of everything, she had a full on stereotypical crackhead type of crrackhead who wouldnt stop harassing her. (Literally AT her house banging on the windows trying to buy anything he can get his hands on. After being told she was dry.)

Anyways, i hit her up and told her to take her time & get here safe.

She estimated 3h cause she needed a cuff (cuff / front =  loan of drugs / not paying up front)
She got a cuff but it turned out to be garbage which she explained to me before even trying to come sell it to me.

She went silent for like 45 mins (as opposed to her normal constant rambling over text) and i was worried she would bail and keep me up all night for nothing.

Nope. Get a barrage of texts while im takimg an anxious poop, saying she met another plug for a cuff of way better shit and shes at the plaza / store ljke 2 mins from my house. Which is my prefered meeting spot, cause fuck buying meth right outside my door. Most plugs dont like how open and obvious it is tho, so thankful she came there.

Surprised, i text back saying im not quite ready but ill run within 5 minutes and be there asap... After i "run asap" AKA: flail for literally 15-20 mins doing nothing... Then walking super slow for another 5-10 mins to the store that is 2 mins away...
I realize i have no cash. Fuck.

Run to the bank across the street from where she is, grab cash, and boom: another text.
"Ill come over to you. Want anythiing from store?"
She walks in the bank / atm area as soon as im reading the text and she hands me a FAT bag. Like... Kids... This bag was THICC.

I give her like $300, (seems like a lot if you knew how much i got... But i paid for her driver + tipped her for being lovely cause im way far away and its inconvenient.)

She texts me and asks if everything looks okay (3 hours ago) and im just looking at it now.
Its a gorgeous single big boi of a shard. Scales out 1 full gram EXTRA, considering i only bought a "small" amount... 1g extra is amazing. I usually expect exact or maybe even less...

Anyways, the quality of this shard seemed too good almost. So i crush it and oh my god... Not only is it still gorgeous, but it smokes beautifully (compared to some shit ive had lately that barely vaporized)
And the crackback is perfect-- relative to my knowledge of performing crackbacks / CBack pics well.

I dont expect anyone to read this. I sound like a fucking head. [Its 4:20am and i should be smoking weed but im ONE hit in to this batch of tech & i dont feel sad for once and my dealer just deserves credit for helping me destroy my life and providing me with someone to casually converse with for 5 mins while i buy drugs off of her. CanIGetAnAmen pleaseeee]

TLDR: My dealer sold me good meth and she is kind to me. :)i know a majority of you guys might not care, and might even be tweaking while reading this. that’s okay. some of you might be happy hearing that a total stranger has rid this shit out of their life for good. that’s okay too. some of you might be currently using and having the time of your life, and i’m here for it. i support you all regardless because i know how good it feels to use. to tweak all the time. to fucking binge for hours and feel like a golden god. but i’m not here to lecture anybody or rant. 

i just figured here would be the best place to post. i mean sure it might be nice for someone who’s never tried meth to hear about someone getting clean and be like “good job, man!”, but i prefer to come here and tell you guys because i’ve been on this sub for years. but anyways, i’m done with it for good. i’ve had a good run with it. 

aspects to tweaking i’ll definitely miss: feeling like i’m floating above all that matters. not caring about a single thing. feeling godlike, as if i have the power to influence anything and everything at once. the bursts of energy and creative ideas that come to my mind. the pure euphoria. 

aspects i won’t miss: not being able to sleep for days at a time, a week max. the body pain after not sleeping for days. the shadow people which would purposely torment me. not caring if i die or get seriously injured or go to prison because i feel invincible like fucking iron man. doing the worst things just to get more. not being able to eat because everything tastes like plastic. being delusional to the point where i believe i have super powers. 


hell the last time i tweaked was for 48 hours straight. i vividly remember what happened. i was walking alone in a walmart parking lot feeling suicidal and some skeevy old man asked me to get in his truck and he said he’d take me to his parents house and we could smoke. i didn’t care about my life at the time so i said fuck it and jumped in this dude’s truck. so he took my to his parents house. i lost track of time and hit a meth bong for 24 hours straight with this skeevy old dude in his garage, we drove to cemeteries and tweaked some more. he drove me around in his truck while he stole shit from people’s houses and would dash back into the truck. i straight up fucked this old dude for a free gram at one point, he was all over me and i didn’t care what happened. i was so methed up i developed a crazy alter ego and lied about my entire life story and played it so perfectly. i became leo decaprio or something. my body was nothing but an empty vessel. apparently during the 24 hour tweaking period with the old dude, my mouth had become numb and i had been chewing on the inside of my lips out of anxiety. turns out i couldn’t even feel that i practically chewed a hole through my cheek, a hole which later got infected because, obviously, i was hitting some strange old dude’s meth bong and sharing body fluids with him. so my face was swollen for a good week or so and i looked like a fucked up tweaker. shocker.

i genuinely didn’t care if i was going to die or go to prison because at one point i convinced myself i had superpowers and could move shit with my mind, as i said before. i was also convinced i could read people’s minds. the entire week after that night/morning i didn’t sleep, i thought i was a NASCAR driver but halfway through speeding down some highway i got irritated by having skin on my face and i had the worst idea - to rip that shit off. the thought in my mind freaked me out so bad i didn’t see a whole ass light pole in front of my car on a road and hit the light pole. i got stuck in time just sitting in my car and just drove away after a while realizing it wasn’t even that bad. everyone’s voices sounded like some fucked up TV characters. i became so antsy. like that feeling when you just can’t bear the moment in time. i tried to write a novel, do a billion things, etc. but i couldn’t stay focused on one task. regret was the worst of it. the only thing that helped was going over to a friends house, still tweaked out from 4 days ago and just trying to eat something and drink water. laying down and watching a movie while she stroked my hair, telling me it was going to be okay. and i realized i never wanted to do this shit to my body again. 

so, i’m proud of all you guys. regardless. for being able to function while constantly using this drug. but it just can’t benefit me anymore. i wish everyone on this sub the best, whether your goal is to keep tweaking or get clean. be kind to your bodies: try to eat something bland and drink some water, it’s the least you can do. i know many of you are good people who’ve been wrapped into some unsavory shit. but at the end of the day, it’s your life in your hands. you can do anything you please. 

deuces.Going to rehab tomorrow morning. I was clean for almost 5 years after 7 years of using, then slipped up and have been shooting heroin and meth for the last 18 months. I’m scared to go but I’m ready. I’m tired and ready to just give up so it’s time.Don’t get me wrong, I love all your beautiful faces but you gotta keep it 
🙉🙈🐵 
you don’t know who knows who.. Don’t forget that each person that knows you use is another possible chance of getting caught or arrested. 
Be Safe homies✌️💕And then I want local tweakers to visit with me and take the free meth but at the price of smoking meth in a graveyard.But this is still one of my favorite drug subs. You guys are fucking wild and a constant source of entertainment for my fucked up self.

Stay classy, everyone 🤍I’ve stayed up the past seven days doing nothing but meth, cocaine, PCP, and smoking weed so last night I was running through the street doing my thing when the meth bugs kicked in. I could feel something crawling around in my urethra and since I was on PCP I knew I could take it out. Well you know one thing led to another, and I ended up ripping my entire dick off. Not my best night but also not my worst night. Do any of you guys have any fun stories about meth bugs in your penis? Let me know.


Will update y’all later onSometimes I take the train to work and it's a good time. Just being able to chill and relax while still getting to work is so nice. You can people watch and stuff. Sometimes a beautiful lady gets on and you get to stare longingly at the back of her head and imagine a life where you're waking up to the back of her head every day maybe. It's fun to imagine.

Sometimes it is eventful too. You get to see the other methheads on the train screaming profanities at unseen entities. That's gonna be a fun meth power to get when I level up high enough, even if it means the girls with nice backs of their heads wouldn't be too into me at that point, but that's ok.

Then there's the train ride home after work. That's always fun too. Sometimes I just don't even get off at my stop and just keep going with the train. Letting myself travel all around my city. I sure hope I can get the chance to do it awake some time. 

I like trains.im 5'3, 120 lbs., 18, female, and native american

**day one**: *i do a .55 alka seltzer shot//gets gacked.*

**Day 2 awake**: *i smoke and do a .4 gutbomb*

i laugh at the shadow people & love reckless behaviors

**Day 3 awake**: *i smoke and parachute .6 & drink some 5 hour energy*

im scared of the amount of shadows im seeing, and recklessness causes great paranoia, want to stay around others to feel safe. I am in the shower and i am scared there is a camera watching me

**Day 4 awake**: *I binge smoke, and pop two .4 gutbombs*

i sit alone in the light and feel accompanied by shadows, & now their beginning to have features & quiet voices. I listen to ghostemane and bones and is easily irritated and angered by other real humans.

**Day 5 awake**: *binge smoking, do a .5 alka seltzer shot and a .2 gutbomb*

now im alone in the dark, shower in the dark; my teeth wont stop chattering and my heart hurts and have been responding to the whispers and i love it

**day 6 awake**: *smoking makes me sleepy, so i do a large bomb*

i am back out with my friends, im starving and i begin to have cannibalistic thoughts and keep falling asleep while my body is still shaking and is active

**day 7 awake**: idk how much 

shadows disappeared, now their real people. my teeth are chattering uncontrollably, i see someones eye in the door crack while im showering. my skin looks green in the mirror; i hear my name being called outside far away. and i have flash thoughts of slashing a squirrel and eating them.  im scared of these thoughts, because im normally not a very violent gackstar.  im getting names and faces mixed up, im in the dark, i keep thinking im in my basement, turns out i am in the hotel room bathroom with the light off thinking of eating people.

**Day 8: idk how much

im completely disassociated with where i am. +its dark out, the car stops, i grab my stuff and get out of the back seat, my friends are yelling for me to get back in, and i thought we were already at the destination, we were stopped at a stop light. i feel as if im falling asleep, i woke up a minute later looking up cannibal pics and necrophiliac porn online. only now i think its all funny and i continue to surf the web. I shut my laptop and i see ive been surfing for 6 hours and the sunrises again

**day 9**: *idk how much

i keep staring off into space and have been listening to john dee on repeat but dont realize until later. I think this guy in the room smells good, like fries; he works at a burger joint. he gets scared and leaves because i was staring at him drooling, and snarling at him. LMAO i didnt even realize i was doing it but i sure thought it was funny when he ran out. i get into an argument w this man who tried robbing my homegirl for an 8ball, he didnt because  i pull out my knife and threaten to eat his wife and daughter; also that i had killed and ate and raped his 18 yo stepsister who had went missing weeks ago( i didnt, but at the time i wish i did & i went to hs w her). i go home, email my ex saying "Iowa and i will take a nap but u wouldent apologize to me othr hundred more mph to house connecting ur wire dope n kecce wifi gn". I dont recall sending this. I crashed for four days & had nigh terrors about cannibals and necrophiliacs eating me.

>!:::Its been three weeks since this bender, and i decided to get sober for the safety of myself and others.!<

anyone similar?here's my background. grew up popping beans and snorting coke, but that was the hardest shit I'd ever done till recently. one drunken night at a local bar this girl I'm talking to asks if I want a bump of ice. I've done coke and mdma infinite times in my 31 years so I said fuck it lets do it. loved it. the problem with meth is it's fucking great. fast forward 2 or 3 weeks of wanting to do it again I have an 8 ball. I stayed up for 3 days jacking, peeping out of my windows to make sure my neighbors weren't on to me, and that episode ended with me standing at my front door watching it for hours with a Smith and Wesson 9 because I became convinced my neighbors were plotting to kill me. oh I was naked too. not remembering how I went to sleep I woke up feeling awful. after calling out of work 2 days in a row and getting away with it, I flushed most of that 8 ball down the toilet and said fuck that shit.

a month later I'm googling and finding out that you can't just snort lines repeatedly mmkay. so this next 8 ball I got, I did it "responsibly". I'd hit 2 lines and go out and socialize on the weekend. I told myself I'd just do it once every couple weeks, and within 2 weeks I was close to being fired for calling out too much. while at work all I could think of was getting home to snort some even if I wasn't actually going to. sometimes I'd just take it out to look at it.

 this haze of my life spiraling out of control became something I was ok with. I lost complete control of myself in regards to just using recreationally which I've always done. I got through most of this 8 ball, but one morning i had a moment of clarity and flushed what I had. when I flushed it this time though, a feeling of relief came over me. sometimes when I'm really drunk the dumb part of me goes mannn if I had a line, but I've trained myself to immediately associate the come down along with the other negatives right with the good part. it's amazing how addictive it is. I had a complete break from reality holding a pistol naked in a state of psychosis for HOURS. and still wanted more. shits cray cray. so if you're reading this thinking about trying it, and still want to, go ahead stupid. natural selection always wins.So this happened last night...  I have a female [F27] coworker  that I know parties and gets high. Other coworkers have told me so, so I thought to give it a shot. She's fucking beautiful, big tits (at least a D cup), sexy tattoos including a full sleeve.  Well, I finally worked up the nerve to ask if she wants to come to my house on Saturday and hang out. To my surprise, she said what are you doing tonight?? I said perfect!

So we get to my place and I put a nice amount of shards in the pipe and we begin smoking while standing in the kitchen. About after the 4th or 5th rip, she starts rubbing her breasts and taking a few pieces of clothing off and I'm thinking this is definitely going in the right direction!

Just then she gets on her knees and starts pulling my cock out. She plays with it for a few seconds to get it hard, looks up at me and says: "this is one of my favorite things I like to do". Then she took the pipe, took a huge rip, then blew the cloud on my cock... before the cloud was done, she swallowed my cock all the way down and blew the remaining cloud out her nose with my cock in her throat. The then gave me the best fucking BJ of my life. OMFG! That was the single sexiest and erotic thing I think I've ever seen and done.

So, without a fucking doubt in my mind, this is my favorite new kink! I want clouds blown on my cock!

Oh, and yes... we spun fucked all night long and she just left about an hour ago. She fucked me like I was a cheap sex toy and I fucking loved it!Hey..my boyfriend and I are pretty heavy users..when we would party..back in the day..we would fuck all night long..the best kind of sex too..that dirty..raunchy almost immoral kind of outer space sex you know? For the past couple years..we use and he barely even says one word to me..for days. He sneaks into the bathroom and jerks off..and wants really nothing else but the freedom to ignore me and bust nut after nut by himself watching smut online. Don't get me wrong..I like smut too but I am never included..or invited to join. I am a very fun..imaginative..experienced woman who isnt bad looking by any means..if I were a dude..I would be grateful for a fun partner who is always down for some craziness..but even if I hint around that I want to be fucked..he actually gets all pissy and an attitude about it..like its a damn chore!! Wtf?Just came back here to say that I’m doin well and have a month sober today! I look healthy now, I’m actually proud of myself for once, and I reunited with my daughter! Keep fighting the good fight, everyone! I love you all! ❤️ I’ll post a selfie tomorrow!We don't all wanna fuck and masterbate for hours.  It's annoying  trying to enjoy your high or score a bag and dudes just keep trying to fuck you without any provocation. Although i can admire the display of confidence, your lack of ability to read body language and assumptions are quite disturbing. If we are so inclined to do so,  we're also high and lack inhibitions so we'll fucking initiate it. Your obvious manipulation tactics are unnecessary. Especially if you're old, ugly,  or fat or have stim dick, please get a clue.  Stop trying to fuck us. Find a fuck -friendly friend and fuck that. 

That's all for tonight.

Edit : Ok all, granted i havnt had a chance to read all the comments yet but i plan to when ive slept and can trust my own responses. However i am amazed at the different interpretations as well as how many people are offended by a post from a stranger that has nothing to do with any of you!!!  You are fascinating in how you read yourselves into, defend and judge something that had nothing to do with redddit or anyone reading this on a personal level.  You see this?  Hit a nerve possibly?  If the fucking shoe fits, strap that bad boy on.  I have enjoyed immensely the responses and what they tell me about how you feel about yourselves as you defend, justify and attack some words a faceless stranger posted on social media. Wow just wow.  Your responses have nothing to do with me, as many of you defend points im not even making! And the perception of who i am based on you is astounding and far from fact.nevertheless you are adamant about your truth.   Thank you,  even you who are off on your own personal tangents,  for participating. I know you all so much better now! Forgive the typos, my eyes are sleepy.It's about .9 of a gram. I don't care if that's ridiculous or not, I bought a cap,  put a quarter of it in some coffee and I'm high as Jupiter. How the hell are y'all motherfuckers?Hello dear tweaker friends, it is I, Joey the shark tooth. Here are my thoughts on harm reduction. 

I would like to point out that harm reduction is highly personal and individualistic. Meaning that harm reduction for a homeless 120 pound IV 
meth and fentanyl addict is going to look very different than harm reduction for your on-the-weekend-quarter-gram-maximum meth user. 

Personally, I have met many people in recovery and still actively using who tend to push their own practices of harm reduction on to other people, which is counterproductive and which increases the possibility that the recipient of the advice will ignore harm reduction practices overall. (NOTE: I am not singling anyone out or pointing fingers at people on this forum; please don’t take it that way)

For example. Homeless 120 pound IV meth and fentanyl addict (lets call him Joey) is at the drop-in centre using the computers to mess around on his reddit account. He posts on r/meth a story about him slamming a two gram shot of ice from an unknown dealer and getting so high that the world turns purple and his heart beats so hard that it can be heard from 50 feet away. Now some gung-ho, trigger-happy (and maybe a little bit self righteous) “pro-harm-reduction” r/meth user comments an 800-word essay about how Joey should be taking Vitamin-this and supplement-that and getting lots of sleep and good food and that snorting is safer than IVing and smaller amounts are better. You think Joey has got the cash to buy a whole bunch of vitamins? You think Joey has a safe place to sleep for 8 hours a day? You think Joey can access three meals a day full of all your finest fibres, proteins and nutrients? You think that snorting 50mg of meth a day would get Joey anywhere near high enough to satisfy his most gentle of cravings? 

What Joey needs to hear is... did you know there’s a needle exchange over on_______? Did you know that rotating which vein you hit can keep them from collapsing? Did you know that there’s a medication called PrEp that protects against HIV? Did you know that boofing can get you almost as high as IVing? Does Joey have access to mental health support? Is Joey looking to cut down his use or quit? No? Then Joey, to avoid ODing, would you consider doing a tester-shot before slamming that whole two grams, especially when it’s from a new dealer?  

TLDR/Main points
Essentially, the point of this post is to remind my peers on r/meth that harm reduction is not a concrete set of rules applicable to anyone and everyone. Harm reduction practices need to be tailored to suit each and every addict’s situation. Furthermore, harm reduction practices are about increasing awareness and providing information to drug users, not forcing them upon unwilling drug users. So, if you’re going to give someone harm reduction advice, please, PLEASE make sure you’re not just telling them what works for YOU, but things that might work for THEM according to their situation (which you know all about already because of course you took the time to ask the person a question or two before jumping to the conclusion that their life is exactly the same as yours).

https://discord.io/highndry**ISO** and **MSM** are the most commonly used cuts in meth. Meth it cut to create more bulk and to obtain more profits. Drugs have been cut and bulked up since dinosaurs kids, this isn't some conspiracy. This post is not to teach you how to form a proper crackback or anything else. It's simply a reference. Any questions you have have been well documented elsewhere, search...

I want to share some examples of what crackbacks containing each cut look like compared to pure meth. Be aware that 95% of what you get most likely will be cut. This is why when smoking you shouldn't inhale the first couple melts of your product. You want to burn off the cut. Hope this helps...

I’m sure of it. This next hit will be the one that finally satisfies me so I can fucking stopI shouldn't even have to say this, but the following things are not allowed, and will result in an immediate and permanent ban:

* Trying to buy drugs
* Trying to find a new connect
* Roll calls 
* Mentioning your location
* Mentioning you're area code (from the 000 or whatever)
* Arranging any kind of meet up. If you want to do this, take it to private message
* Asking about darknet markets/vendors

All of those things are considered sourcing, and will result in an immediate ban. The following things are also against the rules

* Spreading false info
* Dick pics
* Looking for sexual chats/encounters
* Encouraging harmful or reckless behavior
* Hate speech

I probably left a few off, and if I remember them later I'll add them.Propaganda has shown that meth is a devastating drug that destroys peoples lives. Which for some that it true. When someone over does it they end up doing something stupid in public; thus making the average meth user look like damn idiots. 

Either you do the drug or the drug does you. 

Just to give you an idea of how the stereotypes associated with meth are based on either gullible people who have never used or past addicts who couldn't control their usage and became junkies. 

I get up and go to work 5-6 days a week always on time or 10 min early. I work nights 3 days a week 12 hour shifts and 2-3 days I work days 12 hour shifts. Before work I use, never during, and never when I get off because I need to sleep. I spend time with family and friends, I volunteer for events, I have good credit, a mortgage, car, and a education. Never been in trouble either.

There are many of us like that out there, all around you. You would never know by looking at us as we don't meet the guidelines of the stereotypes society has placed on us.

Do I have negative side effects? Well yeah because we can all agree Meth is poison in our body. 

Unlike Heroin meth does not form a dependency. I quit cold turkey after I use up a 8 ball, for a total of 2 weeks and sometimes just because I can go up to 3 months. 

You may ask “why don’t you get clean and just stop all together?” 

I’m a addict. I don’t want to. I don’t have a excuse,  I like it. That’s all. Nothing else to say. The cons of my life is the constant upkeep of myself, as well as making a purchase or hiding it. I stick to a certain set of rules, that doesn’t mean I won’t get caught. It can happen. I know meth builds a false reality, I know it builds false confidence too. I’ve come to terms on what I am, and what it does.

Just don’t chase the dragon. Once I lose my high, (tolerance builds up) I stop. It’s not easy at all and not everyone can do it. But it’s possible.

I dont know why, but I was lucky enough to hold a full time job and provide for my addiction, thank god I have since then left this horrid existence but goddamn damn I still have a friend who is very dear to me that I just recently had to cut out of my life because of the constant stealing... 18 fucken years of friendship... this is hard for most of you \*us\* but just fucken stop stealing from friends and family, seriously.My life is falling apart. Wife leaving my stupid junkie ass. Kids don't like me. I live in my car. I am employed, just so I can send my wife money. And buy tons of meth. I usually reup when I'm down to a tiner. Been selling to support my habits, at least reduced the expense. I've been smoking out and or giving other down and out people dope. Last thing, or maybe the best thing, you should give a meth addict is more drugs. Fuck it i stopped being an honorable man some years ago. Dignity, ain't heard of it. I invited a girl to get out of the cold in my csr. She charged her phone. I smoked with her and sold her a dub for 4 bucks. Dropped her of where she was squatting. She got my number, haven't heard anything. Don't need to. I hope she felt like someone gave a fuck about her for an hour. Another guy I did the same thing, except he wanted me to be his getaway when he stole something from a business. I left his ass there. i dumped his shit out of my car 3 blocks away. Same road. Stealing is fucking lame. I'm no better really. I still have a lot of hate for theft. And switching. Same kind of people do both. I gave a really slow guy a bowl. He won't get any dumber than he is. It made his day. Was very grateful and thanked me. I think he was happy for a minute . That' goofy bastard smiling made me smile. I am not doing anything to change these peoples lives. When youre invisible, someone being nice to you can really help you feel a little better.. All addicts like free drugs.. Somtimes drugs keep the suicide awayWe’ve been having sex every day and this has never happened until last night.. when he came he went fucking insane, not even joking he started getting rougher and then speaking in some different language I have no idea what it even was. It sounded like he was possessed kind of his voice got real deep and it was like he was speaking in Latin/tongues. I was just a bit freaked out but low key turned on by it. It was like he was a demon though. And when I brought it up with him later he didn’t really remember doing that. Like wtf. Is that a meth thing? He’s been using for for over 20 years and I’m newish to meth so I wouldn’t know. All I know is damn that was some shit. Men do you do this? LolLike the girl smoking on her post can look like a fucking monster and you tweakers would still love it and pm her. Respect.This user has been 110% sober for 4 full days! Let’s see where this goes...Trust me, if you want to get good sleep.
Yesterday did bumps of the Crystal up until 3PM and then decided to ride the waves home. Got really high, full Kundalini awakening. Chills on entire body. beautiful waves... Got home at like 9PM. Soo hungry.

Ate lotsa Pizza & Donuts. Drank some alcoholic drinks.
Laid down and fell asleep immediately.

FINALLY WOKE BEFORE NOON...

actually 8AM.

This is a huge accomplishment for me.

Oh yeah, keep Cannabis close too. ❤️🌞if you've tried adderall, you've basically tried meth. same high, meth just lasts longer and has way nastier side effects! meth feels like peaking on adderall for 4 - 8 hours and then just decreases from there until you are in itchy, dysphoric, hell. don't try it! snort an addy eat some ritalin don't even consider meth this is nowhere near worth it. the urge to redose is so powerful i'm baffled that i haven't yet. all in all it's just adderall on steroids with way more long lasting and severe side effects. i cannot believe my family hasn't noticed. the comedown WILL be terrible even if you EAT AND SLEEP EVERY NIGHT don't let anyone tell you different stay away from this shit especially if you have a steady supply of good ice don't try itHey... Stop being a fucking oddball... Seriously, some of you give the rest of us a bad rep. Like damn we all like the drug but literally no reason to be on the carpet for hours over a spilt crumb. It is possible to tidy up and shower when high. Maybe you should eat something before you start decomposing. Better yet drink alot more, at least any water. You paid good money for the drug, and you gon waste it picking at your face... 😐Just in case some of ya'll forgot. Today is Thursday by the way. I know not all of us have moms or a relationship with them. Hopefully you have someone in your life who is a mother, like a wife/gf or sister or even a mother-like figure like an aunt or grandma that you can still try and make their day a little more special. They're far away but I'll be sure to wish my sisters a happy mother's day at least. Anyways I'm gonna hijack the rest of the post with a long-ass post about my mom because I dunno getting it out could be good, seeing as how holding it in doesn't seem to be helping much.

My Mom: 

.
.
. 

It has been over a year now since her funeral. I'm sorry I haven't come by to visit since then. I wanted to go on the one year anniversary of her passing but I couldn't make it. I'm sure I had an excuse like I couldn't get away from work or something but truthfully, deep down I think I was just avoiding it. I guess I didn't want her to see me now, not like this anyways. Not that I even believe that she's still out there, or is now some ghost hanging around her grave, I just felt her memory deserved better I guess. A stupid thought in retrospect, cause I'm really not too different than I was when she was alive. Wasn't getting too many coffee mugs as gifts that read "World's Greatest Son" if you know what I mean. 

.
.
. 

I remember so vividly the last time I'd seen her. Hell, I don't think I'll ever forget it. I got the call I was hoping would never come and arranged to drive down the next day, though I wish I would have tried to come sooner. Maybe I could have said a real goodbye. By the time I got there you she was in a state of intense confusion and pain. The cancer that had been metastasizing throughout her body and had progressed to her liver only months ago had shut it down entirely bringing on what's called hepatic encephalopathy. Basically it's the toxins in your liver expelling themselves throughout your body, eventually reaching your brain and fucking it up. She laid there moaning in agony, delirious and disoriented from the toxins, unable to speak. I wondered if she could even comprehend what was happening, if she even recognized me in the brief moments her eyes seemed to connect with mine as they darted around the room. Something I'll always wonder any time my mind forces me to relive those moments. 

She would wail in great discomfort while the nurses hit her with more and more morphine. For 48 hours I watched her condition grow continually worse. I could tell the end was near when as her breathing was now big, gasping breaths as she continued to writhe in great discomfort while her body waged war against itself trying to fight to stay alive while shutting itself down at the same time. Not soon enough, but after a couple hours of that, she squirmed in agony as her lungs gasped for air, all for the last time. Fuck I wish they would have just out her out her misery 2 days ago. 

.
.
. 

I was back in my hometown. I always hated coming here. It's a small farmtown, 2000 people. Almost all members of the same culty religion that dominated the area. My brother who still lived here would relay back the gossip and rumors about me he'd hear from time to time. Not that I cared, it was more funny to me than anything. Still it was annoying to see the odd car round the block for a 2nd time just to drive slowly past me again while staring. I don't know if they recognized me still or if it was just the fact I stuck out like a sore thumb around here but its weird as fuck. Fuckin people, man. Should have just drove. 

I walked towards the small cemetery that laid past the woods I played in when I was young. I figured a trip through the nature trail would be nostalgic and give me a bit of time to mentally prepare me to for my visit. A feeling of dread came over me as I stepped into a charred, empty clearing that was once home to these woods. I guess some kids playing with matches or whatever had burned it down. Shit, I played with matches too but never did anything like this. I guess I got lucky. Still, my heart sank to see the place where I could call my home away from home had been reduced to ashes. I was devastated. That was my favorite place in the world to this day even. All I had known as a kid was life was a living nightmare but that was one of the only places I could go and maybe make it feel like I was in a dream, even if for just a bit. The only place I felt like I had something I could maybe call a childhood, the parts of it that couldn't be stolen. But now I feel like it was stolen. Like a part of me was now gone. Only this time I wasn't handing that part of me over. 

Well, fuck. I was angry. I found an area and smoked a bowl or three because I definitely didn't want to do all this sober, especially now. I know, I'm a piece of shit. I'm sorry, Mom. Eventually I made the way to the cemetery. I felt stupid cause I couldn't even find her gravestone for the longest time. Eventually I did though. I kind of hated that she shared one with my stepdad. Guess that might explain why I couldn't remember where it was, not that any of that matters anymore. At least I tell myself that. Sometimes someone asks me if I'm angry at him and I always say no, that I don't let that affect my life. That he had already taken so much from me, and to let him continue to affect my life is just giving him the power to take more. I did believe that at least, but to the degree to which he still affects my life I'm not so sure about. Anyways. 

I sat down in front of the gravestone and stared for a moment, seeing if I could feel something. Mostly all I felt was shame. Shame that this is who I was. I remember in her last remaining living months how I was a broke desperate loser, but like more so than usual. Had recently broken my hand in a fist fight and wasn't working. Calling her up to ask for a bit of money saying I needed groceries only to spend most of it on blow. Didn't even pay it back like I said I would. I like to think I would have, had I had the time. Still, to think probably the last 3 conversations I ever even had with you were just calling you up with lies so I could get high and it makes me sick. Well, Mom, I ain't doing much better these days either. In fact I've taken up crystal meth now. Surprise! Fuck me. 

Inside I felt like I was some woods that was burned down. I didn't want her, or anybody, to see my charred remains, void of any semblance of life, as the fire continued to rage on somehow. I wanted to become a normal, functioning member of society, someone who would make her proud, so I wouldn't feel shame when I visited her. I don't think the stone that marks her grave has that much time even. Best I could do was try and douse the flames for a half hour while I sobbed silently so I wasn't actively on fire when I'd see her at least. 

So now why do I continually set myself on fire every day, ensuring any new growth that managed to spring from my ashy remains is eviscerated from existance? I wish I had the answer. Was I just a dumb kid with an endless matchbook and an inability to learn lessons? Or was burning myself down just easier than nurturing growth? I wish I could say I was afraid of what might grow from me but I know that's not true. I don't know maybe the truth is I'm scared that what I grow into will just be unremarkable or not good enough and I'm just some loser. Right now I feel like a loser, but like a loser with the potential to not be a loser. So why give it the chance? Just say fuck it instead I guess. Would rather question it forever than find out for real I guess. I dunno I do want to be great. I want to want to grow. I want to be something, anything other than this but God dammit, I can't stop playing with fuckin matches.

I wish I loved me enough to mean that.Hello Friends

my place has not been cleaned in a very long time, especially my bed and mattress, and lately I have been noticing that whenever I get a chance to sleep after using, and wake up, when I wake up I seem to have some sores or red spots here and there and I feel the comedown and WD, and in the past this was not the case as much, but now its gotten pretty severe, i believe that during the time I sleep, after smoking the meth, the bed bugs come and bite me and suck my blood thus stealing the meth from my bloodstream and as such leave me in a bad state when I wake up, and the sores are proof of it, also i believe the bugs are breeding in my bed because its becoming worse and worse, I have to smoke a lot more meth than when i first started so i bet every day there are more bugs.

&#x200B;

i need your help to kill the bugs or possibly some way to capture them and extract the stolen meth blood from their bodies but it must be a simple solution

thanks for any helpOkay so I'm a little speechless right now. Was at a buddies house and he and his gf are smoking away and they offer me a hit and I politely decline. I then say "speaking of do y'all mind if I go to the bathroom real quick and do mine?" His gf looks at me and says "why would you go to the bathroom?" I said because I shoot it usually. She begins to straight treat my ass about how much of a scumbag I was or would become and people who slam anything are pretty much worthless junkies and how she's just so sorry that I've been "lost" to that world.... Bitch first of all ITS STILL METH. ROA is different depending on each one I know but at the end of the day... Second of all I'm a paramedic. Not an EMT basic or someone with a certificate I'm a full blown paramedic lol. I'm extremely safe and clean and am ALWAYS courteous about it and don't leave used rigs, bloody alcohol pads etc laying around or in a trash can and always ask before doing it in someone else's home. I'm more health conscious now than I was before I used lol. I just don't get it man. I mean I guess maybe I'm wrong but for fucks sake at least I have manner's and a job... Dumb bitch.Smoking my last bowl as we speak. Gonna finish it, melt my cloudy ass stem and smoke my leftovers. After this Im retiring as a tweaker. I had a good long run and did some crazy shit, but my son needs me to be a good dad. He deserves better than a dope head. Heres to the end of an era. Thanks to all the dope men and the shard junkies for all the memories. Love you all. Peace out guys ✌I always thought I was more of a downers guy when it comes to drugs. My main DOC'S were weed and opiates for years. I of course tried uppers, Adderall, Vyvanse, cocaine and while I enjoyed them for sure, they just didn't  have a pull on me that leads me to seek and use as much as possible for as long as possible like weed and opiates did. I eventually ended up in a nightmare IV heroin addiction that lead me to be willing enough to quit opiates altogether. They just destroyed my life right quick and I was completely powerless over them. I stopped craving them and wanted nothing to do with them. Almost two years clean from opiates but I definitely didn't want to be sober. I needed a replacement drug I could use on the daily to fill the hole. Thats when the meth came into play.

Meth of course has it's infamous reputation. The name alone triggers visions of toothless tweakers burnt out of their mind completely insane. Heroin didn't scare me as much as my preconceived idea of meth. When it comes to drugs I've always been super careful and as responsible as possible for the sake of harm reduction. Meth is an extremely powerful drug not to be taken lightly so I thoroughly did my research before I placed my order on the dark net and waited anxiously to try this new substance. 

My main ROA was insufflation and orally. I did shoot it a few times but didn't like it so no more of that. Never tried smoking it since my research lead me to believe it was harder to manage amount used and was more of a tweaking high. Like I mentioned before, stims weren't my DOC and for some reason I have way more self control while using them as opposed to opiates. I had no problem stopping and sleeping every night, drinking plenty of fluids,eating three meals a day, ect...I even took vitamins to stay healthy and used a neti pot twice a day for my sinuses. So yeah, I was super careful with it but I was still an addict and things could go bad if I wasn't on top of my shit, but no one was more surprised than me when it wasn't causing any problems for me or depleting my bank account, ruining relationships, ect...

In short I truly feel like meth made me a better human being. Of course the dopamine release gets you happy, motivated and generally feeling good but thats not all. It got me to care about people, life, goals. The improved sociability got me out of my shell and comfortable in my own skin for once. I got promoted at my job, made new friends, was able to still build my savings despite what I was spending on meth, fell in love, pay my bills and just excel in life where I just couldn't while sober. Make no mistake I still had to hide my use since I was living with my father and both my parents are very aware of my drug problems so hiding it and maintaining the illusion of being sober took some devious work to maintain.

In one stretch of about ten months I used every single day without any breaks. Always replenished my stash when it got low without issue. Even after I build a tolerance from daily use and required more, it never lost its magic and was still financially sustainable. A true testament to whats possible with proper self care and responsible using. Who could've known that meth was the solution for me this whole time instead of opiates and weed? Not me thats for sure.So most of you know that yesterday my cat licked some meth dust i had left on a book and got really high . So just today i kinda forgot i had a line left out on that book, luckily i was there to stop him from getting it cus his ass was sneaking up on it trying to do my dope. So i did the line and moved the book . So since hes fucking hip to it that book is his new favorite thing in the whole world . He is constantly laying on it no matter where im the room i put it . He's trying to return to that book so he can feel that way again and i feel like i ruined my cats life .. 

So I took my buddy to pluggos and both of us scored our bags…. 

We Get home, get to twirlin, and after two or three pufffs, this fuckin nerd takes a couple lil shards (idk like .2 or 3) and sprinkles em all in the carpet, underneath the table we were at…. Giving it to the house (Because it deserves it) 

Heartbroken seeing this I ask him like “wtf you doin? You just threw out a whole pipe!”


Tell me why the FUCK this man goes: “I’ll be down there any way, at least I’ll have something to find when I run out”


I literally shit a lil I was laughing so hard …Holy shit its a night and day difference!!  No more panic attacks, nasuea, depression......should have started doing this years ago.I miss my small time home cook hookup , back in NC before I moved. I'm 35, and I county myself lucky that, unlike mos t people my age, and especially those younger I've actually done good meth. Comparing quality of this stuff (mexican shit) is pointless, The dude in Florida is using the same dope the dude in oregon is, and everybody is like "naww, dawg, this shit is fire" no its not. Its cartel garbage. Fuck what the police and the news say , "its 95% pure" kiss my fucking ass. We had that same shit in NC too, and that is why people like my small hookup did what he did, so that way, friends and family that used, could actually get a good bag of dope every now and then.

The fucking news paints a picture of shake n bakers and home cooks being these fucking wacked out nutjubs peddling bad quality toxic meth, and a generation of users who have never had good dope believe that shit. Talking about how nice there crystals look, who fucking cares how it looks its garbage. People say snorthing meth doesn't give you euphoria..not true, snorting mexican garbage meth doesn't give you euphoria. I've had dope so good that what most would call key bump could get you lifted..and it was ugly as fuck, not even shards, just a crystaline powder.

Sitting at my plugs house while everyone there using is acting gakked out, and I get it, they literally don't fucking know any better. They would cry if they ever did good shit and then had to settle for this.

Fuck those dirty ass mexicans flooding this country with their weak, dirty ass garbage.I know I do. My life has been wrecked by this drug. I will never forget the euphoria and hypersexual feelings this drug brought me. I crave it constantly and even though I am 40 days sober and in Rehab across the state, I still crave this stuff intensely. If I could have my way, I'd live in a dilapidated hotel room and smoke meth ill say everyday. Hell I could be homeless living in the streets or the country with a tent, and Id be okay with it, as long as I have Meth. I regret trying this drug. I know it will haunt me for years to come. This shit is notoriously difficult to quit. Here I am, 3 treatment centers later, 1 less $1k laptop, 1 less $700 bike later, and a whole bunch of family problems later..Here I am. Addicted. Aching for this drug. Stuck thousands of miles away from home. Thus hurts. It hurts a lot. I am so torn up in this nightmare.Best thing I ever did was walk away 20 years ago and never looked back100% Stop using- No cheating or trying to melt down stims or lick bags  


1) Eat Soup and Bananas for a day or two, then eat what you crave

2) Drink Body Armor, Gatorade, Powerade- Whatever YOU MUST DRINK WATER- Shoot for half your body weight in oz's per day for a bit

3) Supplements for the first 5 days- Take a Multi-Vitamin, High dose of vitamin C and NAC to help flush toxins faster, Tyrosine, Magnesium, ALC, ALA. Those pills marketed for after a Rave have alot of what you need. 

4) Sleep- Small dose of benzo is ok, melatonin, Advil PM- Shower before bed- limit electronic devices, music, whatever helps you sleep. Don't jack off all night. 

5) Cravings- NAC and CBD- straight CBD flower if you got it. I like pre-rolls. Plain Jane makes some that look like a cigerettle, they are awesome for craving. 

6) Keep busy, idle minds and hands will keep you wanting more- DO SOMETHING!

7) DON'T USE AGAIN DURING RECOVERY! (Or ever if you want your life back)

Goodluck ya'll <3Hey guys, Satan here with some good advice and shit like that. (P.S., fuck The Cowboys and brush your teeth). 

Now, to set things off on a more serious note, nothing threw me around and caused more pain in my life than my crippling addiction to methamphetamine. 
The amount of pain and misery I experienced in active addiction haunts me every day.

Constantly I'm reminded of the detriments I put my body and brain through; scars number my hands, legs, face, and arms. 

Although underdeveloped, a seasoned user could spot my strawberry fields from a mile away. 

But there's also something different that's there now that wasn't there before: happiness.

*IF YOU'VE BEEN CONTEMPLATING QUITTING, TAKE THIS MESSAGE AS A SIGN TO JUST FUCKING DO IT*

So, you want to quit meth. Welcome! So do a lot of people. Trial and error is how I figured my stuff out, so keep in mind I wrote this with subjectivity riddled throughout. What aids me may not be helpful to you at all.

Step 1: Get Rid of Your Stash (ALL OF IT)

"I'm just gonna finish this bag..."

"I'm going to titrate down and use less until I can cold turkey..."

"If I use less than a quarter gram a day, I can continue using and avoid neurotoxicity."

Here's some bullshit I've told myself before when eyeing the formidable opponent of addiction. The amount of mind manipulation one is able to accomplish and not even realize with this drug is abhorrent. 

Getting rid of all my pipes, meth, rigs, whatever the hell it may be, was the first essential move I made.

When you do this, make sure you cannot retrieve it. Avoid flushing anything down a toilet. Dont have a non user do this for you. You are strong enough.

YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH. 

Step 2: Remove Contacts and Connections

This one might be the hardest of them all. At the end of the day, one of the biggest variables that kept me on the glass dick was my relationships I'd set up around the substance and using it, religiously. 

This doesn't mean anyone you've ever done meth with ever at all is gone. Would this be ideal? Yes. But here's the thing: if you dont want to stay clean, like really want to be fucking sober, then you wont.

This step is unfortunately pretty damn essential though. Anyway to make things easier, do it.

Step 3: Prepare to Crash and Burn *(Withdrawals)*

Physically, meth isn't dangerous to withdraw from. It's also not as difficult as drugs such as opiates or benzodiazepines to wean off of. But-- it is still quite uncomfortable.

Severity and length is determined by many factors, but most importantly purity of product, amount, and ROA's used come to mind.

If you are an IV user, expect to have the roughest time. Those who boof and smoke are not far behind.

My personal favorite ROA was IV, so I jumped off the very top of the mountain in terms of adverse side effects.

You may experience any / or all of these symptoms, to one degree or another. There will also be symptoms likely pertaining only to your individual physiology and psychology. 

Some symptoms from methamphetamine abuse may be permanent.

Be prepared for them.

-Anxiety (can lead to both anxiety attacks and panic attacks, mania, intrusive thoughts, paranoid delusions)

The amount of anxiety you experience will fluctuate; being agoraphobic and staying inside will not help your anxiety levels. Being outside and getting sufficient vitamin-D levels is a huge deal. 
Go on walks frequently. Sometimes, you just have to *walk it out.*

The first few times I tried to cold turkey, I experienced the most brutal, episodic panic attacks I've ever had in my entire life. In fact, heroin withdrawal was almost equivalent compared to how unfathomably aggressive these panic attacks were.
This last time I quit, I never experienced them.

I would fall asleep for around an hour or so, wake up, not even ten seconds into being conscious, panic attack ensues. Sleep was my only saving grace, oh and cannabis. But I'll speak on comfort drugs later. 

*How do I overcome meth withdrawal induced panic attacks?*

This answer is not an easy one. Beyond taking care of yourself and frequent showers, there's nothing you can do but grin and bear that shit. Its absolutely unbearable, but keeping the mind active and engaged is essential for fighting these WD's.

- Brain Zaps and Other Electrifyingly Bad Sensations 

I haven't personally experienced brain zaps as bad as some have, but they are a curious sensation, tinged with something shockingly vile. These aren't dangerous, and do go away after a couple months.

[Lightning Through Your Bones / Veins]

This symptom I suffered from badly. It goes along with anxiety as well, but this thing is a whole 'nother beast, man. Just such a shitty feeling. Makes you want to unzip your skin, right?

Yep. By day 5 or 6 it should certainly be manageable, if not completely nonexistent. There is fucking hope. Keep fighting. 

- Fatigue and Lethargy

Just when you're trying to get your Life back together, that one silly cunt Fatigue comes in the picture and laughs as you try to rise from the bed. 

"I was supposed to roll out of bed and get myself a job this morning..." You tell yourself. 

Not quite, Tiger. You've been clean for a fucking day. Baby steps. 

Around days 6 and 7, looking for employment if you dont currently possess it is huge. I'm embarrassed but readily admit I'm still working on this one. Fuck logistics, sometimes. Anyway.

-- Poor Vision / Grainy Vision

Methamphetamine affects the eyes, one of these being a physiological telltale sign of amphetamine intoxication: dilated pupils. Now, cocaine and psychedelics also do this, but if someone's gakking out with big pupils, no surprise what they're doing.

Meth. Nice guess. No, if you're scrolling through this I'm not recommending you do meth about your bloody fucking meth problem. Nice try, though.

*You might feel hungover* and have day-after beer goggles, or at least what feels like that. It's hard to describe the visual distortions, but you'll notice them.

--Intense Drug Cravings (stim specific)

Your cravings for meth will be extremely intense until about a month or so into it. For me, it becomes manageable then, but I still struggle. My coping mechanisms come into play big time around this time period.

Most symptoms abate by day 9. Some users may experience PAWS, or Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. Symptoms that are short-lived for some are exponentially longer for others. They may experience withdrawal symptoms for months on end.

This is an extremely difficult experience. Addiction therapy is highly recommended for individuals under this umbrella...

...which leads into probably your favorite part, 'cause it'd probably be mine...

*--Comfort Drugs*

Cannabis:

My number one comfort drug to expel withdrawal symptoms is cannabis. It works for almost everything, and is conducive to recovery. Appetite stimulation, euphoria, comfort, and a mental break are all offered by this plant. 

It's not physically addictive and is easy to discontinue. 

Kratom: 

Such a huge blessing to be able to have good access to quality kratom here in Utah, after Gov. Herbert signed a quality act into law. Instead of taking benzos and opiates to handle the physical symptoms, get some *MIT 45* extract. 
One shot of this stuff is wonderfully potent and should do you most of the day with pleasant opiate and stimulant-like effects present. 

Alcohol:

Be careful with this one, but alcohol can be a huge blessing when things become unbearable. Sometimes, like Willie said: *Whisky river, take my mind*

*NOTHING WILL WORK IF YOU INTERNALLY DON'T REALLY WANT IT*

Love you guys, peace and love. Quitting is a big deal, and it's an awesome thing to see. Keep it in gear, ladies and gentlemen. Much love :DDDDUnclench your jaw...

Go drink some water...

Get some sleep...


.
.
.


And everyone is definitely plotting against you. 

Wait—whoah, did you hear that?!I mean Jesus Christ, in no other subreddit have I come across the words "panic", "freaking out", "shadow people", "paranoia", "racing heart", "no sleep", "tweaking", "glitching" so frequently.

Talking about being awake for days and then crashing.

Meth sounds fucking awful. True I've never tried meth, so really I can't judge, but from scrolling through this subreddit I really fucking don't want to try meth, ever. In fact before I stumbled across this subreddit yeah I might've been curious but not anymore, hell nah.

So why do you guys do meth? I have read it gives mad euphoria, so I guess that's something20m. 

As a person who had been abusing fentanyl and meth for years, I can say being 100% honest is the only way you will recover. You have already started by browsing on here looking for perspective. 
Everyone uses for different reasons, just get real with yourself. Start questioning your actions and intentions. You must understand what influences your choices. Is it your environment?  An escape from reality? Is it the need for attention?
Once you have found the variable, you can take control of it. 

 I  overdosed after smoking too much fentanyl, in an alley. A fellow homeless man walking by seen my body in the street, pale and life less. Thankfully, he went to get help. The Man gave me back my life.

After the incident. I wanted to get off the streets.  So i started taking action, Step by step. As I progressed on, I developed a sense of direction. With that sense of direction, came purpose. 

At the end of the day you make the decisions, ONLY YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF.

I CAN IMAGINE A FUTUREWow what a fuckin year. Thank you everyone on this sub for walkin Me thru my first and last year on meth. I can't believe I'm alive,  got about 3 weeks now shits still foggy , life still sucks,  damage was done,  but I'm still kickin.  I deleted all my videos,  sry I hope some got to enjoy the show . Got a grant to go back to school , ready to move forward.  I'll never forget this sub,  what a welcome to reddit .
All you noobs buckle the fucj up lolSo I’ve been smoking daily for over 3 months. In just those 3 months I got beat so bad I had to go to the ER twice, got possessed, bf and I almost got arrested 3 times for fighting and nearly killing each other, stole $45k from my dad which he made a police report on me for, and I’ve been having a long period of confusion like.. is this even real life? Am I actually dead and this is my 2nd chance? I’ve been having so many spiritual signs.. from God himself and maybe some from the devil. But God sometimes goes into my bf’s body and speaks to me. And he can read my mind like he knows things I never told nobody. I ran away from him and now I don’t know who to turn to or trust. Help me! I feel like I’m stuck in some kind of nightmare worldHas anyone else stopped drinking when they started smoking?  I was a raging alcoholic for years but my cravings for alcohol disappeared completely when I started smoking regularly.  I didn't consciously decide to stop drinking, it was just a cool side effect and now I'm almost a year without a sip.   Unfortunately, I can't tell my family what I replaced the vodka with, but hey, what they don't know won't kill em.I snort my shit and I’m not going to lie masks are the best thing ever because I never have to worry about it I have any white around my nose. Anyone feel the same way? 🤣  I'm the night time security for our chickens, I recognize the "something is up" clucks and everything. I've only ever had to defend against dogs but lately there's been a possum stealing eggs and harassing the hens. We've met a few times and I've always just chased him off but after the last time, I realized he wasn't gonna stay away & I was gonna have to take measures.

  I heard some feather rustling a little after 3, figured it was nothing but a voice told me "nah man, go out there" so I grabbed my spotlight and an old backpack and went to investigate. Sure enough, there he was, beady little glowing eyes peeking out from under the coop. After crawling around in the dirt playing hide and seek for a couple mins, I managed to flush him out. He made a dash for the fence but in his panic, he couldn't find the spot without netting at the top so he dropped to the ground and backed into the corner. Idk if you've ever seen a cornered possum but those fuckers put on a pretty good defensive display and have some scary lookin teeth to back it up. But I grabbed his ass and managed to get him in the bag without getting myself bitten. Or hurting him.

  So now I've got a possum in a backpack hanging in my room (with air holes so he doesn't suffocate) waiting for tomorrow to be relocated.

  No point to this story really, Im just fucking psyched and needed to tell someone lolI happened to get my head clean for 3 solid days, not by choice. But it woke me up. My kids and I deserve better. I'm fortunate enough that my parents offerd to send me to a 10 day aversion therapy program.  
Fuck.  I hope it works


Wish me luck. 

Making the call now,  they'll probably ship me out tomorrow. 

Ffffuuck😭

*If there is any informative research not already posted, please feel free to DM me, and I’ll see to it’s validity\~*I thought my own family was planning to trick me and send me to a psych ward to stay there forever. I used to eavesdrop and hear things and I would swear everything would be about me. It is the scariest fucking thing. I live my life now constantly pushing people away and starting intense arguments. I thought it was my family but once I started having black out arguments with everyone I knew something changed with me. I don't know what happened but I hate things now. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Legitimately crazy. But I feel completely fine. I've recovered and haven't smoked that nasty glass shit in almost 6 months but I remember the 6 days of no sleep and then having these delusions and watching stuff move off the wall and seeing things. It wasn't pleasant. I'm thankful to be off that garbage. I want to know if anything I said is relatable for someone who abused crystal for a couple weeks then stopped. Also someone who is hypersensitive to stimulants.

I can stay with my family and have my own room still but because of all the fighting I am always just outside wandering. So no, I am not homeless.Reddit admins are deleting subreddits like /r/drugstashes left and right for allowing pictures of their drugs. So in order to prevent our subreddit from getting permanently deleted we are no longer allowing people to post pictures of shard until the heat dies down. This is the second time I have had to make this announcement. Going forward posting shard pics will get you permanently banned from this subreddit. End of discussion. 

If the shard pics don't stop after this, we will have to completely disable posting of pictures and videos entirely. That means no more cloud vids or any of the content we all love to see. So please guys, knock it off for the sake of our subreddit.Over the last 3 months, every once in a while turned into every weekend, and that ended up being going home on lunch break to hit the oil burner. So, after almost getting fired today for being gone on lunch for 55 minutes instead of the usual 30, I'm flushing the stash baby. Bout 3 gs worth. Here's to sticking to boring ass weed and alcohol so I don't become homeless. cheers 🍻High & Dry is a 18+, mature, all-encompassing community for drug enthusiasts to socialize with like minded peeps, while offering judgement-free harm reduction. If interested in joining, click [here](https://discord.io/highndry) and if you have any question, feel free to ask below.So im currently writing a book to help those that use take better care of themselves and hopefully use safer. 

This book is going to be different and here’s how: For one it’s not going to guilt trip you about your use nor explain why meth is so bad for you like other books do. It’s pure intent is to make sure you’re safe while using, it will also provide tips on how to “hide” your usage or better take care of yourself. It will also have hydration reminder games, coloring pages and empty spots to just write whatever you want. This is not your normal self help book.

As a user myself with a full time career, house, and car and money I have a set of rules that I want to share with everyone and how I’ve done this on and off for so long. Hopefully it will help those in need not become homeless or hurt themselves. I will be making the book free for those who truly need it of course. 

Now I would like to note I am not a doctor or a professional this will simply be a all in one guide so you won’t have to tweak on your phone all day looking for advice on how to take care of your skin, or eat or sleep while using. 

Also NOTE: we’ve all been delt different cards in life. This book is not a 100% certain things mentioned in it may not be possible for you. I will do my best to post different solutions for all walks of life though. This is why there will be a space for you to write down your tips as well. 

YOU ARE HUMAN and should be treated like that no matter your background or use. Hopefully it will help you.

Stay tuned once finished I will post it here and other Reddit areas.You guys are tweaked out of your mindsRailed a line before work in the break room, thought it would be a high IQ move for productivity. The AC at my job is fucking broken and I already have an issue with the ice sweats making me look delusional as fuck. So the disgusting degeneracy aesthetic that I try to hide came out to play. I’m a man with long hair tied up, already a fucking red flag, I’m greasy and a waterfall of sweat is coming out of me so intensely, I feel as if I am being reborn again. However not in a good way, because I never asked to be fucking born at all in the first place. I’m drenching my clothes, I get waves of fresh air through walking around the store, going into sections of the store with fans, small glimpses from the freedom of hell that is my temperature. In my cold bliss, I suddenly smell that foul treacherous stench. Panic consumes my entire aura, they’re all going to smell it on me, I’m drenched, my hair all frizzy, I look like the physical embodiment of insanity. 

My manager walks towards me across the aisle, I walk towards this cuck aswell, I accept my fate. I will reign down on this coward with my bare hands, for his uniform doesn’t protect him from mortality, I lock eyes, I devour his soul with my gaze. 


Manager: hey bro you’re good to go on your lunch 

Me: oh 

I proceed to go to the freezer where the drinks are at and cool off for about 3 minutes, then I go to the bathroom to rail another line. I shan’t be foolish and leave my scent of Ammonia in the break room.Seems to me that a lot of people let mania take over, and reality slip away. Just a friendly reminder that everyone’s allowed to have their own opinion. And just because you feel a certain way isn’t a reason to react. 

This is an 18+ thread. So rather than acting like children let’s act our age. Not our shoe size. Take accountability for your actions otherwise you’ll end up sad, alone, and “modding” a discord at 5 AM🤣

Hope everyone’s having a good night. Stay safe and drink some water. Also take a fucking T break LOL✌️And In betweens. 🤣

So about three weeks ago I gave away my pipes and chucked my syringes. I pulled down the sheets from my windows and opened up all my windows in my house.

Stopping was easy because I don’t get physical cravings for gear, I think I just did it a lot because I wasn’t working any had the time and no responsibility lol.

Anyway now I’ve got two job interviews lined up and feeling good and sorta inspired to buy new furniture now I’m not spending all my money on gear.

How is everyone else doing? I thought I’d drop in and say hi. Just checking in with my fellow fam. XThe slowest thing on earth,
is a tweaker in a hurry.In my “travels”with doing Speed for the last year now, I’ve sort of noticed that there’s two kinds of people do sell/do it:

The hyper-paranoid, perpetually impatient, on-edge weirdos, so have NO chill about it, and are always in “a state” of worry or concern about either getting caught, or not getting paid for it. The ones everyone hates dealing/doing it with, because they’re always on edge. Hate those ones.

The people who are chill, calm & “laid back” about it are the best. The dealers or fellow users who just take it easy, and *don’t* look at doing/dealing Speed as this epic, secretive “cloak & dagger” operation. The ones you can just get Fucked up with, or dole out cash to, and not have to worry about them freaking out if you look in a slightly opposite direction from them.
______________________________________________________________________

Be chill. Don’t be a paranoid freakazoid.Not even talking about the comedown. Binging becomes weird pretty quick, I'd say after like 12 hours. At that point it's still fun and I have the desire to continue, but I start to have this feeling like my whole body is out of wack (which is true lol) and it bothers me. And you stay high for so long that you don't even really notice it anymore unless you JUST redosed. I swear this drug makes you behave really fucking weird. We are all fortunate that 99% of folks don't know the signs that indicate when someone is super spun, because if you know what to look for, it's sooooo fucking easy to tell. There's this guy at work that is pretty high up in the hierarchy and he is zooted as fuck all the time but literally no one noticed even while he's speaking excessively about simple concepts, sniffing every 3-4 seconds, never staying completely still and has that crazy look you get in your eyes when your brain circuits are turned up to 11. I think it's because he's like that everyday and no one is thinking that this dude is a daily meth user. Shit no one would ever think I do it either. I'm sure he's noticed me too but we never talked about it hahaha.

Sorry for rambling about nothing. Have a good night and stay hydrated friends!The problem with meth is it feels so damn good that I want to share that feeling with my boyfriend…

…but do I really want to introduce him to something so insidious?? Or do I keep excusing myself for a couple of minutes to sneak into the bathroom and slam just as we are getting caught up in the moment and sex is imminent? I don’t think I have a choice, I can’t risk getting him hooked and I don’t want to lose him because he doesn’t want to be with someone who slams meth. 

Tina is a jealous bitch and loneliness is the price she charges for the high she gives.Just a vent.  
Goddamn! Is escaping the sweaty, horny pervy  tweakers impossible?   Joined a snap group in hopes of just chillin, blowing clouds and meeting homies from around the world without having rando dicks and sex acts come across.  Now don’t get me wrong, i love sex as much as the next mf, but why the hell do so many think that its cool to just drop your cock, or your last fuck sesh into a group where its pretty well known were not tryin to get down like that?  Almost thinkin bout starting my  own thing where people can come chill, get lit, bullshit and just kick it without having to remind everyone to keep their fuckin pants on.In my opinion, as far as hard drugs go, meth is underrated and over stereotyped. I’m a fully functional heavy smoker(with an unwanted 9 month break in between) and live a perfectly normal life. I’m a full blown drug addict, no denying that. I have a steady job, support a family of 6 on my own, house/car/wife, etc.. It’s the easiest drug to be a fully functioning addict on.

I sleep every day for 5-6 hours, eat regularly, 6’ 215lbs. No skin issues. No teeth issues. Meth gives me the extra boost I need to get through the day, come home and run the kids around to their sports, do yard work, and whatever fatherly duties required.. Without meth I lack the energy to do what is required to support 6 people. I’m tired and irritable, and I feel like I’m not as good of a father without it. Yes, I understand saying being a meth addict dad is great doesn’t sound right and it’s not for everyone. I’m still a drug addict and recognize that. 

But as long as you take care of yourself and understand your limitations it can do some good things. I purposely avoid other users and avoid the scene at all costs. Tweakers in a group are a mess and attract the law like no other. Meth and heroin addicts go hand in hand it’s inevitable you will go to jail. EAT AND SLEEP. Take vitamins if needed. Take care of your mouth. Don’t run errands with your dealer at 3am in his 94 Civic with expired plates. Don’t go to the tweaker den, you aren’t missing anything.

Many years ago I was a pull addict and always a slave to the next fix. Physical withdrawals lost me jobs and I was always in that half alive state. Pulling a 9-5 and a normal life doing blow all day is harder on the body in my experience.So I went carpet surfing because I'm 10/10 fucking desperate. To my absolute surprise after searching for around an hour, I found 4 or 5 tiny crystals. They were at least big enough to crush and get me high.

So when the morning came (wasn't easy to wait) I start crushin them up before work. I notice they're crushing weird. Not crushing into a powder-like substance like ice normally does. 

I start cutting the lines. Shit looks funky... So I taste it. It's salt. It's all fucking salt. I'm so fucking done with everything rn. I need an ice cream man so bad bro

edit: typoAlready feeling like my old self. Sure the drug dreams are a bit annoying and disturbing but I love being cleaned up. I don't ever want to go back to my dark days of using. I am begging to realize how destructive and malevolent this drug is. Take care y'all.Hello! I see a lot of reminders to stay hydrated on this sub, and I very much welcome them. The more, the better. I know that eating meals regularly is sort of implied, and so reminders to do so might be redundant. However, I just wanted to paint y’all a picture of the positives that come from staying fed.

Today I was having a great time for three or four hours, and it quickly turned into a bad time. Overamps for me are usually marked by what I identify as traditional cardiac arrest symptoms, but this was different. I was overheated and felt like passing out. I managed to order some Chinese food from the place down the block, March over there, and pick it up. Within ten minutes of scarfing it my mind became far more clear and sharp . The fog in my brain was burned away by pork dumplings and sautéed green veggies. Not the healthiest thing, I know, but it was the easiest at the moment. Usually I would cook myself something if I feel up to it, and the ritual of cooking is therapeutic for me. Anyway,

I urge you, if you begin to feel the darkness closing in, think back to the last thing you ate. For me it was one banana, eight hours before. If you haven’t eaten in eight hours, please make it your priority. We are still humans and we have to do all the human stuff to stay alive. And we need you alive. Thanks for reading! I like you.My boyfriend has been a meth addict since he was 16 & has been to rehab twice, the most recent he got out of a couple months ago. So he'd been  " sober " (our definition of sober is weed & psychedelics. nothing else).

that is, until he got on facetime with his friend & decided he wanted to go back to his homestate/town which is overrun with amphetamine addicts and people who want to kill him. he goes to pick up this tweaker 4 hours away and I go with him to make sure he doesn't do or buy any meth. I know this is a terrible idea, placing my boyfriend back in the same environment with the same people, and I know just as well as you how this is gonna turn out.
we manage to make it there and back home without any meth talk. we chill for a bit and hang out, i go to take a shower. 

the second i come out of the shower, boyfriend comes up and tells me he just smoked meth for first time since rehab. he's high as shit and mixing a drink w more meth in it. we have a conversation about my fears and the fact that relapse is imminent, and i reassure him that he can still get back on track.

but this friend, this fucking tweak wont leave my boyfriends apartment and for the next three days theyre on a meth, heroin, and xanax bender doing all sorts of dumb shit, talking about drones in the sky. once i realize this isn't going to get better, I destroyed all of their glass, flushed 90% of their drugs (left some for his friend who would need to taper) and told my boyfriends friend he could go sleep on the street or i would drive him to any rehab within a 5 hour drive. 
so. hundreds of miles on my car later, we drop the kid back off in a fucking walmart parking lot where hes clearly just meeting someone to get high.  my boyfriend is coming down, everything is miserable and we fight relentlessly. i know he feels horrible, and so do I. I feel empty. 

the problem is I'm a high functioning drug addict, though I have never been to treatment regarding my addictions. cocaine is my drug of choice, and ive spent thousands in the past year alone. it has taken so much from me already, I am scared at how much darker and deeper this pit can grow. and now that I have someone relying on me to help them in their sobriety, i am  more aware of my bad actions and bad influence. The guilt is overwhelming. Like I'm hindering him more than helping him i don't know. If I hadn't had a working car , he would have never gone to pick up his friend and never relapsed. 

i dont know why im writing this. i guess im just looking for other stories and experiences of people who are in a relationship with someone addicted to stimulants, or where both partners are. I can stop, I can throw away all my paraphernalia and delete all the dealers numbers. I want to be sober so badly both for the health of myself and my boyfriend and our future, but I just don't know if it's possible. i feel as though I've had an epiphany, like no one is talking about the fact the all these midwest kids have nothing better to do than sit around and smoke dope all day and its horrifying. I just want my boyfriend to be comfortable in his own skin, I want to show him how loved and supported and admired he is. But it seems like no matter what I do or say, all that we've built can fall apart with one hit off the pipe, and I can never conquer that. I dont know if he can either. 
thank you for listening. its a giant relief to have the input of others, i have no one i can talk to about any of thisWether or not you guys are aware we are monitored by Reddit. If we break TOS they can easily delete the thread meaning that our one sub that’s actually modded actively, will be no more.

Trust me if I could make a guide explaining where to find what you’re looking for, I would. I genuinely enjoy helping out, and making things easier.. you guys gotta work with me. If you’re unsure of something PLEASE read the rule page, or messages someone on the mod team and I guarantee you’ll get an answer. Getting mad, and telling me to fuck off won’t change my mind, or help your case. Simply trying to keep this community alive, and dick pic free.

Warped~Don't start telling me how you're affiliated with the Hells Angels. Don't start acting like you're a career criminal. Don't tell me how you used to cook or that you have a friend who cooks. Don't tell me that you used to deal or that you can get weight. Don't show me your porn or anybody else's for that matter. Don't pretend like you're somebody that you're not. Everyone claims the same bullshit as soon as they get high and I don't understand it.When other people with habitual vices or straight up addictions look down on my little power crystals because it’s the devils dick mixed with battery acid and pure evil or some shit. Like for as tame and as functional this drug is I should not have bathroom coke sniffers, people who pop mdma every other day, bartards, adderall kids, and especially the fenthead nod squad look down at me with disgust and pity. The stigma is honestly so real, literally crack hysteria all over again. For example, a girl I know who does coke every week said she would literally cry if she saw a shard in real life. I mean it’s funny in a stupid way but that’s literally the stigma you get unless you decide to spend an hour lecturing someone with medical journal articles from the 50s or shifting through other nuanced articles of meth that don’t have it as literal Satan sucking your soul through your dick as you cum. No one even knows I’m on unless I tell them directly because functional meth users aren’t supposed to exist apparently. Literally people have said heroin addiction is more functional than a meth addiction, when like a sizeable chunk of the working class treat it as their coffee(including me). I just wanted to vent, it gets frustrating after a whileI would never have sex with a man when I'm sober, but when i'm on meth I let a guy fuck me and I kind of enjoyed it. I have a really high sex drive naturally but I would never kiss a guy let alone let one fuck me. 

I let him fuck me while I jerked off to straight porn and I just pretended I was a girl (I know, weird right?)I feel my little cat feels unloved because I'm so busy or fucked up.
So we just came up with a rule.
She needs 100 Pat's a day.
I just did 10 strokes down her back, now 90 left.
10 sets of 9.
And please dont make sexual pussy jokes.
This shit is seriouse.
A sad cat.
That's hurting.
I love u little cat. I'm sorry. I'll do betterI knew I was pretty apathetic, but holy shit it's actually a lot worse than I thought. My apathy is normally pretty comfortable for me, can't feel anything, can't complain, right? But everytime I smoke a bowl or two it puts me in a good mood. And then I even feel like I'm able to be affectionate with people. Intimately, or even just complimenting people because I feel like they deserve it. Couldn't sleep last night, didn't have anyone to talk to, just stayed up thinking really pleasant things about my best friend, how cool he is, how I hope he's doing alright rn, how he deserves really good things in life, nice things I can do for him, etc. *Sober me could never.* Sober me doesn't care enough to say positive shit, and when I do it feels forced, like I'm only doing it out of obligation. When people are nice to me while sober, I don't feel anything, it also doesn't change how I feel towards the nice person. When people are nice to me while spun, it actually makes me feel happy, I genuinely appreciate it, and depending on what it is I might even feel a little bit of a bond or some kind of connection between me and the nice person.     1) Hi everyone I typed this all out yesterday on my phone, and as I scrolled to the top to do a quick over-view. The entire page swiped off and reddit decided to not add an auto-save feature,  and well.. I lost like 4 hours worth of work... However here goes take two I reckon, So I wanted to cover just some of the basic vitamins and supplements that protect your brain, cardiovascular system, and other organs from meth use. 

     2) Many users of methamphetamine are actually very health conscious people, which is a huge misconception. We work jobs, have families, and regularly visit the dentist, just because we use meth does not mean we throw everything away and get high 24/7. This guide will be more for beginners but if anyone has any supplements that work for them, please feel free to comment them below. 

    3) What sparked my interest in supplementation actually happened about 4 days ago. I had some vitamins laying around that I hadn’t paid any attention to, and began taking them every night before bed. The differences in how I feel, and how my body feels was actually quite noticeable especially by day 3. 

     
  - BRAIN:  ( To begin this guide id like to start with the brain, as it takes quite a bit of damage from daily meth use. Even occasional users risk some damage, depending upon there dosage. )

1)  Methamphetamine can cause neurotoxicity         With single large dose (100 mg/kg, s.c.) of methamphetamine.  (MA) is known to exert neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons. 

  -  Multiple administrations of high doses of methamphetamine to rats cause long-term depression of both dopamine and serotonin synthesis. Coadministration of the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, antagonizes this effect of methamphetamine on both neurotransmitter systems. 

    2)  However many other factors play a role in the neurotoxic effects other than just dosage. Things like sleep deprivation, malnutrition, and dehydration can also play a big role in your mental health overall. 

(  -  Keeping a semi-solid sleep schedule, food alarms to remind you to eat as well as drink water, is crucial for daily-use. I know it’s easy to forget to do these things, as well as you don’t “feel” hungry or at times thirsty. However your body is working 2-4x faster than what it Normally would be so try to create good habits. )
 
                Supplements For Brain Care-

1) L-Tyrosine- A supplement typically used to improve alertness, attention, and focus. This supplement produces important brain chemicals that help nerve cells communicate and may even regulate mood.

- Meth directly affects Adrenaline and noradrenaline, as well as  dopamine by flooding the brain with large amounts when you Supplementing with Tyrosine is thought to increase levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine, adrenaline and norepinephrine. L-Tyrosine is also believed to regulate Melanin, as well as thyroid hormones.

2) Fish Oil- Fish Oil supplements are a rich source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), two types of omega 3 fatty acids. 

- DHA plays a vital role, in maintaining the structure of your brain. In fact, it accounts for around 25% of the total fat, and 90% of the omega-3 fat, found in your brain cells 

- The other omega-3 fatty acid in fish oil, EPA, has anti inflammatory effects that may protect the brain against damage and aging. 

HEART- Fish oil is also a very important supplement for heart health, so I went ahead and included it now. 

-Findings show omega-3 fatty acids may help to: 

-Lower blood pressure
-Reduce triglycerides
-Slow the development of plaque in the arteries
-Reduce the chance of abnormal heart rhythm
-Reduce the likelihood of heart attack and stroke
-Lessen the chance of sudden cardiac death in people with heart disease

        
     - HEART / And / CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
( Next we move on to the Heart / And / Cardiovascular System, and the effects meth has upon them.  As a stimulant, Methamphetamine use directly affects your heart health with every dosage. Using harm reduction/preventative measures to protect your heart is extremely critical in ensuring you stay in good health.) 

    1)  Methamphetamine has profound harmful effects on the cardiovascular system and results in irreversible damage to the heart, raising the risk of a heart attack, sudden cardiac arrest and heart failure," 

    2)  Methamphetamines can cause blood vessels to constrict and spasm, dangerous spikes in blood pressure, and the rewiring of the hearts electrical system. Meth can also lead to an abnormal heart rhythm, called arrhythmia, and change in the structure of the heart muscle, or cardiomyopathy.

     
  Supplements  For Heart/And/ Cardiovascular                                             
                                  Health-                   
             
1) Odorless Garlic Gell-caps- Garlic has been used for blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure (hypertension).

Possibly Effective For: 

-Improves Cholesterol Levels
-Lower the Risk of Heart Disease
-Garlic can lower total and LDL cholesterol
-Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)

2) Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 )- A nutrient that occurs naturally in the body. CoQ10 is also in many foods we eat. CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant, which protects cells from damage and plays an important part in the metabolism.

Possibly Effective For-

-Can lower blood pressure slightly 
-CoQ10 is also used to treat heart failure and other heart conditions,(when combined with regular medications
-Used to slow (won’t stop) the progression of Alzheimer's disease. 
-Used in treatment for migraine headaches 
-Possible uses in treatment Parkinson’s disease, data is not conclusive at this time though. 


- NERVOUS SYSTEM: (Next we move on to the Nervous System/And/ how meth-use places stress upon the body. Similarly to how meth affects dopamine in the brain, it also affects adrenaline/And/ norepinephrine and blocks their re-uptake.) 

    1)  Methamphetamine dramatically affects the central nervous system (CNS). It acts as a potent CNS stimulant and is highly addictive. Several areas of the brain are affected: the nucleus accumbens, the prefrontal cortex and the striatum.

    2)  Short-term CNS effects of meth abuse include insomnia, hyperactivity, decreased appetite and tremors. Extended meth abuse can cause depletion of monoamines in the brain, which can have a deleterious effect on learning. 

    3)  Long-term use of meth can also lead to (psychological addiction, stroke, violent behavior, aggressiveness, anxiety, confusion, auditory hallucinations, mood disturbances, delusions, insomnia, seizures and short-or long-term psychosis.)



  (Supplements Beneficial For Nervous System     
 /And/Oxidative Stress Health/And/ Prevention-)

1)  Vitamin B-12 (Cobalamin)- plays a key role in making DNA and also helps keep nerve cells and red blood cells healthy.

Possibly Effective For- 
 
-Alzheimer's disease (More Studies Needed)
-Heart disease
-Low vitamin B-12 can cause fatigue, weakness, memory loss, and other problems with the nervous system.
-The psychiatric manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency include delusions, hallucinations, cognitive changes (like memory decline), depression, and dementia. 

2)  Alpha-lipoic Acid (ALA)- ALA is a powerful fat- and water-soluble antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. Unlike other antioxidants, which target free radicals in either the blood or the tissue, ALA is effective in both.

Possibly Effective For- 

-Supports healthy blood sugar levels
-Protects heart from free radical damage
-Functions in both water and fat for greater benefits
-Skin aging 
-Memory

3) Vitamin B6- also known as (pyridoxine), is a water-soluble vitamin that your body needs for several functions. It's significant to protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism and the creation of red blood cells and neurotransmitters. 

Possibly Effective For- 

-Benefits nerve function and synthesizing neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine
-Improve Mood and Reduce Symptoms of Depression
-Prevent Clogged Arteries and Reduce Heart Disease Risk 
-Vitamin B6 also helps the body make melatonin (Important for sleep) 

   -OVERALL HEALTH: ( Next I will cover a few supplements that you can purchase which contain several of these vitamins I have listed into one bottle. Saving you money, as well as making it easier to stick to a dosing routine.) 

    1)  At the end of the day methamphetamine is detrimental to almost every single part of your body. Not so much the drug itself, but the processes used to manufacture the drug, as well as impurities left from poor cooking techniques. Apart from the drug, what causes the quickest changes in people’s appearance is lack of sleep, food, and water. 

    2)  Sleep Deprivation- In the short term, a lack of adequate sleep can affect judgment, mood, ability to learn and retain information, and may increase the risk of serious accidents and injury. In the long term, chronic sleep deprivation may lead to a host of health problems including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even early mortality.

    3)  Death- Though rare, an O/D from meth can prove fatal if under the right circumstances. There seems to be a myth that many believe “it’s impossible” to O/D on Methamphetamine, or at least die from an O/D. However know the symptoms of an actual O/D (do not confuse with over-amped)

Overdose- 
which include: 
-Extremely high body temperature
-Difficulty breathing
-Sharp chest pains
-Altered mental status
-Agitation
-Stomach pain

OverAmping-
-Extreme anxiety 
-Panic 
-Extreme paranoia 
-Hallucinations
-Agitation 

   - Both Over-dose and Over-Amping have very similar symptoms, but should not be taken lightly. If you or someone your with begin showing signs of these symptoms especially after taking a dosage in the form of any ROA, make sure to keep an eye on them and do not hesitant to call for help. 
 ( - An Over-Dose that proves fatal or near-fatal could leave a user with permanent physical damage as a  result in the brain and body if a person experiences prolonged seizures, stroke, heart problems, kidney failure, and/or altered mental status.)

(MORE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN BETTER)

            Quick Health Tips And Warnings: 

(- Below I will list a few things I learnt today some of which I was not aware of, and they could cause serious harm to you!) 

(- Please remember to do your own research though about any supplement you purchase!) 

1)  Aspirin + omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids- 

 - Applies to: aspirin and Fish Oil (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids)
 
- Talk to your doctor before using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids together with aspirin. Fish oil and other products containing omega-3 fatty acids may rarely increase the risk of bleeding when combined with other medications that can also cause bleeding such as aspirin. 

(- Taking any dose of aspirin on a regular basis can triple your risk of dangerous gastrointestinal bleeding, according to some studies.)

1)  Alcohol + aspirin: 

- If you're consuming just one serving of alcohol every day while taking aspirin on a regular basis, the risk of bleeding increases by another 250 percent. 

2)  Vitamin E + Warfarin: 

- Case reports have documented an increased risk of bleeding in patients taking vitamin E and warfarin concomitantly. 

3) Calcium + (Medication) :

- Calcium can interfere with many medications, including prescription osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates (such as alendronate), certain blood pressure medications, antibiotics in the tetracycline and quinolone families (like Cipro); and levothyroxine, which treats hypothyroidism.

- Taking Calcium + Vitamin D Supplements Together Could Increase Your Risk of Having a Stroke

4) Vitamin D + Diuretics:

-Taking high doses of Vitamin D along with a diuretic medication may result in too much calcium in the body, which can cause kidney problems.


   ( - Be careful when combining several
   Different blends of vitamins as you can
   Overdose on vitamins! Which could 
   Prove fatal!

 -Example: Iron toxicity can be caused by taking high doses of iron supplements for prolonged periods of time, or by taking a single overdose. ... Symptoms of iron toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain.


( - Be sure to do your own research, and make sure nothing you take daily will Interact Together. ) 

-  This took me practically all day, but I really enjoyed it. I learnt a lot in the process as I hope now you do As well. If this guide helped you, please upvote^, it would be greatly appreciated! 

- Be Safe. I Hope everyone has a good day, and thanks for reading!So before I say anything I might be drunk and wanna relapse but damn I hate meth, I've realized in my 6 months of being sober that I fucking hate the drug. It all started when I did a shit load of x pills that I thought was Molly but was really 80% meth. Now I have done other drugs like Molly coke and fentanyl (fuck fentanyl too. Perc 30s specifically) but I really thought these x pills were legit. But then I did two lines of meth on my 19th birthday. I realized that most drugs like Molly and x have meth in it, but I was still fucking hooked. After that night i continued this meth journey, snorting it, then I got hooked on smoking off the foil, then I started hitting the pizzle, then I really fucking loved shooting that shit up. This fucking drug man, I would be seeing fucking literal demons because I been awake that long off the shits but I still didn't care. I still loved this drug. For me it brought out the best in me, I felt fucking alive, or atleast I thought. I thought I was the real me when I was high, but after I sobered up, I realized this drug was literally sucking my soul away. There would be so many times I would come down and think "man I don't feel right, I don't feel good, I wanna kill myself im so depressed" but I still would get lit the next day. I wasted two years of my fucking life on this stupid fucking drug, doing nothing. I would get jobs, make enough money then quit and go back to meth land. I felt human there, I thought I belonged there because that's where "everything made sense". So many nights I would be with toxic people that would make me feel like shit, but they feed me ice so I felt okay. Good damn this drug puts you in a fucking stupid mindset man, it literally made me retarded and dead inside. Since these 6 months of being sober I have no fucking serotonin or dopamine left in my stupid fucking brain so I can't think right and can't fucking feel. I hangout with friends now just smoking weed and drinking but I never feel the same, after meth I don't feel human. I literally feel so fucking dead inside and I just wanna be alive again. Idk I'm just tired of it man, I literally still have dreams about smoking ice and I crave it alot but I fucking hate it more than I crave it. I hate what it has done to me. God damnit, if you're reading this and have never done meth, DONT FUCKING DO IT, it really do be ruining life's and makes you a stupid empty shell of a person. Never again with this god awful drug. Idk fuck me man happy new yearsI feel like I'm on my phone way too long when I'm spun out.  Does anyone else do this?Already feeling like my old self. Slowly learning to live without drugs. I am in a private rehab r n and these amazing people are helping me rebuild my life. I am begining to have hope again that I can take my life back. 

Take care y'all.Hey everyone quick update and also need some input or feedback. So I completed a few more chapters this weekend. I did take a personal day to myself to not get burnt out from writing. Anyways for my fellow people with addiction how would y’all feel about me adding some short stories in the book? I want to include stories from y’all full anonymity of course UNLESS you have a nickname or something for credit.

RELEASE DATE IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER 15th 2021
Still going to be 100% free! 

This book is turning out great and I’m trying to keep it as real as possible and not so preachy. I found other harm reduction books online but they’re all the same shit in a condescending type manner. Plus they’re boring as fuck to read. Mine won’t be like that. Anyways let me know what y’all think. Maybe some ideas to keep it more entertaining?

https://afterdarksecret.wordpress.com/2021/08/09/quick-update-and-official-release-date/So I was taking a crap and everything was fine...A normal crap...I felt, heard and pinched it off and then I am a bigger guy so I stand up to wipe...I stand up and the bowl was filled with urine but no turd...This happened yesterday and I definitely was not that spun or whatever...I have heard of people being able to manifest things with meth...What the fuck happened to my shit? I still cant wrap my head around it but has anything like that happened to anyone before? Like the only thing I can think of is some entity took it? i dont know...But I do know the president has a professional shit collector...I am not the president though.story time

ok, so it's late as fuck one night, prolly around 2 or 3 in the morning and i had been up all that night and i believe the 2 prior nights straight tweakin. well, masturbating... so i'm there butt ass naked in my chair doin my business and, like i had done so many times before, i grabbed my bubble and threw a torch under it. 

the bubble is heating up all bubbly and stuff and i thought i was just gonna get another hit and go for a few more hours. nah, that's where the funny part stops... as i'm hitting this bubble it fuckin slips out my hand and falls right onto my dick, bubble first! ho-lee-fuck!!!! so, i knew what was gonna happen before it even landed but i couldn't move anywhere near fast enough and the damn thing fell right on the top, bounced to the tip and then to the side of my penis. omg....smh. i can't believe i've become an episode of intervention.....

luckily the crystal meltingly hot bubble never touched any one surface of my skin for more than a fraction of a second but it still burnt the fuck out of my dick! that shit didn't feel right again until like 3 weeks later. Now, i always think of that scenario when i'm in similar situations. 

don't be like me. learn from me.I consider the drug dealer to drug buyer relationship to be sacred. If you deliver shit to me and risk arrest, hang out a bit, let's get high. However, no offense but I don't wanna be your friend, and I hate those who try to push it.  

My new person is calling me to hang out and I'm not cool with it but she is not getting it. Like, you deal hard drugs and carry a gun, I watch Netflix and wait for the mailman.If you have a good woman by the time you start fucking up your life with meth, don't EVER start giving her any of it!

Set the boundary early and set it firm.

You aren't ready for what's on the other side of giving your good wholesome woman meth for the first time.

PLEASE take my word for it!hi y’all you might remember me from long ago.. posted on here overwhelmed as fuck, I was letting the drug do me instead of doing the drug, blah blah blah. I have no idea where else to post this so it’s going here. TL;DR grief and my experience with meth.

i met my bf in march of 2019 and we had a tumultuous relationship to say the least. he was using when I first met him and I was adamant that I was Not Into It, I didn’t force him to quit, just said yo bro I don’t think this shit is good for you. I had never tried it. he was almost at the point where he was getting Weird (y’all know what I mean). We were both 21 btw. He got clean, I helped him thru the withdrawals. we had 4 beautiful months together both sober. He always said that he quit for me, which I don’t like bc that implies an ultimatum, but everyone said they think that I was the push he needed to get his shit together. He got a job and we were enjoying life together. Those 4 months (march to july) were the most beautiful months of my life. I had never had someone love me so intensely. He was borderline obsessed with me (which could get annoying but I would give anything to have him back).

He was living in a trailer park (stereotype) and was very friendly and charismatic, he loved people, he loved to make people laugh, he was a 21 year old who lived alone so his place was The Place. he was able to abstain from using even while people used right in front of him . I respect his strength. One night on july 11th, I was extremely drunk. my bf was down the block getting pops from a pop machine. His old dealer was there and was smoking and was chopping lines for hot rails. My inebriated ass said hey! coke! i’m super drunk and need to sober up! I asked the dealer if that was coke and if I could have a line and he said yes... that was the first time I used... I was back the next day buying shit from him. when my bf returned he Knew... my nose was pouring blood and I was dead sober. This kind of... enabled him to relapse. I was hooked the first time I tried it.

We would use together and I used heavily for about a month. You can look in my post history and see how that went. (spoiler: badly). Drugs put incredible strain on a young relationship. We went thru SO MUCH together in such a short amount of time. We were each other’s ride or die. Yet our relationship was hanging on by the seams... we fought constantly... meth made everything skyrocket into crises... we were bouncing from crisis to crisis and finally I had had enough, I broke things off, I said that’s it... 

... and I didn’t reunite with him until November 24, 8 days before he died. I went to go visit him on my 90 days of sobriety. I relapsed with him. The relapse was positive because I romanticized the fuck out of my drug of choice and was sort of a reality check. but that high... we talked for 12 hours straight, I lost my voice... it was like we had never been apart... I told him that I didn’t need meth and that I didn’t like it anymore, but whenever I used with him, it was so special. He gave me two things that day, a lil bit of his shit and pepperspray... because he wanted me to be safe... I shouldn’t have taken it.

I saw him once more on saturday the 30th... only for about an hour... it should have been longer had I known it was the last time. On monday I had my first day of work at a new job at 10am. He called me at 2am, it woke me up, I didn’t answer bc I wanted to just sleep and if he was twacked I knew he’d talk for forever... he texted me at 5:18am and said “babe I need to hear your voice” “I need help” and I didn’t wake up... at 7:48am he was pronounced dead. He was killed by three men younger than us.. 18, 19, and 20... they stole his cheap ass phone and two points of dope and his shoes and left his body in a front lawn.

I still don’t know how he died. I don’t know if he was shot in the head and i’ll never be able to see his face again. I don’t know if he suffered and bled out slowly. I don’t know if I want to know but not knowing is fucking killing me. Its not fair. We may have had a multifaceted relationship. He may have introduced me to drugs, fine. But he was a good fucking kid. He made friends everywhere he went, whoever he met. He loved to laugh and make people laugh. He was a sunbeam. He was just a kid. He was everything. He was the only person I could see myself being with forever because at least shit would never be fucking boring. he took a piece of my heart with him when he left. He left fingerprints on my soul in the most beautiful, fucked up way. 

I miss him and i’m not okay. Thanks for reading.keep hydrated my peeps.This run was a real “just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in”, fresh outta rehab, feeling free as a kite, then I hit a telephone pole and burst into flames. I knew I didn’t have another run left in me and I didn’t. So bye shadow dudes, I’m so over your bullshit. My life isn’t supposed to look like this. I have to do something else.

Nothing will change if I don’t. I have to be a different person because the person I was did those things that I do. Leggo. Let’s go!I’ve only been using for 2 years. But looking in the mirror today I can’t recognize myself. The hobbies I loved and personality I had vanished. The respect I had gone. I know I’ll never be the same person as before. And today has been rough. Crying randomly knowing I’m fed up, but still want to get high. 

Meth was my best friend. Meth always treated me real good, I always told myself. Your mind convinces you to see things bleakly, like the devil has your soul. Like the world is shit, and it feels like we are lying in shit and eating shit. 
It’s all fun and games until shit hits the fan. Then you have to clean up messes because of irresponsibility and a blind eye. 

Please be cautious trying it your first time. Actually, don’t even attempt it...

Because for 2 years I was chasing that high, only to lose the things I worked so very hard for. The value of meth and its high carried me away, actually made me cold hearted. It’s interesting though the same people that loved me before it all, can’t stand me now. So sometimes meth has it’s benefits. 

It’s a never ending love story, featuring me, myself and I. Hopefully I can fight this battle..For the most part meth has improved my life. I met my fiance five years ago through meth and we have an amazing sex life because of it. Before meth I had questionable hygiene. Now I shower immediately after getting high. My apartment is immaculate and well decorated with artwork. I was overweight my whole life and now I'm physically fit, not skinny either. I don't drink anymore. Bad news doesn't affect me as deeply as it did before. I don't spend hours in front of the TV like I used to. I don't know... I'm glad I found meth, it's really been helpful.TodY i was rollerblading around during my come down and i was befamlebd by a wizard i saw doing crazy magic trix. I asked him what he was dojng then he gave me a magic potion then i was able to fly. It sucked caus i had to pay 300 dollars for the potion. I flowed up to heaven after reaalizing i had thw ability ro read peoples minds and tell what thwy were doing. The poeple had cool minds and brains of emotions. I flowed up to heven and i saw god and realized he was also thw devil. I took a lighting bolt and thrww it at him and i won. I saved thw worls. I know thos is true you beleve me rit now it actual happenedAt this point I am too scared to do meth anymore. Which I was only using small doses for therapeutic usage. 

I was really surprised that the majority of cases are from meth of cocaine. I had assumed fentanyl in these drugs were rare and were primarily in heroin to increase potency. I feel like this is very important information that's not being really reported as to what exactly people are dying from.

Its similar across Canada and the US. Majority of people dying are not heroin users but the past year or two have increasingly been meth and cocaine users. To the point the majority of ODs now from fentanyl are people using cocaine or meth.Well folks, I know this isn't an airport and no one cares about departures, but I have to call it quits on Tina. I'm breaking up with her. I had done meth before about 10 years ago and never had a problem with it, quit it, never touched it again. But last March 2021 I got a 1g bag and throughout the year worked my way up to getting half ounces for personal use. 1 week of use became a month, a month become 3 months, 3 became 6, etc...etc...

I've managed to avoid getting into trouble with the law and I have kept it a secret from my SO this entire time (I'm prescriped adderall so meth doesn't make me seem any different).

But it's finally that time. I gotta let her go. In all honesty, I feel I've been very lucky in that it hasn't destroyed my life by any means but this is precisely why I'm stopping is because I wish no longer to push my "luck".

Luckily, I have 2 months worth of adderall to help withdrawals and wanting to sleep all day. Also, I'm on abilify (partial dopamine agonist) and fluoxetine (anti-anxiety) and those last two meds really help with the depression symptoms. I stay rather stable mostly. 

All that to say, I wish everyone the best. Be safe out there. Do your thing, but be careful.

Cheers.I was overcome with a feeling that I could only best describe as guilt supplemented with the stirrings of anxiety and dread. A big plate of steaming guilt with a side of mashed anxiety dripping with dread, if feelings were food. Basically what you would get for a cafeteria lunch at the high school on the side of town you avoid whenever you're not buying meth. Thankfully we have drugs to stave off feelings, both hunger and in a more general sense, and I buy my meth in large enough quantities so as to not be in a near-perpetual state of "buying meth". Anyways whatever you call it, I was feeling like that. At least as much as I could feel it in my numbed out state of existence I've been in for the better part of a year. 

It seemed to weigh down more and more heavily upon me with each cumbrous step I took as I trudged up the stairs to my apartment. Feeling guilty partly because I hadn't came home at all last night, or much at all this past week for that matter, and even when I was around I wasn't really "present". Mostly feeling guilty because I didn't feel guilty enough to actually do anything about it. Or anything, really. Except to get high. More of a guilt that I don't care enough to improve, though you didn't have to reach too deep into my decaying mind to have ascertained that tidbit. 

I guess shame would be the more appropriate word. I don't know, my thoughts not revolving around methamphetamine rarely made much sense to me anymore. What did make sense was the fact I was still taking off multiple nights per week, leaving her at home alone. Not that I could reliably tell you with any degree of certainty what day of the week it even is at any given time, or if my sleep-deprived mind could even decipher it's recent memories well enough to distinguish the individual days from one another. It all seemed like a blur lately. I had a bad habit of losing track of time and dates. A bad habit I had allowed to flourish and exacerbate alongside my addiction. One of many; both bad habits and addictions. 

These habits and vices; all products of the unrestrained apathy that was slowly taking over my life ever since I could remember.  It was because of this I had once again punched out every box and then some on yet another figurative "fuck-up punch-pass" and I was now here to redeem my prize in the form of relationship woes. My relationship being one of the few things I did care about. Not that you'd be able to tell. Time to pay the piper. No not that piper. 

I walked into our shared apartment, undisturbed from the last I had seen it. She doesn't do much when I'm not around. Or when I am around. She's been quiet and withdrawn even when I am around for a good while now. It's funny how the symptoms of distress from those who love us tend to sometimes mimic many of the negative symptoms that are brought on by this addiction. Only her symptoms were brought on by her love for me. I hated how she cared so much when I seemed to care so little. Why am I doing this to her? Oh right, because I'm a piece of shit. I wonder if you truly showed me the wake I've been leaving behind in the shit storm that is my life, would it even elicit a shrug from the shoulders of my bony frame? 

I set down my work gear and waste a couple moments before making my way to the bedroom where she would be cooped up like always. Before entering I slipped the gift I swiped for her from Walmart on my way home into my jacket. A small token to indicate I still gave a shit, or at least wanted to appear like I did. I wasn't sure if I even knew which was the case anymore, though I guess that answers it for me right there. I collected myself best I could and entered. 

She says nothing to me. I walk past her towards the closet. She usually waits for me to initiate but I'm too cowardly to even say anything and she too hurt to even speak. At least her silence afforded me some opportunity to slip out of the clothes I had worn and worked in for 2 days straight now. Extra putrid from the sweat-inducing labor I did while adorned in them, a supplementary stank to that brought on by the already sweat-inducing state of rest that came with the use of this substance, making them gag-inducingly rancid. If I had anything in my stomach I might have thrown up. Welp, I didn't have an appetite anyways. At least she could see I was still going to work, much to the dismay of my fellow tradesmen's olfactory systems. I wondered if any of them noticed the flaming car wreck trying to pass itself off as a person working along side them, not that I really cared. 

I figured it was in both our best interests if I took a shower quick before we got into things. I had to keep mentally reminding myself to keep it quick as I had a habit of getting stuck while in the shower, only ever jumping out when I noticed the hot water was gone. 

I did my thing and stepped out to dry off, catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Lately when I look at my body it seems foreign to me. It's wasting away so fast that each time I see it it's near unrecognizable. My muscles had atrophied to almost nothing, each of my bones visibly protruding past the surface of my skin. My thin frame looks like it did when I was 16 except it feels like I'm 60. Fuck me, I'm only 30, not that you'd be able to tell from my face. I had more baggage under my eyes than the emotional baggage I carried with me that lead me to abusing substances. More lines on my face than lines I had snorted all week. Ok, well maybe not that many lines in my face but thats probably not a good thing. It's like I woke up in someone else's body; as if we all turn in our bodies to get our dream bodies to go to dreamville or wherever, like they're shoes being exchanged for a rented pair at a bowling alley. Only a mix up at the desk has left me with someone else's body. 

"Excuse me. There's been a mistake. This one isn't mine. Mine had pecs, biceps. You know, muscle tone? Not whatever this is," I say with disgust as I point to the pale, lifeless body I'd been handed only for the teenage attendant to just gesture widely to the empty rack behind him and shrug out an insincere "sorry." Oh well. Who needs organ function anyways?

I quickly got dressed and made my way back to the bedroom. I sat myself down and tried unsuccessfully to recall what I had planned to say when I was rehearsing this in my head on the drive home. Not that these things ever went at all like they do in my head anyways. I looked at her, wracking my brain for the right words or hell, even any words to say until finally resigning to only letting out a timid "I'm sorry." 

Pathetic. 

I remember how i used to get so anxious about this same situation that I had found myself in far too many times before. I couldn't even fathom the thought of confronting her about my transgressions until I pretty much had no choice. These days though it was different. Before i used to care because I hated to see her hurt. Now I think i just cared out of obligation. Just enough to trick myself into thinking I'm still human and maintain the status quo. Despite my efforts even that was met with near complete indifference on my end more and more each time. It was like I no longer cared enough for anxiety to wriggle its way into and nest itself in my brain. Either my brain was now an uninhabitable, radioactive wasteland; or my apathy had grown to levels where even my SO's feelings were seen as just another obstacle standing between me and this insidious fiend of a drug I was so in love with. Either scenario was just as likely. 

She stared up at me with her ongoing silence. She loved me so much. I was flawless in her eyes, she used to tell me. Now, all she could muster was a long look into my eyes, as if she was looking to see if the man she loved was even still behind them. I knew she was tired of saying all that she had said a million times before, and me giving her a million different bullshit excuses in return. Not that anything could be said that wasn't already plainly conveyed by both the tears and pain she was fighting to hold back. A look of misery and torment in her eyes that was only further intensified by the bags that hung beneath them. Evidence of the sleepless nights she'd lay awake worrying about me. If only my tired eyes were indicative of having a heart and soul like hers did. Mine only served to tell I had given mine up. 

We sat there in silence for a long time, her continuing to stare into my eyes in her search for the real me in there somewhere. I couldn't honestly say whether her efforts were in vain or not. I wish she'd find me, come rescue me. I prayed that she did. I almost felt like I was one of those situations you sometimes see on the news, where some sick fuck kidnaps somebody and keeps them held captive for years and years until finally they get an opening to call out for a neighbor to call the cops. They come and arrest the guy and reunite the victim with their family and they can try and live some semblance of a normal life. Could I be found? Be rescued? Could I ever live a normal life again? Or is there nothing left to find but a rotting corpse that would only serve to bring closure to the people foolish enough to still care about me? If I were honest with myself I'm both the captive and kidnapper. My destruction is my own doing and my only escape is through my own demise. 

Eventually I can no longer hold her gaze and let my face droop down. Unable to fall over dead at that second like I so desperately wishes for, I attempt to cut the tension a bit with my half-hearted gesture. 

"I got you something," I say with a bashful tremor in my voice. God dammit, even this felt shameful. Giving her something as if I felt it would solve anything or make up in any capacity to my mountain of wrongdoings. I reach over to grab my little gift from my pile of dirty clothes. Thank god its sealed in plastic. I hold it in front of her. At first she says nothing. I can't tell if it's shock or disgust. Probably disgust. In retrospect I probably should have gotten her something she would like, not something she would wear for me. Too bad it took me until that moment to realize. I am a fucking moron. Though she's so sweet and innocent, she still forces a smile for me. 

"Well, what are you waiting for? Put it on. Of course you'll have to undress me first," she says. God, I'm really something. My fingers tremble as I slowly slide the fabric from her soft figure. I couldn't tell you how much of it was from the meth but I could feel my heart pounding as she lay there, poised completely bare. I take my time with the view as I pull her gift out of the packaging. Slowly I drape it over her body and god damn, it fits perfectly. My queen. She looks so fuckin good. 

This is the shit I've been ignoring. And for what? To peer out the blinds for hours on end all geeked out and paranoid as I wither away at some junkie's flophouse? That's not living. When Death comes for me he'll probably turn around in confusion fearing he's come far too late. No Death, I'm still here. Please release me from this mortal coil. Hopefully he's feeling merciful that day because I doubt my soul would even be worth the fee to have it towed to the soul scrapyard or wherever they put the useless soul junk. 

She looks heavenly to me. I wondered how she could possibly still be attracted to what she saw. She seems unfazed though as I got on top of her. She feels so good. So warm. My vasoconstricted, frail body probably feels so cold to her but if she minded she gave no indication of such. I run my hands down her soft body and am hit with waves of ecstasy. I'm glad I got the Egyptian cotton. 700 thread count, stretched to each one of her queen size corners. Oh my God, I'm in heaven. I will get some good rest tonight. Fuck, I love my bed. Don't know why I've been avoiding this. 

Oh right... Meth. Duh.

Shit, where did I leave my pipe again?Was such going to a song and I’m like”damn my voice sounds so good” and I recorded me singing and I was like holy shit I suck more than I do soberStay up 3-5 days you will encounter them. They are real. They use our mind on drugs to somehow access their dimension and see them. I think they should be worshipped. They are the closest thing we have to angels or demons that might be actually real. Post your experience of them.i stopped using meth last year same day, last time i used it i promised myself that i will stop, i stopped smoking weed/tabacco too the same time, it wasn't hard, it just took one decision, the hard part was the psychoses, to this day i still have minor visual hallucinations, but no more shadow people/hearing voices :D tbh i don't understand why i was doing this drug, i thought i needed it to achieve anything in life, now i'm happy to say that it was a lie, an excuse i was telling myself to keeep indulging in such a habbit, right now i'm alot better without it, and don't plan to ever do it againIdk why but as a tweaker i fucking love mormon girls. Last month i had a coworker when i worked at chipotle who i was in love with so i hid the fact i smoked meth. I was texting her once and one of my friends said that women love c onfidence. So i t ok the extra mile and sent her a picture of my dick then she blocked me. Idek why she was mad bc ik im huge. My dick isnt small its big so shes acting like a bitch. 

Then this other girl at a church i went to when i was gacked af and had been up for 4 days so i dat next to her and told her about the cool shiti did. I gave her my number and we texted for a bit but she didntseem interested then i asked her on a date and we got coffee and i tried to make out with her when she hugged me before we left and she fucking maced me. 


Then last year i bought my girlfriend at the time meth for valentines day then she kicked me out of her hojse. Lifes been pretty fucked since then because of that nitch.



Anyone else have a thing for mormon girls?I have had good experiences and recently horrible experiences. I was clean for 2 years until recently and now I remember why I quit the first time. So no more meth. No more anything.I just wanted to make a post saying EVERYONE OF YOU ARE WORTH IT. No matter what other people say don't let it get you down. And just remember our world is always trying to find ways to kill us. That is how it's always been and always will be. But in the end we have all made it this far so don't let unknowledgeable people get you down. Also don't beat yourself up mentally we all have a tendency to do it. Hope you all have a good day stay positive.i genuinely don't understand the ppl who smoke dope just to strock their dicks all day ,it's pathetic 2 me lmao it rlly is . i get the horniness from it aight i get it , but ppl will do that shit for days straight.if ur gonna be using ice , man use the shit to be productive , be creative do anything else but beat ur shit all day. that ain't no way of living , go paint or some shit idkIf you wanna find out yourself, YOU WILL. if you disagree with me you're probably high on it and will agree with me at some point. The highs are always "worth it" but the lows cancel it out and it will ALWAYS end in a LOW. why am i FUCKING MY SELF IN THE BRAIN. 

I don't want to put it all on addiction cuz i know but it is still a CHOICE made by me DAILY to buy, and use it each individual time and despite my long history of not being in control when it comes to drugs, if im not in control of myself at-least when sober, WHO IS?!? Must be me. Fuck. This life is fucking wild and unsustainable.  It's honestly fucked. I don't even remember what sober feels like.... 

i know i didn't love it all time but it was safe, acceptable, not going to get me arrested or burn every bridge i have and make everyone hate me and the anxiety wasn't as bad as this... like holy fuck.... the shit this makes somehow acceptable... i fucking hate myself now and i use to justify using cuz only when im high af can i forget that everything i do is wrong, morally wrong, financially retarded and i have neglected my family, girlfriend, everyone who even remotely cares about me, and my fucking self for YEARS. I'm a DRUG ADDICT... AGAIN. NO. U KNOW HOW SHITTY THAT IS? Society HATES me... US ... if you are one... and once you get deep u can't hide it anymore, it starts to show, u slip up, act like a meth head which u now are... next thing u fucking know ur life is FUCKED and u don't even recognize yourself in the fucking mirror anymore. I can't say this shit to anyone else.... just venting and let it be known...... it's fucked... u can enjoy life without it, WHY WOULD U GIVE THAT UP. I HAVE OBLITERATED A PROMISING LIFE with CRYSTAL METH USE for originally NO FUCKING REASON OTHER THAN CURIOSITY AND CUZ I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO ME. it did.

JUST GO ON WITH YOUR DAY I DON'T NEED YOUR SHIT COMMENTS IDGAF.  10upvotes, NO ONE CARES, get over it, i posted it, it's what im going through, don't need any feedback. Thx. Who woulda guessed most meth heads are dicks 😒🤷🏼‍♂️ /s 🖕🏾I used to love getting high…. Had to finally give it up. 85 days clean today. For those of you still partying, do your thing, others of you that are thinking about quitting, life is better on the other side.I keep hearing the song Brena by A perfect circle continuously. It sounds very faint and I was literally putting my ear to all the walls and floors trying to figure out who’s playing it but when I really focused, it turned out to just be the white noise of my fan. I can still hear it and am just laying in my bed listening to imaginary music. It sounds so vivid but it’s no where to be found except in my headHello I have been noticing unusual signs of my partner. He is a drug abuser of opiods, and an alcoholic. But these past few days he have been high on something and it is not the usual signs of opioid. He's been up for days, not showering or eating like he used to. Not smoking weed, (like this is the longest he has ever kept a pool of weed) and not drinking at all! He's been irritable and mean lately, fighting alot. And he keeps taking apart his gun and rebuilding it. And playing in his hair. Then last night he told me we have bed bugs, and asked if I brought another man in our bed, and got really defensive when I told him no one else in the house is itching or having rashes. I know we don't have bed bugs for a fact!took the ACT smack dab in the middle of a good ol meth-in-the-morning, xanax bars before bed binge so i was sleeping enough to function, but not much. got a fucken 34 outa 36 in reading and 25 in math (math score isn't great but it's a million times higher than i expected) i feel pretty good about that shit, i haven't done my best on a test that didn't affect my class grade in years. usually i would've said, " fuck that test how's it gonna help me " and it was 6 long hours i was pretty close but i finished that shitSo I'm a 23 year old guy, currently dating my buddy Kyle's mom, and i live with kyle and his mom rn. Kyle's16 and still a virgin, he's going to prom tonight and i wanted to change that for him. So i gave Amanda, a 29 year old prostitute 600 dollars worth of meth to go to prom with Kyle. She showed up to our house and kyle was so confused. He found out she was a peostitute and he cussed me out and tried to hit me. I started crying bc i paid 600 fucjing dollars of meth for her. She's still here so he still has a prom date at least. But Kyle could be esily gotten laid befpre he went to prom. Kyle's really mad at me, but Kyle's mom doesn't know what i did for him. How can i make Kyle stop being such a fucking square and just take Amanda to prom?? IOr does it seem like meth use has increased and users are coming out of the wood work since the shut down in 2020? I know there are always newbies popping up. But it seems like everyone I know is suddenly admitting that they are using. Then theres Reddit and all the naked spun fun crew to the crack back masters. Meth's like, "Hey, everyones doin it, come take a twirl and try talking to the squirrels. 

Maybe I'm just paying more attention lately. 

&#x200B;

\*\*Never fuck with the squirrels, Morty\*\*And boy, am I ever glad I was born in the time in history where I can smoke some god damn meth. Fuckin meth. America's favorite past time. Meth and the U.S. of fuckin A, man. Basically can't have one without the other. So could you imagine being born before America was around to start banging out that shit? Like you wouldn't even have to be a caveman being like "Oh man. I wish I could smoke some meth. Too bad I can't cause we as a cavesociety haven't invented fire or meth yet." (People were a lot more ignorant then then so he probably was pretty against booty bumping that shit if they even had meth.) You could have been one of the early adapters of America and still would have been fucked. 

I'm assuming Christopher Columbus and company didn't just land on American soil and be like "Alright guys let's kill Indians and make some meth," cause like meth wouldn't have been invented yet. Yep, before America became the America we know today we'd all be like "Oh look at me, I'm a citizen of this new found continent. Fuck the British, let's get our hands on some slaves. Only we won't have them making and distributing meth, we'll have them pick cotton instead cause I dunno I guess that's useful somehow." Honestly, doesn't really sound all that fun to me tbh. 

No it wasn't until the year 1973 when meth was first invented by its namesake, a one Dr. Chris Still-Meth. Then is when the amazing America we all know and love truly began, and God dammit am I ever glad to be here (well I'm a little north 🇨🇦, but still technically part of North America). I would not have wanted to live in a world where meth doesn't exist yet. It would suck. All prior inventions paled in comparison. It's like "Ok cool invention Thomas Edison, but how does it make porn and jerking off better? Get out of here with your stupid light bulb that's gonna be sweet for smoking meth in when somebody finally invents that, you fuckin dirty animal!" Yeah not for me. 

And sure, maybe it would be sweet to have been born in the future. Maybe there will be drugs better than meth. Unlikely but who knows. I'll get to miss out on cool things, like bikini flying car washes, or the first, like, actually black president, or see when we first colonize the sun after we all fuck up mars too. But that doesn't matter. Meth is all I need, all I want. I will love it until the day I die. God bless you guys, God bless America, and God dammit, God bless motherfucking meth.Does anyone ever find that they just get stuck, like you need to get out or go somewhere but you cant stop playing on your phone.
I've been sitting here half an hour, I have to go!!I did not write this, took it from somewhere not here!!!!


All the "meth" coming from mexico is fake... sleepy dope/nope/dust/iso!!!!

Just some tips for the unexperienced new meth user:

From here out the term "fake" will also be refering to badly cut or impure meth

1.real meth does not come in massive chunks of "ice"

2. real meth is not completely clear

3. the bigger the rock the faker you can bet it is

4. real meth crystals will be DENSE (wont crumble under a little pressure)

5. real meth will have you up for days, sweating, horny, not hungry, feeling like a god.

6. 1 gram of real meth would be good for at least a week to the new user

7. real meth is very bitter similar to caffeine. if it makes you wanna spit it out(sour) its no good

9.real meth WILL dilate your pupils to fucking hell. Your eyes will look black (no iris) when you're really spun

10. real meth gives you dry mouth

11. when you crush real meth it will still
 be somewhat crystalline. fake shit turns to powdery dust

12. real shit lasts forever in the bowl!!!
 fake stuff seems to just disappeas

13. real meth will burn easily if overheated and mark the inside of the bowl. fake shit you can just torch the fuck out of it (still burns but not the same way)

14. most of the fake shit has a disgusting taste when vaped

15. its nearly impossible to clean the fake shit using traditional methods (acetone wash,recrystalize)

16. real meth will have you up wanting to DO stuff. The fake shit just makes you kinda wired but you wont get much done

17. real meth is strong enough to keep you awake for a LOOONG time.

18. fake shit will make you dizzy/confused/tired

19. real meth increases your heartrate and will produce vasoconstriction while the fake shit seems to only increase blood pressure.

20. fake shit climbs up the side of the bowl while you smoke, seems to run away from the heat. real meth stays in a nice puddle at the bottom

21. dontevengetmestartedon CRACKBACK (the way the meth resolidifies in the bowl)

-REAL: solidifies quickly and like the ripple from the edge of a pond. white in color. has a slight feather look to the puddle. kind of shiny translucent

-FAKE: Slowly solidifies, usually super clear. different portions of the puddle will harden at different times. puddle doesnt really have a defined crystal look to it. detaches from the glass easily if bumped. once melted in a bowl it becomes hard to disolve with water.

22. if you're getting an 8ball (3.5g) for $100 its probably bunk ass shit

23. when you take a hit of real meth you can feel it pretty much instantly (feels like pure dopamine release)

24. fake shit will have you spinning in circles, feeling like shit, compusively using to try and chase the little bit of "high" it gives you

25. While prolonged meth use usually causes some level of paranoia, fake shit seems to really bring this on quickly.

26. real meth dissolves very quickly in just a small amount of cold water. Fake shit will kinda be like undissolved sugar but will eventually dissolve

27. the melting point of fake shit is all over the map. msm will vape off at a lower temp than meth. but most of the "meth mixtures" I've seen around can handle way higher temps than real meth. And it'll melt funny too. Some will stay solidified and slide around in the lower temp puddle for a bit before melting.

28. bad shit will turn your pipe white and chalky very fast. usually within a few pulls

29. if you use a card/bill/paper to crush real meth some of the "powder" will compress into translucent spots and will stay crystalline in structure. It will stick more to the surface that you're crushing it on and will require alot more chopping to get it all broken down.

30. real meth should usually make you super horny and able to perform. Sometimes you'll get "dope dick" from good shit but you'll still be horny af.

31.the fake stuff seems to effect the stomache more in weird ways. you can definitely eat and sometimes youll have the munchies even though which is the total opposite of good meth.

32. a bit of real meth will have you off reorganizing your clothes or some stupid shit and feeling fucking awesome about it! fake/bad shit will have you sitting there tensed up in a ball wondering how you smoked a whole sack

Thats all I'm throwing down for now.
those who've had the real thing will recognise a bunch of whats listed right away. I have no personal agenda. some of what is said can only be interpreted as opinion.

Label this/me how you wish. I'm just a person who's sick of bullshit. Alot of "meth" users have never seen something close to pure. ALOT of you are buying these huge chunks of fake dope because it has literally fooded the market in the last 5 years. I meet people that only know the fake shit, have never had anything else. Its becoming the norm....

Most street dealers and all dnm afaik are selling this shit and don't even know it's fake/cut. They'll call you crazy and "no complaints from anyone else" :)

I encourage copy paste of this for harm reduction purposes

the meth game is currently a fucking joke of a mirage!!!!!

Now You Freaking Know!!!!


This is what REAL D Meth Looks Like!!!!

http://imgur.com/a/kyzVxYou guys aren't going hear from me very frequently except to brag perhaps. The albeit quasi drug induced moment of clarity is before me. I'm too old for this shit. Before I relapsed I was half way on to something. I don't need a drug to escape being a Senior. I will just refuse to be a Senior. Let others sit and wallow (this includes Social media). I'm gonna drop dead doing shit. I'm done. Meth is for those who have the luxury of time to waste not for those who should be cherishing the moment. Time for me to grow up and refuse to grow old until feasibility is the sole issue. It's been fun guys. I am out!yo. i been havin this conspiracy theory that meth sits in ur lungs n fights off everything and that’s why meth heads dont get sick. but ya know, never been confirmed. LISTEN TO THIS ONE!!! i haven’t gotten sick in over a year, also haven’t been sober in that long. last week i got sober, 2 days into being sober i got covid. weird coincidence right?? TWO DAYS AGO I GOT SAID F IT, BOUGHT A BALL N GOT SPUN N GUESS WHAT? all my covid symptoms have been gone since (and i had them bad) 


thank u all for ur attention. when i go missing it’s cuz the government doesn’t want anyone to know what the cure to disease is. that’s y meth is illegal ;)I've only been using a year, on and off. I started back in my home state of NC, briefly moved back home last November, but moved back to NM the beginning of the year. I was ordering from deep web but wasn't getting any good shit. So for the past few months, when I am using, I am trying to find a connect.

I'm finding that everyone, including women, are absolutely fucking perverts. I make it very clear that I like to smoke alone and I just want to buy my shit and go. Usually the first one or two times buying from the connect I will smoke with them to just break the ice, no pun intended 🤣 and to test my shit. But it doesn't take long to have to drop them as I am being put into uncomfortable situations, even after stating multiple times I am not sexually interested.

I use to love to fuck when spun, but I quickly began being abused and became terrified and just started smoking on my own. I just want to chill and smoke. I like to draw and listen to music or clean and organize if it's needed. But lately I've been wanting to socialize, but god damn the last chick I hung out with, I woke up (was coming down and got sleepy) with her trying to fuck me. And I spent weeks talking to her before meeting up, hoping that would vet any issues.

Any advice?

And I always pay for my shit and still get offered to get my bowl loaded up extra for free or they give a little extra for free but I've started declining because it seems to be a loophole to try to fuck. I hate declining and so do most when I do and they take it offensively but damn. I don't want to be a fucking pocket pussy.Today I have been 3 months clean after 10, close to 11 years of being an absolute speedhead. I finally had a fucking nuff of the shit and put the pipes and needles down for good I am never going back there..

I just wanted to make a quick note here in the hopes that it might lift the spirits of those of you who are stuck deep in this merciless hole. 

I know it doesn't feel like it right now friend but trust me you are loved. You are wanted. You are needed you are absolutely good enough. You can do this. You got this shit. You're better than this. You deserve better. There is beauty here on this earth waiting for you to embrace when you are ready to embrace it. And I promise you it is worth it to stick around, fight and stay strong to see the day the light welcomes you and your rollercoaster ride is indeed worth something in the end. It is not all pointless suffering.

All the losses, all the pain, illness mental and physical, the bullets you've taken along the way, they all help mould you into the stronger and amazing version of yourself who is on the other side of this and I sincerely hope you can let yourself believe this and step into the light.

Fuck I wouldn't wish 10 years of this bullshit on my worst enemy .. and it makes me saddened to see others go through it. It's why, when I was hustling the shit as well; I sourced the best cleanest shit in the country I could get my hands on so that people had the safest alternative to lean back on until they too could see this and got themselves the help they so desperately needed and deserved. but now I realise how much damage I caused thinking I was doing the right thing cause I was delusional from the shit, when really I should've just sold people jump and turned rhem away from it. I don't think I can forgive myself. But I plan to do better things with my life to make up for that. I just hope it doesn't take you 10 years to ease yourself some self respect and leave this evil shit behind. No one deserves to suffer for that long. I wish I could see this so much earlier too. I haven't been off it for that long but hey now that I see things so much more clearly, the damage it is has done me mentally and physically, the relationships tarnished the time wasted sitting in a cell the life I ruined for myself? It's not worth it. It's not a life. So it's time I went out and started living, and I mean living not just surviving. After everything I have been through in the name of crystal fkn meth I owe myself that much. Peace and rest. More importantly sanity purpose and actual enjoyment in being alive. Its taken me a long time to get here and accept or beleive that there is life outside of this and that I DESERVE that life. And so do all of you. 

So in closing I hope you all stay safe and positive, cause you can get through this. It gets better and it's going to be okay- it has to be.&#x200B;

Here is some advice for meth users, don't make the mistake of been open about your drug use with friends especially if it is meth like I did (I feel no shame or guilt with my drug use so I don't care about hiding it) because cunts will use your meth use to gas light you, as an excuse to try and control you, and fuck with you, and blame anything you do on meth, they will put all their prejudice on meth upon you and see you through that lens.

I have a friend who went feral and tells everyone I have meth psychoses and hear voices, to try and get an intervention to stop me using. People believe him because well - its meth. Cunt has even told my boss at work I'm suffering from meth psychosis. And for the record I'm stable as and never ever heard voices on meth, and don't have psychosis.

funny thing though and I wonder if anyone else experienced it, him and others act like tweakers when I smoke meth around them, they get all crazy, so consumed by the fact I use meth that they become delusional and start making stuff up about me to try and get me to stop. So fuck all you people that won't let people do their thing. Also the woman I fuck, uses it against me and constantly holds it over me, and tries to make out I'm delusional, and that my point of view is invalid cause of meth. she has demanded that I disassociate with a whole heap of people, to the point that I ain't going to be allowed to associate with anyone. she thinks everyone gets spun and horny and I will fuck every woman I come across, its not my trip, but I can't convince her otherwise.

I am been fucked with by and gaslight to the point where I just about question myself - they say something and when u mention it at a later time they say - I never said that and then go on a rant about how its the meth and I'm delusional and they shout and act crazy like they are tweaking. they all using drugs and/or alcohol and they have the fucken audacity to give me crap about my meth use. I ain't running around lying, telling everyone that they are crazy and delusional, and trying to control them, turns out they are the fucken tweakers.

My feral exfriend tells everyone I communicate with demons and hear voices, and using the meth creates a channel where the demons can communicate to me. Says I have permeant psychoses with no evidence, cause I fucken don't. and guess what people believe his insanity and not me cause I smoke meth. So tom if your reading this go fuck yourself and I know what your up to (he secretly follows and reads my reddit posts) - fuckwit. I bought a - smoke meth, hail Satan shirt to fuck with him, but to him and the people he told its more evidence that I talk to demons. - fucken retards have no sense of humor, can't even tell when I'm fucking with them, cause they believe everyone on meth is delusional and crazy.

I also have been able to astral project for 30 years, had some trippy experiences in the astral world. I done meth for 4-5 years, and now apparently my astral projection is a sign of meth psychoses so don't make my mistake everyone - keep your meth use secret from everyone, control freaks, retards, enemies,  friends,  family, and partners and ex-partners will all use it against you to systematically fuck you over.

smoke meth, hail Satan.I forgot my shards at home. Sweet Jesus's baby what a meatstick maneuver that was. How the hell am I supposed to get through my work day? Thankfully I had the sense to get spun af before work and I remembered to bring my michael bubblé which still has a couple radio ready hits in him that i can suck into my facehole, so my heart will still be set to vibrate for a couple hours yet, but then how will I take on the afternoon? Where will I find the energy? The sustenance? Eat a fuckin lunch like an idiot? Yeah sorry but there's a reason people take a bunch of meth instead of a baloney sandwich when they wanna beat their dick up for several hours and/or do other such cherished pastimes.

What will I do in the shitter? Shit? Lord have mercy for I may just be wiping more than my b-hole in there. I will be wiping tears. Anal fissures to be precise. But I will be also wiping tears. Cause I'm all sad and shit. And also the fissures. Needless to say please send any spare prayers or thots you may have in my direction or we might just have to call the day a write off and I'd be lying if I said I didn't do that yesterday already and unfortunately 2 writes don't make a right.Took a couple of months off and plan to never use daily again but the quiet is deathly and the whole world feels paused beyond 3am, and I somehow had forgotten abt this unfailingly lonesome stretch of the day. 


How did I spend such shamefully massive, entire half-day blocks of time, confining myself to the floor of the upstairs bathroom while I [“creatively”] traced my pre-industrial revolution lineage that ancestry.com omits, all from the hallowed “pages” Wikipedia.com, til I could figure out how exactly I’m related to Rollo, despite the looming evidence that suggests I’m actually just not. 

and prob am more closely related to a contemporary but way less cool (imo) charlemagne, but yeah like it’s whatever. as you can tell. 

and, I mean.... — totally worth it.. 
all the time/s.. that that

(that that? ..I mean I guess...this world is already ridiculous so why not “that that”. whatever the highly provocative and ever-intuitive language of English says to say, I’ll try to say, so THAT ppl know wtf I’m fucking saying maybe just, EVER... right? Okay so) 

happens.

totally.I make sure i always bring my own pipe.. like they load the bowl FAT (I only load what ima smoke then and there) and burn their meth soo bad it turns into a dark caramel/black color and they put their torch or lighter right to the bowl.. it makes me sad and kinda stinks it up making me nauseous/gag inside. 

When they offer me a hit i politely decline i always hold my torch 4-6 inches depending from my meth pipe or lighter and twist my shit 10 2 10 2 they don't even twist some of them and have been using for longer than I have! 

I have y'all to thank for showing me the proper techniques and my old plug.. also when youre melting it youre supposed to blow out first then inhale as it smokes up to mitigate the amount of cut in your product my buddy taught me this and it's actually better to do!!Yo my skeletons it's time to UP your food game with some calorie dense healthy food like salmon, avocado, walnuts and plenty of berries for antioxidants - easy to snack on and will fill out that gaunt face 😱You guys seem to want to know how I got shot. Well here is the story.

I met Christine in the Elks Lodge of all places. She was on xanax and crack and she was a top shelf alcoholic, like 6 pack in the morning alcoholic. I found out later that she was a biker chick and her old man rode with the Outlaws MC. I don't think that he was a patched in member though.A wimpy ass like me should have never gotten near her, but you know, the moth and the flame.

Christine was fairly attractive although her face was rough. She had long blonde hair, nice boobs, thin waist and a fat ass. She also had a Tonka Toy yellow Hemi Ram pickup with "It's 5 o"clock somewhere" on the tailgate. Best of all she had a SS custom chopper that she rode like a demon.

One Saturday, Christine on her chopper roared into my driveway and came to my door dressed in her biker nymph outfit. My Oh My. We were talking and she just climbed into my lap. And BOING, it was on. This was not my fault. No man could resist. No man.

We settled into some type of relationship with me on heroin and her on alcohol, crack and xanax - like 5 footballs a day, half a bottle of Crown and a rock of crack.

She talked me into buying her a handgun, since she was a felon and she needed a straw man. She was afraid that the Outlaws would come to get her. She wanted this $590 Glock .40 caliber, but no way I was buying her that. I bought her this $125 .22 revolver made By Charter Arms or Raven Arms or Taurus Arms - one of those cheap gun manufacturers. The gun was a POS. Sometimes it fired. Sometimes it didn't.. A gun guy told me that it had weak pull or something. You gun guys here might know what that means. Anyway a true Saturday Night Special.

One night, Christine was cracked out of her mind and swore that there was someone outside her house. I looked out. It was 3am and nothing was moving - not even the rats.But out she runs,  gun locked and loaded. 

After a while, I decided to go out too. Bad move. I don't what Christine was thinking, but she shot me in the arm. Thank God it was a 22. The bullet took off some skin and meat from my bicep.  I wrapped up my wound and it healed OK. And that's it. No big firefight in the street. Sorry to disappoint you.With the stigma of meth theres also the stigma that all users are pieces of shit, thieves, liars etc. How many people here use and pay for their own stuff, treat other people good, and dont lie?

 I use and the people i know that use dont fit the sterotype at all, i pay for my own stuff, never steal, treat the people around me with kindness and respect. 

Dont get me wrong ik one or two tweakers that are pieces of shit and fit the sterotype, but everyone else ik that uses dont fit that sterotype. How many people here can say that they dont fit that sterotype either?So what happened was...

So i often smoke (both cigarettes and meth) in this enclosed "lean-to" type structure attached to the bay door garage. Its a brick garage, and this lean to structure is composed of the same brick as the rest of the building; save for one, ~10ft wide "open" side in the front of the structure. To close that front a bit more I've added an outdoor "room divider" type thing. Very private when one wants it to be.

My front porch, however, is most certainly not private. But, sometimes a change of scenery is nice.

So i think to myself, "I'll just smoke a cigarette real quick on the front porch, then head to the back! Easy peasy." I take my lil makeup bag that holds my dope, pipe, torch and other various lil scrapey/scoopy tools. Everything i use. Everything i need. All of it. In that lil ipsy bag.

So i sit on my front porch. I enjoy the crickets. I admire the trees. I spot a mushroom. All is peaceful.

And then i get an impulse.

"I know! Ill finally take care of that underground yellow jacket nest over there!"

I have never taken care of a yellow jacket nest.

Id heard that diesel fuel or gasoline would suffocate them. I grab the gas can.

I quickly realize I've underestimated not only how much gas i should use; but also just how many of those striped demons live down there.

I did not  acknowledge until after I'd rained poison down upon mine enemy that there was only maybe 2fl oz of gas left in that can.

I flee. I run as swiftly as my short lil legs can take me. I abandon not only my cigarettes, lighter, earbuds and bottle of brisk tea on the front porch - but also that special lil ipsy bag.

It sounds like hail hitting my front glass storm door and living room windows. There are hundreds of these feisty fucks pelting my dwelling - emboldened by rage and driven by bloodlust to seek revenge for the threat I'd posed to theirs.

Id thought for sure they'd give up soon, just give them 20-30 mins. No. This was at 11pm. It is now nearly 3:30 am. They are relentless in their efforts - and now have been driven to substance abuse. They are invading that special lil ipsy bag. An inch or so unzipped, these fuckers have found their way inside. They are supplying stimulants to the troops. They will surely stop at nothing now.

I want my god damn drugs back.I’d wake up every morning, bright eyed n bushy tailed, ready to face the day. Work starts at 5:30am sharp n I like to get there early, so I’d be up by the witching hour. The whole household would still be sleeping soundly upstairs. 

I’d smoke a bowl and get myself ready. Sometimes I’d leave the house early and meet up with a friend, to smoke and talk and just bullshit around until I had to leave for work. (None of my friends were people that I could bring home, so doing it this way was the only way I could have a social life. Anyway, I’m a mom and wife by day, and have a household to maintain.) 

Other times, I would finish up a few household chores before I left, which always got me brownie points with the old man when he got up. He’d wake up to a clean kitchen, dishes done, laundry folded...and text me cheery things like “thanks baby; you’re the best; you’re superwoman; have a great day at work”.

And I always would. I was never late for work, and I loved my job. (I still do, but it’s not the same.) I drive a garbage truck. Primo career for a meth head amirite? I find the coolest stuff all the time, I just have a good eye for trash-that’s-not-trash. 

I’m a driver, and each day I’m provided with a “thrower”. That’s a person (typically a dude) who rides on the side of my truck and throws the trash for me. It’s not a job for everyone (and thrower pay is kinda shitty) so turnover is crazy high. This meant that I would meet multiple new people a week but there was little obligation to actually form genuine relationships with them. I could tell the same stories, the same jokes, and they’d be brand new every time. The person would be gone before I ran out of things to say, and there’d be a new person in their place. 

Most people willing to work trash are pretty laid back, don’t-give-a-fuck types; my kinda people. The majority of them got high too. When I got a new guy with me, I’d say, “Welcome to Truck 16, the Party Truck. Do you like to party?” 9/10 times the answer would be yes. The 1/10 would just laugh, thinking I was being funny. When I got those ones, we’d just smoke weed instead. (Everyone smokes weed.)

I’d always be willing to motivate my throwers; I’d throw them a line or give them a hot rail and they would become trash slinging fiends. We’d bust the route out in no time, have a good time doing it, and be home before lunch. 

Looking back, there surely was a dark side to this. I could have made addicts out of some of them. Most of them were occasional users, not daily like me. Some would use words like “relapse” when talking about meth. I tried to be more quiet with those ones. I would never offer them anything...But I didn’t have to. Every time, they would end up asking me for it. And...I didn’t care where someone was at on their meth journey. If they wanted to get high, then we’d get high. I don’t care about your moral dilemmas. This is the party truck.

They come and go so much, it’s almost like they’re just another piece of equipment on the truck. Living equipment. My boss just refers to them as “bodies”. If we are short on throwers, she will call the office and tell them, “get me three new bodies by tomorrow morning, thank you.” Sometimes I’d forget they were real people with real lives. 

I did have some great ones over the years though. Some real ride or die types. A few of them I will never forget. I wonder about them occasionally. What happened to them after they just disappeared one day, like they always do. I’ll never know. I hope I didn’t hurt them. But I know that some of them, I probably did. I didn’t mean to. I wonder how they remember me now, and their time on the Party Truck. I imagine for most of them it is a strange blip in their life. For me, it WAS my life.

But man, I miss it. 

I’m nearly 3 months sober now. (It sounds like nothing but feels like forever.) Sobriety wasn’t really my choice or something I was ready for. I love my job still, but it’s not the same. Nothing is the same. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks for hearing me out. There’s not much point to this i guess except to get some of this off of my chest; nobody in my life wants to hear about how much I miss doing meth every day. They want to hear about how much better my life is without it. How much I cringe looking back at the old times. But I don’t cringe looking back. It’s nothing but fond memories. Maybe that’s the dope playing tricks on my mind. But it feels real. My life was the shit. Now my life feels like shit. LOL.

Anyway. End rant I guess. Don’t really have a conclusion to this. I haven’t gotten closure myself either, so it’s not really something I can lend to this story. Just wanted to share the memories.First off, allow me to introduce our three new moderators, u/iammatt4ever420, u/allforspun, and u/spwunt! Please welcome them to the family, as they will be helping to make sure the subreddit doesn't descend into another pit of debauchery and dick pics.

&#x200B;

Second, now that we have found a few more moderators we will be lifting the post restrictions from the subreddit. We are sorry we had to put the restrictions in place, but u/_warped and I weren't able to patrol the subreddit 24/7 and since you guys can't seem to follow the few simple rules we have in place to protect our subreddit we were forced to restrict posts until we were able to moderate it properly. Hopefully with three new moderators, we should be able to moderate things much more efficiently than before.

&#x200B;

That pretty much covers everything. Make sure to follow the rules, and thank you for choosing to spend your time in our subreddit! Have a wonderful day.I think I have a hereditary predisposition for it anyway, (and I’m also a dancer so I have a very active lifestyle ) so that might have something to do with it, but I’ve been using for 4 years and I have noticed back pain and pain in my neck and shoulder joints that has gradually gotten worse with time. I think it might be early osteoarthritis but I’m only 24.God DAMN is there any feeling so good as being out of dope, then finding a shard nestled gently in the shag? THANK YOU SLOPPY PAST SELFTook 13 months in jail and a fresh start but I've been clean off crystal and black for 4 months. 25 now and started slamming at 18 and been off n on homeless and in jail. Finally got a job a car and more money saved then I ever have. Fuck I miss it tho. Shooting the fuck off with a half G shot and just the lifestyle with it.8 days clean from meth, I cut off all toxic people, family and sober friends are sticking by my side, been offered two jobs this year already despite being covered head to toe in tats (even face tats)

you can do it, you honestly just have to want to so bad, and have a reason why you want to. and that reason has to be for you. 

(for all family and friends of meth users, as much as it hurts when people go back on their word and relapse, or steal money from you/lie in general, just accept it's part of it and if that person wants to change, they can).

much love!Im not really a horror story. 5 years of functioning meth use here. 

However, it just gets really fucking BORING and OLD after awhile. And having it in your head almost constantly and in your dreams is quite hard on the depression. Long term effects are depression. I'm here in my apartment just barely awake and in bed pigging out, smoking weed/thc edibles and depressed despite being on meth. 

That's called a tolerance and its my day off.. literally smoked a bowl did a line earlier.. blacked out in bed and slept for 9 hours exhausted from work. Woke up feeling so refreshed yet confused at when i fell asleep.. and i was still wearing my make up and contacts sigh.So, I get my stuff from a solid, consistent source—a person I know in real life who is interested in keeping customers. But as my tolerance climbed a bit, I was finding all sorts of reasons to believe the quality had tanked. I was always saying to myself, “Sure this tastes bitter but is it really THAT bitter?” Or “Yea its dancing around in that cup of bleach but it could be a little livelier....”

I now think that I was being entirely too critical and not looking at my own consumption and tolerance level. I recently had to travel across the country and stay with my mother for a few weeks while she recovered from an operation. I brought a little product but blew through it, and so I decided to try cold copping in an unfamiliar city and was promptly ripped off. Dumb move, I know— I’m entirely too trusting. I’m not even sure what I got sold, could’ve been laundry powder, but I can say that there wasn’t a speck of real shit in the whole 8 ball. (Though the dude did go to the trouble of weighing it out correctly, which is a little bit funny)

I can’t afford to keep getting ripped off, so I just took a break and things went pretty smoothly. This week I returned home to my stash and did a little bit and, yknow what, this stuff I get is pretty ‘fire’ as the kids say.

So I guess the perspective I wanted to share and encourage is this: paranoia can get the best of you, and it’s very easy to forget/refuse to turn the critical lens on oneself. Now that I’ve had a few weeks away from it, my stuff tastes SO bitter and it really scoots around on that bleach, too. I was just being a little bitch. Don’t be like me. Don’t be a little bitch.

One love.Just your daily reminder to lax your jaws and loosen those shoulders up, thats all for now, jog on sonThoughts on effectiveness?

UPDATE #2: In a shocking turn of events I have again, yes again, witnessed this unbelievable act in a zoom room (it was by no means a private situation--there were over 250 people in. the room).  I asked the man doing this why and here was the response:

Me to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Direct Message) (3:08 AM)

Might I ask what is the advantage of that route of administration?    

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to Me (Direct Message) (3:10 AM) 

it will soak in at the prostate and bladder. it’s not but .1 but I’ll be hard very shortly and an amazing orgasm

There you have it.  Directly from the horse's mouth...

UPDATE: Some back story...

I commented about the origins of this in a comment below so I will reiterate it here for the sake of everyone's peace of mind.

During the pandemic I have taken to some pretty sketchy, for lack of a better term, ZoomOrgies/circle jerks and I have seen many things I haven't witnessed before.

Of particular note, there was an evening where I came across a rather attractive guy and we started chatting.  At one point he picks up a water bottle and shakes it.  No big whoop.  The next thing I know he is shoving what appears to be a length of plastic tubing into his dickhole (I know.  I felt the same way you do).  He then proceeds to gingerly pour the contents of the bottle into the tube and therefore into his penis. This was a rare time in my life where I was stunned.

So, since I have been pondering what was in that bottle? Since the DOC there was meth, my mind naturally went to the booty bump philosophy yet I had never heard of such a method used on the penis.

Now, could I have looked any old place on the interwebs for the answer? I suppose.  Would I get the hard-earned, feet-on-the-street experience of the r/meth user base? Certainly not.

You all have posted some shit on here that would never have crossed my mind so I thought why not return the favor? As we can all see it has amassed quite a little following in its time--even earning me my first awards from the community.  For that I'm honored.

Now seeing as I have now been observing New Years Eve for 4.5 days (don't worry I have taken my vitamins/meds daily, eaten and hydrated abundantly and somehow even got 10 hours of sleep cumulatively on 2 of the nights) it is now time for me to jerk off a little more and go to bed :)So i haven't been using it that long only ever since October. But my boyfriend has been and i first smoked with him in October and do it maybe 3 times a week...But goodness. Does anyone else get super horny and have the best orgasms while they are high? I feel like its spoiled sober sex for me lolToday I am quitting this evil drug.I spent every last dime on it and then eventually started stealing.Please wish me luck on this journey.so in high school i never did any drugs and graduated with a 3.5 gpa. after that I went straight to the marine corps. and was there for 3 years and after that I moved in with my high school girlfriend when I was 21. Then one day I went to wal mart to get some stuff for her apartment, and I saw this one dude from high school and he was fuckin' crazy shit man. him and some of his buddies were smoking meth and I couldn't help but wanna try. I took a hit, just one puff, and HOLY FUCK!! It was amazing!! I had my rollerblades on, and I kept roller blading for 6 hours straight! I got lost and didn't come back with the groceries, I had to call my girlfriend to pick me up. I never stopped doing meth. I never told my girlfriend about me doing meth until valentine's day this year!! I fucking love meth and I'm going to keep doing meth for the rest of my life! If you've never done meth before, then holyy FUCK!! You're missing out on the greatest thing ever in the world.  it was too thick to suck into the syringe until I reached 30cc in the solution. when the taste hit my mouth, it was so strong that the inside of my mouth got warm and the back of my neck got hot. the euphoria is so strong that I almost feel like I'm rolling. I have reached a new level of high for myself and its incredibleHey all, longtime lurker first time poster, but I felt it was worth it to hopefully help other individuals avoid a few hellish, multi-week / month long experiences I had due to using meth. At this point I can now use meth and enjoy it while also not acting like I'm headed for a psych ward to my loved ones. I'm going to share some tips that if I had heard when I first started out would have saved me a ton of shitty drug experiences.  


1. Supplements can be useful but don't go overboard. I ended up racking up something like 50 different bottles of supplements and taking different stacks seemingly at random because I "felt wierd". Supplements won't help you here- eating, hydrating (but not too much), and sleeping are the key to success. Supplements can help fill the gaps but if you don't have the necessary human-living functions alongside they will do jack all and likely make things worse.
2. If you feel like you're dying after doing some meth, tell yourself (or even better, tell a trusted friend / fellow tweaker) "I feel like I'm dying right now. I will check back in with that feeling in <some reasonable time period> but until then I am going to do <some activity that ISN'T sitting couch-locked thinking>". My reasonable time period started as 1 hour but is now 24 hours. This has worked wonders for keeping me CALM on meth which is MUCH better than being stressed the fuck out thinking you're dying.
3. Accept the binge, mitigate the consequences, and when the meth runs out it runs out. When I do meth I buy 4g that is shipped to me. I will use meth every day until that 4g runs out. Once that 4g runs out, I will not buy more meth for between 3 to 6 months. I accept that I am not going to sleep some nights (like tonight) but I mitigate the negatives of that choice by, say, ensuring I have a lot of meetings at work the next day so I stay present and engaged. I find it much more harmful to my health and well-being to guilt-trip myself during the entire binge and it just isn't fun. 
4. Fucking. Move. Right. Now. Get up and dance a jig. Waggle your arms. Pick up your legs and do high steps. Lay on the ground and scoot around with your feet. Meth likes to keep us physically locked which is murder for our bodies and health. Once I learned the magic of moving and changing positions on meth with little physical activities interspersed throughout I stopped experiencing 99% of the physical symptoms (soreness, weakness, lethargy, dizziness, cracking joints, cold extremeties, etc.) DESPITE how deep into a binge I was. Move and move often.
5. Allow yourself the freedom to get weird if you want. This loops back into the guilt aspect. Sometimes on meth I complete an absolutely ridiculous amount of work. Sometimes on meth I wear lingerie, use an anal plug, and masturbate furiously to swaths of different porn. Just go with the flow and don't resist how you're currently being pulled to much.

I hope someone finds these tips helpful and as I think of more I'll be sure to add them. What tips do you have for enjoying the freakin' heck out of this wonderfully and dreadfully fun substance?You have questions?

https://afterdarksecret.wordpress.com/What catch 22 this drug is. I mean, so I LOVE using but it comes with a price. For example. . . 

Isolation,  complete Isolation. 

-I don't hang with many because most addicts are savage. 
-They steal your shit. . My wallet, my phone, my blue tooth speaker. . Stolen the other day.  I had one girl over , she smoked heroin.  Her ride came, I said no one in the house.  She left,  so did my stuff. 
-Most addicts are ignorant or constantly on defense mode. 
-Some don't shut their mother fucking mouth and give me anxiety up the wall.
-Some lie, and take sook fucking long to do anything or get anywhere. 

Weight Loss 
-I am at the stage where my appetite is still very suppressed.
-Usage stress and depression leaves me with no appetite.
- because I'm so skinny the fat came immediately off my tits and ass.  I am more self-conscious of my body while on dope then I was off and heavier. 
- the indented wrinkly stretch marks are way more obvious now there is hardly any meat on my bones.
-this makes me very paranoid in sexual situations with others so now I just masturbate on my own. 

Mental Health
- self-medicating, the minute I start coming down I feel depressed,  I cry , and I hate myself and life. No motivation,  can't even leave house.
-on it I'm over the top intense. Don't interrupt me cuz I am on one. Happily distracted and can. Get irritable when things become annoying , including people. 
- Nobody seems to care about me as much since I started using. It's like I'm alone on this island. 

Annoyances 
- meth and shopping are a bad combo for me, I tend to scan every shelf in the store and leave buying way more than i need. 
-my knees turn purple and it makes me self-concious in summer.
-muscle atrophy and orthostatic blood pressure got me dizzy and winded and exasperated at times.  
- mouth is always dry.
- pile shifting or just focusing on useless activities. 
-no matter what i sleep during the day and up at night.
- over heat terribly in the summer


Just plain self - concious though. About a lot of things.I just turned 20 two weeks ago, I was dating a girl 10 years older than me since I was 18. I remember we started as friends, then we became really good friends until one day we kissed and history changed at least for me, we fell in love and you know we did everything two people who love each other does. When we started dating, she was going through some shit with her husband, anyways he left. But then I went away because I got caught up in the wrong lifestyle. When I came back to town I started using, same thing I went away a couple months, (we would still text each other here and there) couple months back I came back to town and we started dating again but this time it was a little bit more serious, she went out of her way to be with me and help me with my addiction, she would leave her kids alone at home just to be with me and push me to be a better me. At the time I cared but not really. I was devoted to my addiction and then she got tired, she left me yesterday because of my addiction, at the same time that I’m really trying to quit for good and have a better life, finish high school and enlist in the army so I can have a career. I tried to explain all of this to her but she’s just done trying and putting her life on hold waiting for a change, I don’t blame her though. I know it was my fault and I know she deserves a better man. I hope one day we could see each other again and when that happens I’ll be the man I always wanted to be. If you read all this I appreciate your time🤝 it’s not the end, I always tell myself this “What is a mistake without the lesson?” 
Ima keep moving forward and live through the pain that’s the only way I can overcome this and become a real man, I wanna take responsibility for my life and make myself proud. Thank you for y’all time. Remember what is a mistake without the lesson?I started looking at 10 this morning. It's almost 5pm. I have 2 that are "on their way" one who is coming with an 8ball. The other a half oz. But, they've both been on the way for like 4 fucking hours. I have to get to work tomorrow at like 10 and I'm worried they'll both be like "here" right as I leave for the office. Why cant fucking meth dealers be more reliable? I know this isn't dominoes but jesus tap dancing christ it's been 7 fucking hours! I'm also about to cancel on them both and just go to bed. Hopefully they come thru. Updates as news breaksI live in an apartment complex and I smoke on two to three days a week. The walls are thin so I use all the stealth I can think of. I use a candle for heat and even light it using an electric lighter that makes no sound. I’ve always been told the vapor has no odor. 

However, every time I use I can hear the neighbor say “He is doing it again.” I know it can’t be from any sound. Is it possible they can smell it? It is high quality and I don’t detect an odor. Could they be seeing some of the vapor in their place?

I am baffled and welcome any ideas that I haven’t though of.Today is my first day off of Meth. I'm hoping by documenting my experiences I will have a better chance at staying clean I am very sore tired and mentally drained from my last 3 Day Bender no sleep no food no human interaction I feel like a bag of smashed assholes hopefully I can remain sober and get my life back on trackFuck me, I am a total dumbass for thinking I could get a relationship to work with another tweaker. Like considering the gong pageantry relationships already are for me when I'm sober with my wits about me—what the hell was I thinking with this shit? 

Relationships? Hey, those things are ez pz. Surely I could do interpersonal relations while gacked off my tits the whole time! I can't remember to disconnect my phone from the bathroom speaker's Bluetooth before I go to start a 4-hour DJ set down in Club Clitoris playing the infectious beats of dudes literally beating their dicks onto a set of tits while my roommate is trying to take a bath, but I can navigate the ups and downs of meeting another person's needs. That's me, miss relationship professional. 

Tell Cousin Jeremy he can shut his fucking mouth because I'm gonna be bringing somebody home for Christmas this year and it's not going to be my guy friend, Brad this time. You know, the guy who could act about as convincingly straight as the candy cane on his fucking cashmere, deep v-neck sweater. Like fuck me, Brad. You couldn't even try to pretend you're into deep V's of the vaginal variety for an evening? *Oh, you didn't need to bring any fruitcake, Aunt Joan. I brought this fruitcake, my boyfriend Brad instead. Now can your son shut his pretty mouth up about my old highschool softball team before Brad fucks it? Thank yooooouuuuuuu.*

Really though. Relationships + meth = Brad for Christmas. Like meth on its own already storms into my life and drops it's monster dick on my brain's coffee table. Not only does being high make everything take waaaaaayyyy longer, but my emotions are way more intense. Like more intense than the awkward collective boners from a troop of boy scouts on a camping trip all bundled into their sleeping bags trying to pretend they don't all just want to jerk off. Which if they're pitching tents in tents, well that's pretty intense. 

Needless to say, we argued constantly. We stayed up all night just arguing some nights thanks to our good friend Chris Dolmeth. We'd have killer make up sex but sadly, a few days per week filled with more O's than the chorus to Tarzan Boy doesn't make up for glaring incompatibility issues like *being a huge fucking asshole, Eric.* But whatever, dude. You always smoked way more than half of the shit anyways. At least Brad owns jeans, you fuck.First time ever slammed 1/2 gram about 45 minutes ago I am all sorts of f’ed up right now. I thought a .35-.40 was wicked powerful but damn, I had no idea. Shit. Supposed to meet my very disapproving boyfriend at 7 and I have to be a lot less high by then. 2 hours, man am I screwed or what!!!!???this is more towards those who slam honestly but i noticed they LOVE trying to get people to try it. i've been around people who slam who try to subtly get me to do it. for example, i was around a group of people who all slammed and they talked about me as if i wasn't there. "if she hasn't slammed yet, only a matter of time till she tries." and whenever they would make comments like that, they'd look at me all creepy. this has happened multiple times, at least twice w different people. why do yall think some users almost find pleasure in aiding someone ruining their life?So I can buy more meth. Then I use more meth, so I can work even harder... To buy more meth. (;

Who else been grinding?This is my own list of tips & tricks I’ve learned along the way, especially when you feel like you’re going crazy, and you don’t know if it’s you, the meth, those around you or a combination there-of.

1. Drink a lot of water, no shit right? But specifically anytime you catch yourself after zoning out on something, DRINK WATER learn to associate the physical act of drinking water with “damn it’s been that long?”

2. Anytime you lie, regardless of the reason, repeat it back to yourself in your head: I am lying to ______ because ________. 
3. Along with #2, know your intention of shit, in communication or actions. If you dont know and it just sounds cool aka not a lot of detail, (e.g your friend invites you over and there’s no detail about what yall’re gonna do, if you’re gonna stay there, how long you’re hanging, etc) Otherwise you could fuck yourself up real quickly thinking too deep about shit, when it conflicts w your personal values, and self image. 
4. Self reflection and journaling is a must, it’s helped me tremendously realizing that I was causing a lot of my own problems, I know this bc I can read what was on my mind 2 weeks ago+ how long and last time I slept at that time. (Very helpful bc you can see your own patterns with #days awake and how erratic your thoughts are)
5. Always eat something even if you don’t feel like it if you can’t remember what you last ate or when it was, EAT SOMETHING & if you are like me and just forget to eat at times; stock up on Cliff bars. Carry them in your car, purse, desk, everywhere.
6. Effexor has helped me quit this shit cold turkey before, not recommending it for that necessarily, but saying it to emphasize that checking out antidepressants is very very smart. Especially if you’re leaning towards quitting. No insurance? Google your county’s or city’s behavioral health department. I was surprised to learn my city offered assistance for that.
7. Practicing DBT skills is a lifesaver, it teaches you to calm down and assess your emotions before acting
8. Time yourself or be mindful of the amount of time it takes doing random shit like replying to Facebook trolls, what do you gain from it? Outside of feeling important to yourself.
9. Seroquel is super helpful when you need to sleep and feel yourself going crazy but won’t admit it to your loved ones that you need sleep bc then you’ll never hear the end of it. I’m out for like 10/12 hours sometimes. I do it at day 2 now just cause it’s a nice reset for my body
10. Be conscious of who comes and who stays in your life. Their reasoning for doing so. Otherwise time will fly by, and a year later you’ll see how much time you wasted on some stupid tinder boy that also smokes, who was giving you subtle hints all along to leave. It’s so much harder forgiving & trusting yourself when you get in too deep, and then say fuck it sunk cost fallacy.. You’re only as far out as you believe you are though, let that empower you that you are always there inside, you have goodness inside you too.
11. The Ironic processing theory is so real it’s funny, meditation works wonders for peace.

God bless and I hope all yall have a good day and know that you matter always, despite your mistakes, you are a person still, one who’s most certainly worthy and deserving of your own love, and living a life that you actually love. You got this <3My days of tweaking have ended. I quit ice 3 days ago and am not feeling too bad. I can not deny that this drug has instigated the hedonistic, selfish, chemically dependant psycho that has always existed with me. I miss the old me. I want to end this nightmare. I have made the decision to attend a 30 day inpatient rehab across the state. I leave this afternoon to board my flight. Trying this drug was among one of the stupidest things I have done and is a decision that instigated a battle I will be fighting til the end of my days. It would have been best had I never even tried it. But what's done is done and I must live with myself now. I plan to abandon all drug use, get myself together, and build a life that will bring me more joy than drugs ever did. I never wanted to be "that guy" 

I never wanted to be the guy who spent most of his paycheck on illegal drugs. I never wanted to be the guy who writhed in paranoia and guilt over the knowledge that he was doing something very wrong. I never wanted to be the guy who pawned the tablet he purchased specifically for his hobbies( language learning) to get some more ice. I never wanted to be the guy sweating a putrid odor, viciously and deviantly masturbating. I never wanted to be the guy living in fear of the police. I never wanted to be the guy running around at night in search of drugs in a bad neighborhood. I never wanted to be the guy controlled by his lustful instincts and depravity. I never wanted to be the guy with burns and sores on his face. 

I never thought the first time I'd be boarding a plane would be for me to go to Rehab. It wasn't supposed to be this way.. I was supposed to be something. To do something. I had dreams.  Dreams of dining in a cafe in Tbilisi, whilst conversing with the locals in their native tounge. Dreams of achieving fluency in the languages I fell in love with. Dreams of traveling with the beautiful girl who crushed on me and caressed my shoulder. But now its just this. The repugnant taste of toxicity on my tounge. The solid stem of an oil burner against my lips.  The bi weekly pickups where most of my paycheck went to. Blowing thick white clouds out of my mouth into the night air. Gradually seeing my teeth erode through the months. My face sinking in. Hearing voices from the airvent. Feeling bugs crawling inside me. 
 
I have had enough. I will obliterate the walls I have built around me and become a happy and respectable member of society again. I will not despair, I will be free.It’s 330am and I’m outside smoking a stoge and there are some birds chirping already. WTF! Anyone get crazy anxiety when they hear this shit even when you’re off the next day?? I think it’s the idea the sun will be up soon and you’re just overcome with shame because you haven’t slept a wink and you’re high as fuck on meth.I can feel myself going crazy. Weed helps a lot. 
A little bowl whenever you feel anxiety really helps, coffee, tobacco, exercise, work, video games. Whatever I can keep my mind occupied withI was wrong about meth girls. Now that I've met a few, I now know that you women are smart and cool and sexy and way out of my league. Mea Culpa.I hadn’t done crystal in 3 years... got two grams on New Years stayed up all night... smoked a bowl of weed in the morning.... had a panic attack... I could feel God telling me to “flush it” “get rid of it” .... so I flushed what I had left...  

It was too much for me... my tolerance was so low I felt like I was frying... I could feel my heart pumping like crazy.... and it wasn’t as good as I remembered anyway... how do people do this stuff without heroin or benzos? 

If you would’ve asked me 3 years ago if I would ever flush 2 grams down the toilet I would tell you that’s blasphemy... now is the time to quit since judgement day is comingnever thought I'd be a PSA for abstinence but meth is not a substance to flex with... e.g., when one shows up to a party as a 'meth-virgin' one should prolly be HONEST AF about it. otherwise they gonna rip you a new asshole... 

in my experience, the tweakers I've met are pretty reluctant to injure the fresh-meat with an LD50 of the most potent and toxic substance on earth. they want your body, your cash, or summa your stash first!

everyone has crazy crank stories but my first  was slamming a shot intended for a metheran and being completely BLOWNOUT (or so I thought at the time)... there was no way this was erotic (2 me). my typically 10" hardon went more flaccid than it was the day I was born. I did not want to fuck anyone anymore. all I wanted to do was talk philosophy, do push-ups, and smoke cigs (maybe dial 91 and wait for symptoms of psychosis?). 

it was an odd dissonance = GODMODE (but with the crushing humiliation that comes with detumescence and this lurking sense that you may very well die naked, covered in lube, with strangers). 

"Hi mom."

However, the show must go on!

I showed up there as a 'TOP' (having sent pics of my usually reliable cock) and this gracious couple was DTF!  what would you have done? I ignored my useless dong and tried to make their experience epic by being the best asseater in North America. I'm an eager beaver and I made up for my lack of boner by burying my face in their cracks for hours, deep-throating, ATMs, etc.

I tried to cram decades of porn inspired fantasies into one night. I was overwhelmed. 

I've since been back there twice trying to, "get it right" and every time I slam too much fucking meth and my dick doesn't cooperate... (not the way it does in my bedroom when I get home and think about things anyways). 

it gets worse (or better (if your into this sorta thing)).

by thanksgiving I sold my body in a trailer to a dealer (that looked nothing like his pics, was sickly, and enjoyed kissing... yuck)! but by god I was starting to get a little harder. like I was getting off on the shame? I deserve this for being born a goddamned freakazoid?! I was confused when he gave me bags  to take home, like "no shit! thanks man."

\[ASIDE: now I know why whores always have drug stashes. as in; what kinda 'addict' keeps a stockpile of drugs in their home? anything I have - I'm doing until its gone. (unless of course dudes are just throwing bags at you all the time\]

in hindsight - he prolly owed me a key (for (at least) rimming his hemorrhoid (I think it was a roid. I have limited experience with buttholes)).

I can keep going... tell you about booty-bumping the rest of that stash (half gramish) not realizing it had been 5 days with no sleep, food, shower, calling 911, asking them for help, then eloping from the ER and running around my hometown in hospital scrubs, freezing cold, and telling everyone who would listen what a shameful asseater I am. 

I completely forgot that boofing is basically the same as slamming. 

I would never even consider slamming a half gram of meth.

That there is the problem with harm-reduction. when inhibitions are lowered, what's the harm in some more? 

I did not know there was such a thing as VIOLENT CRYING until I KNEW I was going to die from that one simple mistake of saying, "fuck it, I'll just finish the shit, cuz if it's in the house it's all I'll think about." 

then comes the apophenia - the signs and portends that its time to get 'clean' again, and to set an 'example' ... to repurpose the shame and regret into something useful... yada yada yada ad infinitum.

folks, i just signed out of another psych-ward and within 24 hours I was in a hotel room trauma-bonding with a new 'friend' (who was cool with just letting me ramble on and on and on...) but again, I slammed too much, the pecker failed, but we cuddled, and it was nice being the little spoon for a change...

I think I might be gay.

edited: to fix a spellcheck failThere is no hunger, there is no thirst,

There is only raw, kinetic energy.

The first spark, the first cloud -

The world rearranges itself to your liking

And in that singular, ineffable moment,

You feel the most euphoria a human can feel.

"It's better than sex," some will say. 

Others intone gravely the many costs.

Can you imagine, really imagine for me,

Just for a minute or two,

What you felt when you held your newborn

For the very first time?

Do you remember how time slowed down,

How all other concerns and worries

Became meaningless, hollow paper tigers?

What if you could feel that again

Anytime you felt like it, over and over?

Would you?

Will you?I love all of you, no matter what youre going through. You are all people and you all deserve the most you can get out of yourselves. You are all perfect in your own ways, and ill always be here if you need any emotional support.
Take care of youselves, drink water, snd love yourself.Feels like I can’t stop

I’ve hit further than rock

And I don’t think theres a bottom

Cuz I just keep on falling

I keep telling myself to steer clear

But I got no will power here

The only friends left say to turn to God 

But I’ve tried and it’s so fucking hard

I wish my family could be the reason

I often think of them when I’m using

It’s pretty much treason the way I’m continually abusing

I’ve tried to run but I can’t outrun myself

And I can’t seem to locate the right help

One moment I’m high I feel alive and great

The next moment reveals it was a lie and I’m the number one person I hate

I need to get the hell out of this place

Phone God to see if he has space

But I’m probably going to hell at this rate

Never really did like the heat

But seems like no matter what I do I’m attached to life on the streets

Was the motivation to initially start

A proper one for fucking up my heart

I don’t want my life to end now

so someone give me the antidote to find the way out

©️Wish me luck y'all, I'm gonna need it. I feel like I've been away for 3 weeks and I'm ready to come back home. I have spent the last two days feeling the worst I've felt in a very long time. I can't believe I did that. I feel like I got hit by a train of guilt, embarrassment, regret, and disgust and I damn do I deserve feeling like this. This sucks. My sores hurt. I feel like worthless trash. I have been on and off using since I was 16 (iv) and I'm 24 now. I have been fucking around with this deceitful and malicious drug for long enough to know better. Why do I keep going back...? What can I do to make this relapse the last one...? other than treatment/ therapy, I'm poor and have no insurance, oh haha the irony of a druggie. If I put my money where my track marks were I wouldn't be typing this right now or feeling like a giant piece of shit. Fuck the needle. If you have read this far I'll assume you are wither bored or high so send help, prayers and positive vibes for this idiot who needs to get their life straight before I lose everything.So I'm quitting again and I've been trying to satisfy my fiending by watching people smoke. My problem is that very few people know how to smoke without burning their shit. So time to teach some of y'all that haven't gotten the basics yet. Feel free to add your own tips, hopefully I won't be needing them.

Melting down

Take your bic lighter, start far away from the pipe and slowly circle the flame around the puddle. If it's not melting then move it a bit closer until you see it starting to melt. Be patient because it's better than burning it. 

When it's starting to melt ease up a bit, focus more the the centre as thats likely where most of the unmelted crystal is. The residual heat from the glass should do most of it for you. 

Make sure all the meth has turned into puddle form and try to evenly coat the bottom of the bowl without breaking up the puddle. 

Let it crystalize. Blow out the vapor from melting it down, you do not want to breathe those chemicals in.  The crackback should look something like broken glass. 

Smoking

To smoke the meth you want to do much the same thing as you do for melting down. It will melt down much faster now that it's a thin layer rather than a small pile of crystal. Cook it evenly to stop yourself burning it. 

Wait until there's a bit of vapor before starting to breathe in. Then very gently suck while rocking it from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock. You want to move the puddle/pipe to follow the flame not the other way around. 

The vapor will form because the puddle is touching cooler glass than it was touching. Breathing in will draw cold air through the carb also helping to cool it and increase the amount of vapor. 

So the main points: 
Circle slowly
One puddle
Cook evenly
Slow breaths
Ten to two
Cold makes vapor

Stay safe out there and don't let meth take away the things that matter to you.man... so, I got demons, like literally. i got these creatures from another dimension fucking with me and my computerrs and my car and my home and everyone i know. 

They fucking connected a circuit to my dad's ears several months ago, this has been going on for over 9 months and meth has been the one thing keeping me sane. EDIT- i could hear through his ears, 1500 miles away without him knowing. i knew it was him cuz he was at work and i could hear him working.*

I got these voices that come by calling me 'Son', they seem like angels.
Then i got fuckin what they have come to tell me are DJINN, that face rape me like alien face huggers. 

anyone have any idea wtf is going on?

this is some highly fucked up shit going on, and i thought i had to have been losing my mind but nah, this is really happening to me, and i witness other people with the same problems they just dont know it's DJINN, aka SHAYTAN, AKA SATAN. I'm kinda venting. this might be better as a IAMA demon possessed explorerer, as i starte using meth as a medicine since it has certain properties that have helped me immensely.
Istead of going to the hospital, i was able to fix a problem i have with hfcs, and a hole in my bladder that the djinn gave me. what happens is, using the way meth speeds up the cellular growth rate, i have been able to fix my bladder, going from urinating the amount of 1 third a bottle of water, to two thirds so far. problem is, something happened and they tell me, the demons, that i am now psychic, and i can see between wolds.
what it is, I believe, is i am somehow raising my entire consciousness and being into the lower astral plane.

any thoughts on where i might be at?


oh edit:

theres an ionispheric console interface for the GAMES, they call this the WORLD PHONE, it's a command interface using songs. that uses the ionisphere to talk to everyone in demon world, there's like 91 games last i knew several month ago. 

i was able to turn off the shit, it was pissing me off greatly. the songs are fucking horrible. and the idea is fucking so stupid as fuck. a command console and interface that uses illogic for the commands? motherfuckers.

I am addicted to porn, and keep thinking the next trade will be the one that changes things…

I thought I could look up to you lot.  I really did.  You are all Chads banging coke off a strippers 8 ball.

I never seem to get it right, it is like you guys actually say the opposite of what logic dictates every time, probably about 70% of the time, all the time.  EVERY TIME!!!


I am gonna take all the Benadryl in the medicine cabinet and have a nice long talk with the mouse living in my vents….

I just can’t do it anymore. No matter what I do I get it wrong.

There is no winning.
Capitalism has failed us all.

Even the dags I walk don’t respect me.  Yesterday Karen’s dog pissed on my leg.


Just…. Please….  I don’t know what to do anymore.  I need a handout. Just another stimulus check and maybe the market will go my way.

I am at a loss fellas…..  thank you for the comradery but with all due respect, fuck you all…













See you MondayLot to digest with FB down 25 percent. Lot of shit talking across reddit about the metaverse.  Truth is I bought a headset 3 weeks ago so did a couple friends of mine. Walking dead is serious good shit. But I'm not here for that you apes. Vr porn is next word. Anyone just watching regular porn hub is a boomer. This stock is going to the moon over the years. I'm long on FB stocks have positions. Your girlfriend is jealous Jim Cramer: "Russia-Ukraine situation is dire, and could have serious consequences."

Knowing his track record we all know how this is going to turn out. Inverse Cramer is always right.

So thank you Jim Cramer for helping us avoid World War III, and now we investors can get back to focusing on what really matters: the fundamentals of the companies we are invested in.The world printed trillions in fiat in 2020 2021. Some of it got directly infused in the economy, given to people. 

Most corporations had record profits, absorbing most of those printed fiats. Sure, some went to pay the wages, but mist were pure profit.

In time people spend more then they earn, everyone will need more money, money that is locked now in purchased assets leading to a recession.


Cash will become extremely valuable.

Printing money is off the table now for most governments.

Due to Russia war, devaluing the dollar us not am option anymore, the deal is made using yuans...

We are going for deflation and recession next few years, keep your cash liquidity and buy when every assets price will crash soon.

Tldr:  corporations absorbed most of the printed money, people spent most of their cash buying stuff, they ll need liquidity.

This is financial advice so we can all get rich.The year is 2022,  Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine and pushes NATO to their limit when he finally tweets a picture of a nuclear mushroom cloud. World War 3 is underway. Thousands of Gen Z kids are drafted into the military. You are a Russian troll bot at work one morning posting on Reddit about how Joe Rogan had sex with the devil to gain his notoriety when you suddenly hear Gucci Gang Gay Version played to the sound of rotary engines. Helicopters start flying overhead, and the song changes to Homo Flow, Shotta Flow Remix. The whole fucking area around you gets napalmed. Choppers drop off enemy troops and you get smoked by a 17 year old with a “Black Lives Matter” sticker on the side of his standard issue army helmet. As you lay on the floor bleeding to death he walks up to your body and proceeds to do TikTok dances over you while he Instagram livestreams the whole thing. You die a slow death alone in your troll bot farm.

-Idea from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/9qyd57/trump_declares_war_on_vietnam/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) but I changed some words to fit with the current situation.I haven't really heard anybody talk about this stock, but it seems like it goes up a lot. To be honest I'm not even sure what the company makes but I guess it must be something pretty good. Anybody have experience with $SPY? Could this be the next Face Book?Markets are in deep shit, and there is a short term disclocation ripe for exploitation

https://imgur.com/a/us6AyjL#r713TrZ

In January, a massive amount of puts being bought on indexes led to a 4.5% move on the SPX on Jan 24th, within the day institutional put selling reversed this and we saw a flat close

The resulting short vol being supplied has been what propped markets up recently, however with the  bout of bad news, these puts are now getting retested, whoever is holding these puts are now feeling nervous as we're beginning to close onto the lows seen in January 

The amount of put buying, and resultant put selling is extreme, rivalling Mar 2020 in notional value, and is all sitting on someones book

This is when the opportunity arises, during every OPEX cycle there is generally heightened volatility due to increased exposure to gamma from color decay, dealers will look to balance out
their books and from current positioning this will likely result in an acceleration into whichever direction the market moves into. This massive put short + MM rebalance will result in a convexity bomb if there is additional any downward pressure

**And to exploit this we want to slam it from two directions**

1. Long volatility products. Market maker liquidity retracts when vol is high, when vol is high efficient pricing becomes more difficult so they will increase bid ask spreads and reduce the total liquidity they provide, 
                                                                                                                                                  
       Widening these spreads will make it harder for institutions to unwind and further exacerbate the impact they have on the market, which will again further push moves down.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
 If Vol gets bid up this will not only push vol higher (and reflexivly create realised vol) but this will also effect dvol dvega and dvol ddelta on OTM puts and send them on a rehedging cascade.
                                                                                                                                                           As MM chaotically rehedge downwards whoever is short the puts will not be long for this world.


2. Shorting deltas directionally required to trigger these moves, adding to any bearish positioning from HF and institutes                                                                                                                                        
 All it takes is one scared risk manager to pull the plug and tell their desk to cut exposure

Resistance zone \~452

Support zone \~430

Following the pandemic crash the market has channeled perfectly in these parallel lines.  This trend has been broken, extremely bearish.  %K crossing %D on the stochastics, bearish indicator as the selling pressure is increasing.  Through this week there was a double top formed at a key resistance area.

Many large cap companies are starting to sell off causing greater fear in the markets.

Berkshire Hathaway had a nice run up when the 200 day moving average caught up with the share price.  Reaching a main zone of resistance a bearish double top pattern has formed. %K will be crossing %D.  Selling pressure is starting to increase on many safe stocks as valuations have reached absurd levels.

It is no surprise that low interest rates and quantitative easing cause asset bubbles.  Many economists have said inflation is transitory, now the general population is seeing that it is not, inflation has been accelerating and the FED has to fix this huge mess they have made.  In history the only way inflation slows is through an economic recession.

Short term bonds are soaring faster than the long terms, at this rate the yield curve will be inverted soon.  This is just another factor an economic recession is on its way.

**Predictions**

This week will be very volatile for the S&P, after the fed meeting there will be a violent overaction in the market and big funds are going to start dumping their positions.  Next week will be very bloody with a strong negative sentiment.  These intuitions are not dumb, they know a recession is coming.  I think Putin will wait to invade Ukraine,  they will most likely try to find a compromise where the tariffs placed on Russia are lifted, then they will not invade.  My forecast is that 4 out of 5 days will be red next week.  Most likely thursday will be the one low volume green day.

I almost forgot to add that very high rates of inflation (more than 5%) are a fear of the top 1% because it can start to degrade their wealth.  The government will forever be influenced by the ultra rich so there will be many rate hikes this year...

I will try to respond to every comment!I was just reading up on archtitecture and the work of Tadao Ando, when I came accross a reference to the Japanese financial meltdown starting in the 1990ies. It sounded too familiar not to share it with you retards. Will this repeat here in the West?

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese\_asset\_price\_bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble):

>The **Japanese asset price bubble** (バブル景気, *baburu keiki*, "[bubble economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_economy)") was an [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) from 1986 to 1991 in which [real estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate) and [stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) market prices were greatly inflated.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-1) In early 1992, this price bubble burst and [Japan's economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Japan) stagnated. The bubble was characterized by rapid acceleration of asset prices and [overheated economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overheating_(economics)) activity, as well as an uncontrolled [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) and [credit expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_expansion).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-okina-2) More specifically, over-confidence and [speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation) regarding asset and stock prices were closely associated with excessive [monetary easing policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy) at the time.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-edgardo-3) Through the creation of economic policies that cultivated the marketability of assets, eased the access to credit, and encouraged speculation, the [Japanese government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan) started, prolonged and exacerbated the Japanese asset price bubble.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-4)  
>  
>By August 1990, the [Nikkei stock index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225) had plummeted to half its peak by the time of the fifth monetary tightening by the [Bank of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan) (BOJ).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-okina-2) By late 1991, other asset prices began to fall. Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-okina-2) the economy's decline continued for more than a decade. This decline resulted in a huge accumulation of [non-performing assets loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-performing_loan) (NPL), causing difficulties for many financial institutions. The bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what many call the [Lost Decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-5) Japan's annual land prices averaged nationwide have finally risen since the asset bubble collapse, though only mildly at 0.1%, a process that has taken 26 years to show up statistically.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble#cite_note-6)NEW YORK: Billionaire investor George Soros bought nearly 20 million shares of electric truck startup Rivian Automotive Inc in the quarter ended Dec 31, securities filings showed Friday (Feb 11).

The 19,835,761 shares, worth about US$2 billion at the time, makes Soros Fund Management among the most prominent investors in a company that has yet to produce a consumer vehicle. Rivian, which is 20 per cent owned by Amazon.com Inc, is expected to provide the e-commerce company with more than 100,000 electric trucks.

Irvine, California-based Rivian said in December it expected production to fall "a few hundred vehicles short" of its 2021 target of 1,200 due to supply chain constraints, highlighting the likely challenges in ramping up production to take on EV leader Tesla Inc.

Shares of Rivian fell 9 per cent Friday and are down 43 per cent for the year to date. The stock price is down 67 per cent from the high of US$179.46 it touched on Nov 16, less than a week after it raised US$12 billion in the largest stock debut of 2021

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/billionaire-soros-buys-stake-ev-startup-rivian-2493991There is a popular thread on why Facebook is going to buy Roblox, announcing the deal in their all-company meeting this Tuesday. I agree that there will be an acquisition, but it will be Unity, not Roblox. Lizard man does not want to bet bigly on a specific game or ecosystem of games. Microsoft bet on Minecraft thinking it could grow into what Roblox became but never was, and there will always been a next hot game. Instead, zuck wants to invest in the core tools to create the Metaverse. Not only that, but if they can own these tools used by developers worldwide, they can better control the distribution of these apps to have more influence of the Metaverses from other big tech companies. That more or less leaves Unreal Engine and Unity. Unreal engine is run by Epic Games, and if you read the news ever, you’ll know that the CEO of Epic hates big tech, so that leaves Unity.

For context:
Apple is getting ready to launch their VR headset. If past product launches are any indication, Apple has been distributing prototypes of this product to key developers in order to have a reasonably compelling launch catalogue of games/apps. Remember: Zuck is a lizard- you can’t hide from him, he has absolutely slithered his way in and got wind of the rumors about how much better this Apple headset is than anything oculus can build in the near future. Zuck can’t let apple launch their VR headset by the end of the year and have a more compelling vision of the Metaverse than a company named “Meta”. He has [already considered acquiring Unity](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/facebook-mulled-multi-billion-dollar-acquisition-of-unity-book-claims/)and the timing is right. 

Disclosure: positions in $U and $FBFor a long time I loved the forum, loved the loss porn, loved the gain porn and unrealistic, survivor bias trade ideas it gave me, but I'm fucking out. 

My mind is being polluted by you retards and it's fucking up my trading style.

My breaking point: today. I planned out a short trade all night, looked at the QQQ and SPY 0 DTE puts I was going to buy against an inflation trade and 50 pt rate hike.

Lo an behold, I talk to one of you autists in chat who's sure the market is going to blow up at open. I disagree and go on my way.

Then at open the market moves a little bit up, I'm waiting for a good entry on my puts, I go to pull the trigger and ... I immediately switch, think I'm wrong, and the market is going to move up. I BUY FUCKING MOTHERFUCKING RANDOM ASS CALLS.

20 minutes later, I'm down 80% and $4600, and I have no fucking idea what the fuck I'm even holding. I'm literally playing the opposite of my plan and I decide on this new plan at the worst possible time.  I went long at literally the exact HOD. Like, to the minute. 

IM FUCKING DONE. THIS RANT IS THE LAST TIME ILL BE ON HERE. THIS IS WHY THEY SAY DONT TAKE TIPS. BECAUSE IT WILL GET IN YOUR HEAD AND IT MESSES UP YOUR SYSTEM.

LOVINGLY SCREW YOU GUYS IM GOING HOME.

And no, you motherfuckers will not see me on Monday.

And yes, I posted about shorting yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spcfou/1245_est_yield_spike_warning_close_your_longs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

UPDATE: my original trade plan is +800% ($54,000).You may know me from such dim-witted hits as "Peloton is going to tank on earnings, here's why" and "Facebook and PayPal have to bounce back up right?!"

I was using the few braincells I have left and came up with a novel idea: why do people even buy calls on earnings? IV crush just eats away at potential profits even if you happen to guess the direction correctly in this increasingly irrational market. 

Why don't people just buy or short shares of a company if they think it will go down or up on earnings? I tried the options thing and even when I guessed correctly I either ended up losing money or made so little that it wasn't worth the initial risk. 

I for one am going to start making smarter plays and rely less on chance and increase my odds of success!"The reverberations of fiscal and monetary policy are likely to be more severe to humans than any climate or societal disaster 💀"

Holy F we are getting close. Inflation, bond markets, Russia Ukraine, supply chain, covid protests.  What a time to be alive.

Edit: WOW! Thanks for the awards everyone! My first gold!That's right, Uncle Putin is nothing short of a giant bear trap. A big Russian bear trap.

Stop putting your money into puts as though Putin is gonna somehow launch an invasion and tank the entire market.

I'm gonna tell you why, so listen up you mouth breathing clowns.

1 - I bet the majority of you talking about this 'InVaSiOn' are getting your information from fucking CNN. The US media is keen to portray Putin as some demonic harbinger of doom, and its a convienant distraction from the fact that you're all going to be homeless soon because food and fuel cost a fortune and mortgages are going through the roof. Quick, lets blame Putin.

2 - This is classic Putin mindset. He's one of the biggest trolls on the world stage. He took the piss in Crimea because Obama was weak as fuck. Remember in August 2012, Obama drew his "red line" against Syria if Assad used chemical weapons? Fucking eye doctor Assad then went and dropped a shitload of chemical weapons and the US did jack shit. 18 months later, Putin gambled on a weak assed Obama doing fuck all and rolled his troops into Crimea and stole it. Biden seems to have a more firm stance and Putin is testing for weakness.

3 - Russia doesn't even fucking need Ukraine. To what purpose does Putin want it? It's fucking dogshit. Ukraine has nothing of any worth to Russia, apart from Nostalgia. Can you imagine Russia taking control of the whole country? "*Ok Putin, here you go, by the way, our population of 41 million people doesn't want you here, so have fun with that. Oh, and there's also this little place called Chernobyl we take care of. Here, have it fucking back*".

4 - What is Putin actually moving up? The media always talks about "OmG PuTiN DePloYs TrOoPS!!" Yeah ok, but what. Most of the pictures i've seen are of the T-72b3 variant, which is a dogshit revamp of the old T-72 which is way outdated. The UK and the US have already delivered a fucktonne of AT weapons to Ukraine which can cause more damage than 0DTE fd's. Back in 2015, Russia deployed some T-72's against Ukraine's troops and they got rinsed. Ukraine even trolled them by capturing some and using them against the other Russian vehicles.

5 - 100,000 troops. That's all Putin has put on the border. "**OMG THAT'S LOADS!!**" No it fucking isn't. It took the US nearly double that to invade Iraq back in '03 and Ukraine is 25% bigger. You can also gurantee that the reistance from the military of Ukraine will be a damn sight more fierce than a bunch of Iraq conscripts who fucking hated Saddam and didn't even want to fight in the first place. Speaking of Saddam, it took him nearly 300,000 troops to invade Kuwait, which is about the size of your wifes boyfriends spare bedroom. That's there one where he rails her while you bumpkins are trying to figure out why Robinhood has fucked you over again.

6 - When Putin took Crimea, it took him just 6 days. The president was looking unstable and within a week, Putin moved troops in and took control. he didnt spend months teasing anyone and telegraphing his moves like he is now. 

History lesson over.

In short, shut up. Putin isn't going to invade. He's pulling a classic KGB commie troll move. All you 🌈🐻 stop pissing money away on puts. He's probably got SPY puts expiring in a few weeks and needs them to print before he calls it all off and everyone goes home. 

Finally, even if Uncle Putin does invade, that means the US is just gonna throw everything it has at defence contractors, so get your Lockheed calls in right now.

TLDR - Shut up. Putin is trolling. He is master troll. no invasion. puts get fucked.TITLE TYPO: MEANT TO SAY UKRAINE

Check the following Twitter accounts: nickschifrin and bnonews

U.S. Intelligence believes Putin may be planning to invade Ukraine as soon as next week. SPY dropped about a half a percent just after this news came out. This and the fact that minutes from the January FOMC meeting are releasing on February 16 means next week is gonna be really interesting. VIX also just spiked. We might test January lows.

I've been increasing my position, I said this was gonna happen back in november, looks like everyone else is starting to think that too. Based on what the government is saying, looks like the end is nigh. If you trust the government, I don't, but I already thought it was gonna happen before then. Anyway, rolling strategy to try to milk it until an actual embargo hits and the assets hopefully go to 0 and it gets delisted or something, idk, maximum put value is cool. Then we're moving into Titanium futures probably, Russia has a massive chunk of global titanium, we'll see. If mainland China looks like its going to invade China then there is also a play there, but no point in discussing that yet.Salutations, Fellow Austists! 

Rejoice with me! This year my wife's boyfriend has granted me a special privilege: I get to pick our yearly Family Vacation! And instead of going to some boring place to see some cliche thing, you know, like the Blue Man Group or Yellowstone National Park, this year I'm taking our family to enjoy something that's truly magical. I'm taking us to where the \*REAL\* action is, to a can't-miss experience that bonds true spirits closer together, for life.   

I'm so excited, my dudes! Where are we going?  To a show like no other.  We're going to see a show on the Fed Rate Hike Spring Tour!  Now, this is a 1st for our family.  We'll probably go early to get good seats.  Go down in front to the pit.  I want to be there the moment JPow takes the stage.  We're hoping to go, down a few cheap beers, and watch his dazzling laser light show, craning our necks up at interest rates shooting upwards towards the Heavens, watching JPow's mesmerizing movements as he makes markets explode back down to Earth with fire and without giving a fuck.  My God.  So fucking Metal.  Feeling the powerful bass of the Fed's sick financial bass drops and face-melting policy breakdowns as we mosh hard all night long.  I can't wait.  I'm hoping JPow or the lead guitarist crowd surfs on top of us.  I'm hoping their set includes the best songs from their latest album: "It's Just Transitory" and "The Economy Is Strong".

But please I need your help! : (

After countless hours scouring the net and fb I just can't seem to find the tour dates. Or just where and when the first show is? The 1st 50+ bps hike?  You'd think MGK would be posting something about this on IG.  Please, I can't let my wife's boyfriend down.  We're so looking forward to this.  I've been growing my hair and beard out for month for this, so that I can head-bang sweaty all night long. Also because I can no longer afford barbers.  I can't even seem to find a link to where they'll be live-streaming the much-anticipated first show. A show that's going to be as legendary as Queen playing Live Aid--mark my fucking words, fans.  This is important and we want to be a part of history-in-the-making.  

In a nutshell, where can I score ticks?  Preferably with good seats.  I've been using my wife's boyfriend's credit card because all of my Wendy's paycheck is tied-up in fast-expiring Calls.  I've been obsessively checking Ticketmaster, CVent, and Live Nation every morning, every night for weeks.  Please tell me I didn't miss pre-sales!  I'm planning on bringing my SPCE certificate that's -80% from ATH and a sharpie to get JPow to autograph it for me.  I'll frame it and hang it up in my room in the basement so it will finally have some value again.

And I hear tell that Cramer may be opening?  Can anyone confirm? I'd love for him and his crew to autograph the margin call notice I received from TDAmeritrade after following his investment advice.

So if anyone bought tickets please let me know where. Or let me know if all are sold-out and where we can stream the hike online.  If we can go and you chip-in for gas we're also open to carpool to the show day-of. We can hold about 2-3 more in our 2009 Dodge Grand Caravan.  Must be willing to listen to Kelly Clarkson on the way.

Thanks in advance and rock on my dudes \\00/I felt like I was leaving money on the table in late 2020, not going for it in a levered fashion so enter this “experiment”. They felt like high conviction plays in the moment. It was quite a ride and hard to look away from but I’m evidently not too good at this.

About a week ago, I bought 400x 2/18 $245 calls for an average cost of $4.59. Sold today for $0.54, realizing roughly 90% losses.

I still think it was a shot worth taking.

Mods, can you update my flair?[https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-dfast-results-20210624.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2021-dfast-results-20210624.pdf)

some shit that's already realized and they're tryna downplay:

>The severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in CRE and corporate debt markets. Consistent with the Scenario Design Framework, under the severely adverse scenario, the U.S. unem- ployment rate climbs to a peak of 10-3/4 percent in the third quarter of 2022 (see table A.5), a 4 percentage point increase relative to its fourth quarter 2020 level.11 Real GDP falls 4 percent from the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 to its trough in the third quarter of 2022. The decline in activity is accompanied by a lower headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, which quickly falls to an annual rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter of 2021, and stays at that level for another quarter before gradually rising to 2-1/4 percent by the end of the scenario period.  
In line with the sharp decline in real activity, the 3-month Treasury rate remains near zero throughout the scenario. The 10-year Treasury yield immediately falls to 1/4 percent during the first quarter of 2021 and stays there through the first quarter of 2022, after which it gradually rises, reaching 1-1/2 percent by the end of the scenario period. The result is a gradual steepening of the yield curve over much of the scenario period.

\*here's the answer on the rate hike, though... likely conservative using the word gradually. monday will be telling of what gradual means.

the test is all about finding the weakest money masseuse and cutting off their hands. they look at wha their losses may be in a 'severely' adverse situation, doesn't look great.

>Changes in supervisory stress test results across exer- cises reflect changes in  
• firm starting capital positions;41  
• the scenario used for the supervisory stress test;  
• portfolio composition and risk characteristics; and • models used in the supervisory stress test.  
Under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, the aggregate CET1 ratio is projected to decline to a minimum of 10.6 percent before rising to 11.2 per- cent at the end of nine quarters (see table 3). In the aggregate, each of the five capital and leverage ratios declined over the course of the projection horizon from their levels in the fourth quarter of 2020, with levels in the first quarter of 2023 ranging from  
1.0 percentage point to 1.8 percentage points lower than at the start of the projection horizon (see table 3).

now we're getting to the meat and bones of this bullshittery:

>Projected Losses  
The Federal Reserve projects that the firms as a group would experience $474 billion in losses on loans and other positions in the aggregate over the nine quarters of the projection horizon.  
These losses include  
• $353 billion in accrual loan portfolio losses;  
• $4 billion in securities losses;42  
• $86 billion in trading and counterparty losses at the 12 firms with substantial trading, processing, or custodial operations; and

just to me this seems like a lot of money, and though this is a severely adverse situation they're describing its in my opinion in reality it's already much worse.

there are a ton more tables under these that get more specific on each firm and the primary source of their losses. it's pretty interesting stuff considering everyones head in the sand in spite of these glaring issues which have painted them into a corner. I absolutely have found a new love and respect for whoever is writing up these reports, while obviously skewed to not show how truly fucked they are the info is there.

This all started when i looked into the primary dealers for the FED and realized these are all the offenders names we've seen over the last year+. knowledge is power and these motherfuckers thought they were the smartest guys in the room, didn't work before and it won't work now.

[https://shashwats.substack.com/p/s-and-p500-average-performance-during](https://shashwats.substack.com/p/s-and-p500-average-performance-during)[SQ trade](https://imgur.com/a/q1ufDtG)

Okay folks this was a trade on SQ I made on Thursday after hours. I placed the trade at exactly 7:59pm before after hours closed. Roughly 2 minutes into Friday open at 9:32am I felt something I haven’t felt in a long time. It was as if Putin was speaking to me through the force. I heard a whisper in my ear. “Invasion”. A 3 minute trade netted me about 11k and damn I’m sure glad Putin whispered to me.https://imgur.com/a/TxLxqrG

For all of you wondering where to stick your cash if Russia goes to war with the Ukraine; while Putin says he doesn’t have a cell phone… we all know it’s an iPhone. Here’s the proof.

This is not financial advice, Putin and I just like the stock.So listen up. Y'all gonna preach that inflation is super fucking high and money is devaluing quick af and also say it's fucking unsustainable that market is up 120% in the last 2 years or so.  

**If it's the currency losing value quick, isn't it unsurprising that the market is going to perform good?** I mean, it's an alternative value holder to currency.

Let me show you a smooth brained example. **Say you are a farmer like 1000 years ago, and you buy a cow for 10 gold coins.** Now, let's say your retarded kingdom faces an inflation so high it causes the price of the cow to go up 1 gold coin each year. Now, after 10 years, your cow is worth 20 gold coins! Did you make money? Fuck no, it's just that gold coins lost value and cows did not.

**You wouldn't fucking talk about "the imminent crash of cow prices" if everything went up in price just because the cows did too.**

And for those of you who think inflation isn't real? **Two years ago, I bought a cheeseburger at McDonald's for 1€, now it's worth like 1,40€.** I would also buy a protein shake at my local gym for 1€, now it costs 1,40€. The kebab place I frequented would cost 2€ per kebab, now it's like 2,90€ or some shit. 

*If you look past the March 2020 dip, we are only up some 42% at the SPY ATH. Going back to the previous cheeseburger / protein shake / kebab example, those prices are also up some 40%.* This is irrefutable proof that it's not actually market going up, but currency going down and market adjusting. 

So saying "this growth is unsustainable" and "we are in for a correction" is fucking retarded if you think stocks only go up (which they do) since in theory, stocks have gone up 0% in the past 2 years (going back the the previous cheeseburger example). **Unless the prices of cheeseburgers also correct down, I don't see market correcting itself by a huge margin. If you think stocks only go up, that is.** Which you do. 

**This is obviously not financial or investment advice.** If you didn't gather it from the cow example, I'm fucking retarded. This is a crazy man's rambling[https://www.imgur.com/a/2VNuzDo](https://www.imgur.com/a/2VNuzDo)

&#x200B;For real though, what are the actual limitations for if Putin and the gov bought like $5B in puts before invading Ukraine? Are the limitations liquidity, legal issues, or something else?

I’m sure the gov could create a program where it funnels money through “ordinary” citizens to buy puts or short the market, so that’s not my worry.
 
Can Russia actually get it done to finance the war effort in Ukraine?

This is kind of a shit post but kinda not lol

Edit: I’ll shoot a hypersonic missile up putin’s buttholeShould I hold Nvidia or save what can be saved? I bought the dip with a x5 lever. Now the dip of the dip fucks me! I am down 20%. Have looked at many analyses, some say it goes down further, the other it goes up again because of the sales that will be published soon. The trade closes automatically at minus 50% which is at 224. Do you think that it will go down so far?

https://preview.redd.it/9egao2atmeh81.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7f05395ee427489e995317c88daf4655c88bddEveryone wants to time the market, but it has been shown over and over again that DCA’ing is a much better approach. As long as you are DCA’ing into stocks / projects that can survive a true bear market, then it really doesn’t matter if the sell off over the last 48hrs is the continuation of a bear market or just a bull trap fabricated by nonstop Russia / Ukraine fear mongering.

Putting aside that point, I really don’t think Putin am has any interest in going to war with US/NATO. 

I am purely speculating, but here is a stance that can explain Putin's actions…and one that would turn him for someone who is bat shit crazy into someone who is playing 4D chess. 

1. He knows our financial system is already unstable. Inflation, stimulus no more, the fed has stopped printing, rates are going to be increased, and asset prices are at record high valuations and primed for a correction. All of this is causing uncertainty and many are starting to believe the markets are standing on the edge of cliff. 

2. Additionally, Ukraine's pro west leader, Zelenski, is relying on the west for stimulus and general stability. If the west cannot provide the aid or if it falls into a recession, Zelenski loses support from his base and Putin is given a narrative that says, 'the west is dealing with their own problems, their is no way they can help Ukraine'.

3. So Putin fabricates the threat of war in an attempt to push the US markets over the edge. That creates opportunity for Putin and an opportunity for Russian backed, Ukrainian politicians to gain back popular support. 

Now, the risk in him playing this game is steep. Because if he pushed the west too far, and they impose sanctions, it will crater Russia’s economy. So if this is his strategy he is walking a very thin, but manageable line. I say this because all he has to do is to continue to posture and cause uncertainty right up until the point where the US is about to put sanctions in place…and then back down. In that time, the markets will either fall off the cliff or not, but they will certainly be weakened per how they have responded over the last 48hrs. 

Would be interested in others thoughts on all this as week. 

Not financial advise. I know nothing about anything.I've been looking into getting into futures trading but the problem is it seems like all the prices are dependent on things that haven't happened yet. I have no idea how to predict the future so I dunno how anyone makes money on that. But I was wondering since there are futures, are there pasts where you can trade on things that already happened? Cause then I could just look up the thing and figure out if I should buy or sell it myself. I feel like that would be a lot more safe as an investing strategy. I've checked all the major brokers and nobody trades pasts. I don't get it, where are they? This seems like an obvious idea?Let's be real here, Russia is going to invade Ukraine in a matter of days, maybe a week and a half at most. My way of supporting Ukraine has been to short the Russian economy. Living in the US can make it harder than if you live in Russia, but it's still possible since there are many ETFs that track the Russian economy, such as my chosen vehicle, RSX.

RSX holdings are made up of 39.7% energy, 26.9% commodity exploration and manufacturing, and 16.3% financial services. That's over 82% of the ETF about to get absolutely destroyed by incoming sanctions and FUD (which has already been dealing massive damage to Russia's economy lately).

Just two weeks ago experts were saying that oil would jump to $100 a barrel in the event of an invasion, now they are predicting [$120 a barrel](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/09/oil-will-hit-120-a-barrel-if-russia-invades-ukraine-david-roche.html). Prepare for the Russian economy to crash by at least 35% when that happens, especially since nobody will be buying their oil but China.

I'm shorting RSX (currently at $23.20) at a strike price of $22 with an expiration of 3/18, I'm already up 202%. I'm expecting a price drop to $18 *at least* once those sanctions hit, and I'm confident that my current gains will double when they do.

If you have the spare change, you might want to consider either doing what I did, or buying some long calls on oil, like USO.

Let’s see what next week brings 

[Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/IPjakoc)Mass human psychology will always lag reality. 

Consider the below bullets points and the TL/DR at the bottom. **2022 is going to turn out just fine.** 

* **Rate hikes will be slow and steady**
   * Inflation is not out of control: the Biden admin is (admittedly) right that supply side shocks are heavily influencing key elements of the CPI basket. There is ZERO reason for the Fed to panic and drop a .5 bomb on everyone on Monday, or even in the near future. This is an extremely delicate process, and the Fed is going to continue to combine (1) hawkish language with (2) slow and steady rate hikes. I will borrow a phrase from Deng Xiaoping here and say that in 2022, the Fed is going to 'cross a river feeling for stones'. 
   * A slowly increasing rate hike environment is not destiny. Everyone here needs to move beyond the extraordinarily simple money printer paradigm. YES, QE absolutely contributed to high valuations, but NO, a slowly paced rate hike in combination with an easing in COVID/Supply Side issues (see below) is not the recipe for a crash. Are some companies going to be naked when the water slowly recedes? Yes--but corporate profitability is very high right now. If AMC and other bullshit fake companies go out of business, the huge employment needs in EVERY sector (not just Wendys) will catch those workers. 
   * Everyone with an IQ above 80 has known that COVID QE was going to cause inflation, and require rate hikes. Retail capitulations over the past 
* **COVID is fading away and becoming seasonal like the Flu**
   * Look at the numbers, they are there for everyone to see. Already the Biden admin is talking about rolling mask mandates back. Sure, another variant could pop up, but we are on the brink of Summer and COVID is now becoming a seasonal phenomenon. 
   * Therefore, people will start to go back to normal. This is beneficial for consumption, as well as for easing supply-shocks (particularly in China). 
* **Supply Side issues are already easing and will continue to ease as COVID concerns globally start to lessen**
* **Ukraine is not going to become the global crisis many here think it will**
   * Read the room: major players in Europe and the U.S. are NOT going to throw down over Ukraine. Literally, Berlin runs Europe, and Berlin sent helmets to Ukraine. If that doesn't tell you the degree of European resolve, I don't know what else will. 
   * If a conflict occurs, it is more likely limited (Think: Crimea lite) for Putin to save face. This means that limited war is possible without massive contagion. Far Western Ukraine (Donbass) already has political, culture, and linguistic splits with Kyiv, and in material terms, the only major consequence is that a larger % of the European grain supply will be Russian-owned. Now the French will have to start buying American grain for their pastries. 
* **Incomes are pacing with inflation**
   * I saw an advertisement at Chipotle for $15 an hour this week. I'm a big four bro on the services side, and I got a 10% raise this year. Salaries are up across the board: in Consulting, new hires are making WAY more than they did two years ago. McDonalds literally just came out and said at all company owned restaurants, its $13 an hour average, and will be $15 by 2024. 
   * Yes, I know you can find articles like this ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/business/dealbook/inflation-pay-prices.html)) that says that prices are outpacing inflation, but we are in a SUPPLY SIDE crisis. This is NOT a demand side crisis. Logistics bottlenecks and COVID easing are critical to this going away. 
* **Corporate profits are at all time highs**
* **Biden is afraid of 2022 midterms and will not rock the boat with China this year.** 
   * Yes, shaking a sword at China is politically popular, but Biden is *very* unpopular right now and the DNC does NOT want to worsen the bloodletting its destined to suffer late this year by aggravating an already bad supply chain crisis. 
   * The new tariff options the Admin is exploring are punitive measures. It is a continuation of the low level friction that will define U.S.-Sino relations for the next decade.

Link: https://imgur.com/a/cKhLrUlRemember what Peter Lynch said?

Something along the lines of Everyone's a long-term investor until the market experiences volatility. You cowardice shits suddenly forget about long-term goals as soon as volatility hits and you pull out of the market.

Remember what Buffet said?

The market is a device used to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.

What the fuck is wrong with everyone fear mongering and pulling out of the market. Do you believe things will go up in a 5 to 10 year span? OK then you should be staying in the market. Suddenly all ya'll are adopting a short term investor mindset.

I remember reading a study that showed that retail investors who change their positions the most, and move in and out of the market are most likely to underperform everyone else.

You cant take volatility? You shouldn't be investing in stocks. It's in times of volatility that people get rich, because suddenly the market is highly irrational.

Every time there's a conflict across the world you're going to pull out of the market? Every time there's news about inflation or interest rates you'll pull out? Every time there's fear mongering in the news? That's a good way to lose any earnings you would have made by investing and then some.

[Merger to enter the CT market link here](https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/new-york-community-bank-eyes-ct-presence-following-merger)


It is a relatively stable stock that has been downtrending since the news of the merger was pushed back but still relatively stable.

What turned me me onto this stock initially was some unusual options activity that seemed out of place on Wednesday of this week. The order was for 4/14 $14 calls 2500@the ask of 0.10 and current OI 2800; The options activity was less than 150 since the day this order went in. 


All in all someone is bullish on this and I'm in on it as well. 


Positions 200 $14c 4/14


TLDR: Buy NYCB calls for pending merger news. That is all, good luck and fuck you all 🚀🤑THE REAL REASON NO ONE TELLS YOU!!!

US Stock market is in honeymoon period after 2008 crash, low interest rates and free money, this is good for businesses as they borrow money and create new employment and grow(this is how economies work). Same applies for the companies as they raise more cash by selling junk bonds. For example Tesla was a Zombie company in 2014 and they sold  huge junk bonds to run the company as they cannot issue more common shares as it affects the stock price. 
The other side, the buyers are who lend the money from FED Reverse repo with almost 0% and buy these for high returns in exchange of their treasury bonds with FED!

Understand this, when reverse repo rates go up these zombie companies run out of cash as the above gambling is not worth it and that’s when growth will slow down and it trigger the recession and people do less spending and inflation also goes down during that period. Then FED once again start the party to rescue..So, calm down and slowly invest in your favorite companies, great discounts may come!Who here really thinks Nike, Apple is really interested? Those rumors were put out there for big money to sell out and leave retail with the bag. Seen it time and time again Rite aid, fitbit, blue apron, Groupon, gopro. They may get bought out in the future but for FAR LESS value then when initial rumor starts. [**Leveraged ETFs: the pot at the end of the rainbow? Or a deathtrap?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/sr1hn1/leveraged_etfs_the_pot_at_the_end_of_the_rainbow/)

I've spend the past couple months looking for a trading style that plays to my strengths and I've been thinking of trading leveraged ETFs at Market Open hoping to take advantage of the additional volatility.

So I'm basically looking for anything that is going to be pretty consistently volatile at MO, while having a large enough cap/enough volume to be fairly liquid and have a tight-ish spread.

I figure with backtesting I can determine a basic range for stop loss and target price.

**1) What are some of the most consistently volatile stocks/ETFs?**

**2) What are some good ways to get a good idea of what a stock will do at MO? (So far I just look at the market as a whole and the pre-market price action)**

3) Is it better to enter a position before MO or during?

4) Is there anything I'm obviously missing or misunderstanding?You probably know by now that the semiconductor stocks are taking a nose dive due to Russia possibly cutting off key ingredients used in semiconductor manufacturing.

Reuters said Russia could disrupt 90% of US semiconductor-grade neon. So how do we invest in that other 10%?

I did a quick google search and only found this Korean company called POSCO, but they just barely started producing NEON this year.

[POSCO localizes technology for production of rare gas neon](https://www.ajudaily.com/view/20220112162636793):

> The new facility is cable of producing about 22,000 normal cubic meters of high purity neon every year, which is enough to cover 16 percent of domestic demand. Normal cubic meter (Nm3) is used to represent the amount of natural gas in the gas industry. TEMC has secured long-term purchase rights. POSCO, which nurtures the production of rare gases as a new growth engine, will work with domestic companies to localize facilities for other imported chemical compounds such as Xenon and Krypton

Questions:

* What is the best non-Russian company we can invest in with regards to Neon?
* Are any of them good to invest in even if this Russian thing didn't happen?GameStop

https://imgur.com/a/qMnUnFoHi apes and retards, I wanted to share a method I have used to take a $25k account and turn it into $750k. This is not financial advice, but was hoping it might be useful to some of you out there posting massive loss porn and blown up accounts. 

Step 1: Deposit $25k into trading account. Find your edge day trading, swing trading, low DTE weeklies trading, scalping, etc. 

Step 2: Start out by risking no more than 3% of your account on any given trade. Ensure you take profits at predetermined targets and reduce position of trade going your way and set stop losses no higher than 5% from entry. 

Step 3: Execute a couple great trades and double your account in 2 months. Then become completely cocky and throw all your trading rules out the window and start risking 50% plus account size on retarded trades. 

Step 4: Either win a big trade like this and get ready to lose more or lose a trade and start chasing even riskier trades. Blow up your account. 

Step 5: Deposit $750k into trading account. 

Hope this is useful!The title should be enough to explain what I am trying to convey.

Yes, there may be reasons for a stock's decline. So if it is declining, we should inspect with care for the reason, but the market is irrational and so are you guys, you guys lose your mind (most, not all) and immediately turn your opinion about the stock when it starts on a tear.

I remember seeing all those bear posts in 2019 about Alphabet. It declined a bit and you all were trashing it saying it is a shit company (not just a shit stock). "I use adblocker and use all those Google services for free, everyone I know is doing the same. I don't know how they will even make money.", "Google is irrelevant, they haven’t innovated a single product worth using", " I stopped using Google search".

The same narrative was prevalent about AMD a few years ago and is currently prevalent about INTC.

Even though, I have no position in GME and think that most of the GME retards will lose money (I played GME around 2020 and January 2021, and after that I exited my positions), I still see the same thing about GME for example. Whenever the stock jumps, everyone suddenly becomes more bullish and when the stock dives, everyone suddenly becomes pessimistic, when the opposite should have happened (though I think anyone holding GME at this valuation is most likely an actual retard based on balance of probability).

Currently, I see a similar sentiment around companies like Meta, Paypal for example.

The same goes for Nvidia. Even though I think that Nvidia valuation is a little insane (Nvidia cannot produce 3 times more FCF than INTC in the long run, that's what I think), whenever it dives, you guys say, "No one can even buy their product, shit company", when it jumps, "No one can even buy their product, mega bullish".

The only exception is probs Apple and Tesla.


**Why did I write such a long rant?**

I finally understood the 2 main reasons why 90% retail traders lose money.
1. They make bad plays. Mr Captain Obvious.
2. They become fearful when they should be greedy...

So, TL;DR: if you actually think something is good, buy when it’s mega down and sell only when you think you have an absolutely amazing play (don't just sell out of winners to chase something you are not even sure of, because most gains come from a handful of right plays).For all his fault, you cannot deny Buffet’s uncanny ability to call the market and pioneer approaches and strategies which made him a legend, and Nostradamus of massive market swings.

The buffet indicator is an indicator used to indicate where the market is over/under sold. It very neatly compares the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market to U.S. GDP - nice and easy and no obsfucation or data quality concerns.

By today’s measure, the stock market is the most overvalued it has ever been. Therefore a correction is clearly in order.

This will come in the form of a medium-large drop in US markets (region of 5%
to 15%), just to balance the books in terms of the artificial steriod pumped markets.

https://www.asiafinancial.com/elon-musks-tesla-buffeted-by-recalls-lawsuitsTLDR: Fed won’t raise rates significantly, hyperinflation is bullish for everything. 🏳️‍🌈🐻 = Fuk’d

So, Is Russia going to invade Ukraine?? No! I grew up in Europe and forever have we been fearing the Russian invasion, that never ever happens. You know how many times Russia “almost” took over? Yes, never since the collapse of the USSR, to the contrary, the NATO is Inching closer to Russia, then Russia inching towards us, and we are effectively surrounding Russia on all sides.

Russia is powerful, but can never, ever win against the NATO, it’s completely unrealistic. Anybody who believes that Russia starts a serious war against the West has completely lost touch with reality. Not even the fucking COLD WAR turned HOT. So stick your anxiety pills up your butthole and relax.

Anyway, how can you make money with this? Looking at the reaction of the market today, it’s evident, that the entire stock market is completely retarded for contracting due to some White House announcement that’s obvious distraction from the actual problems. Coincidence that record Inflation numbers are coming out, and they push the same ol Russian shit?

The way to make money is by believing that they will remain irrational, and betting on it.

I made most of my money through Oil, because I knew that environmentalist were gonna shutdown oil supplies, when demand is steadily going up = Oil go up. But people were shorting Oil because Tesla was growing??

Once you understand how retarded the world is, you’ll make money.

The smart thing might be to sell Gold, because fed will raise rates, then bearish for gold and commodities right?!?
And buy Puts?!?

Remember to smoothen that brain surface. 

The Fed has constantly been lying about inflation being transitory, why would they tell the truth about raising rates significantly? 
They are NOT going to cause a recession during an election year, Powell is basically part of the Biden administration. Their 0.25% whatever is going to do nothing against almost 8% CPI and 15% real inflation.

While the bears are celebrating because “Inflation will crash the markets” they are forgetting that the reason inflation crashes the markets is, that interest rates go up. 

This time is different because the fed is not going to fight Inflation reasonably, during times of unhinged Inflation, everything goes up.

Yes, stock market, commodities, prices, everything will go up.

Yes, yes, right now we are in a bear market because of expectation of a rise in rates. This ship will most likely reverse as soon as the market realizes that Powell is pluwffing.

So the shorts that are building up right now are going to get so utterly fucked, in one of the biggest market rebounds since 2020. Im aiming for around March - September, and should probably time calls for next year.

This time the dollar will take a massive dump, so you better do something with your money, not financial advice.

P.S. 

Dollar will shortly go up during first hike but eventually shit the bed when investors realize that they are not going to do shit.

Hyperinflation is Bullish for everything!
Don’t listen to 🏳️‍🌈🐻In November I had a great idea, I sold my zim calls and bought carr calls at $60 for September, to me it looked like a guaranteed win, today I’m 40k in the hole and to make it worse I took out a 15k loan to average down my position

Currently down 26% Seems like a good time to buy.Ukraine is the leading producer of sunflower oil. When their economy dips, sunflower oil prices go up. 

Shuttered production/supply means disproportionate demand, coupled with inflation and other supply chain issues.

In light of recent events, *Sunflower oil ($PSUNOUSDM)* is back up to 1746$ per metric ton, indicating a new bubble similar to 2008.

War is no unheard of thing to the US, since 9/11 over $6.4T has been spent on war. 

Judging from the US previous experience, the S&P500 actually gained 50% over the years of WWII. That’s 7% annualised. Over the two largest wars ever heard of, it gained around 115%.

However, during the pre-war phase, the market did indeed have a poo, but after the ‘prelude’ of the this conflict, they go back to their normal business!

The prelude in this case with our boy Putin, as I’m sure you’ll all know is derived from commodities. Good ol fashioned oil. It’s just gone up to around $95 a barrel, people are predicting $120!! This is people loading out of big tech, and into oil to get some bang for their buck, but when/if war does breakout, judging from history, the S&P500 should climb right back up.

Well today we officially saw that trend confirmed, played out and also break a major support line. 

This morning we really had potential and i think some people got trapped when we broke towards 451. But the sellers took over and by golly did we dip 📉.

We saw resistance near 451.5 tested this morning but it was too much. And after that it was all down hill. We saw support after support broken and eventually a major support of 440.6 get broken. This support level being broke along with the daily 200 ema is an incredibly bearish hint of whats to come. If you remember way back to January. We had this exactly same situation where we broke the 200 but closed above it only for the following days us to dip like crazy. 

https://i.imgur.com/HtToWcs.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/MrAAXTp.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/0sG5BCI.jpeg

So we broke support and closed below it and formed a new downward channel what does that mean? Well its gonna get bloody. I fully anticipate this to retest 420 area next week. 

Here are some supports to watch. 
439.9 (daily 200 ema) --> 427 --> 420.76 (bottom of the last dip). 

Obviously this usually wont dip more than 1.8-2% in a day so i expect a rest somewhere near 431-433 before we make it to the 420s. 

Remember my call me crazy but we are experiencing a dead cat bounce from 420 to 458 a week or so ago? Looks like i wasnt so crazy now... if we break 420 i full expect us to end somewhere near 360-380. 

Resistance wise- 443 --> 447 

I do not forsee this breaking 443 though. But it is a weekend and anything can happen. Keep your eye on crytp0 this weekend. They saw a massive dip today too and are at major supports. 

10% challenge today-
Closed one put for 50% 
And one put for 20%. 
https://i.imgur.com/tC2vPZs.jpeg

Positions- 
I was not going to open and hold anything and i even advised against it but end of day when we had the sell off to break 200 ema and broke the major support line... we got a major bounce to 442 and a picked up a 2/18 441P for next week. Im planning to hold next week till maybe Wednesday depending on what we see and how far up its up. 

But remember guys a lot of us saw 50-100% gains today which is amazing and it was a hell of a day for the people in  the intraday discussion but the goals 10%. We just have to know when to hold and when to sell. Its all about risk and not being greedy. 

So for instance if you find the right entry and you find yourself up 20% but supports are clearly being broken... do we sell? No of course not. We set a 10% stop loss (preferably trailing loss) and we let it ride. The whole thing is we ALWAYS secure profits. We dont get greedy and let a a trade go red. 
So for instance if you didnt get a good entry and your trades stalled at 10% . Or even 5%. You don't take a chance and you secure the bag and live to trade again. 

Hope everyone had a good week! See you monday. Again ill be live trading monday like today.[https://imgur.com/a/xK5E6Gu](https://imgur.com/a/xK5E6Gu)

Should've just held on to the first 5 puts I bought at the brief pump at open, but oh well. Could've potentially actually netted close to $30k. Not complaining though!How is Theta gang going these days? I'm down 260k YTD on my underlying, O but I made 40k in premium. Yay? lol 

My puts are fking underwater, and im getting fked every day. Seriously is there anyone in Theta gang who is actually having a good time? Puts are a bad idea, covered calls are just a bandaid on a fking missing limb.“Eight years of my 16 year career I’ve been working on this, since Colorado legalized marijuana back in 2012-2013,” @RepPerlmutter says about the Safe Banking Act. “I am confident that the Senate will take it up.” 

We all know that Senate Majority Leader Schumer plans to formally file legislation to fully legalize cannabis in April. This should be the beginning of a wondrous weedstock FOMO! Instead we get kicked in the nuts with rate hikes and a Russian invasion. My question is that enough to stop an ape feeding frenzy on weed? Money is green and weed is green. Coincidence? Maybe.

So we have the banking act and legalization possibly just weeks away! Democrats and Republicans both want the taxes and jobs! This is going to happen. I believe Schumer thinks he has or can get the votes in the Senate.

Here are some notable Republicans that support Federal Legalization:

Representative Steve Stivers: Republican Representative from Ohio, where medical marijuana is now legal. He is a co-sponsor on a bill designed to give banks permission to do business with the cannabis industry. It is known as the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Cory Gardner: Republican Senator from Colorado, where marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use. He supports bringing an end to federal marijuana prohibition and is considered one of the primary voices for the movement on the Hill.

Representative Duncan Hunter: Republican Representative from California, where marijuana is entirely legal. He is a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Mitch McConnell: Republican Senator from Kentucky. He hates marijuana (at least for now) but played a huge role in the legalization of industrial hemp production last year, giving the agricultural community, as well as the CBD sector a boost.

Representative Dan Newhouse: Republican Representative from Washington, where marijuana is legal for recreational use. He is a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act and has voted in favor of medical marijuana access for veterans.

Representative David P. Joyce: This Republican Representative from Ohio is the co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, a group pushing for marijuana reform at the national level. He is a supporter of several marijuana legalization efforts, including the SAFE Banking Act and the Marijuana Data Collection Act.

Representative Don Young: Republican Representative from Alaska, where marijuana is legal for recreational use. He recently joined forces with Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to introduce the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2019. He is a state’s rights supporter and a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Matt Gaetz: Republican Representative from Florida, where medical marijuana is legal. He recently introduced the Medical Cannabis Research Act of 2019 because, he says, “we cannot reform cannabis law without researching its safety, its efficacy, and its medical uses.” He is also a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Kevin Cramer: Republican Senator from North Dakota, where medical marijuana was made legal by way of ballot initiative. He is part of a group working to give marijuana-related businesses access to comprehensive and affordable insurance coverage.

Representative Denver Riggleman: Republican Representative from Virginia, which has a medical marijuana program. He is a supporter of all things medical marijuana and eliminating prosecutions for petty pot offenses. He is also a co-sponsor of both the STATES Act and the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Lisa Murkowski: Republican Senator from Alaska. She believes states should be permitted to make their own rules when it comes to marijuana, and that financial services should be made available to the cannabis trade. She is presently a co-sponsor of the Secure And Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019.

Representative Mark Amodei: Republican Representative from Nevada, where marijuana is legal for adults 21 and over. He has called out the federal government for accepting tax money from the cannabis industry, all while refusing to legalize. He supports the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Troy Balderson: Republican Representative from Ohio. He is a supporter of medical marijuana. Balderson was part of the “yes” crew that legalized it for therapeutic purposes in his state in 2016. He is presently a co-sponsor for the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Tom McClintock: Republican Representative from California. He is all about keeping the federal government out of state marijuana business. And while he admits that he’s not a big fan of the substance, he doesn’t believe prohibition is working. He has supported medical marijuana legislation and is presently a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Chris Collins: Republican Representative from New York, where medical marijuana is legal. Co-sponsor of the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Rand Paul: Republican Senator from Kentucky. He is a huge supporter of medical marijuana. He has sponsored cannabis legislation from the CARERS Act to the STATES Act. He is also favor of eliminating policies that force pot offenders to be sent to prison.

Representative Gregory Steube: Republican Representative from Florida. He is a supporter of giving veterans access to medical marijuana. In fact, he introduced the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, earlier this year, aimed at preventing Veterans Affairs from denying patients the use of medicinal cannabis in states where it is legal. He is also a supporter of the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Thomas Massie: Republican Representative from Kentucky, which has a restrictive low-THC medical marijuana program. He is a big supporter of eliminating policies that prevent medical marijuana cardholders from owning guns. Massie has championed legislation to remove the cannabis question on the ATF forms. He is also a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Dan Sullivan: Republican Senator from Alaska. Not always a supporter of marijuana reform, but advocates for state’s rights and cannabis research. He is also a co-sponsor of the Secure And Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019.

Representative Guy Reschenthaler: Republican Representative from Pennsylvania, where medical marijuana is legal. In addition to being a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act, he is also one for the Federal Clean Slate Act, which aims to seal the marijuana convictions of those involved in non-violent crimes.

Representative Fred Upton: Republican Representative from Michigan, where marijuana is completely legal.  He has received a B rating from NORML with respect to his position on cannabis. Upton is a supporter of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus and co-sponsor of both of the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act and the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Jim Banks: Republican Representative from Indiana, which still locks people up for cannabis crimes. He is a co-sponsor on the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Daniel Meuser: A newbie Republican Representative from Pennsylvania. He believes veterans should have medical marijuana access. He is also a supporter of the SAFE Banking Act.

Senator Andy Barr: Republican Senator from Kentucky. He is pushing for industrial hemp and CBD companies to be given access to financial services.

Representative Kelly Armstrong: Republican Representative from North Dakota. He is a supporter of ending federal marijuana prohibition. Armstrong is a co-sponsor of the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Bob Gibbs: Republican Representative from Ohio. He has supported widespread medical marijuana legislation in the past, including the dusty CARERS Act. He is currently a co-sponsor of the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative James Comer: Republican Representative from Kentucky. He is a massive supporter of legalized hemp. He worked closely with Senate Majority Leader itch McConnell to include the legalization of industrial hemp on the 2018 Farm Bill. He also supports allowing cannabis operations to deposit cash, which is just one of the reasons he is presently a co-sponsor of the SAFE Baking Act.

Representative Tom Graves: Republican Representative from Georgia, where low-THC medical marijuana is legal. He is a co-sponsor of the SAFE Banking Act.

Representative Anthony Gonzalez: Newbie Republican Representative from Ohio. He has signed on in support of the SAFE Banking Act.No, Russia isn't invading anyone anytime soon, Ukraine is much stronger now than before and with the help of U.S, Russia won't even enter the octagon/ring, it's just trash talk. Maybe Putin is yolo'ing on puts. 

Remember, Ukraine is the 2n'd largest country in Europe, they are by no means a small village that Russia can take over in a weekend. 

It's a classic scare tactic, so buy the DIP.Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) has been trying to get the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act across the finish line for several years now, and his latest attempt is to pass it as part of a large-scale manufacturing and innovation bill to which the cannabis language was recently attached in the House.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance on Friday, the congressman discussed the prospects of his proposal, which has cleared the House six times in some form now. He said that while Senate leadership has insisted on passing comprehensive legalization first, he still sees opportunities to advance his bipartisan incremental reform.

“Every [House] Democrat and at least half the Republicans have supported SAFE Banking, and I am confident that the Senate will take it up,” he said. He recognized that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and colleagues are prioritizing broad legalization legislation that they plan to formally file in April, but he said that he’s “questioned whether they have the votes to get something of that magnitude through the Senate, which has not even had a hearing really on marijuana in 50 plus years.&#x200B;

The CDX Index (blue)  is essentially the cost to insure one's corporate bonds. The chart compares that to the VIX (essentially the cost to insure equities). The two follow a remarkably similar path.  Both have been recording higher highs and lower lows recently.

(Still way of extremes though).

Watch credit markets closely. This is where institutional investors show their risk appetite. If they don't feel they will get paid back from the companies whose bonds they buy then as an equity investor (at the bottom of the capital structure) it's probably time to be nervous too.Today: https://imgur.com/a/zeRxoph

This week will be a doozy.I’ve dreamt of making this post.

I joined WSB and started trading options on Robinhood on March 2020. After about 8 months of pretending to know what I was doing, I had lost close to $8,400. I stopped trading because I lost all of the student loan money I had. I started working at my big boy job and began trading options on Robinhood again on January 2021. By June 2021, I was down another $6,600 to bring my total net loss to about $15,000. I couldn’t believe it. $15,000 was just gone. By December 2021, I had gotten enough money saved up that I thought I could invest a bit more into my Robinhood account and hope to get back the money I had initially lost. Two months later, I had lost another $4,250. In two years, I had lost close to $20,000. Un-fucking-believable. 

I could not give up. I just couldn’t. 

I transferred one final $1,000 into my Robinhood account. I decided that I would only invest in “smart” and “calculated” option plays whatever the fuck that means.

I traded a lot of SPY, Tesla, and earnings reports (UPS, Apple, Meta, Disney, Snap). Somehow, I managed to play most of these correctly with a few bumps along the way.

After losing an initial $20,000… today, I’m net POSITIVE $1,300. 

LET’S. FUCKING. GO.

Thank you, WSB. You were there for me through all of my losses and always inspired me to come back and take what was mine. I will now be withdrawing my invested capital and play with my remaining gains.

TLDR: I lost $20,000 and somehow made it all back. LFG.

[TLDR Snapshot](https://imgur.com/a/EX0HiNY)This last week has been a shitshow for me. Everyone said to buy SPY puts, but I didn’t listen. I thought since everyone was talking about it, it just wasn’t going to go down. So… I bought some calls instead. 

Lo and behold, SPY stocks dipped down to the low 440’s. I was wrong. 

“Really?!?!?” I thought to myself. This sucks, now my wife is gonna fuck my neighbor’s plant who’s YouTube channel makes more money than I now own. 

Yesterday was the worst day ever, I thought that my stock market game was over for good. 

Today, I’ve decided to turn things around. I still have some money left, so maybe there’s some hope I could win my wife back by making the right choices. 

Of course, I need to learn from my mistakes. I screwed up so badly by doing the exact OPPOSITE of what everyone else was doing. 

Therefore, I will not be doing that again. 

However, I have decided to stop buying stock options. Rather, I will invest my $$$ on simply buying stocks the simple way. 

Every time I buy an option, I take the risk of losing more money than I invest, and I can’t do that anymore. I’ve lost my wife already, I cannot have my dog leaving me for that shitty Maurice asshole living across the street with that sexy white poodle. 

Man, I just get so enraged thinking about it. Will I let that happen? 

Of course not! Fuck that poodle. I just hope my dog doesn’t. 

Over the course of the next few weeks, I will be making smarter investments. I will be rich, I will fuck my wife again! And I know the risk. If I fuck up, I will be leaving under a bridge. 

Nevertheless, I will remain optimistic. On Monday, I will be investing my remaining $$$$ on one specific stock. Which one? Here’s a hint: read the first letter of every paragraph 🚀 🚀 🚀I’ve been at my local Applebees for 4 hours, looking at tickers in my watchlist. I was bullish on DKNG when it was $63, I then forgot the stock existed for a few months, and now it’s at $23. I can’t help but be 3x bullish now that it’s at a $40 discount. Football is not going anywhere, and apparently you can make $280 off of a $5 bet. My cock is hard for the next Nintendo Entertainment System ticker, and I hope you’re here for it

I found options and it honestly has brought the worst out of me. went from being super careful with Investments to reckless. I need help to get back to that 200k mark. Instead almost every good move I make, the greed has brought the worst out of me and I make a twice as bad of a move. I made back my losses today with puts but I got greedy and went balls deep towards the falling knife And it sure cuts deep.

Can someone with a brain give proper advice on how I can get myself back? I’ve been day trading and I don’t think this is for me even though It’s a fun rush like a gambling addiction. I’m going to send back the money to my account I have here while I’m still up and maybe go for smaller gains because it’s not the Logical thing to do.

TLDR: The graph above represents SAVA's data (red line), and other lines represent competition and placebo. SAVA's cognitive data is not only far superior to the competition; it is the only drug that shows cognitive improvement on ADAS-cog in a US-based trial.

Below is what I was able to fit into reddit minus images.

&#x200B;

**1) Cassava Sciences - The Future of Alzheimer’s Disease Medicine**

Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ: SAVA) has publicly released the most promising data on Alzheimer’s treatment to date. Their revolutionary oral drug, Simufilam, as well as their rapid AD diagnostic blood test SavaDX, will potentially solve the largest unmet medical need in medicine. No other Alzheimer’s (AD) drug has been shown to be more effective in human trials (Phase 2b in 2021).In a breakthrough achievement, Cassava’s Simufilam hit the trifecta for medical treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease ─ groundbreaking effectiveness, excellent safety, and, equally important, improved patient behavior.

Cassava’s CEO, Remi Barbier, expressed extreme confidence by stating, “We are 100% planning on success”.Eventually, Cassava Sciences will have a binary outcome. However, the existing clinical data reveals a high probability (>90%) of success which we will discuss in-depth below. Recent interest by the FDA in the AD space has led to sharp increases in the market caps of BIIB, LLY, and RHBBY (details discussed below). Simufilam can expect the same upon FDA Approval. This presents investors with a valuable asymmetric risk-benefit investment opportunity. What are asymmetrical investments?

&#x200B;

Over ten years scientists Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang from The City College of New York (CUNY) and Cassava’s Dr. Lindsay Burns developed Simufilam. The journey began when research on postmortem brain dissections revealed the prominent role of tau deposits in Alzheimer’s Disease. They discovered Filamin A (FLNA) , when altered, plays a central role in [tau hyperphosphorylation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28438486/) and neuroinflammation. Based on this process, in 2011, Dr. Wang and Dr. Burns identified a binding molecule, Simufilam (PTI-125). Ten years later, SAVA’s Simufilam is in a position to revolutionize AD medicine.

Essentially, by reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and inflammation, Simufilam can stop and even reverse the progression of AD to improve the function of the patient.

📷

**2) The Vision: Altering Alzheimer’s Progression and Improving the Lives of Millions of AD Patients and Their Families**

Doctors often face the sad scenario where families bring their elderly relatives to the ER as they are unable to take care of them—not because they have become forgetful, but their agitation and aggressiveness have become unmanageable.Unfortunately, these families have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no efficacious treatment. While heart disease, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases have a myriad of remedies, tragically AD does not. According to the CDC, [AD ranks as the sixth leading cause of death](https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/alzheimers/index.html), and by other estimates, AD is the third leading cause of death for our elderly.

The unacceptable mortality statistics do little justice to the true scope of AD-related morbidity. Beyond death, AD has a tremendous impact on families, physicians, and society which can be assessed by its economic impact. The Overall Costs for AD are astronomical. Alzheimer's disease is projected to cost US $1.1 trillion dollars by [2050](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures).

📷

The progression towards death in Alzheimer’s disease is heartbreaking. Out of every 1,000 Medicare hospital admissions, 538 are associated with AD. Not only are there far more hospitalizations associated with AD, but those hospitalizations are also more complex, have increased duration, and more frequently result in death when compared to non-AD patients.

Decades of failure in the AD space have led to skeptics who believe AD cannot be cured or even effectively treated. However, other neurological diseases faced similar challenges in the past. In Parkinson’s, the medication Sinemet had an extraordinary impact with patients realizing dramatic and immediate improvement. The improvement facilitates decades of time to live independent lives. No such therapy exists for AD, though Simufilam has firm potential to break this paradigm.

The Amyloid hypothesis has dominated AD research which has led to over 100 failed attempts, most following the amyloid hypothesis, targeting a symptom rather than a root cause of the disease. The process for researchers to examine ADs from different [perspectives](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alzheimers-inc-when-a-hypothesis-becomes-too-big-to-fail/) has been slow and challenging but has begun. Simufilam has led the way. Simulfilam’s breakthrough method of targeting the root cause is a novel approach that sidesteps duplicating the missteps of the past. It is a disease-modifying therapy meant to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. Current therapies provide only symptomatic improvement.  Simufilam has the potential to slow cognitive decline, improving the quality of life and even perhaps extending the duration of life for millions of AD patients.

Simufilam additionally improves activities of daily living (ADLs) for many AD patients by reducing Behavioral Disturbances. This makes it much easier for caregivers and for families to care for their loved ones.  Family members experience extreme guilt when they can no longer care for their loved one often progressing to something known as Caregiver Stress Syndrome, characterized by extreme mental, physical & emotional exhaustion and strongly associated with negative health outcomes including depression and anxiety. Further downstream, Simufilam will decrease the burden on our healthcare system and its economic impact.

In summary, AD is a disease process that starts with one patient, affects a whole family,  and will snowball into a trillion-dollar problem for society, if unaddressed.  Simufilam’s never before seen trifecta of improved cognition, improved ADLs, and less behavioral disturbance is the overdue solution.

**3) Massive Market Opportunity: The Future $Trillion AD Ecosystem**

Apple, Netflix, Tesla, and numerous other companies revolutionized their Industries with innovative technologies, creating trillions of dollars in value. Upon approval of Simufilam, Cassava will have the most successful drug in history and will enter their Prestigious ranks. [Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), a senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, stated, "If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer’s disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.”

The market has yet to accurately price SAVA’s intrinsic value. Currently, it is pricing in 1-2% chance of success. In the following analysis, we will definitively show that the possibility of success (POS) is greater than 90%.  This presents an extraordinary opportunity for institutional and retail investors.

Humira’s total addressable market grosses approximately $20 billion annually while being used by 1.1 million patients worldwide (65% in the US). Meanwhile, the US Alzheimer’s market is at least 5 times larger.  It is also pertinent to mention Humira has several direct competitors (Simufilam has no competition). We estimate the AD market to expand as treatment becomes available. Most physicians hesitate to diagnose AD when treatment does not exist. In such cases, a diagnosis is a prolonged death sentence. Thus when a treatment is available, the incidence of diagnosed AD will likely increase.

Specifically, there are 6 million AD patients in the US and 15 million mild cognitive impairment (pre-AD) patients. Globally there are 55 million AD patients. This represents potential revenues that can surpass $100 billion annually.

While the market has been slow to comprehend this opportunity, it is not oblivious to it. On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by ***$17 billion*** in one day\*\*.\*\* Similarly the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by ***$15 billion and*** **$13 billion,** respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit and have unsafe risk profiles resulting in brain swelling and bleeding.

In addition to Simufilam, Cassava Sciences has released data on SavaDx. Its importance can not be overstated. AD is a disease that starts decades before clinical symptoms present. Said more simply, AD damages the brain before patients develop memory loss. From a patient's perspective, by the time memory loss develops, it's already too late. This is why clinical neurologists believe preventing AD is more important than treating it. SavaDx gives us the opportunity to prevent AD. It is a simple blood test that can accurately screen AD decades before neuronal injury and death. Early diagnosis with SavaDx gives clinicians the ability to treat AD before it causes irreversible damage in the brain. We envision this patient cohort to become the largest treatable population, upwards of fifteen million, based on the rate of expansion of the AD population.

Once Simufilam enters the market, Cassava’s SavaDx will rapidly expand Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment. SavaDX is currently being evaluated alongside Simufilam in SAVA’s Phase 3 trials.  It is clear that the FDA understands the importance of early diagnosis. Quanterix was granted BTD by the FDA for its version of SavaDx in 2021.

Market penetration is generally slower for new medications as associated adverse events are often not fully understood by physicians. More importantly, older alternative treatments often exist. With Simufilam’s excellent safety profile and a market with no adequate or alternate treatment, we foresee Simufilam’s uptake to be relatively rapid.

Lastly, below we examine the plethora of medical literature supporting added indications for Simufilam. Filamin-A (FLNA), Simufilam’s target, has been implicated in multiple diseases. Yale is aggressively pursuing and has shown clinical benefit in hard-to-treat seizures. A review of medical literature has implicated FLNA in cardiovascular disease. In fact, FLNA is present throughout the body and plays a role in many disease processes including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, strokes to name a few possibilities. The authors of this analysis believe Simufilam will balloon into a new class of medications similar to monoclonal antibodies.

**4) The Science**

📷

SImufilam has two primary mechanisms. 1) Decreasing neuroinflammation 2) Decreasing Tau Hyperphosphorylation.

FLNA is a complex scaffolding protein with many associated functions and associations. Work by Dr. Wang and Dr. Burns revealed when FLNA’s formation is altered it caused increased binding between AB42 and a cellular membrane protein complex setting off a cascade causing neuroinflammation (via TLR4 receptor), and Neurodegeneration (via the A7 receptor). Simufilam interacts with FLNA to decrease AB42 and the protein complex binding. This in turn stops Inflammation and neurodegeneration (secondary to decrease Tau hyperphosphorylation).  Both the degree of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can be gauged with biomarkers associated with the above cascades. These biomarkers include:

1. Abeta42
2. Total Tau
3. P-tau181
4. Neurogranin
5. Neurofilament Light Chain
6. YKL-40
7. Paired Associates Learning Test
8. Spatial Working Memory Test
9. IL-6
10. sTREM2
11. HMGB1
12. Albumin
13. IgG
14. Filamin A Linkages to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
15. Toll-like Receptor 4 in Subject Lymphocytes
16. Plasma P-tau181
17. SavaDx

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, all 17 biomarkers improved in patients taking Simufilam. We will discuss these spectacular results in more detail below.

To measure both improvement and decline in AD Patients under an experimental drug, we must perform tests on memory/IQ (cognition), activities of daily living (ADLs, ie. patient independence), psychiatric problems (behavioral issues), and stress imposed on caregivers. It helps to have “hard” measures such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests, as well as MRIs measuring brain shrinkage.

**Phase 2 Cognition Data Shows Incredible Improvement in AD Patients…**

Per [Woodland Report](https://woodlandreport.com/2021/11/cassava-sciences-sava-alzheimers-drug-may-be-the-best-drug-in-history/):

“[ADAS-Cog](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533317509350298) is the cognitive test used for SAVA’s trial. It is considered the “gold standard” test for evaluating AD drugs and how all AD drugs are ultimately evaluated by the FDA. To date, Simufilam is the only drug that has shown improvement in ADAS-cog, in a US-based trial.

The ADAS-cog is essentially an IQ/memory test, not an opinion survey. Compared to other cognitive tests such as MMSE, the ADAS-Cog is more sensitive and more comprehensive, requiring 45 minutes to complete. Below we discuss why this test is so thorough making it an accurate measure in AD.

[ADAS-Cog has 11 parts](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170991) (Dimensions):

* &#x200B;

1. Word Recall Task

* 2. Naming Objects and Fingers
* 3. Following Commands
* 4. Constructional Praxis
* 5. Ideational Praxis
* 6. Orientation
* 7. Word Recognition Task
* 8. Remembering Test Directions
* 9. Spoken Language
* 10. Comprehension
* 11. Word-Finding Difficulty

Based on 70 points, a higher score implies more errors (worse cognition). Eight of the 11 parts are objective. The other 3 require some subjective judgment to score, though there are clear guidelines in how they are scored. Let’s get into some detail.

Dimensions 1-4, 6-7, and 11 (i.e., seven out of eleven of all dimensions in ADAS-Cog) offer little room for random error, subjectivity, or rater bias as this assessment has a clear right or wrong answer.

📷

For example, consider dimension #1, Word Recall. For this, "A list of 10 words is read by the subject, and then the subject is asked to verbally recall as many of the words as possible. This test is repeated three times. The number of words not recalled across the three trials is averaged giving a score of 0 to 10. The test administrator does not use his subjective judgment at all; instead, the patient either remembers each of the 10 words or not.

📷

Another example, consider dimension #6, which assesses orientation. The subject is asked the date, month, year, day of the week, season, time of day, place, and person. The number of correct responses ranges from 0 to 8. The patient either correctly knows where he or she is or does not know; no subjective judgment is needed.

Take a look at the other dimensions that have clear right-or-wrong answers (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11).

📷Across the seven dimensions, the total number of available errors a patient can show is 49 (about 70% of all errors available).

Dimensions #5 and #8-10 (which together constitute 30% of all errors available)? These may not have clear right-or-wrong answers, however, ADAS-Cog test administrators receive training to avoid differences in scoring due to subjectivity. For dimension #5, Ideational Praxis, "The subject is asked to send a letter to themselves.  The instructions are:

1. Fold the letter
2. Put the letter in an envelope
3. Seal the envelope
4. Address the envelope
5. Put a stamp on the envelope

Scored from 0 to 5 based on the difficulty of performing the five components. If the patient adequately finishes all letter-sending tasks mentioned, then they'd get a 0 (no error). Difficulty in performing the steps warrants an assignment of an error point. As the reader can see, this is straightforward to score.

For dimensions #8-10, the administrator has a 10-minute open-ended conversation with the patient, and at the end, the test giver rates the patient from 0-5 per quality of the patient's speech based on:

1. How well the patient understands what the administrator is saying
2. The difficulty the patient has in finding desired words

If the patient speaks like a typical person like you and me, they'd get a 0 for each of the three dimensions (#8-10). To a clinician, these distinctions are obvious and take little thought. All physicians, PAs, and Nurse Practitioners learn to assess orientation and conversational skills early in training. These are some of the earliest clues to cognitive impairment and are a required assessment on basic history and physical exam (H&P).

Further, In psychometrics, researchers often deal with such performance or ability-based questions that do not readily offer clear right or wrong response options--and instead rely on the judgment of the rater. To mitigate this familiar issue, for decades researchers have developed rater training techniques to form a consensus on what type or degree of behavior corresponds to roughly what score. Rather than each rater using their own unique/idiosyncratic standards. An additional mitigation tactic is another party observing the test and giving their own score independently which is done at the AD trial sites. In addition, many clinical sites that perform cognitive testing for Cassava Sciences are also responsible to perform cognitive testing for LLY and BIIB via ADAS. To highlight this point, recent ADAS-cog testing showed little improvement in both LLY’s and BIIB’s medication over thousands of patients assessed. These same assessors gave Cassava Sciences’ patients scores clearly indicating improved cognition.

As these clinical test sites specialize in research trials in AD drugs (also performing studies for SAVA’s competitors, it’s what they professionally do), they would have a close familiarity with the ADAS-Cog. By definition, these physicians’ test-judging styles would form the gold standard. Notably, SAVA does not have involvement with how the sites are run; SAVA requests that the sites use ADAS-Cog per cognitive measurement and then the sites take it from there.

In (Ihl et al., 2012) the authors describe "the collection of ADAS-Cog-11 \[dimensions\] with the most potential for detecting a treatment response." These dimensions were:

1. Ideational Praxis
2. Remembering Test Instructions
3. Language
4. Comprehension of Spoken Language
5. Word Finding Difficulty

Dimensions #5 and 8-10 (which constitute 30% of total errors) are all included in this subset. Based on actual empirical evidence, dimensions #5 and 8-10 are \*in practice\* largely objective and valid. Concerns of subjectivity are hypothetical, which has not been observed over decades of ADAS-cog administration.

As it turns out, the more subjective portions of the ADAS-Cog [have very little relative contribution](https://www.page-meeting.org/pdf_assets/2921-ADAScog_IRT_Sebastian_Ueckert.pdf) amongst patients.

📷

Instead, it is tests 1, 6, and 7 that have the greatest impact. These are right-or-wrong Word Recall and Orientation questions, which all test short term memory. This makes sense given AD is a disease of short term memory. Placebo effect is unlikely to make a person suddenly remember the day or location, or recall a list of words.

Of note, Phase 3 will use ADAS-Cog12 which adds a Delayed Recall section. This makes it more sensitive for mild cognitive impairment. Simufilam will target this larger group of people (15 million patients in the US).

Skeptics can argue that due to the open-label nature of the Phase 2b trial, physicians can still score certain sections favorably for SAVA. However, the math definitely suggests this is extremely unlikely to make up for the large 8.2-9.2 point difference between the 12-month data and placebo. In addition, open-label trials of other AD drugs using the ADAS-Cog do not show these same results (discussed in the section below). Unlike with Simufilam, those patients all declined from 6 months onward in both open-label and placebo-controlled trials. We will discuss a cohort of over 40,000 patients to make this clear, below. Essentially, AD is like Rabies or cancer.  Either it is treated, or it overwhelmingly leads to death. Thus if we see AD patients improving over 12 months, it is assuredly treatment effect, not placebo.”

**5) Why the data is so unique in both Biomarkers and Cognitive Data.**

## Biomarker Data Predicts Efficacy Simufilam

📷

Simufilam’s biomarker results were groundbreaking. Previous AD medication directly targeted a single focus downstream and corresponding biomarkers showed limited benefit.   Several surrogate markers like increased inflammation and cerebral atrophy (brain shrinking) that were reported by Simufilam’s competitors foreshadow negative clinical outcomes long term.  Comparatively, Simufilam works upstream and the effect can be analyzed by 17 biomarkers monitoring neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The totality of all 17 biomarkers makes for a much more convincing case than the few reported by competitors. To be clear, all 17 biomarkers checked by Cassava Sciences improved in a 28-day randomized controlled trial. The two most important biomarkers include Aβ42/40 ratio and ptau181 which directly correlate with Alzheimer’s disease progression.

The utility of biomarkers in AD is to predict cognitive improvement before it happens as cognitive improvement can take many months. After reviewing the spectacular biomarker data in the 28-day trial, we anticipated cognitive data improvement would follow. The Biomarkers predicted correctly, as expected:

## 📷

The above ADAS-cog scores are what make Cassava Sciences a generational opportunity. Along with the biomarker data, these ADAS-cog score improvements have never been achieved in any US-based trial over 12 months. The Chart below shows Simufilam’s data (Red Line) compared to what is expected due to the natural course of the disease. This is represented by the Placebo group (Grey Line) and  Eli Lilly’s Donanemab (Green Line) trial. Simufilam Cohort results are vastly superior to both the Placebo and Donanemab Cohorts. Though BIIBs and RHHBYs medication has not been included on the below graph, the difference between Simufilam and those medications is just as significant.

The first 50 patients in the Phase 2b trials take place at 7 clinical sites (currently expanded to 200 patients and 16 sites). The table below shows patient selection. These are mild and moderate AD patients with an average age of approximately 70.

📷

📷

Biomarkers were followed on 25 of the 50 initial patients and continued to impress:

📷

Again, the biomarker data foreshadowed continued cognitive improvement correctly.  The mechanism of action (MOA) of Biogen’s Aduhelm (and many other Alzheimer’s drugs) seeks to directly target amyloid-beta to reduce the number of plaques, while Simufilam’s MOA  is further upstream and more comprehensive. It works by decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation and plaque build-up and decreasing inflammation.  By targeting a deeper, more fundamental cause, Simufilam serves as a more powerful means to not just clear the plaques, but also prevent formation. Biogen’s Aduhelm decreased pTau-181 levels by 13-16% at 12 months, Simufilam decreased it by 18% in half the time.

Little kids play this shit like crack and parents are buying them Robux to feed their addiction. Google searches for Robux increased substantially over the holidays. Not to mention the NFL deal. Plus Pelosi pulled a YOLO with $100 1/23 calls. What do you think? Bullish or Bearish after earnings?Hello fellow degens of WSBs,

I remember someone in here had a YOLO 180k calls on FB that expired on February 18th but unfortunately, I can't find the post anymore. Would the kind gentleman show us some of his loss porn he has atm since a lot of my brothers and sisters here have suffered some severe losses and might need some of his guidance? Do you guys think he pulled out? or is he hodling?

1. 7.5% CPI data is bearish (we haven’t peaked).
2. Interest rates. Fed emergency meeting Monday. Expect them to hike early and fast.
3. Good earnings not rewarded.
4. Russian is officially rumored to invade Ukraine soon.
5. High yield savings will be more valuable than stocks once yield passes mortgage rates. 
6. US debt 30T over 130% GDP. With interest rates rising, govt won’t be able to save us this time.
7. COVID 19 supply chain issues still in full effect

Don't roast me but I still use Robinhood. For some reason they don't have the CPI stock. Am I doing something wrong or do they just not have the stock on Robinhood? Thanks in advance!Apparently I don't understand shit when it comes to stocks lol the fucking call calculator told me I should b up 1k but instead I'm down nearly 80% because of some bullshit thing called IV crush I do not get how puts and calls can lose money when it went up so fucking high from earnings. Whatever this retard is done with stocks folks I'll just save my money like a normal person and make my monthly car payment and die poor I guess. 🙃 I'm more angry at myself then anything because obviously I have to smooth of a brain to understand simple shit like IV crush and I figure if I don't understand the game why play it. Luckily I'm not financially broke my dreams r just crushed for now

Asana’s CEO Has Bought $1 Billion Of Company Stock. It’s Likely the Largest Purchase Ever by a Corporate Insider.

Moskovitz, a Facebook co-founder, started Asana (ticker: ASAN) in 2008. 
His latest string of purchases—exactly 7 million shares from Dec. 30 to Feb. 4 for more than $400 million—came in the wake of a sharp decline in Asana shares. The stock has rebounded in the last week.

Moo moo I am a cow. 

Quack quack I am a duck.

Meow meow I am a bear.So today, inspired by a few posts I read earlier in the pre-market, I decided to try my knowledge with options. So, this is what i have done, but i don't understand the outcome. I don't think it was supposed to come out this way.

Honestly, i have no 'ucking clue what i have done, i just remembered i pressed Buy and Sell a few times.

First if you turn the ticker upside down and backwards you get VAVS which is obviously a mispelling of VANS which people haven't been driving for years due to an uptick in the SUV market.

Also I have never heard of SAVA until today and am pretty sure it was just made up by the Canadian trucker blockade to distract us from the fact that no one ever talks about clear Dr. Pepper anymore.

I did a google search of clear Dr. Pepper and came up with this image (worth approximately 31 million in today's market if you own the original link). Obviously this man has never worked at SAVA or even heard of this company and is in desperate need of a day off.

TLDR: SAVA is just a bunch of guys in vans with really bad satellite internet drinking regular Dr. Pepper. This is not financial advice and I am not a marmot.

Mark shifted his company away from the open platform of the browser and onto a closed system where Apple set the terms.

EDIT: They start going onto the topic around 23 minutes inSo I ran up on $Z Wednesday night and it was earnings time.. I've been following $OPAD since Zillow screwed the pooch on flipping houses last quarter. I decided to play both sides and bought a $61 call and 36.5 Put.. Both are green at the moment.. I was excited af about its moves AH but everything I'm finding is saying earnings sucked and its going to be a blood bath today..   Anyone got an opinion on this?     I'm selling my call at open and riding the put down I guess.. anyway...  Keep an eye on Z next week.. It may be a good play to buy some puts for the next month.. Everyone seems discouraged by 800+ million loss[Meeting of the Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm) set for Monday morning. There were rumours earlier of an emergency rate hike before March. And one member called for a full percent increase in rates before July, possibly as two half percent increases.

Edit: this appears to be a normal meeting but has been spreading as FUD on Twitter and StockTwits. It may still affect trading at open, but I'm changing my flair to discusion.I’d have to imagine a war between Russia and Ukraine would have a negative impact on the market in the short term, but I honestly have no idea. For all I know, it could give the market a boost. What are your thoughts on this matter? How will a Russian invasion affect the market in the short, medium and long term? Will a Russian invasion cause investors to panic? Let me know what you guys think will happenRussia about to get sanctioned to shit and PALL will go thru the roof. Russia produces shit ton of palladium. I bought some in January when shit really start going down the hill. Scientists and shit need palladium for who knows what. 

My only green ticket. 

I’m up 10% (not much but better than my other stocks). If you follow PALL, you will see it’s always shoots up when Russia and Ukraine is mentioned in the news. God speed, retards.Degens, guys with wives who have girlfriends and girls with men who jerk off alone in the closet every night, gather round this campfire I have something to tell you about all the FUD going around.

Inflation is going to taper because of base effects (and base effects are a substantive cause of current Y/Y inflation metrics).  This of course is why the FUD is spreading faster than my wife’s legs for her boyfriend when I leave for a hot minute to pickup some smokes and hit up the strip club. All the mother FUDders on this sub want you to fear JPOW’s big 1% interest rate announcement.  But I have news for you:  the market will rally hard after a massive one day (maybe even half day) drop.  Why? A few reasons:
1- expectation that inflation will come down
2- base effects should drive down actual inflation starting with April or May report.
3- Covid is over
4- fuck your poots

Thats right, save your poots for under the covers when your wifes boyfriend comes over.  An increase in interest rates is a good thing, stable inflation is a good thing, and the megacaps will do exceedingly well, meaning yolo call opportunities.

Fear not, hold and persevere!

Big 🚀💵This week has been bloody! My spy calls we're beat up and I don't see a big reversal coming anytime soon with the fed looking extremely hawkish on rates. If we get a double hike next month the market could take a huge hit. I know this possibility is partially priced in but it isn't a reality yet. I'm curious to watch how real estate prices and stock prices reacts as the rates increases aggressively over the next 3-12 months. I'm considering moving more equity into the real-estate market but I'm not sure if I want to further my leverage with a possible connection ahead in both markets. Let me know your thoughts and what you predict in the for the next year! [📉](https://emojipedia.org/chart-decreasing/)[📉](https://emojipedia.org/chart-decreasing/)[📈](https://emojipedia.org/chart-increasing/)Alright guys big day ahead! Friday. day after cpi. and day after huge sell off. bullish or bearish? lets find out!

pre market we are obviously seeing some green which im going to relate to the fed not announcing a major hike and that 50-75 bps is the plan with no "emergency". is that the right move? well probably not but thats not what we are here to debate! we only care what the chart shows us. 10 years back under 2.0 and the vix is relatively flat. 

i will not being jumping into puts or calls at opening bell. need to wait and see what she's going to do next. 

supports- 449.5 --> 446.4 -->445.5 --> 444.4 --> 443 --> 442 (bottom of red support for the symmetrical triangle). 

resistance- 450.3 --> 451--> 451.4 --> 456 (breakout towards the white dotted resistance line).

do not be a perma bull or perma bear. this very well may retest 456 before we drop lower. or this very well may drop to 442 before finishing green. 

remember the goal of today is one 10% trade. take it. secure your profits. and live to trade monday. if you wanna let it ride set a stop loss.

I highly doubt retail was behind this especially on a day a pile ftds were due. Share volume yesterday was over 3 million and average volume is around 300k?

What I’m asking is if this strange activity suggests the large players are banking on these going itm? 

I can’t mention ticker due to wsb rules but it’s probably irrelevant because my question is centered around this type of activity in general so ticker shouldn’t matter? 

Any help is appreciated I’m not asking for advice regarding this investment more so if anyone has seen this before and what I should expect for the coming week? Thanks in advance.Inflation and potential war…the perfect ingredients for a bullish bond market. The market was priced in for a .25 hike this March but with a likely .5 coming up with another possibility of a total sum of 1 point basis hike by July (Bullard’s word)…the market is well underprepared for that. Now add the growing conflict tensions between Russia and Ukraine and all other allies involved, there is no doubt that next week (if not next multiple weeks) is going to be rough as the market calibrates to the new upcoming events. As a bull though, I do see light at the end of the tunnel maybe in March after the hikes finally set in and hopefully we avert a crisis in Ukraine.

But I don’t want to be ignorant of the broader implications of these events.
We can talk about how bad inflation is for the market but let’s be thankful we are in a position where we have money to invest in the market to even have these worries let alone deal with additional costs that inflation brings to families who are still struggling to put food on the table and have suffered tremendous losses economically and emotionally during this pandemic. As for the escalating crisis in Ukraine, it really puts into perspective how fortunate we are to live in a country where our lives aren’t under the threat of some foreign power in the modern world and hope this crisis does get averted as it’s unnecessary to waste lives for pointless causes 🙏.

With that all in mind, hopefully we can use this post as a friendly discussion into what these next few months holds for us.https://imgur.com/a/wuKkX5l

Ready to ride the economic boom!So, Russia is looking to invade Ukraine. The west is committing to impose sanctions if they do. Putin already made an agreement with Xi to sell gas to China. The US is asking other countries and China to provide oil and gas to Europe in case of war. 

So what I think is going to happen is gas is just going to get funneled to Europe through China. The company with most pipelines in China is petrochina $ptr. They are going to be in the best position to profit from the situation of buying dirty sanctions ridden Russian gas and sell it cleanly. 

I know nothing else about the company other than they are the biggest in China with the most pipelines and they connect to Russia through Kazakhstan and another directly. 


Positions: nothing yetToday, a meeting notice on the Fed website attracted market attention.

This notice anticipates a private meeting at 11:30 a.m. local time on February 14 (next Monday), which will focus on the review and decision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on the prepayment rate and discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank.

The notice once again triggered speculation about "raising interest rates in advance". The main reason is that the new CPI data released by the United States yesterday once again set a 40 year record. The market has begun to generally expect to raise interest rates six or even seven times this year. The speech of "raising interest rates by 100bps before July" by Brad, chairman of the Federal Reserve in St. Louis, has poured a hot oil on the already tight market.

Tim duy, an observer of the Federal Reserve and a macro strategist at SGH, also said that it was not impossible to raise interest rates again before the FOMC meeting in March, "whether this Friday or next Monday". This happens to coincide with the time of this meeting, so "sit tight" guessed.

However, it is precisely because the market is anxious enough about the topic of raising interest rates that it needs to be pointed out that this meeting is not an interest rate resolution meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), but a regular meeting of the board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to discuss the discount rate.

The Fed's website shows that the board usually meets every other Monday, and the meeting will be held in public unless members consider matters that need to be kept confidential.

According to the minutes of the meeting, the Council held similar meetings on January 18 this year, December 6 and November 15 last year, and the contents of the meeting also focused on prepayment and discount interest rates.

Analyst Garfield Reynolds told Bloomberg that the "expedited procedures" mentioned in the notice only meant that the meeting did not need to be notified one week in advance.

ive got a seriously perplexing stock for anyone whos bored and curious - check out Mr Cooper Group (thats literally the name of the company LOL) - ticker "COOP"  
They had good earnings and popped 18% today to hit their ATH levels.  
The confusing part is - IT DIDNT BUDGE at all during the market wide DUMP..im talking Maximum Level Retard Strength.  
I bought April puts for around $1.7 that were worth ~$6 just a COUPLE OF DAYS ago so im not too worried but wow WTF? 

Markets eagerly awaited January’s inflation data, and remained in limbo for three days. Of course, the expectation about the figures was high, and an excessive risk could not be taken. And the presentation did not disappoint: **the 7.5% year-on-year inflation up to January in the general index, and 6% in the measurement that excludes food and energy,** were catalysts for important movements, which are maintained over the closing of the week

[https://markettimes.co.uk/markets/the-fed-without-alternatives/](https://markettimes.co.uk/markets/the-fed-without-alternatives/)I posted previously on HIMX and their massive earnings potential. They are currently very undervalued sitting within earshot of their massive dong raising shithole clenching 🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕💥💥
The past 2 months there has been massive short selling on the company driving the price down since it’s recent December peak. The past week has already seen 7 straight green days as interest is raising due to the upcoming earnings. Volume since December has been ~2.5M s/d but the last 7 days have seen well over 3M s/d. We are currently up 12% on the week and are sitting green post CPI bullshit (hell yeah to foreign tech). Their P/E is sitting around 6. Every earnings their stock explodes and either approaches or blows past previous ATHs. Earnings is on 2/17 and they have previously beat revenue projections every quarter 2021 and beat EPS 2021 by 12.5% 24.5% and 40.71%. In the past quarter we saw a MASSIVE explosion of the EV market and every nanny and their friends bought VR sets for the grandchildren. HIMX supplies the chips for all of those displays and if their earnings trajectory continues we are likely to see over 60% beat on EPS. Assuming we blow harder than a $20 prostitute in downtown Trenton we could be looking at breaking the ATH of $17 and 🚀🚀into 80%+ gains. As of Jan 15,  the DTC on short sales was sitting around 9.2 days based on volume with an outstanding 22.7M shares sold short which is around 20% of float which isn’t supermassive like my throbbing cock every time I look at my positions, but it’s certainly enough to cause a pretty gigantic cum explosion if we zoom to ATH or even just +50% for earnings week.

I’m not going to tell you retard about this anymore just know that I am NEVER wrong…I’m only ever right or not right yet. Now excuse me while I go stand in the closet and jack off to my wife’s boyfriend boning her.

Melvin (No)Capital is losing money on AFRM. The stock is down 25 percent today. They are the fund that lost 41 percent of their last year and even more with FB this year. Add another loss to Gabriel Plotkin’s fund. Also add another loss to Michael Jordan by extension. He invests with Melvin Capital. Melvin Capital will it survive 2022 or go the way of Bill Hwangs Archegos the fund that went under in 2021. Well anyway here is some more loss porn for you fine people. Have a great evening!


Edit Expedia another of Melvins main holdings down.

[Full Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)I found this one a little over a year ago. It’s an index that tracks carbon credits futures. I was interested in carbon credits when I was looking for unique ways to bet on renewables as I figured an increase in renewables combined with restrictions on pollution from manufacturing would increase their value. Of course I was not only correct that the value would increase but I also never bought any of this index. It’s up 87% on the year. I’m just wondering what y’all’s opinions in it are. When do yiu think we’ll reach a point that carbon credits will be less valuable due to manufacturing practices becoming greener. I bought 1 leap and I’m considering accumulating morePrices on Aluminum have gone sky high + 54% for the year the highest in 13 years.  There's suppy chain problems right now and Europe is hurting to find dependable sources of energy.  If there's more COVID as well (causing miners to get sick and/or stay at home from work), there's going to be a serious Aluminum shortage.

This is data and facts.

According to the latest Yahoo Finance data update, about 13% of TLRY’s float is being shorted. 

While that float probably isn’t high enough for a major short squeeze, any short interest above 10% is generally considered elevated. That should raise warnings on BOTH sides; bulls should be concerned about underlying fundamentals, while bears should be concerned about the possibility of a squeeze if short interest continues to increase.

The already heavily-shorted stock has seen even more interest from short sellers as of late, despite its profitable fiscal Q2 earnings surpassing Wall Street’s earnings estimates, and Tilray's feat of reporting positive EBITDA for the 11th consecutive quarter.

Just keep this stock in the back pocket of your watch list and please comment, even if you're of the opposite opinion.

To curve inflation Fed needs to do 3 things

1. Raise interest rates above what inflation is now. REAL RATES ARE NEGATIVE
2. Stop printing any more money or letting fed buy more treasuries or Corporate Bonds
3. And in the long run, congress needs to cut spending and balance a fucking budget - NOT HAVE ANY FUCKING DEFICITSI  know people are sick of GME but ya'll can go fuck yourselves.   Regardless of what you think of the company's future, MOASS, the cult-like hopium echo chamber, etc when looking at the chart over the past year, it's really hard to deny that there has been some cyclical price movement.  And guess what, we're in the process of making another run, as expected based on previous cycles.   Some nice green dildos so far this week with Tuesday +13% and Wednesday +7.5% but have no fear,  you haven't missed your chance to yolo in you fucking degens.

Take a look at this very dumbed down chart:  [https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png)

All I'm trying to show here is the approximate 60-trading day cycle that we can track over the past year from peak to peak. It's important to note that the sneeze last January was not tied to any of these cycles.   Based on the 60-day cycle, the current run will peak around 2/18, which is in line with a big OPEX clearing date.  What happened around this time last year?  how about the stock more than doubling over a 2 day period.  If we can break the year-long trend and run into OPEX, a  significantly larger move up is possible.

While the stock is the lowest it's been in quite some time, it's primed for a big move thanks in part to the options chain.

Here's some fun options activity from today:  [https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png)

Some  pretty nice call buying pressure coming in.   The put/call ratio has  flipped to heavily favor calls, both in volume and premiums.

Ortex Data:  [https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png](https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png)

Considering  short positions are self-reported and I don't really trust Ortex data  this all has to be taken with a giant fucking grain of salt but it's  interesting to note that over the past month cost to borrow and  utilization is the highest they've been since before last January with  utilization reaching 100% today. There are some interesting theories as  to why we're seeing this now but that's too complicated for me and not  important to the point i'm trying to make.

The  data i reference has bIeen pulled from various posts/DD of late and is  not my original content. Considering my extremely low IQ, I'm not nearly  capable of coming to these conclusions on my own.  What's been  particularly pleasing to my smooth brain is how multiple people have  come to similar conclusions around these cycles, even when taking  different approaches to get to the same end place.

ok, now i'm ready for the gme hate...May it be a lesson to you all who get some freshly minted tendies.. but then realize you forgot to sell…. lesson, sell your shit. 25% is fucking plenty in this market.

"sometimes you just need to transfer a few thousand and pretend like it never happened" - WSBI was looking at SOXS and thought it may be a good purchase with the worry of a crash. My only question is how do people make money off of those?

If you own something that goes up when the market crashes, why would anyone buy it when it’s really high? Like if there’s a 80% dip and This goes up 240% (being a 3x), why would anyone buy that? Is it that there are people dumb enough to think it would go higher so they buy it then? Like when gold shot up in March 2020?Hear me out, so Webull allows 4x day trade leverage on AMD and ROKU, which are pretty volatile stocks. With my $26,000 account I can get $104,000 worth of leverage on them, so all I need to do is identify the trend and set a take profit order at 0.2%. What are the odds that I absolutely top tick it and the stock doesn’t move in my favor by 0.2% throughout  the whole day? This couldn’t possibly go tits up right?Time to blow the dust off grandpa Cheney’s playbook and do the 4-3 war blitz split: calls for boeing, lockheed, haliburton, and raytheon, puts on index ETFs.

This is it, boys, those who missed 2002 war tendies are getting their chance. So what do ya’ll think? Will putinski be our new overlord?AFRM was planning to release earnings at 4:00 PM On Feb 10, 2022 – after market close. They accidentally sent out a tweet summarizing their earnings, 2 hours early.

This was picked up on Twitter and the markets started to freak out. I’ve outlined what happened in the following timeline – note all times are in EST

## 1:47 PM – AFRM “accidentally” tweets out earnings results and then deletes the tweet.

There were a few accounts on twitter that caught this mistake and started to share it – one of the larger accounts being Stock Market News – [here is a link to the tweet](https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily/status/1491846317336846338). Leading up to this time it was relatively quiet across social media as people were waiting for the earnings after market close. At this point in time AFRM was trading at about $80 per share and started to become more volatile based on the tweet starting to be shared across Twitter.

*“$AFRM when you write the perfect scheduled tweet and accidentally just send it 💀”*

To give you a bit of perspective of how significant this mistake was, here is a breakdown of how quickly it started to circulate across twitter for the next 30 minutes

Number of tweets increased 580%, number of likes increased 211% and number of impressions (how many people see a tweet mentioning AFRM) increase a whopping 842%. 32 million people saw a tweet related to AFRM in this short span of time. This will all picked up on the [Utradea Social Sentiment Dashboard](https://utradea.com/social-dashboard)  


https://preview.redd.it/fbr96k0l33h81.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=022d6111848e1e80c9f2f8e43f5135842082bf44

For the next little while there seems to be a mix of Calls and Puts being purchased, and the flow looked a bit more active. The price moves between $82 and $77 per share. The market was still trying to make sense of the accidental tweet

## 2:45 PM – AFRM Share Price Starts to drop of the cliff

Around this time AFRM is trading $82 per share, and then a few minutes later we see it nosedive to $51 per share in a mater of minutes. Trading was halted for a few minutes over this time period, but the stock continued to fall. Once trading resumed, we started to see the price bounce back up as high as $65 a share.

At this point the damage was done. The tweet wiped out close to 25% of the share price and approximately $5 Billon in market cap.

## 3:20 PM – AFRM tweets out actual earnings release

Here is a quote of their tweet “Due to human error, a small portion of Affirm’s fiscal Q2 results were inadvertently tweeted from Affirm’s official Twitter account earlier today.”

Below I’ve highlighted a few bullets from their official earnings release.

Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 Operating Highlights:

* *Gross merchandise volume ("GMV") for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 115%. Excluding the impact from the completion of the initial rollout of Affirm's interest-bearing solution with Amazon in November, GMV doubled.*
* *Active merchants increased from 8,000 to 168,000, driven primarily by the adoption of Shop Pay Installments by merchants on Shopify's platform.*
* *Active consumers grew 150% to 11.2 million and increased by 2.5 million, or 29%, compared to the period ended September 30, 2021.*
* *Transactions per active consumer increased 15% to 2.5 as of December 31, 2021.*

Looking at these results you’d be happy as an AFRM investor – they performed extremely well in the last quarter.  


Unfortunately, the damage is done – at market close the shares were trading at $60. Here are some of the tweets in response to AFRM earnings blunder

*“I expect to be fully compensated. I’ve contacted your IR team. This is not acceptable”*

*“Wtf. Lost over 50k because of this mistake. Entire plan was to expect earnings after hours not during”*

*“This “human error” cost me a ton of money.  Good earnings overall but this screw up cost me big.  Stock dropped and was manipulated down.  Options flow was super bullish on this.”*

### Closing Thoughts on AFRM Earnings Blunder

First, the power of social media in the stock market, especially Twitter. Whether it as an accident or not, Affirm dropping this news on Twitter will get picked up almost instantly. Even if it is deleted. Twitter is truly one of the best sources for real-time stock market information. AFRM would be more than aware of this. As an investor, you should have an active pulse on what is trending on Twitter.

Secondly, I think we will see an investigation into what happened with the early tweet. It could have been an honest mistake, but you can look at put options that were purchased ahead of time an see who stood to gain from a significant drop in price. I will be watching this closely over the next little while.I can understand some movement to less risky positions, but I cannot understand the continual losses across the entire market when inflation is higher than expected. Inflation should increase most prices, no? Cf. Burry’s initial warning about a stock market “upward crash”. Maybe that already happened before us mere mortals knew? Because it doesn’t look to be happening now. 

I get being spooked at first, large positions moving more into bonds, etc. But how can a slight increase in inflation be a direct cause of multipoint losses across the board, over and over?Throughout 2021 corporate profits in America seemed immune to infection, inflation and snarled-up global supply chains. With most of the country’s biggest firms having reported their latest quarterly results, revenues and earnings in the last three months of the year seem poised to set another record. The technology industry’s annual profits rose by a quarter, compared with 2020. Among property firms in the s&p 500 index they swelled by a third. Net-profit margins have edged down from their recent peak in the second quarter of 2021 and analysts forecast lower earnings and sales in the first three months of 2022. It may prove to be a brief sniffle caused by unusually strong seasonal factors. But America Inc no longer looks totally impervious.

**Read [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide), follow [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Official_WSB) and [IG](https://www.instagram.com/official_wallstreetbets/), browse [Discord](https://discord.gg/wallstreetbets), see [ban bets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets)!**So for those of you who really want to know what's going on...here it is. I implore you to actually read this even though it's long. It will be very important to see what happens over the next couple years (or even months):

\- Our Fed is either lying or is completely feckless/ignorant about the inflation situation. I think they are lying because they don't want to incite panic. There has almost NEVER, I repeat NEVER been a time in our history when inflation has been calmed by a Fed Funds Rate below the inflation itself. In most of our history, the Fed Funds Rate has always been HIGHER than inflation, particularly during times of high inflation when the Fed needed to calm it. So to think, a hike of .25% is going to get the job done against what is now 7.5% inflation and counting is absolutely comical . A complete joke if we're being honest  😂😂😂. They will have to raise rates MUCH faster and quicker than they've said. Which brings me to point #2.

\- The Fed may genuinely THINK inflation will come down on its own when supply side issues are resolved, and the labor market isn't as tight, blah blah blah. Guess what? The Fed of the 1970s said the exact same thing. Instead of admitting responsibility (the historically loose monetary policy is probably 90% of what caused this inflation), they will look to other causes to save their own asses. Well the Fed 100% perpetuated this inflation. The only way they will get it to come down is by doing what the Fed finally did in the late 70s/early 80s and that was to hike rates SO ridiculously high (it peaked around 20%), that inflation was finally defeated. By the way the inflation at that time maxed at just under 15%, so the Fed Funds rate was hiked Well above that to quell the inflation problem. Think of what 10% Fed Funds rate within a year would do...well that brings me to my next point

\- Bonds will take an absolute epic shit. Followed by the biggest stock market crash in our market's history. Short either of these with LEAPS and you will make lots of money. If you're able to time short term moves even halfway decently, generational wealth is on the table. People will argue "but the stock market did fine in the 70s and 80s. Blah, blah, blah." Firstly it was a very different situation. They weren't in the most overpriced market in history by almost every fundamental metric (and not just stocks, remember we're in an "everything" bubble with bonds, real estate, internet money, etc. even trading cards!). Secondly, they didn't have a global pandemic that still threatens a potential recession. And lastly, the market of the 70s and 80s actually had a massive period of negative "real returns." It was one of the worst performing markets in history when accounting for the huge inflation that wiped away the nominal returns. We may see one final run for stocks in the next couple months, but the big crash is coming and there's no way around that.

\- Lastly, I would like to emphasize the severity of the situation, not just in the US but globally. Every country is experiencing high inflation, because EVERY country instituted this ridiculously loose monetary policy when the pandemic happened (I really am shocked how they all could be so dumb...did they actually have to take economics classes to get their degrees? Unfortunately, it became a "they're doing it, so it must be okay if we do too!" situation). The UK has already rate hiked twice and this hasn't done shit to slow down their inflation. They are also seeing what we will likely start to see here (or maybe already have): A price wage spiral. When inflation increases, workers start demanding higher salaries to compensate for the money they lose to inflation. Well, businesses have to pass those increased salary expenses back through the sales of their goods and services, thus creating a loop of price increases and higher inflation. If you don't believe me, google "Andrew Bailey, pay raise" and see what pops up  😂😂😂. He's essentially the "fed char" of England's central bank and is facing huge backlash for asking workers not to ask for pay raises. As hilarious as it is, his request would probably help slowdown inflation but we can see there is no way that's going to happen and if Powell says that here, he will look just as bad as Bailey.

TLDR: In short inflation can only be stopped by one thing at this point. Not supply chain issues being resolved, not the pandemic going away. Fast and furious rate hikes which will ultimately crash the "everything bubble" we have had building for the last 13 years. Enter those short positions and get ready for some fun fellow bears 📉📉📉🚨🚨🚨🐻🐻🐻 But epic buying opportunities will manifest at the end of this, so be ready to scoop up your favorite equities at insane discounts!

TLDR 2: Short everything! The crash is nigh!!!!!Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies, PMCCs…Yada, yada, yada.
What do you call it when you are bullish on a stock, buy 60 day expiry OTM options, then sell weekly covered calls at the exact same strike price so you can exercise your calls if it moons and someone exercises against your weeklies?

Am I just writing this sentence so AutoMod doesn't delete this post for being too short? PossiblyUber stock trading was halted somewhere (not because of Robinhood). The stock was frozen for 40 minutes and then was let loose at a 5% loss. Their earnings yesterday were stellar. Feels like all market forces are working against me to try to get my options to lose. Anyone know why the halt happened?Hello fellow retards

I come to you with a new bullish investment opportunity. Yes you heared right. Bullish. Have had it with the 🌈🐻 shit in the past few weeks and wanna hear some solid green crayon stuff? Here you go:


**Intro**

A few days ago, I was watching this video on YT where that dude explained how the start of coffee consumption (and therefore caffeine) was one of the big contributors to the economic upswing in Europe. People used to drink alcohol more regularly during the day. It was their main drug. That changed with coffee though. People were able to work earlier in the day and for longer in the evening. 



**Main Part**

So you see the people themselves are mentally and physically dependent on that shit. What's even better is that your bosses need you to stay that way too. They need the working force. So you best believe that coffee will be needed no matter the state of the economy. It's basicly on the same level as water at this point in our society.


**Conclusion**

I'm currently broke bc I'm on this sub too much but as soon as I get some money I'm gonna go full margin on coffe futures or some other stupid derivative, idk.Have you ever been to a busy restaurant and your server takes like 10 years to run your card, so you're stuck sitting there with your wife and her boyfriend, awkwardly waiting?

Have you ever tried to order food online but the restaurant's online ordering system is a pile of hot garbage?

Have you ever worked at a restaurant and the POS ^((point of sale, but piece of sh!t works too)) system is as old as Cathie Wood?

Toast (TOST) fixes this.

Toast is a cloud-based ^((OOOOH fancy buzzword)) restaurant systems company that makes hardware (POS systems that aren't actually a piece of sh!t) and software as well as processes payments from restaurant transactions. (They take a little cut when you order from a restaurant that uses them)

Here's why you should buy it. (Not financial advice)

* Rapid growth: TOST is growing revenues at **105% year-over-year**
* Solid revenues: TOST is on track to make **$2B** in annual revenue this year ($14B mkt cap, \~7x price to sales)
* Excellent customer retention: Net retention is around **110%**, meaning that not only are they retaining their customers, they're actually getting their customers (restaurants) to buy MORE of their shit!

*TOST reports earnings next Tuesday (Feb. 15th) after market close.* I expect their report to be good. Why?

1. **These things have started popping up everywhere.** I feel like I can't go a week without seeing Toast at a restaurant. I went back on my credit card statement from last month and "TST\*" is all over it, which is how a Toast payment shows up.
2. **People are fucking lazy.** As people start to be more comfortable going out and doing shit, they're going to go get takeout or go eat at a restaurant. They're not gonna cook their own food, literally who has time for that?
3. **People are going back to work.** TOST's last earnings report was Q3 2021. What happened in Q3 2021? Oh yeah, people just stopped working. They said fuck this part time minimum-wage restaurant job, I'm done. Restaurants everywhere were shortening their hours and closing due to staffing shortages. I expect that with fewer staffing shortages in Q4 2021, we should see some impressive growth and guidance. HOPEFULLY this would push the stock higher, but this is a clown market, so who knows.

**TL;DR - everyone eats food, no one wants to make it themselves. Buy TOST. Call your mother. Not financial advice.**

Edit: Position 150 shares. I'm poor, so this is a lot for me, I swear

Guess what, upon the release of CPI data today, at 7.5%

The probability of a 50bps rate hike shot up to 48.2%

Moving into March's CPI data, I would expect an easy 7.8-8.0%. (refer to Brent and gas prices and you would see the clear indication, energy prices has the largest weightings in your CPI data)

What this means is that, a quicker and much more aggresive rate hike will be neccesary to bring down inflation.


Tldr: sell all your calls and buy PUTS.

Edit: St Louis Fed President Jim Bullard just confirmed my prediction. 50 BASIS POINT RATE hike on the menu in March Fed Meeting. That's 34 days from now.How do you degenerates feel about AAL? It seemed to perform pretty well through the week aside from today. Do you guys think it’s mostly hype from recent contracts and merges or do you all think it’s a solid buy right now?&#x200B;

I was never good at the normal card tricks or escaping an underwater death trap through the use of a secret key.  However,  I noticed that things would turn up missing on a regular basis.  My weed, lighter, sandwich, money,and girlfriend all vanished in a few weeks.  Finally,  I understand my gift.  I am the answer to inflation.  I wear no cape but I assure you I am the super hero you have been looking for.  I challenge you to place a ticker in the comments of this post.  I will give you analysis on that ticker and you will inverse my call.  I assure you inflation will no longer be an issue in your house.[https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm)

 Closed Board Meeting on February 14, 2022

##### Government in the Sunshine Meeting Notice

*Advanced Notice of a Meeting under Expedited Procedures*

It is anticipated that the closed meeting of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at **11:30 a.m. on Monday, February 14, 2022**, will be held under expedited procedures, as set forth in section 261b.7 of the Board's Rules Regarding Public Observation of Meetings, at the Board's offices at 20th Street and C Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C.. The following items of official Board business are tentatively scheduled to be considered at that meeting.

**Meeting Date:** Monday, February 14, 2022

##### Matter(s) to be Considered:

1.Review and determination by the Board of Governors of the advance and discount rates to be charged by the Federal Reserve Banks.Because this is the most Batmaniest Batman Pattern I have ever seen. [It's simple, the bat kills the market] https://imgur.com/a/QMuJII8)

And before you guys get all upset that this post has a bearish implication remember, I don't care, shut up. I'm bullish when the situation calls for it. I was planning some bullish plays Monday, but saw this. So I'm reconsidering and asking advice of the best minds I know, and also you guys.



I normally look at charts in my ToS account, but this guy was pretty easy to spot. Not flagging this as technical, because I really don't think this pattern is all that telling, really. And I'm not predicting anything, but this has made me think I'm going to stick with my bearish sentiment a little longer.2 factors that primarily drove up the stock prices during the pandemic were:

1. Increased retail participation due to more time (work from home), excess savings due to less expenditures in services (vacations, salons, restaurants, night life).

2. More institutional money flows due to super easy monetary policy by the central banks. The companies that invested in more capacity already had the funds and the rest just borrowed and invested to offset losses in operating businesses.

Both the open taps (easy monetary policy and excess savings) are coming to an end. With high inflation, a lot of the stock market gains are getting used up now as well. 

Fresh money has to flow in for the markets to go up. While wages have gone up, so has the inflation. Other asset classes have also made people a lot of money such as real estate or cryptocurrency (even after the recent declines). What if the value of these asset classes start coming down? (CBDCs or stricter regulations are on the horizon). Then people would have to sell stocks to generate liquidity after losses in these other asset classes.

My point is that while nobody can predict where markets will go from here but thinking in terms of probability, there seems to be much more downside probability than upside. 

Correct me if I am wrong in my thought process.

Edit: lot of comments are about a single red day making people nervous. To put a disclaimer, I am a medium to long term positional trader and have been cutting my positions on every rally. More of “sell the rally” than “buy the dips” right now.Been looking at oil stocks, funds, and ETFs for the possible impending eastern Europe conflict. Yes, I'm very late to the party. Being retarded is hard, especially when you're autistic.

 For the most part, stocks and funds like CVX, XOM, BNO, and DBO all have very similar charts. Then there's OILK. It hasn't had nearly as much of a jump recently as those others. What am I missing?Ya'll thought I'd quit huh?! Some may remember me from my [$FB 100k overnight banger](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sln6yp/first_100k_overnight_banger_with_fb_puts_biggest/). I mentioned in the comments that I was looking at $AFRM puts and a lot of ya'll laughed and egged me on, well guess what... it paid off! While ya'll were buying calls when the leaked data came out, I was buying puts:

[https://imgur.com/a/JtNAVhj](https://imgur.com/a/JtNAVhj)As some of you know, the greatest investor of all time, no not Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch or Bill Gates, I am talking about Nancy Pelosi you bums. She has calls on Roblox, which reports its earnings next Wednesday.

Remember, the genius Pelosi bought calls on Google before it split, bought Disney calls, which had spectacular earnings. Now her next move is Roblox calls, and it will no doubt go up or Pelosi will cancel Roblox.So... CPI came and it was worse than forcast-the market responds by... Going up.   I was frankly very surprised about it-I thought at least a 2-3% correction day after so many straight green days.  We had a slight dip at opening (most stocks went less than 4%) and now we are back rising up.

I know it feels like inflation is higher on the street level than 7.5- everything we do in out business is up 10-15% and a lot of our construction is up 35-35% higher. 

I think inflation is going to get worse before it gets better and that they are not going to seriously address it, because to do so would stop the money printing factory and no one is going to do that in a midterm election.Had no clue wtf I was doing. Saw that it was up 10% from an apparent leaked tweet. I figured that the ER was priced in at this point. I then noticed super high IV on puts and bought a couple yolos..  next thing you know, moon city baby. I wish I would've bought more though. I took a lot of screenshots of my spy gains from today, but those are nothing compared to this.

Edit: these were 2/11 $70 puts that I bought when it was around $80https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-denies-citizen-petitions-filed-behalf-short-selling-clients

Baseless CP finally rejected by the FDA today, which is a huge win for SAVA today! Just look at the share price late august 2021 and you'll see the instant effect that the CP caused, and has synthetically kept SAVA share price suppressed ever since. Until today.

No articles published this catalyst sized news during the entire market open hours today, only in after hours did a few start popping up with articles about this.

TL;DR : SAVA about to explode in price, will surpass $100+ share price by end of this month, mark my words.10 year treasury yield spiked above 2% at 1245 EST - close your longs! Tech stocks are going to get battered.

This is going to make all indexes go very red.

I'm just going to write more here so the post doesn't get flagged for being too short.

1245 yield spiked means all that stuff we were worried about is peaking intraday etc etc 

Be careful out there.At 12:45p.m today the bull was having a fine day, the wind was blowing nicely and the weather was calm and cool until some prick decided to shoot the bull 🐂 for no reason whatsoever.

Why would anyone do such a terrible thing, all the 🐂 was doing is eating green grass.[SQQQ Position](https://imgur.com/a/SUfGSxF)

Sold nearly everything around 9:45 a.m. bought some banks and split the rest into SQQQ, VIXM, and SPXS an hour later. Gonna chill here and wait for JPow to make it rain on me.I use a stock screener called finviz to find stocks that are potentially over/undervalued by financial metrics before deciding whether to open a short/long position. 

A few stocks that have been constantly showing up in my screener as being extremely overvalued are Hyatt Hotels (H), Hilton (HLT), Snowflake (SNOW) and Datadog (DDOG). I mainly look at price/sales, price/FCF, ROA/ROE, and P/B.

Now, what these companies all have in common is that they are have garbage financials, are not making money, and have been pumped up incredibly over the past couple years. Additionally, insiders have been dumping their shares like their life depends on it. I own puts on all of these from a few months ago, but I couldn't figure out why these particular stocks kept getting pumped while many other HEALTHIER growth stocks were being corrected due to potential rake hikes and, let's be honest, a long needed correction. However, stocks like SNOW are STILL trading at a ridiculous Price/Sales of 83 and continue to get analyst upgrades by the big banks. I understand that there is corruption and manipulation, but I realized something fishy is going on with these particular stocks. 

I decided to look into the ownership of these stocks, and found that Melvin Capital owned a significant position in all of them. In fact, Melvin owns approximately 10% of the entire float of Hyatt Hotels, and has significant positions in all of the others. 

If you look at the financials for many of these, you will find that many of these have ridiculous valuations and continue to get pumped. The NASDSAQ and S&P are both down today while all of the stocks noted above are up. I believe that Melvin Capital is somehow pumping up these stocks (possibly through the options market) and is in bed with the big banks to have them upgraded. Now I don't know how this affects GME, and I still don't understand why and how these stocks continue to get pumped. But I do know that these stocks are heavily manipulated and Melvin Capital is benefitting from it. Could it be possible that they will take the profits from pumping these stocks to cover their short positions on GME?I posted several months ago about how inflation will cause a downturn in the stock market.  Too many of you autists thought that the market was a good hedge against inflation and I was wrong.  Wrong! It's a good hedge against forecasted future inflation...until inflation actually affects earnings, consumer demand, and interest rates.

But what you don't understand is that government inflation data is seriously time lagged.  Let me give you an example in the industry I am in...automotive.  We make parts for vehicles. Component level.  These get into sub assemblies and then final assemblies.  

The cost of steel has gone up for these components 80% since Jan 1 2021.  

The cost of labor has gone up 15%.

The cost of packaging including skids has gone up over 100%.

The cost of oil is up 40%.

The cost of transportation is up 45% for domestic and 85% overseas.

Many of these costs have not even found their way into the cost of cars due to contracts.   Secondly, costs are continuing to rise at exponential rates.  

In 2022 our steel costs will increase by another 40% by Q2.  Our packaging costs have already increased an additional 10%.  

What your seeing from government data is time lagged info from more than 6 months ago from a component level.

By end of 2021, our component pricing increased on average 12%.  By mid-2022, it is expected to rise another 20-40%.  

There are now appearing significant insolvencies in the industry.  

You guys have no idea what is coming...future annualized inflation to exceed 10%-15%.You probably missed the insane execution of Dell's management team or the fact that they're undervalued given their position in the market and current multiples. 

"Dell Technologies Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells,  and supports Information technology solutions, products, and services  worldwide." - Fidelity

My thesis is that this company is undervalued when compared to their peers and especially when compared to their earnings. They also have pricing power so increase in input costs and goods is going to be easily passed on to consumers. 

**TL DR: Old schools is new school. Dell is making bank and unnoticed by the average investor.**

&#x200B;

Let's start by comparing multiples in the industry and where we stand. 

&#x200B;

1. **Let's Look At Some PE**
   1. Dell: 7
   2. HP (HPQ): 7.1
   3. Seagate Technologies (STX): 14.1
   4. Hewlet Packard Enterprise (HPE): 6.8
2. **How about Price to Sales?** 
   1. Dell: .6
   2. HPQ: .4
   3. HPE: .4
   4. STX: 1.2
3. **Price to Cash Flow**
   1. Dell: 6.4
   2. HPQ: 6.5
   3. HPE: 4.8
   4. STX: 9.0
4. **Price to Free Cash Flow**
   1. Dell: 5.9
   2. HPQ: 6.5
   3. STX: 9.0
   4. HPE: -14.6
5. **Return on Equity**
   1. Dell: 131.1
   2. HPQ: -127.6
   3. HPE: -2.0
   4. STX: 56.2

**Let's take a look at market capitalization (billion).** 

1. Dell: 46.6
2. HPQ: 41.9
3. HPE: 22.4
4. STX: 24.6

**And now Revenue (billion):** 

1. Dell: 94
2. HPQ: 63.5
3. HPE: 27.8
4. STX: 10.7

Alright enough with random multiples. This is a long term play for me and not a quick money maker. But if we focus on their revenue, earnings, and then current pricing, they're fairly undervalued. I bought my calls based on where I thought the price could go and I'm fairly confident we'll get there with this company.

1/20/23 75 Call

1/19/24 80 Call 

1/19/24 85 callIt has recently been brought to my attention by a friend that I should not trust using Fidelity for the squeeze. Is this accurate? All my shares are in fidelity, been using them for years. Am I better off with any different brokerage or am I worrying about nothing and Fidelity won't "glitch" the squeeze on me?[https://i.imgur.com/uWlBrCP.png](https://i.imgur.com/uWlBrCP.png)

I started the day out with 5 put contracts and later in the day the tweet from Affirm sent the price up. I was down about 60% and well said duck it and bought more contracts with a 1 day expiration. I guess Affirm then tweeted the full earnings report and a couple of halts later my puts were deep in the money.

With this I will quit my job and become a professional options trader now. Thanks WSB.If your scared to risk money and take risk in general then growth will not only be slow but also maybe impossible. Everyone on here put your money where your mouth is! I’m a gambler that’s why I’m here. Used to go to casinos all the time I now go maybe 2 times a year and trade and if u don’t risk it u don’t make it. I’ve had my losses like everyone but I’ve had great days like today. 

TDLR: Take a step make a riskier move with informed and educated information. Basically go for it life is yours for the taking. I’ve been almost homeless to living in a 7 bedroom house. Just love life and enjoy.I know y’all get off on loss porn… I’m from TN and we like to keep it in the family, no matter the distance. So does this qualify as making great decisions so that I can stay here? I’d say I’m asking for a friend, but I’m definitely asking for myself!

After buying some $DIS 2/11 calls a few days ago I knew they were going to explode at market open after their earnings call last night. I asked ALEXA to set me an alarm for 9 am so I could sell early. She confirmed that I had an alarm set for 9 am. LO and BEHOLD, guess who woke up bright eyed and bushy tailed at 11 am and already missed the huge spike. Fuckface ALEXA made me miss out on about $10k extra of earnings, and that’s assuming I sold below the peak. ALEXA is retarded and doesn’t know how to set an alarm.

I have owned shares for a while, and have always been bullish on a company founded by another member of the PayPal Mafia[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/four-fast-chargers-every-50-miles-us-unveils-ev-infrastructure-plan/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/four-fast-chargers-every-50-miles-us-unveils-ev-infrastructure-plan/)https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/02/10/affirm-afrm-fiscal-q2-2022-earnings.html

Affirm stock dropped as much as 26% on Thursday after the company reported second-quarter results ahead of schedule.
Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending in Dec.:

Loss per share: $0.57 per share

Revenue: $361 million vs. $328.8 million expected

Affirm stock was up about 10% during trading ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings on Thursday.
The early release came after an apparently since-deleted tweet sent from the official Affirm Twitter account on Thursday morning, which included details about the company's financial performance including that its sales rose by 77%.
The tweet suggested that Affirm would beat revenue expectations. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected a 61% rise.
Affirm is one of several hot "buy now, pay later" companies that offer short-term and low-interest loans to users when they buy consumer goods online.
For example, users buying a $1,450 Peloton bike can pay it off over 39 months with payments as low as $45 through Affirm. Last year, Affirm announced a partnership with Amazon to to be the sole non-credit card provider for financing for products the retail giant sells in the U.S.
Affirm went public in Jan. 2021 and is currently 50% lower than its IPO price. It was founded by Max Levchin, one of the original founders of PayPal.Had a little bit of money left in the account so decided to get some puts on AFRM instead of using my RH debit card to buy a veggie burrito with no guac. Alive to fight another day.
https://imgur.com/gallery/2xtnsOJHey all you shitstains,

I am an OG WSB and made an absolute fortune on that gaming company in December of 2019 right after Keith Gill on youtube. I have never been more convinced of another play as much as I have then... until today.

Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is an underpriced juggernaut that is poised for a huge, huge earnings on March 1st.

Fundamentals are staggering.

Every single quarter they exceed their targets, never a single quarter SINCE IPO in 2004 have they failed to grow. That is 79 quarters of growth, guess what, add Slack and Tableau acquisitions and guess what, it is going to grow again. But the street doesn't appreciate it all that much right? Last four ERs, -15% price drop, 3%, 3% and a 9% drop - so why is this different? Well they exceed targets, but this one is going to smash every expectation. Street says 0.75 but my heart says this will look more like August and 1.48 - nearly doubling expectations. And the stock price will balloon upwards to $250-$260 area, but also add in the fact that their 12-month performance is -8% versus similar companies like Adobe have gained 3%. So add a little extra on that for a like to like comparison.

Compare its assets to its share price - $155 on 1/31/19 with $30.7B in assets versus 1/31/21 and $66B (more than 2X) and its share price, $230ish (even over the current price).

Compare what it is doing with its debt to help bolster its tangible book value - $680M on 1/1/19 to $11B on 1/1/21 or 16X its actual, real value. And debt went from $3.1B to $6.2B (2X) or put another way, every time they spent a buck, they made 8.

Price to sales improving every quarter, PEG dropping, debt to equity 1/3 lower than like-to-like (Adobe), I could go on and on. This is a powder keg. Add in more dumbass analysts (33 on TipRanks that I use) and their PT average is $333.

Bonus X Factor: The leak of the NFT marketplace is massive. Given their huge ties to Shopify, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, etc - they can eliminate the duplicate market for their clients, a $160B a year industry. Buy underwear, don't care. Buy Air Jordan, get an NFT for $1 verifying authenticity - poof, pure HYPE beast type stuff.

For the full year, the company saw a revenue of $656.4 million, a 52% year-over-year increase, and a non-GAAP net loss of $15.1 million. In Q1, Cloudflare expects a revenue between $205 million and $206 million as well as a non-GAAP net income per share of $0.00 to $0.01. In fiscal 2022, the company is aiming for a revenue between $927 million and $931 million. They predicted a non-GAAP net income per share between $0.03 and $0.04.

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp)

Our yield curve right now:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058454/yield-curve-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058454/yield-curve-usa/)

We are at steep yield curve

 **Steep Yield Curve**

The blue line in the graph shows a steep yield curve. It is shaped like a normal yield curve with two major differences. First, the higher maturity yields don’t flatten out at the right but continue to rise. Second, the yields are usually higher compared to the normal curve across all maturities.

Such a curve implies a growing economy moving towards a positive upturn. Such conditions are accompanied by higher inflation, which often results in higher interest rates.

Lenders tend to demand high yields, which get reflected by the steep yield curve. Longer-duration bonds become risky, so the expected yields are higher.

**So we get this piece of information:**

 When the yield curve is becoming steep—signaling high growth and high inflation–savvy investors tend to short long-term bonds. They don't want to be locked into a return whose value will erode with rising prices. Instead, they buy short-term securities. 

&#x200B;

So they call us savvy investors who buy short term securities. Let me tell you a story about savvy investors who are buying short term securities right now.....

The logic is, the fed is going to raise rates, maybe fk up and cause a recession. Why is there an article outlining that a steep yield curve may lead to buying of short term securities? Did this work in the past? Where is the disconnect here?Do they know the market is fucked, yes. They know we know the market is fucked. They know that we know that they know the market is fucked. And so on. They want damage control. So they will never claim its over 7.0% or the media will go ape shit. Even though its probably more like 15/20%, it won't happen. 

Realistically at the same time they don't want dig too much deeper into their own anuses by claiming inflation is dropping. So, they will claim it is 6.9%. 

So nobody will freak, its lower. That means we could be on the mend? Nobody knows. But at least it isnt higher, which would signal panic. It's provocative; but open ended. It allows the kicking of the can down the road. Also its a meme. So it's perfect. 

:) Now read the first letter of each paragraph.I know that PayPal has had a rough few weeks but 119.02 is way too low for a company that keeps posting gains quarter after quarter for the last 4 years right?? Are any of you guys thinking about buying calls or is this puppy dropping even further?Everyone is already leveraged to the tits. Banks make money when you borrow money.

Interest hike means people will want to pull their money to pay off their loans

You pulling money means banks stop making money on your loans.

Banks don't want that, so they'll drive the price higher to make it worth while for you to continue smith maneuvering your house or rental units or whatever other degeneracy you do to fund your investments.

[Russia may use field hit by U.S. sanctions for gas exports to China](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-may-use-field-hit-by-us-sanctions-gas-exports-china-2022-02-08/)

MOSCOW, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom may tap [**a field**](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-sanctions-idUSL1N10I1H120150807) hit by U.S. sanctions off the Pacific island of Sakhalin to provide China with gas under a recently signed deal, sources and analysts said on Tuesday.

Russia, already Beijing's No. 3 gas supplier, has been strengthening ties with China, the world's biggest energy consumer, reducing its dependence on its traditional European energy customers amid a standoff with the West.

President Vladimir Putin announced new gas supply deal with China on Friday, which would boost gas exports from Russia's far east where the pipeline network is not connected to traditional routes of its fuel exports to Europe. [**read more**](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-xi-new-deal-that-could-sell-more-russian-gas-china-2022-02-04/)

Gazprom said it signed a long-term sales and purchase agreement with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for natural gas to be supplied via a far eastern route.

As the project reaches its full capacity, the amount of Russian pipeline gas supplies to China would grow by 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, totalling 48 bcm per year, including supplies via the existing Power of Siberia pipeline.

Gazprom has not revealed the source base for the new deal. The company and CNPC have not responded to a request for comment.

Two sources said gas may come from the fields off Sakhalin, including the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye, which Washington put under sanctions in 2015 for Moscow's role in the crisis in Ukraine.

The field, part of the Kirinsky block in the Sea of Okhotsk, also contains oil, while sanctions are related to exploration for or production of, oil or gas in Russian deepwaters.

The sanctions prevent foreign companies from tapping hydrocarbons at such fields, and the possible gas exports from Yuzhno-Kirinskoye may show that Russia has learned how to get around the sanctions.

Moscow-based Sova Capital brokerage said gas for the deal could come from the Kirinskoye field "or more likely the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field, which should launch in 2023 or 2024".

According to Gazprom's data, Yuzhno-Kirinskoye's reserves amount to 711.2 billion cubic metres of natural gas, 111.5 million tonnes of gas condensate and 4.1 million tonnes of oil. Production is seen there at 21 bcm per year.

"This will be Yuzhno-Kirinskoye, no doubt about that," a source said about the gas source for the new deal with China.

Gazprom said on its website that "Yuzhno-Kirinskoye is in the process of pre-development, with geological exploration completed within the boundaries of the field."

It has also said the company had been constructing production wells at the field using semi-submersible drilling rigs and it expected to put it on stream gradually in the period from 2023 through 2025.

Sakhalin-1 project is expected to begin LNG production in 2028.

Gazprom's own LNG plant on the region, Sakhalin-2, has not enough resources of gas to raise production and set up a third production line.This is it boys.

Yes, based on past precedent for the last 3 decades, we've seen the fed being super accommodative to the stock markets with interest rate decisions, having kept them at historic lows at the fear of having stocks or property go down. 

But inflation is a complete different beast to what fed has been fighting all these past years (i.e., keeping property / stocks high for the top echelon elites by sacrificing wealth equality and peasants). 

Inflation is something that the top richest and most powerful elites of this world fear more than anything. 

Why? Because it erodes their wealth. Taking the Rothschild family for example (with an estimated net worth of $400bn). You really think they aren't freaking the fk out if inflation suddenly zooms and turns their $400bn into the price of a big mac??

NO. This is why the feds will raise interest rates substantially to fight inflation. Their priority has always been for the top echelon of society and they will do damn anything to keep that power structure in balance even if it means tanking the global economy.

**tldr; the fed would rather preserve the value of the currency to keep the power hegemony of the top 0.01% and for the global economy to tank than to allow inflation to run rampant and risk hyperinflation and eroding the wealth of the top 0.01%**Greetings fellow retards!

Despite the challenging macro backdrop of supply chain issues, surging inflation and lingering pandemic risks, Bank of America strategists have noted that some of the investment flows into gold have been very resilient.

“[There are significant dislocations buried beneath headline inflation, interest rates and currency moves, raising the appeal of holding the yellow metal in a portfolio and supporting our $1,925/oz average gold price forecast for 2022,” BofA analysts said in a research note at the end of January.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/gold-has-remained-steady-as-stocks-and-bitcoin-have-plunged.html)





Gold futures ended higher on Thursday, stretching their streak of gains to a fifth session in a row - the longest run of consecutive gains since November. The rise for the metal came in the wake of data showing the U.S. consumer price index rose by a more than expected 0.6% in January to 7.5%, a 40-year high. [Gold's rise "underscores its status as safe-haven commodity, and an effective inflation hedge," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-futures-up-5-session-in-a-row-longest-streak-of-gains-since-november-2022-02-10)

The remaining FAANGs have fared better, but it’s only a matter of time before they collapse too. They are simply mispriced, and no asset can swim against the tide forever, especially when the debt cycle is over.



With so much uncertainty, the case for gold is a strong one and you can watch the interview here.

Ruffer played their cards well. They saw risk-on conditions return in late 2020, swapped a little gold for [redacted], bagged the profits and bought back their gold. Spectacular.



It is rare for gold to do well during bull markets, and by holding it, investors risk underperformance. This is why gold beating the S&P 500 is key, as it gives investors the confidence they won’t underperform. It’s happening, and I believe this could go on for some time yet.



I’m bullish.

So I was going to buy a car and stuff, but I learned there’s a car shortage and cars are expensive because of supply demand or something. After some deep research is learned that it’s because cars use something called a microchip and there is a shortage of the very chips that make the cars. 

Since I want a car, there must be others that want a car as well.

It follows that there is demand for chips because there is demand for cars.

Micron technology is a company that makes the chips that we need. It’s also a publicly traded company ands it’s stock has a low price to earnings ratio (around 13). NVIDIA also makes the car chips, but their price to earning ratio of 68. It seems high but Netflix has a bigger one so it’s fine.

Therefore if Micron has the same P/E ratio as NVIDIA, the stock would be over 5x the price. Therefore Micron should be around $500 per stock.

I’m putting everything in Micron. When their price goes up, I’ll be able to car.You guys want to fuck with the hedge funds and Market Makers?

[CPI data coming in similarly to last month could be a 'market killer' phenomenon](https://preview.redd.it/ckt701zsmug81.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e86af5b1bcff78ac8a2ef16d77f92499f449974)The U.S. Department of Labor will release the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January, and this data will visually present the latest changes in the U.S. price level at the beginning of the New Year. Currently, as concerns about high inflation continue to grow, the Federal Reserve has released signals at the January meeting that it will take multiple rate hikes and even start tapering during the year.

Currently, the median survey of economists interviewed by Bloomberg and Reuters both expect the U.S. CPI to grow at a year-over-year rate of 7.3% in January, continuing a 40-year high since February 1982. At the same time, CPI growth in January is expected to reach 0.5% YoY, unchanged from the previous month.

https://preview.redd.it/0yfd16bxlyg81.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=994a0a2211a0cc65c608b61f7c8bd96449780d3e

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI is expected to rise 5.9% year-on-year in January, up from 5.5%, and 0.5% sequentially, down from 0.6%.

From the above market expectations, it is expected that tonight's CPI growth will probably break 7 for the second consecutive month - as shown in the chart below, the highest forecast in the Bloomberg survey is 7.6%, and the lowest forecast is 7.0%. In the past half year, the upper and lower range of this forecast has only once failed to "count" (last October's data was higher than the highest forecast).

https://preview.redd.it/ke98ny60myg81.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=c281e999d00c5e305599d35a5ac895f2ddf4939f

Thus, as long as there are no major mistakes in this month's survey, tonight's CPI data release - "U.S. inflation is high for the second consecutive month in the 7 era", "U.S. CPI in January hit another 40-year high", will probably become the cut-off point for the global financial media coverage ......

Interestingly, however, the White House does not seem to want the focus to remain on the climb in year-over-year data ......

White House spokesman personally "teaches you how to interpret CPI"

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jen Psaki was asked for her thoughts on the U.S. government's upcoming January CPI data on Thursday during her regular daily press briefing. A reporter asked, "Economists are forecasting a reading that the CPI will rise 7.3 percent year-over-year in January. I want to ask: Do you see any signs in the current data that would suggest that inflation will decline rapidly this year? How confident are you that inflation will fall without hurting demand in the economy?"

To which Psaki responded, "Well, we don't know the exact data yet; I know there will be forecasts. But first, when we look at tomorrow's data, we're looking at recent inflation trends. In both November and December of last year, price increases showed a slowdown relative to the previous month. In January, the year-over-year rate of increase is expected to be almost half of what it was in October of last year."

"This is a sign of progress that the rate of inflation (chain) growth is falling back - especially as it has done in recent months. We will also refer to payroll growth and see how it compares to January's inflation data." Psaki said.

In response to reporters' mention of the 7.3 percent year-over-year CPI growth estimate for January, Psaki said with a slight understatement, "Given what we know about price performance over the past year, we do have a sense that tomorrow's data will show a higher year-over-year rate of growth, and that's because the year-over-year data largely reflects last year's price increases, as we've discussed and have known for a long time of, but it's not reflecting about recent trends."

Psaki emphasized that CPI is divided into month-over-month and year-over-year data. Given what we've seen over the past year, one should focus on the monthly data. "Even if, as some are predicting, the year-over-year figure reaches 7% or more, it would not be surprising, even though we don't yet know exactly how the data will perform."

In fact, from a deeper reading of the economic data, Psaki's "sermon" on Wednesday was actually not without merit.

Some industry insiders pointed out that, although the U.S. CPI data in January year-on-year growth again "broken 7", in the visual impact may indeed seem more eye-catching, but in recent months the U.S. CPI growth rate has indeed fallen for many months: in October rose 0.9%, in November rose 0.8%, in December rose 0.5% in December. If the January CPI growth rate is lower than the current market expectation of 0.5%, it will be the third consecutive month of growth rate decline.

Adam Button, an analyst at the financial website Forexlive, also wrote that Thursday's U.S. CPI report is one of the highlights of this week's U.S. economic calendar. The White House has already taken the precaution of saying that the year-over-year figure will be "high". But Button said, "It would be a mistake to think the White House is suggesting it will be above consensus."

Button noted, "As our friends at Newsweek pointed out: last year, Biden also warned of high inflation ahead of the CPI report, but the report was actually below consensus." Button believes that the market will pay more attention to the monthly rate data and that the composition of the report will be key.

Rare early market speculation on less-than-expected data?

It is worth mentioning that just before the release of the U.S. CPI in January, the trading sentiment of market participants in the financial markets, it seems that there was also a subtle change on Wednesday: the U.S. indicator 10-year U.S. bond yields were once off more than 2 years highs in the session fell sharply, while the Nasdaq rose sharply by more than 2% throughout the day, many insiders attributed these changes in the market to some institutions speculation that tonight's CPI data may be less than market expectations.

At present, although the media survey on Thursday's CPI data overall forecast high, but some analysts said that some areas of price growth will slow down, especially in core commodities such as clothing and used cars.

Michael Gapen, chief U.S. analyst at Barclays (Barclays), then noted that "apparel, new and used cars and alcoholic beverages - these are all components of core CPI, and the pace of price increases in these areas should be lower than in December and lower than the the recent peak in October."

While prices for used cars continued to rise in January, momentum is stalling (and actually even reversing), according to the latest data from industry body Manheim. The Manheim Used Car Value Index climbed only slightly last month to 236.3, and while it still jumped 45 percent year-over-year, the year-over-year increase was only 0.04 percent. In addition the unadjusted price change fell by about 1 percentage point compared to December.

https://preview.redd.it/8twdjwt1myg81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=6522bf8448cf6ad85fe4e56667d6290617ba0d4a

National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan also noted that the U.S. inflation data may show some improvement. Hogan expects the U.S. CPI to rise 0.4 percent in January, below the prior and market consensus expectations, although the year-over-year figure will likely remain at 7.2 percent. Hogan also noted that inflation moving in the right direction would be illuminating, which could Will remove some of the Fed's hawkish tone.

In addition, Jefferies (Jefferies) economist Tom Simons is expected to core CPI growth in January will be recorded at 0.3%, lower than the market's general expectations. He noted that "when the data is slightly lower than expected, people will especially want to know how the Federal Reserve will view the situation. At the end of the day, I don't think this number will be so important as to change anyone's opinion, but I think the subconscious reaction of people will be this."

The whole market is holding its breath

For financial markets, as high inflation has previously been seen as a direct trigger for people to bet heavily on the Fed to raise interest rates aggressively, so tonight's CPI data performance will undoubtedly also become a key factor directly affecting the movement of various assets such as U.S. stocks, U.S. bonds, the dollar and gold.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted last month that the Fed would not rule out the possibility of a 50 basis point direct rate hike in the future, and traders have become more convinced that the Fed will make aggressive moves after the surprisingly strong January nonfarm payrolls report released last Friday and showed significant payroll growth. Federal funds rate futures show that the market now expects the Fed to raise rates in March by 50 basis points of the chances of one-third, higher than the one-fifth before the release of the non-farm payrolls data, the Fed raised rates six times during the year (25 basis points each) probability is also close to fifty percent.

&#x200B;

In this regard, Alvise Marino, head of foreign exchange strategy at Credit Suisse, said that the market may react more strongly if Thursday's CPI data is unexpectedly weaker than expected than inflation again: a data pointing in the opposite direction would represent a big change.

Morgan Stanley strategist Matthew Hornbach said in a research note, if the U.S. January CPI data can make the market feel "surprise" (lower than expected), it will become the only opportunity to save the U.S. Treasury bonds in the short term. But he also pointed out that if the January inflation data continue to deteriorate, then the subsequent series of conditions may lead to a continued decline in U.S. bond prices.CPI came in at 7.5% today but I think there is reason to think we may have already seen the peak inflation rate or that we will by next quarter. 

bull case: 
1. Fed raising interest rates and regression to the mean will taper demand
2. Supply side improves because a. capitalists and b. labor and productivity improvements with end of omicron wave.
 If either 1 or 2 happens, fed will likely ease up interest rate hikes and hopefuly we will reach a steady state for inflation and growth such that it is a slower but steadier burn and markets will finally chill the fuck out. 

bear case:
1. Energy crisis because a. russia sanctions (likely but impact is already priced in) or b. all out war (unlikely)
2. New covid variant (possible, but I think worst of the pandemic is already behind us, see my previous post)

TL;DR Inflation and by proxy the markets should stabilize by the mid way point of the year. RIP 2020-2021 return rates but should go back to average or slightly below average ROI soon. 

Disclaimer: Im no macroeconomist or financial advisor but I am a retarded permabull. Bull or bear we're all gonna lose money and wives- we might as well do it the american way. So do your patriotic duty and buy spy calls.

P.S. fuck the bears

edit: lol, really triggered some of the bears, all i have to say to that is fuk ur putsBullard said he favors 100bp hikes by July 1st, which means a more aggressive  hiking schedule versus what the market priced in. So what does this mean? Very large knee jerk reaction at the front end of the yield curve; 5yr note absolutely getting hammered, now 1.94%. Vs 10yr note at 2.03%, nobody will be willing to buy any duration. Hope you are all SHORT bonds because spreads are about to blow out

It’s not like they weren’t warned to cover 20 points ago. 

IMO it’s going to get worse too.  
Next will be exoneration by SUNY Journal of Neuroscience (peer refereed) has already done so. The FDA took forever but the CP denial was total. It has be declared as being debunked for months yet the New Yorker attempted CPR sans luck. I know many are misguided shorts and hopefully you can cover. But many will try to double down Take your shots but if you downvote don’t be a CS, leave a comment.Waffle House is a great employer because it allows people from rough backgrounds ( limited education, poor work history, criminal records, etc) the chance to earn meaningful wages. District management opportunities (overseeing 2-3 units) touch six-figures and they pay livable wages all the way down to the line cooks.

A key component to this compensation is the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. WH is a privately owned company, and their website (and several others) claim that the only way to buy stock is to work there. The private stock has increased something like 30% annualized every year over the past 20 years (this is anecdotal and a little bit suspect, it's not publicly traded and numbers get murky). 

I suspect (although it'a hard to complete DD on a private company) that WH's valuation is currently being stung by COVID and related restrictions the same way other publicly traded fast food companies are. I also believe long term in the resiliency of the Waffle House brand. 

FEMA has an unofficial Waffle House scale to measure the impact of natural disasters. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index?wprov=sfti1 

I've sobered up in WH more nights than I can remember. I spent what was otherwise the most depressing thanksgiving of my life alone in a Waffle House in Greensboro, NC. 

There has to be a way for me to buy shares off of a past or current WH employee in a private exchange right? I'm assuming there's someone who'd like the liquidity of cold hard cash, and I have no problem holding for the long haul. Is this possible? Next Market will open after 2 days, what's special about it, it'll open on Valentine day..

Market is my first and last love, I love the way it make love to me, Its my demanding partner and makes love to very frequent.. IDK why other's have different opinion about the rigorous love making style of my partner and tells me "it fucks me royally".I'm too retarded to understand  why the stock was halted today and then got DUMPED as soon as it was resumed. 

Did people panic dump because they expect uber to be less profitable by 2024 ? Wtf

Price is too low now Is this a buy?HAHAHAHA THE MAD LAD ACTUALLY CALLED IT:

I KNEW IT WAS TOO STUPID TO GO TITS UP. This guy predicted earnings beat based on botched Google search queries for Disney+ subscription signups. $DIS up 8% after hours. Fucking unbelievable.

Bought shares in $DIS after reading his analysis because fuck it. The play is still on the table, since $DIS is pretty beaten down but the company is strong, and reopening is actually happening this time. Beautiful looking chart, price rebounding from the 200 week MA on a reversal candle, and there is confirmed trend reversal on the daily (it's now showing a higher high and higher low). Holding out my shares for a while, but god damn what a fucking entry.

tl;dr analysts don't know shit, they got outplayed by a dumbass with Google search trends.

Obvious it looks like they are all on the same trading algo, and I know popcorn triggered a type 2 and type 3 squeeze alert.  Makes me wonder if all of these are about to launch.I was down 17k and slowly getting things right. I did Tech analysis on my P&L.

* Its still in down trend as per the down trend line
* Also has strong support at -15k loss
* Previous -12k support now going to act as resistance?
* If I break -12k resistance, it is going to form cup and handle. After that Moon to -4k resistance?

What do you guys think?  

About me:

I YOLO-ed my $14k FB calls today,  was down $1300 and ended my day with $85 profit after porting them to PUTs.  Consistent $100 to $200 profit for the past 14 days ever since I restarted my trading strategy.  Hope I won't wipe my account. I was doing swings earlier. Now doing 0 DTE calls/puts.

Before I begin, a quick word from my friends Nic and Angie...

[MRO - GO BABY GO](https://i.redd.it/smtny4t3u0h81.gif)

# Regardless of what happens with Russian and Ukraine, the oil boom cycle is here.

# So What's the Best Way to Play the Oil Price Boom?

Some might argue to invest in a fund that tracks the overall spot price of oil like USO. **However, I think that a much better, more-profitable AND safer play would be to invest in an efficient and well run US Oil & Gas company**, with my personal favorite being **MRO.** There are other good choices out there including the 800 lb and 1,000 pound gorilla's like Exxon/**XOM** and Chevron/**CVX...MRO has out paced both of them by a wide margin over the past year.**

# MRO

* **MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel** (one of the lowest in the industry)
   * Practically all analysts and investment banks are predicting $100 by summer 2022
* **MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to Stock Buy-Backs**
   * Their Board of Directors has approved **$2.5 Billion in Buy-Backs**
   * That's currently 15% of their Market Cap, this will have a huge impact on the stock price
* **MRO was the #2 best performing stock in the S & P 500 in 2021**
   * **They are set up for an even better year in 2022 given the current commodity prices and market conditions**
* MRO has a 50/50 oil and gas production split: With both prices at multi-year highs, they are making a killing 
* **Position:** I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase.  I'm admittedly not an options expert so if you have options that you feel good about, please share in the comments
* **\*\*Bonus** \- I haven't posted on MRO in a couple of months but I wanted to throw this information out there for those who are just thinking about the oil and gas boom that is happening right now.
* **Cheers and Happy Trading** \- **MRO is up more than 90% since I began posting in September 2021.** There have been multiple people who've reached out to me to thank me as they've made substantial profits based on my postings and analysis. **Thank you to everyone for their kind words and happy trading.** I'm enjoying the hell out of the ride and I hope that you are too, cheers.I would just like to take a moment to point out that in the absence of 500 meme's clogging up the subreddit, a bunch of WSB posts that were bullish on the Disney earnings rose to the top today.

One retard even predicted the rise based on how good 2020's Mandalorian Season 2 was.

https://preview.redd.it/5v0tb6mtnvg81.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=e62176801cd93609f0fffb10f0063e115183939e

Turns out he made out with some tendies, and so did everyone else who took his sage advice.

Disney obliterated their earnings to the upside.

WSB text wall works.

Long live the great wall of text.In keeping up with the WSB tradition of trying to lose any gains you make, I’m doing two last calls for this week.  FYI I made some significant money on Disney calls (I told you all last week to buy them but some of you didn’t listen!  Let this be a reminder: don’t fuck with the mouse!!!!)

I have 50 Zillow calls, $54, exp 02/11 -

The report two days ago I read said that “75% of home buyers have regrets about their new home” - um…..who gives a fuck??? They already bought the house!  Even if they overpaid, dude, the real estate market keeps going up not down.  But the fact is that people keep buying houses and prices keep going up and that’s good for Zillow. 

I also think that if bears or shorts wanted to keep the price of Zillow down or think earnings will be bad, and the best they can come up with is that buyers have regrets, I think that means they don’t know what the hell to write and are getting desperate LOL.

Also the consensus is that earnings will be -1.48.  I think that’s really crazy low and anything better than -1.48 means the stock price moves up.

Also with interest rates going up, chances are demand for real estate will increase in the hopes people can buy property before interest rates are raised.  That helps Zillow.

My next call is 100 calls Under Armour price $23 exp 02/11 -

This one is basically I think Under Armour has bottomed.  Gyms are reopen and people need workout gear.  Also Steph has increased basketball shoe interest and if their guidance is good or they announce a new athlete signing a deal with them I can see it going up, and again, during Christmas time I’m sure a lot of people did some workout clothes shopping for them or as gifts.

The stock has beat earnings by a lot the last three quarters.  For this quarter the estimate is .06 and I think they beat it, maybe not by a lot, but beat it.

I was also thinking of doing Affirm calls but I just don’t feel too sure.  It’s a tough choice but I like Zillow more to make a recovery and the price to go up if only because expectation are SOOO low that any good news and it goes up, my tard ape mind thinks….

Once again, this is not financial advice do your own research.  I eat crayon tacos and burritos with spicy red salsa and drink cold Coors Light.  Don’t listen to me :)how was your earnings week?

I made a couple 60-100% option plays on earnings myself (uber, disney, clf) 

i usually like to buy calls on the run up and sell my contracts to degenerate gamblers before earnings to secure a 80% call profit but did you guys have a good earnings week?As 2021 rolled out I was, as always, cautious. I kept buying good fundamentals and editing my ideal entry price to some tech stocks I have kept an eye on. 


I had used margin to leverage myself 2-4x throughout 2020 and I knew this was risky. Compounding risk by buying risky stocks or leveraged ETFs wouldn't be wise.


I had beaten indexing in 2020 and I made the occasional post laughing at people yelling about risk adjusted returns as if that matters. I had more gains than them and all they could do was yell about how risky it was. These are the kinds of people who would pay off a 1% mortgage because holding VTI is too risky. I would take that money into VTI and say this is not risky enough. Oh there were stories about just holding all TSLA or all [redacted] and this and that but I had made several plays on various stocks including a little TSLA and a little SPWR and I was satisfied. I continue holding gold mining stocks.


I was at times swamped with Earnings Reports and Earnings calls but I knew one thing and one thing only. 


**"You will not predict the future and no one else will, the best gains are made with calculated bets"**


So I kept my diversification going and adjusted (especially on weeks where 20 Earnings Calls happened in 3-4 days) by ranking my picks from safe with 100% conviction on long term vision (50 years) to risky and has to be reviewed regularly. Then I caught up as I had time. By May it was obvious that I had "missed" a wonderful GME opportunity and of course I did. Those who had calls going into January 2021 that expired later that year probably had a chance to retire. 


With each wild and irrational swing down I bought the dip and each wild irrational swing up I sold off some of my positions. I was leveraged so naturally I was holding far more in every stock than I could without that leverage, it was rewarding. When I wanted to take a few weeks off in the summer I did. Most weekends I do a blackout on finances and economics on Friday Close and only take a disinterested glance on Sunday evenings.



When politics caused some of my picks to shoot up 10-20% in a week I sold off until I was just holding my long term positions as if I wasn't leveraged. With this market the volatility nearly always allows a lower entry later. Sometimes a week later. Remember I am leveraged so short term profit taking is necessary to take full advantage of what the risk affords me.



When the market sometimes judged a guidance or a short term supply issue as a reason to sell off a stock, I reviewed the fundamentals and bought more. I am not holding stocks that don't have a great long term business model that works today, not just in theory.



By October I had decided my appetite for risk had been fulfilled and I needed to deleverage. sold off what I could and by early November I was less leveraged than I had been since April 2020. I saw the corrections and entered some tech positions that I found at comfortable prices. You know what happened next, the dip kept dipping. 


Entering 2022 I am still up on most of my positions. I have compounded gains due to the way I approached risk. I have removed some stocks from my watchlists that have been unable to adjust to our new economic reality in 2021 and their debt has expanded while their earnings have not done so well adjusted for inflation since 2019.


**TLDR** So here I am. 'The crash is coming'. I have beat indexes. I am diversified. I have managed my risk level in a way I find comfortable. I will do it all over again this year. Some will panick or play into some wild conspiracy theories while the wise will take their money and nod.Because "they" love to fuck with "us."

They know that "we" view the number "69" as sacred.

First, "they" told us that 4Q GDP grew by 6.9%

Then, that video game company was purchased for $6.9 billion.

Why else are they doing this?  Because the shorts hAvE nOt coVered!

Next, CPI will increase by 6.9%.

Mods, ban me for a week if I am wrong...Today I planned on selling my Datadog at the market open, before their results after close tonight.

I did some solid due diligence to back this decision up. Atleast an hour yesterday evening. I got the night sweats worrying about the results.

Imagine my surprise when they reported results this morning pre-market and the shares went up.

Its clear now. Going full retard leads to mistakes being cancelled out. 

Everyone here who blew their account up can only call themselves partial retards, and they need to try harder.Given the recent market volatility, premiums are sky high and I want to look at making money the theta way. 

I understand that the premise of selling cash covered puts is willing to buy the stock if the put goes in the money against you with the hope that the stock will eventually recover and you get to keep the premium.  

My question is on the winning side of the trade. If I sell cash covered puts on a stock for example that’s at $50 and I sell a $50 put, if the stock goes up the put expires worthless and I keep the premium. But what if the stock goes up an insane amount, to let’s say $60 or $70. Can I exercise the put at the $50 strike, essentially allowing me to keep my premium for the $50 put I sold, and buying the stock at  $50 to then sell at $60 for some additional profits? This seems too good to be true, so what am I missing here?Listen, am I a degenerate who just sunk 5,000 into dkng. Yes, was it dumb, possibly. But it dosent meant it won't work. 

Look DKNG is burning money. Like literally. They burned throught 800mill last year. And this year is no better. The earning are coming Feb 18 and they are not going to be good. I mean they missed pretty much every earning they had. 

So, DKNG is up now. U might ask, why are u shorting. Quick answer, HYPE, superbowl is the only thing that is keeping this ship from hitting $15. And trust me, it will go there.I'm hoping to just grab an opinion, for background, I don't own Roku, but contemplating on it. 

While it's true Roku is a growth stock and many are getting hit, it seems pretty difficult to justify, going from it's high of almost $500 to now around $160. Financially, they are making money, and exceeding their EPS, actually quite significantly. Only bearish argument I can think of is being a covid pandemic stock, but even then, people are still watching shows, which makes it difficult as mentioned to justify, such a price difference. 

Does anyone who holds or contemplated or even simply researched Roku have a bullish or in this case bearish argument to explain what's happening? Would you say it's a buy?Let’s all hop on the retard train back to the 2008 housing crisis.

Banks were retards. The Government was like it’s okay retard bankers. We understand you’re retards but you tried your best. Here’s a bailout check and we’re raising interest rates a bunch so you fuckers stop handing out housing loans to everyone. After a year and a half the market started getting back on track and moving up again.

Then we look at the Covid recession. That shit lasted literal weeks. Everyone was super scared, but then these COVID powerhouse stocks started carrying the market. After Covid recession we saw a solid fucking bull run where if you lost money in the market you literally had to be retarded (no offense to the retards who lost money in 2020). The point is that this was in no way a typical recession. 2008 crash was nothing like 2020.

Then we look at whatever the fuck is happening now. I’m not claiming to be a goddamn messiah and an all knowing fucking Da Vinci ass. And this post is probably going to piss you off because I’m not going to pick a side. Fuck you bulls and fuck you bears. You can make money playing both sides. The purpose of this is to explain what the fuck is happening and might happen soon.

Jerome Powell is not ***THAT*** retarded. He has a better sense of the economy than any of you fuckers. There’s a reason he was on the fed throughout Obama, Trump, AND Biden . If you can’t accept that he is slightly less retarded than us, fuck your feelings he can do what he wants.

He knows if he said the economy is going to shit, people would panic sell the market. His job is literally judged based on how the economy is doing. Do you think he wants this shit to crash? No. He has a fucking money printer, who doesn’t want that fucking job. That shit sounds way better than what I do.

During the last fomc meeting, he basically said a bunch of nothing. Everything he said we expected. The reason why it was so bad is because he was completely ambiguous. He said we’re going to raise rates and we don’t know by how much or when.

This caused a lot of uncertainty. If he said, I think things are looking really fucking shitty… buckle up retards. There would be a huge sell off.

Instead his goal is to release bad news slowly so that we see a more moderate crash over a longer period of time. This is assuming that things continue to go to shit. If we see inflation go down, employment numbers get on track, and the economy overall is looking healthy again, this will likely be short lived. However, if it keeps going the way it’s going, prepare for fuk.

Tl;dr
Go learn how to read and come back and read the fucking post retard***New York*** **– With inflation going only higher, stocks are slipping on Wall Street Thursday as expectations build that the Federal Reserve will have to get more aggressive about removing the tremendous support it’s given the economy.**

The hottest inflation reading since 1982 sent the S&P 500 down 0.5% in early trading. It also sent Treasury yields jumping, as traders built up bets the Fed may have to throttle the economy with a bigger-than-usual hike in interest rates next month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury topped 2% for the first time since August 2019.

[Original Source](https://mosttraded.com/2022/02/10/stocks-slip-yields-soar-on-hottest-inflation-in-40-years/) The online travel giant reported adjusted earnings of $1.06 a share on  revenue of $2.3 billion. Analysts expected Expedia to report earnings of  60 cents a share with revenue of $2.3 billion.

Twitter reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 Thursday that missed analyst estimates on earnings, revenue and user growth.

&#x200B;

Shares popped more than 8% during premarket trading.

&#x200B;

Here are the key numbers:

&#x200B;

Earnings per share: 33 cents, adjusted vs 35 cents expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts

Revenue: $1.57 billion vs $1.58 billion expected, according to Refinitv

Monetizable Daily Active Users (mDAUs): 217 million vs 218.6 million expected, according to StreetAccount

The company provided revenue guidance for the next quarter ranging from $1.17 billion to $1.27 billion, while analysts had expected about $1.26 billion, according to Refinitv.

&#x200B;

Twitter also announced a new $4 billion share buyback program. Half of that will be an accelerated share repurchase with the remaining being repurchased over time, the company said.

&#x200B;

Despite the miss in user growth numbers, CFO Ned Segal said in a statement in the earnings release that its previously stated goals of reaching 315 million mDAUs in Q4 2023 and at least $7.5 billion in revenue in 2023 remained the same.

&#x200B;

The report is the first under new CEO Parag Agrawal after Jack Dorsey stepped down from the role in November. Agrawal, who previously served as chief technology officer, had been a key player in the company’s efforts to create a decentralized protocol for social media through Project Bluesky.

&#x200B;

Agrawal has inherited Dorsey’s aggressive internal goals, including to grow Twitter to 315 monetizable daily active users by the end of 2023.

&#x200B;

Twitter’s report follows those from Facebook-owner Meta and Snap, which both reported some macroeconomic challenges like supply chain disruptions weighing on advertiser budgets.

&#x200B;

But they reported different degrees of impact of Apple’s privacy update on iOS that makes it harder to narrowly target ads on iPhones. While Meta said it expected to take a $10 billion revenue hit as a result of the changes, Snap said its direct response advertising business was recovering more quickly than expected.

&#x200B;

Twitter said last quarter that the Apple changes had less of an impact in the period than expected, and that the impact should be modest in the fourth quarter.sell a naked call and have 100x leverage compared to shorting a stock WHILE GETTING PAID A PREMIUM? Literally if you short a stock you have to pay interest like a \*slightly\* retarded college graduate to take on unlimited risk. Meanwhile if you sell a naked call you have some other retard on this subreddit who will literally PAY YOU to take on unlimited risk. 

bUt SeLliNg NaKeD cAlLs MeAnS yOu aRe LeVeRaGeD a HuNdReD tImEs! ! ! 11

Naked calls = -100 shares

Shorting a stock = -1 share

Going by loss porn math I think that means naked calls win out. You know who else is not 100x leveraged? The same people who say "TiMe In ThE mArKeT bEaTs TiMiNg ThE mArKeT."

Also can someone tell me why my broker won't let me sell naked calls? What's wrong with having unlimited risk x 100??? It's still unlimited, RIGHT?????Investors fell for misleading US propaganda on Russia. If you want a full understanding of what is happening in Ukraine, read this book. It will help you have an informed outlook of the true situation, not an exaggerated one backed by US and NATO propaganda. Read it from start to finish and you will have knowledge on Ukraine

[https://books.google.com/books/about/Anthony\_s\_Treaty.html?id=f3rfzgEACAAJ](https://books.google.com/books/about/Anthony_s_Treaty.html?id=f3rfzgEACAAJ)I have completed some prolonged DD about market models and simulation and come up with a thesis based on the most influential investors of the galaxy: Nancy Pelosi and Cramer.

I think that the right investment strategy is based on Pelosi calls and Cramer puts and I am here to defy anyone to prove me wrong.

I truly believe that the next company Pelosi is going to put calls is DWAC and I think that Cramer is going puts on Durex.  Tyson Foods, and it’s many subsidiaries that were either bought or created by the conglomerate have been tested through trials and tribulations time and time again. Their ravenous lawsuit record which includes over 50 million dollars, reported, in pollution and animal cruelty cases. 
    
   Tyson Foods was once on the brink of destruction, as the late 2000’s into the early and mid 2010’s brought forth trial and case after trial and case. They were fined for polluting rivers, leaving behind massive quantities of pollution, emission pollution, animal pollution as well as extreme animal cruelty, disregard of the animals relation that it has to its product and the dozens of chemicals and fillers that it pumps into its chicken, beef and pork supply to cut costs and because of general lack of care, it is, one of if not THE worst company in terms of treatment of their product and environment damage.

   Their earnings were recently released, 24 hours later than they were suppose to, with an 11% increase in business revenue, pretty low considering covid binge buying, inflation across multiple sectors the company dwells in as well as its supposed ruling over the meat industry. What catches my eye is the 100+% increase in personal income taken this year. That’s too much for any company to take for supposed personal reasons. 
  
  I’ve heard the rebuttals, oh they’re the top producer as a single company for chicken product. Actually, they’re not. Though sales are slightly up volume has extremely decreased by the years and they are hiding that the amount they’re selling is actually decreasing. I believe as the newer generation comes in and the older generation dies out, everybody will look to Tysons past history of animal cruelty. No matter what vegetarian or vegan, no meat no cruelty product they release will prevent the common person from knowing the tragic history of Tyson Foods. Everyone watched the Tyson Documentary if you ask the common millennial, Gen X, whatever the generations are called nowadays, they know and resent Tyson’s past and current relations with animals. 

I’ve heard that people don’t care about it, that their dino nugs or their subsidiary brands will out compete any possible resentment for the brand as they have fully diversified their name into almost complete disappearance from the Tyson Title. To that I say, you’re wrong. Tyson has fought for the past 2 weeks to get past 100$, it hasn’t and won’t. I believe the chart shows a down spout, a hook and reel chart, into the 90’s and an eventual dumping into the 80’s. 

Nobody besides people who are lacking the ability to change brands buys Tyson, Ive heard the rebuttals yet again. Oh Tyson sells out, Tyson doesn’t stay on shelves. My neighborhoods show an excess of Tyson brands, does yours? I believe finding the next movement up for the stock, if possible, and buying cheap leap puts would prove worthy. If not that then shorting? I’m not sure yet. What I am sure about is Tysons failure to compete with growing brands and it’s inability to change its past. Another rebuttal I hear is corporations don’t care about animal cruelty. True. Let me ask you something, if McDonalds, a known buyer of Tyson chicken for majority of their chicken products and Chick-Fil-A started their buisness at the same time, February 10th, 2022, who would succeed. My money is on Chick-Fil-A, with the rise of healthy eating and the growth of this mindset that eating clean is better for you and with sales across the board for processed food and cheap eats going down, even with covid, inflation, poverty, people still want clean and healthy food.

I believe Tyson will crumble from its high 90’s stock price. I will eventually be creating a large put strategy across multiple options when I understand people’s ignorance to chemical filled products and of course the eventual demise of older generations. Puts on TSN to halve it’s stock price by 2030.

Positions: None currently, deciding on a short or multiple put strategy. 

[Tysons possible down pour into 90](https://i.imgur.com/QGneq7e.jpg)

This graph shows trend lines of a consistent gap down after rising a large sum and its eventual return. It seems within the next couple weeks Tyson will experience a drop down into the 90’s as the 2014 trend line showed space in the upward movement, which it did, it was less tight going up when looking at the trend lines but the 2020 trend line shows space in the downward movement, which I believe will follow suit and drop down.Your daily trading discussion thread.

Now we'll have a CPI beat, because the basket is changing. Per the BLS website "Starting in January 2022, weights for the Consumer Price Index will be calculated based on consumer **expenditure data from 2019-2020**. The BLS considered interventions, but decided to maintain normal procedures." 

The CPI basket will be influenced by consumption patterns in 2020. As we all know, many people opted to become homeless, took advantage of the eviction moratorium or moved back in with their parents. That will decrease the all-important weight of rents. Nobody drove for a better part of the year, so gas will be downweighted. People used fewer services, so those will have a lower weight too. Childcare in particular comes to mind, as kids stayed at home. On the flip side, toilet paper and disinfectants will be huge. Bottom line, these weights will be lower for what people want right now and what is getting pricier right now. 

I'm predicting a 6.5% surprise and a face ripper rally.I understand that stocks only go up.

My main concern is, can stocks really survive this soon-to-be high interest rate environment?

10 year rates just hit 2% recently which obviously isn’t much, with the 0.25/0.5/1 bp “suggested” interest rate increase from feds per month until “inflation” is controlled - what does this mean for the market?

The market basically giving me sloppy joes and bears and bulls keep telling me it’ll either go up or down.

In a complicit position because at one hand I just wanna diamond hand it and wait for years because a small blip in a big picture shouldn’t warrant for much concern. 

Personally I feel that the market is still holding strong and big companies with no debt should stride through these environments like it’s their bitch. However…. With all these FUDs and “investors” bitching out - is this really a safe environment to have my money in a high valuation P/E ratio environment?

I guess I just wanna know your personal opinions on how much more downside/upside you guys are expecting given the data today and the White House telling the feds to start “recalibrating”.

Last time a concerning inflation was reported the markets didn't take it well. What do you guys think will happen tomorrow if the report comes up again high? They're talking about a potential 7.2% inflation YoY, which would surpass even the last one.I was having a discussion about farming dexes and this guy started to compare with dividend investing. He kept going. I decided to share with you guys since he's clearly one of us and should be investing in options, not in dividends.

EDIT: He was implying the dividends are paid by the money backing up the stock and not the companies profit. So if a stock price went up ad infinitum, the dividends would also go up ad infinitum. But in reality if the companies profit/payout doesn't change and the stock price goes up, the dividend yield goes down, guys.>Updated seasonal factors to be introduced February 8, 2022

Following the 3min 22ema chart ☠️.

The 22ema supported this run perfectly for most of the day. The price action closed slightly below the 22ema 3 mins after 1200.....touching the 55ema.

55 is the 10th Fibonacci number and 10th Triangular number.

The price rode along the 55ema until closing at 1:59 at 17.97 and opening 1 penny higher for 17.98 at 2o'clock.

Even if no specific mathematical expression can generate all prime numbers, this doesn't mean their distribution is completely random.

Besides number 2 all prime numbers are odd because any even number can be exactly divisible by 2 and therefore it is no longer a prime.

Also, it is well known that the last digit of any prime number greater than 5 can only be 1, 3, 7, or 9. Numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 are excluded to ensure that the number is odd. The number 5 is also excluded because any number ending with 5 will be divisible by 5.

Edit: The 8th and 11th prime number would be 8x11=88. 88 is referring to space time...time travel, 88 squared is 7744. It's clear these number are the master numbers 77 and 44. In the periodic table it is Iridium and Ruthenium, if you add their weights of 192.963+ 101.904 you will get a sum of 294.867. The element Tennessine weight is 294.

Let's check out some facts about Tennessine... 

The discovery of tennessine was officially announced in Dubna, Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element as of 2022.

Tennessine may be located in the "island of stability", a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17, all other members of which are halogens. Some of its properties may differ significantly from those of the halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states.

Two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough; normally, nuclei (all positively charged) repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion. The strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus; beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus.

The beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber, the separator; if a new nucleus is produced, it is carried with this beam. In the separator, the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides (that of the original beam and any other reaction products) and transferred to a surface-barrier detector, which stops the nucleus. The exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked; also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival. The transfer takes about 10`6 seconds.

What does that mean? Time travel.

That's a great question tbh, I think we should discuss.I am early in my trading career and lost about all of my savings (40k) on the crash.  I was wondering if this was a blessing in disguise or the opposite.  These are some thoughts I have - 

Pros

* More careful trader for the rest of my career
* Learn not to trust others for advice
* More emotionally invested in money, motivating me to seek out additional sources of knowledge and wealth

Cons

* More emotionally invested in money, making it more difficult to make objective trading decisions
* Will continue to try doing crazy irrational things to make it back
* Neither, it's not even that much moneyI have gotten a bit into the Literature of trading and understand the basic principles. 

But i still have some questions:

How do stock prices move if...

...two companies merge
... a company gets bought up by a larger one
...a Company buys up a smaller one
...they fire a top manager **Inflation can come from a supply shock,** which is limited for various reasons and results in higher prices than what is produced, or from a strong increase in demand. In this sense, and without an in-depth analysis, it could be concluded that the first case is much more negative, which also compromises the growth of the economy’s aggregate demand.

[https://markettimes.co.uk/markets/how-inflation-affects-investments-how-to-protect-yourself/](https://markettimes.co.uk/markets/how-inflation-affects-investments-how-to-protect-yourself/)Walt Disney Co., the world's largest entertainment company The first quarter results report released after hours on Wednesday showed that earnings per share and revenue exceeded expectations, and streaming media subscribers approached 130 million, reversing the downward trend. After the earnings announcement, Disney's share price soared 8% in after hours trading.

The quarterly financial report as of January 1, 2022 shows that Disney's adjusted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter is $1.06, and the market is expected to be 63 cents; The revenue was US $21.82 billion, compared with us $16.25 billion in the same period last year, and the market expectation was US $20.91 billion; The total subscribers of its streaming media service Disney + were 129.8 million, higher than 118.1 million in the previous fiscal quarter, and the market expectation was 125.75 million.

The growth of streaming media subscribers remains strong

In the first fiscal quarter, the revenue of Disney's media and entertainment distribution business reached US $14.59 billion, a year-on-year increase of 15%; The operating profit reached US $808 million, a year-on-year decrease of 44%.

https://preview.redd.it/dhgdhnat2zg81.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=44a4a778b4a22f8b535b2910ddca1af55d582a90

The number of subscribers to Disney + increased by nearly 12 million to 129.8 million in the first quarter. This means that in the last three months of 2021, Disney's user increment has exceeded that of streaming media giant Netflix. As Netflix admitted last month, competition may be eroding its user base. Netflix added 8.3 million new users in the last quarter, and its total number of global users reached 222 million.

The average revenue per user (ARPU) of Disney + in the United States and Canada also increased to $6.68 from $5.80 a year ago.

Disney has invested billions of dollars in new programs, hoping to take a share in the online video market dominated by Netflix and bet its future on a direct to consumer strategy.

Disney executives had expected Disney + to see stronger growth in subscriptions in the second half of this year than in the first half. More original content will be released on the platform in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Christine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, said on the earnings conference call that the company expected to invest a lot of money in streaming media in the second quarter. She said that the company's program and production costs for direct consumer business are expected to increase by about $800 million to $1 billion, including the program production costs of Hulu live broadcast.

Bob chapek, CEO of the company, said Disney was bidding for the broadcasting right of NFL Sunday tickets to further deepen streaming media.

Although Netflix's latest financial report showed that the growth of users slowed down and led to a sharp drop in its share price, chapek reiterated the performance guidance that Disney + users will reach 230 million to 260 million by 2024.

Return of Paradise business

As concerns about Omicron subsided, the relaxation of government restrictions and the release of pent up demand brought strong traffic to Disney theme park.

The revenue of Disneyland, experience and consumer goods reached $7.2 billion in the quarter, twice that of $3.6 billion in the same period last year. The division's operating profit jumped to $2.5 billion, compared with a loss of $100 million in the same period last year.

Disney said the revenue growth came from more guests visiting its theme park, staying in brand hotels and booking cruise ships.

After closing most Disney branded retail stores in the second half of 2021, the company's consumer goods business revenue decreased by 8.5% to $1.5 billion.

"This year is the last year of Walt Disney's first 100 years. Such achievements, coupled with our unparalleled collection of assets and platforms, creative ability and unique position in culture, make me very confident that we will continue to define entertainment in the next 100 years." Chapek said.

After the announcement of the financial report, Disney's share price soared 8% after trading on Wednesday. The stock closed up 3.33% at $147.23 in regular trading. However, since the beginning of the year, the stock has fallen by more than 6%.\-$141M on Monday, -$35.2M yesterday, and $115.4M in TWTR shares still left in the ARK pockets.

As we can see, Cathie is preparing for TWTR Earnings and probably she will dump even more for today before Twitter eargnings call on Thursday before the market opens.

https://www.reuters.com/business/new-china-tariff-probe-among-options-considered-by-biden-us-chamber-2022-02-09/I will continue to teach and share my found opinion on the EV Space or what I call the Industrial Revolution Of Our Tine - Lets Call It" The EV Revolution" In the past, as history teaches us.. .. As we Move Forward and watch the Old Die Off - Revolution and Evolution Gives Way To New Birth, as in the Past, "From Horses To Cars, Carriages To Trains -  time is repeating itself from Fossil Fuel and ery industry linked to it - to **ZERO Emissions** and Electric Vehicles and all that is being created through The Technology!!! Welcome To The EV Revolution!!

In The Past - The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 ... HISTORY LESSON -  Industrial Revolution, in modern history, **the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing**. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society. ..... Today we are repeating the process with New Technology from A.I, MetaVerse to The EV Space and today I wanted to share those industries that will help support and grow That SPACE - Charging Stations....

I like $EVGO for so many reasons...  formerly Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation, is a public fast charging network for electric vehicles (EVs). The Company's fast charging network is powered by renewable energy.  It Provides charging services close to where drivers live, work and play, whether for a daily commute or a commercial fleet.   Trading Up today and over the last Five Days from $7.40 on February the 4th - to $10.31 today!! with a 52 week High of 20.60 which occurred on February 12, 2021.... 

The New Power is in those who control the source - Just Like Oil was King for The Past Industrial Resolution - Charging Stations - "The New Standard Oils Of The World" will help to control the "The EV Revolution"  $EVGO has a current Market Cap value of over 2 Billion and has started an infrastructure that partners with local and national businesses establishing over 800 Charging stations and growing - YES there are others out there - President Biden Mention One and the stock soared for that day over 100%... Many Retail investors will miss this portion of the EV Revolution... while we chase $LCD, $TSLA and $RVIN.... they all need Charging Stations - Just like our Past Billionaires Knew - The World would Need Fossil Fuels... Think On This - Our World will Need Charging Stations!!! $EVGO

>Side Bar and Quick Note -   "Subaru opens reservations for Solterra EV and announces a charging partnership with EVgo" - there are rumors of Exxon liking the EVGO technology and putting them in an already established Massive Infrastructure of Fossil Fuel Stations that Exxon Controls

EVgo’s owned and operated charging network serves over 65 metropolitan areas across 34 states. EVgo offers its services to EV drivers, business owners, policymakers, fleets and automakers.  The EV Revolution Is Here -  Shell, BP, Chevron and others are starting to embrace the notion of offering customers other options besides gasoline fill-ups in an attempt to keep access to wallets and loyalty, regardless of which type of drivetrain rolls in. .... Not Just Me who likes $EVGO -  In the last 3 months, **5 ranked analysts** set 12-month price targets for **EVGO**. The average price target among the analysts is **$13.20**.

If by the grace of sweet lord baby Jesus this isn't taken down I'd like to say thanks for peeking at it and good luck to all!So, like many others here, mostly every option trade I make is based off being  compulsive and thinking things will magically work out in my favor. 

I see people on here talking about how they should inverse themselves and how they seem to have the worst possible luck investing. 

Well Google stock split came and I thought oh calls is a no brainer right? I don’t know what was inside of me that day because I chose to inverse myself. What happened next amazed me...

Not financial advice I had to do the opposite of what I thought was the right play to get here.I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but if I’m ever 98 and I’m still buying stocks talking about them being long term plays, then please just kill me. Seriously, almost all of us here want to make enough money and become financially free, we want to reach a point where we don’t have to worry about money anymore for the rest of our lives, and then here is someone who has reached that point and has made it, but refuses to retire and still buys and sells stocks in order to make even more money and is spitefully defending his positions even though he probably won’t even be here to see if he was right 5 years from now. There is clearly something wrong with this picture…[Disney has released earnings of $1.06 Diluted EPS for the most recent quarter.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-company-reports-first-210500944.html) The estimate [had been 61 cents.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-dis-remains-show-113306296.html) I have $1K in DIS weekly calls [expiring Friday, as seen here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ScipioAtTheGate/comments/snuguz/dis_dd_post_proof/)If this holds up by tomorrow , **I win at least $70K** :)

I'm also bullish on Datadog tomorrow as my company currently use them for monitoring. It's a great company. As for Corsair, I have 700 contracts that expire next week. My gut feeling is that it might do do a small short squeeze before that so I can profit and GTFO.

Seasonal patterns repeat themselves time and again in financial markets.  From many corrections taking place in Feb-March, to the end of year [Santa Clause Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_rally),  retail traders can learn about them, and leverage historical data and  seasonality to generate alpha in the markets. For instance, going into  small caps [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM)  at the start of October and staying in till end December every year has  yielded a profit of about 9% every year. Compare that with [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  where the average yearly profits are about 17%, despite the holding  period being 4 times more i.e 3 months compared to full year. These  types of statistics can help us come up with trade ideas, and that is  what we are going to discuss in this blog post.

## Seasonality Data

We will start with more macro analysis and move towards analysis that is very granular and can  help us do a deep dive into seasonal data.

## Month, Week, and Hour Seasonality

We are going to talk about the radar charts for months, weeks, and hours seasonality in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard). The figure below shows a summary of the charts for [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Each corner is either a month, hour, or a week day, and the values are  the number of times price has closed green for each variable. More  specifically, at each point, we look at data from the last 20 years, and  calculate how many times the price closed green. For instance, the  value at August would be the percentage of how many times in the last 20  years [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s price closed higher than it opened in the month of August.

https://preview.redd.it/onef1os30wg81.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=786373f3e3dd0d4477ff16b4389d26a1db6cd806

We can see that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  seasonality starts to get better from July onwards and continues to  increase till the year end. This can inform us that trading [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  for bullish plays is best done during the last six months of the year.  On the other hand, we can see that the seasonality is quite even/bad at  the start of the year, which can actually prevent traders from going  heavy into bullish plays at the start of the year. Although this data is  useful, it is still not granular enough to give us specific plays.  Therefore, let's talk about a few more tools we have.

## Granular Seasonality Across Time

Knowing what's the best half of the year to buy a stock is good  information. But we can do better, and look at more granular information using our Seasonality & Price Movements widget in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  This tool shows the cumulative average daily, minute level, and hourly  change for the stock under analysis. At each analysis point, we observe  how much did the price change, and create a cumulative graph of that  change, averaged across time. The purple line demonstrates that while  the green and red lines are simply the upper and lower bounds of how  much price is expected to move at a maximum.

https://preview.redd.it/bqlwq4t40wg81.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fdd2047230fc9cc85e8d308cd5f7880656bcf7

The chart above illustrates the granular seasonality of [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  from 2010 to 2019. We skip 2020 because of the COVID crash, and want to  do testing in 2021. From the chart, we can observe a number of things.  First, the start of the year is a very choppy time period for the market  in general and stocks do not have a clear direction. From March  onwards, price starts to get in a bullish trend, but the trend is not  very strong. In around June-August period, there is on average a quick  mini-rally. Finally, after August, price starts to gradually continue  going up historically with a strong uptrend, leading to an end-of-year  Santa Rally. Those are quite a few observations, let us now see if they  actually worked in 2021 and 2022. We advise readers to do this analysis  on 2020 as well, because they will find very similar stats.

https://preview.redd.it/3c0eiug50wg81.png?width=2884&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a6285692caf0f2886414d168c2b0e0a1da002c

Having the knowledge from looking at the seasonality from 2010 to  2019, let us now see if that applies to future data as well. Analyzing  the last two years, we can observe very similar behavior in [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Dips and choppy markets both happened in the start of 2021 and 2022,  which is not surprising given we had already observed that fact over the  historical data. Another great thing is the rally from June to August,  which netted about 7% in just three months in 2021. Finally, we can see  the big rally at the end of year, which we call the Santa Rally.  Overall, the price of the entire year looks very similar to the average  price of the last 10 years. That is a very strong edge for retail  traders because it lets them stay in and out of positions at the right  time, and somewhat time the market, which is an incredibly hard thing to  do without looking at any seasonality data.

## Intraday Seasonality

Most people look at seasonality based on days, weeks, or months of  years. However, there also exists seasonality in how the price of a  stock moves intraday, and retail traders can leverage that to great  effect. Let us take a look at [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  and how it moves intraday. The first thing we need to do is pick the  minute level seasonality in the tool. The figure below shows that the  price of the stock, on average, goes down for the first half of the day  and goes up on the second half of the day. It is important to note that  this is averaged data across many months, and it will not work out  exactly every single day. Despite that, if we see a dip on the first  half of the day, we can somewhat assume that the stock can potentially  move up on the second half of the day.

https://preview.redd.it/dulp9fb60wg81.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=366b30e1ac2002fa4274424fcd1289c9a4c6cf38

Let us actually test this theory on minute level data for [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  from Feb 1st to Feb 4th, 2022. The figure below demonstrates the  effectiveness of the intraday seasonality. Looking at the four days of  data, we can see that the stock generally tends to go down after the  market opens. There was only one day where it did go up for a while, but  by the mid day, the stock is either down or break even. Despite that,  it starts to go up in the later part of the market hours. It was only on  Feb 3rd, where it went down a bit towards the end. However, an accuracy  of 3/4 is quite good especially since we are simply looking at  seasonality without doing any additional analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/3rjkx7170wg81.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=805a284b25325c93d46625717e8229b737f10128

Analysis like this can help us find patterns that different stocks  follow, and make plays based on them. For instance, if you want to go  bullish on [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  for a day trade, the second part of the day is where you should enter  into your position. For readers, we would urge you to take a look at [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s intraday seasonality chart. You might have heard that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) makes most of its move pre-market and after hours - you will see a proof of that.

## Macro Comparisons

Seasonality data also lets us analyze differences in how different  sectors or indices move across the year. The chart below shows a  comparison between [QQQ](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=QQQ) and [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM).

https://preview.redd.it/dfgb5bs70wg81.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bdd281559e832bdaf90879bfdb6631c842128e

Looking at the charts, there are some differences that catch the eye.  First, QQQ can often rally at the start of the year, but IWM rarely ever  goes up much at the start of the year. In contrast, IWM goes up  significantly more at the year end compared to QQQ. Although the  principle here is valid for all types of comparisons, if you look at the  data for IWM in 2021, you will see that we actually did not get any  rally at the end of year. This example is added deliberately to show you  some limitations of seasonality analysis. It only looks at historical  data, and if market regimes change, it can be invalid for future.  Therefore, please always do some additional due diligence on top of your  seasonality analysis.

## Final Thoughts

As discussed in the last section, it is paramount that you do some  additional due diligence on top of your seasonality analysis. As long as  you're doing your due diligence, seasonality data can provide you great  insights and trade ideas, that can help you become a more profitable  trader. We hope this guide will prove useful to you and help you become a  better trader. Thanks for reading.First-time poster so forgive me Papa JPOW for I have found this shithole.

In essence, Chemours is a good chemical company and I'm going long before earning statement. 

Financials look solid

They've beat their earnings estimates consistently

The debt to assets ratio is falling consistently

EV/EBITDA ratio is 9.53

The industry they operate in is one of the rare that's 🚀 in the current pandemic/supply chain/inflation bullshit

Even if the stock falls I'm comfortable in holding their stocks

Obligatory "you should reverse this since I'm on the spectrum"With the CPI (Consumer Price Index) results coming out tomorrow morning I'm wondering what that means for the S&P500. 

Results are expected to show a rise in inflation of .4 % for January. Which will be 7.4% year over year. This is the highest pace since 1982. Now while the CPI is not a direct link to the stock market it can give insight into how FED will look to increase interest rates depending on demand. 

With current supply chain shortages across the states mixed with potentially bleak CPI results. I can see a potential pullpack and a very red day in general. 

The last CPI results came out on January 12th, the week or 2 following SPY fell around 45 dollars a share. Obviously not saying CPI directly caused this, put the timeline is interesting.

I grabbed a bunch of SPY puts today begrudgingly as I would much rather ride the retard bull. But I just feel like a tasty dip is looming.

Am Retard not financial advice. 

TLDR: Inflation make gay bear gang bang on Spy.The one thing that continues to impress me about SPY is how much it loves support and resistance. Pre market we saw a massive gap up at open and a test of the month+ long downward resistance line. And we blew through that with a clear and confirmed break of that downward trend. So we are back in a bull market right? Right?!? 

Well thats where things get complicated. On one hand yes. We broke a very major resistance line and thats extremely bullish. However, as always we have to factor in economics... tomorrow we will see CPI data drop at 830am. 

This is going to be a big deal. On one hand if CPI is better than expected... markets going to bull run on the premise that no unexpected rate hikes...

On the other hand if the CPI is higher than expected... theres a very good possibility that the markets is going to extremely over react to the downside. The market will be trying to price in the unknown and possibility of more rate hikes. 

Now another thing i am watching is where we closed today which was at the 458 resistance line. This parrallel resistance line actually reveals an interesting pattern. I am seeing a head and shoulders pattern. If it plays out and CPI causes a dip we COULD see a dip back to 420... this pattern is actually fairly more obvious on the daily vs. Hourly in my opinion... 
https://i.imgur.com/9LdgUih.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/L9jaS7S.jpeg

Now if we see a breakout above the 458 resistance line the head and shoulders would be negated and by all means i see  no reason this shouldn't go back on a bull run. 

A couple other things to note on the daily chart. 
RSI is neutral meaning we have room to move either way, MACD is a buy but relatively flat. 

We have a very large gap on the daily from 452 to 455. Gaps are not always filled however a large one on the daily like that most likely will be. 

We did close a candle above the 100 ema finally which is bullish. 

The daily candle could be interpretted as a hanging man technically which could be seen as a reversal candle much like we saw back on 2/2. Granted this one isnt as obvious. 

Tomorrow is D-DAY. Tomorrow in my opinion is going to reveal how the month of February is going to play out. Look at the market all week. We were super flat. The market didnt know what to do or where to go yet. 

Tomorrow if we are rejected at 458 and see a red day. I tryly believe we will see 420 again... 

If we open and run green tomorrow breaking 458... i believe we will be going on a bull run till march when we see the first rate hike.

*This is not Financial AdviceWhat the hell is happening... from -2% to 0.10% .
This is just tiresome.Meta mentioned in its last quarterly report the risks of policies in Europe and the potential case of shutting down its services in Europe. This in turn lead to a lot of negative press and discussions, while some already thought of this as an empty threat.

As a reaction to all the public discussion and some politicians already voicing their opinion, Meta is now back-pedalling and several european employees have been sharing an [open letter](https://about-fb-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/about.fb.com/news/2022/02/meta-is-absolutely-not-threatening-to-leave-europe/amp/) on their LinkedIn and Twitter profiles.Right now META is looking to build cred behind the Metaverse idea. The stock is at a good value right now if you legit believe that Facebook will be outrageously profitable with their Metaverse. If you think it's going to be a disappointment and not stop the bleeding of users from FB and Instagram, then perhaps not. But I have a feeling that META is about to make a HUGE offer for Electronic Arts. EA has been playing nice with FB for the past 12 years, and their game portfolio fits nicely into the demographic that FB is trying to reach AKA basic-ass Chad's (Need for Speed, Madden), international newcomers to Facebook (FIFA) and aging dorks that play or once played the SIMS (typical FB user). The Sims seems tailor-made for a Metaverse re-invention, at the very least it will be a huge marketing play to pull much of it's 20+ MILLION person audience into their new virtual world.

**TL;DR: EA is going to be acquired by FB for an offer they can't refuse, because their game portfolio and the Metaverse venn diagram will overlap in a big way.**Your daily trading discussion thread. Please keep the shitposting to a minimum.

Buying calls at open. What is everyone else’s play on earnings?

Edit: well that worked out bought 150C 3/18 and I’m going to bank in the morningSONO reports holiday earnings tonight. They will be reporting “Q1 2022” earnings but it will be for the period ending December 31st 2021 so don’t get confused—They are reporting Christmas sales for 2021 but it’s reported as “Q1 2022.” This quarter is always their biggest quarter every year by far. 

Since IPO, SONO has posted roughly 9% annual growth. However, they just posted 30% annual growth from $1.326 billion in 2020 to $1.717 billion in 2021. That is a big jump… Clearly COVID boosted their holiday and general sales from the stay-at-home effect. 

Management knows this boost in demand was brought on by COVID, and so do analysts. However, both management and analysts keep reiterating that this boost in sales from COVID is here to stay and the company will continue to grow. In the words of a Morgan Stanley analyst: 

*”Sonos undoubtedly benefitted from secular tailwinds brought about by COVID, however we wouldn’t characterize recent growth as “pull forward” as much as an acceleration of trends”*

[Morgan Stanley ANALysis](https://imgur.com/1nEJcU2)

This is coming from Morgan Stanley, 5th largest shareholder of SONO, and if we exclude BlackRock and Vanguard, their 3rd largest shareholder. So take their ANALysis with a heavy pinch of salt. They are here to sell you designer SONO bags. And so is management. 

Management has given an aggressive guidance of 12-16% growth for 2022. Now remember, every fiscal year for SONO kicks off with holiday sales. For fiscal year 2021, they kicked off holiday sales in 2020 with $646 million in revenue—a record quarter. This quarter is huge for this company. It sets the tone for the rest of the year. 

However, this year they guided lower for holiday sales due to supply chain issues, yet, they continue to pound the table that there is huge demand and guide higher overall. They’re telling us they will earn record revenue numbers for 2022 with around 12-16% increase, while guiding lower on their busiest quarter? Really? Something stinks…

Can we see softened demand over the holidays? Absolutely. And it’s not pretty. 

We can check 2 places. Google trends for the terms: **SONOS Speaker, SONOS, and Speaker,** shows huge spikes in these searches for the past 5 years around Christmas time like clockwork. This year? The spike is muted big time. See spike 5:

[Google Trends shows extremely muted spike for Christmas this year](https://imgur.com/fq4dZHx)

And to confirm this, we can look at Best Buy Q3 earnings and holiday season outlook. SONO’s depends on channel partners for the vast majority of its sales… Best Buy is SONO’s largest retailer and accounts for 14% of total revenue according to SONO 10k form. So when Best Buy speaks, you best listen. 

[SONO 10k](https://imgur.com/Bmkb4BK)

Here is Best Buy CFO on their Q3 2021 earnings call:  

*”I would say some sales probably got pulled into October similar to last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints worried consumers…As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October. The sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January… we’re starting November flattish sales”*

[Best Buy Q3 2021 Earnings Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript/)

Best Buy guided a weak holiday season and the stock reacted with -15% haircut overnight. 

So Demand is down across the board this holiday season for electronics IN GENERAL as consumers bought gifts much earlier in the year due to the media ramming supply chain issues down consumers throats and fears of shortages. Demand is also down in general as COVID lockdowns start easing—less people are sitting inside and wanting to up their theatre systems, computers, speakers, etc. 

However, management at SONO tells us there is no demand issue whatsoever, that they will continue to grow, even with a decrease YOY in holiday sales—their biggest fucking quarter. WTF!

I call bullshit. 

**The play:**

Do not buy 2/11 or 2/18 puts. IV is way too high for these expirations and some negativity is baked into the stock meaning you need a big miss and removal of guidance for a big drawdown (I think this is possible but why take the chance on these options?)

**My position: $10k on 3/18 25p’s**

IV is low. Spread isn’t outrageous you can get a mid fill. Minor movement down in stock price will still give good gains 20-50% whereas the February puts will be toast without a big drawdown. 

If we get a big drawdown these will still hit multiple times. 

If no movement we can get out with our money back versus February options you are done. 

I am confident stock will slip after ER—by how much I’m not sure. So go further to March to prevent IV crush.

**TL;DR: SONO will show weak holiday demand and might even adjust their guidance lower. Stock will tank tonight**

*Disclaimer: not financial advice, do your own research, I eat crayonsI am watching this for a break above $6.75 and holding that level. If it does this, we will see $7.80’s.  If it goes through that we’re at $10 plus. Obviously trade your own plan, but this is what technical analysis is showing. Good news today with continued expansion, but not the banking act news we are looking for. This is a pretty big short squeeze candidate so curious to see when they feel the pressure and begin covering. My guess is that $7 break and hold will start causing shorts to sweat. Trade your plan everyone!

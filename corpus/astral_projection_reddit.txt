Hello! Since my first successful projection, my cat has been with me in the astral, so obviously I wanted to prove if it was really him, so I devised a method to do so. I set up a box in my room where treats were hidden. My cat showed 0 interest in the box. I waited 3ish days, and APd again. When I saw my lovely kitty in the astral, I showed him the box. I spent a bit of time exploring my house in the astral, and then returned to my body. The first thing my cat did when he woke up was to go find the box, therefore proving that it was him in the astral! I APd again later that night, and my cat was wih me. He told me, telepathically because that's how communication works in the astral, that he was my guide. He's been VERY clingy and extra cuddly with me in the physical realm since then, and I've enjoyed having him around even more.I’ve astral projected my whole life since childhood. In that time I’ve had thousands of experiences including travels into the past and future and outer space.

If anyone has any questions I’d be glad to do my best to answer them.

Check out my Astral Club YouTube Channel! https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZEI was AP at my parents place, floating around outside the house. Just as I started to float upwards, the family cat comes bounding over and meowing and screaming sounding very distressed, and began to jump up frantically as if trying to pull me back. It really felt like he was saying "No don't die/go!! I'll miss you!!" 
I signalled to myself to return to body and awoke to him sleeping near me with all his legs violently twitching. It subsided after a few seconds. I wanted to shake him awake to let him know i was still there but decided it might shock him so i didnt. 
This has been haunting me since it happened yesterday. Currently crying many tears thinking about how this cat cares for me so much, and how he doesnt want me to die. I love him so much and that cat is my little guy.I was told to post my experience here, so here you go:

So, what I'm about to tell you is based off my own experience and understanding of what I've been made to understand by these beings. My intentions are not meant to sway any beliefs you may have, as our Spitiual growth is a Journey of Self.

During my first encounter, I was meditating in order to connect with the energies around me. Both in the Earth, and all around me. I was able to see the whole of my being form blue/white roots of energy, and spread throughout the ground beneath me, and connect to all living things around me. I could see their life energies surrounding them, being connected by webs of light between all things. 

I could feel my conciousness bleed out into the roots and webs, and I was able to connect to them, and become One with them. I could feel their life within me, and my life within them. I became One with all living things around me, and I wanted to connect with more than that of Earth. So, I stretched my conciousness out into the sky, and let myself bleed out into the cosmos.

Within seconds, I saw a white hole of energy open up in front of me. It was a circle of white light, surrounded by a golden aura, and inside this I witnessed 3 beings standing in front of some sort of large, flowing metallic, spherical object. Wherever they were, everything was white. I could not see a floor, walls, or a ceiling. It was just absolute white. I immediately had this sense of wanting to go inside this "portal" (for lack of a better word), but I didn't know how.

In that moment, It seemed they had heard me, because next, I could feel their arms and hands around me, and I could feel them separating my Spiritual self, from my physical self.

When I was there with them, I had lost all sense of time. It felt as though there was a weird, disorienting sense of being somewhere where you cant tell if it's day or night, and you don't know what time it is. These being helped me orient myself, and made me feel more comfortable. They told me they were the "Keepers". They were tall, wore elegant robes of gold and white, with strange shoulder apparatuses. They had large bulbous heads, with pointed chins. They had large dark eyes, long arms, and long necks. They told me I was in their dimension, which was higher in existence than ours, and are able to insert themselves into our realm through the object I saw.  It was large, silvery metallic, and it looked like it was flowing. It had strange colored light orbs flowing within it, and it could react to these beings movements like it was their own.

I asked many questions, but these answers were the most important to me, and so I feel like I should share them with you.

What humans call "God" is the Absolute Conciousness of all sentient beings, living throughout the past, present, and future. What we call "Life" is accidental, and therefore sacred. These beings know that, and have been watching us since our beginning. They have introduced ideas to our ancestors in the hopes that they would use the knowledge to further our species evolution, and take the next step towards our true potential. 

There is no "Divine Creator", there is only the chaos of the universe itself, on an endless cycle of birth, and rebirth. The universe does not have a beginning or end, and will always die and be reborn. It always has, and always will. 

"Death", is a human construct, used to help understand our cycle of Being within this universe. When our bodies physically "Die", our conciousness then leaves our physical form and rejoins the Source of all beings, and our pure form of conciousness can then choose another form to incarnate throughout space and time. 

Based on the vibrational state of our physical being (our spiritual resonance), at the time of our "death", (meaning if we were good or not), it determines whether we ascend or descend into our next cycle of "life". That's where the notion of "heaven" and "hell" throughout many of the worlds religions come from, and have been completely misunderstood. They are simply higher and lower dimensions of existence. 

This is a never ending cycle of being, for the sole purpose of gaining knowledge and understanding of Self, in order to achieve the highest level of conciousness.

If anyone has had any similar experiences, please let me know. I would love to discuss these things furtherSo I go to the bathroom last night before bed. I close the door and do my business then I walk out of the bathroom and I felt a presence coming from my brothers door. I felt like he was behind me and looking at me so i jumped and turned around but no one was there even though it felt like he was. I thought maybe he was lurking in the shadows of his door looking at me and i just couldn't see him or something but nah he wasnt there so then I turned the air conditioner up and went to bed.
So then my brother comes into my room this morning saying the weirdest thing happened to him last night. He said he heard a door shut (which was me going to the bathroom) and then he said he kinda teleported to his doorway and out into the hallway cuz he was planning on going to the bathroom too. He said i came out of the bathroom and i turned around and jumped cuz he was there and he scared me. He said he started laughing and then all the sudden he felt like he was being pulled back into his room toward his bed. He said he started falling backwards in a weird way like he was being dragged to the floor like a black hole. He then woke up in his bed and saw the blue light from the air conditioner being changed. He was so fucking confused on what happened and i told him he must of astral projected!!
Like its so weird i FELT him there but he wasn't..but in his mind he was and he said I saw him and looked at him but from my perspective there was nothing there but i felt him.So, I posted this in the subreddit “glitch in the matrix” and someone suggested that I posted it here.  So here it goes.. 

Meeting our son.. before he was born .

So, this happened about seven or eight years ago. My husband and I were laying in the bed one night, watching television. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a child in the doorway of our bedroom. Thinking it was our only child at the time, I tapped my hubby and said “Hey, shhhh look, but I think Connor is going to try to scare us ! He turns and looks and this child walked into our room. I can’t explain it, bc it was one of those moments that seemed ... somehow different. We watched in silence, soon realizing that this child was NOT out son. He toddles in, head slightly tilted back, curls bouncing and diaper squish squishing as he goes to the end of our bed.. we see his head go down (like he was crouching) and when we got up to look- he was gone. I looked at chris (my husband) and said “ Did we just see a ghost?!” Then, almost as an after thought, I said “well, we know  if we have another baby, and he has curls, that he was here before he was born.” We both laugh, bc We were not trying for another baby at the time. Fascinated, we go to check on our son, and he was fast asleep. A few months later.. I’m pregnant. (Surprise!) So fast forward aNd our new baby, Liam, is two. He toddles in the room, head titled slightly back and curls bouncing, and it hit me like a bucket of ice water.. holy crap, this is the baby that came to visit us! I mean, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind.. now, on top of that, whenever Liam is staying the night elsewhere (like with my parents) he comes to visit me in my sleep .. for example- one time he came and just smiled at me while I was taking a nap.. He was in a little red shirt, and his hair was cut short (he left with it long) the next day I go to pick the kiddos up from mom, and lo and behold- his hair is freshly shorn and he is wearing a little red shirt. I asked my mom “did he wear this yesterday?” And she replies “oh, yeah he did, but he insisted on wearing it today, so he is..”.  So, I look at him and say “did you go see momma yesterday in mommas dreams” he just looked at me (he was four) all big blue eyes and serious, and nodded his head. 

So that’s my glitch in the matrix story. One of many, but the most profound. Our son, I guess, travels astral, and even stopped to see us before he was born. I would know those curls anywhere. the fact that my husband witnessed it with me makes it even more weird, but utterly fascinating.   Thanks for reading and forgive typos please ❤️❤️

EDIT: just another fun fact/side note. He was born on All Hallows’ Eve. (Or Halloween for most people). Maybe he chose that, too lolThe subject of fear is such a popular one on this sub because of so many  new people getting affiliated with the subject. And this is a good thing. This is what the sub seeks out to do, introduce the subject to as many people as possible. This is going to be a overview of fear, why it bothers so many and how to deal with it. The post is long because its elaborate. 

The ruling principle of what i am going to explain derives from Hermetic Philosophy. For those who don't know what this is, Hermetic Philosophy came to be in the time of ancient Egypt and it is said to predate all the major know religions to the extend that all religions borrow from Hermeticism. It is the philosophy of the mind, the universe and our role in it. I highly recommend reading "' The Kybalion '' for it is a beautiful introduction into the subject and the 7 Hermetic principles that govern existence. 

The 4th Hermetic principle is the principle of polarity. It states: ''Everything is dual, everything has poles, everything has its pair of opposites. We are going to use this universal principle to understand fear and how to master it. 

Think of emotions in the way of this Hermetic principle. Every emotion has its opposite. It is bound to its opposite emotion. Take happy and sad for example. according to this principle these are not 2 different emotions. This is one and the same, but it differers in degree. Like up and down, left and right, slow and fast, deep and shallow, positive and negative, light and dark. These are poles of the same thing but different in degree. 

Heat and cold for example are identical in nature but differ in degree. The  thermometer shows many degrees of temperature with the highest being heat and the lowest being cold. Between these poles there are many degrees of temperature. It shows heat and cold. But what is defined as heat and what is defined as cold? When does heat stop and start being cold? Heat and cold is the same thing. Its temperature. Heat and cold are the manifestation of 2 poles that differ in degree but are one and the same thing.  I would like for you to see emotions in this manner. Polarities of the same thing. 

Once you understand this you open a door for yourself that leads to mastery of your emotions and therefore mastery of the self. This is what we are going to use. 

Now for the exercise, the tool, the way of mastering emotions. And note this, mastering this on the level like the ancient Hermetic Masters could, extends far beyond mastering you fear to Astral Project. This gives you control over your emotions in a way that you decide what you feel and what your mental state is and  make sure that you are not a reactive being that is being blown from left to right by external factors. 

Imagine you are in dark room. The only way to banish darkness is to bring in light. The only way to get rid of the darkness in your room, is to introduce light. You can not take a shovel and scoop out the darkness. You can not grab darkness and take it outside. This bit is important '' you can not get rid of darkness by focussing on the darkness ''. The only way to get rid of the darkness is to open a window and let in the light. To flip a switch and turn on the lightbulb. Light and darkness are polarities of each other, just like fear and courage. When you experience fear in the Astral, or even better before you have ever been there in the first place, focussing on fear will bring about fear. The way to master your emotions, the way to mastering your fear is to focus on the opposite polarity. Just like getting rid of the darkness is only achieved by introducing the light. It can not be dark and light at the same time. So this is how it works:

You experience fear and by the power of your WILL you focus on its polarity and your mental state will follow. You will banish fear by focussing on courage. You will banish a bad feeling by focussing on its polarity. You will banish sadness by focussing on happiness. You do yourself such a big favour by practising this. Energy flows where attention goes. Regarding the WILL this is more then simply wanting something. It is a combination of intention that defines what you want, then focussing on how to achieve and energy that follows in this path. 

Do this, practice this and you will become a master of your own emotions. Emotions are nothing more then a mental state and these states can be altered. They can be manipulated and transmuted. 

Next up,

If fear resembles ignorance then courage resembles knowledge. A very good way to overcome fear is by gaining knowledge. Fear of the unknown is fundamental within human nature.  Make sure to become knowledgable. Know what you are talking about, read books, watch video's and TAKE THE TIME to study the subject. You will receive no respect on this sub when constantly asking for shortcuts, quick and dirties, summaries and so forth. Invest in yourself.

And finally,

Again, focussing on fear brings forth fear. If all you do is read about the doom stories, the Astral demons, Astral hijacking, cutting Astral cords, being locked out of your body and energetic parasites, you are making this so, so hard on yourself. I don't deny the existence of these things, i don't acknowledge them i simply don't give a shit. I refuse to create this little voice, this little demon on my shoulder that is constantly reminding me of all these things that can go wrong and what about this and if that. You create this voice in the back of your mind that can be very hard to get rid of once its there that will negatively influence your abilities to achieve AP or your experience. Why would you want this. Why would you put yourself through this. Astral Projection is such a beautiful and profound experience to have. Don't taint it for yourself. Focus on the positive and bring forth positive. 

Fear is nothing but an emotion, it comes, it passes. Weather you keep dwelling in it and let yourself be consumed by it is 100% up to you.

Go do this.31 Years ago I had an OBE when my guide showed up in my room as a physical being. He took my Soul out into the universe and downloaded a great deal of info into my Soul. Since then I have had one other OBE. Same thing more info. (Will post the link to that and my other OBE below) 

There were a lot of concepts that I couldn't figure out until I came across them in books or people sharing their stories on reddit. One that I have just recently understood is when we are completed with an incarnation we are "programmed" (By books and TV and movies) to "Go into the Light!" (Except Poltergeist where they told Carol Ann "Don't Go Into the Light Carol Ann!") 

What I was shown it the light is the gateway to a "Loop" that returns us BACK to this earth and to another incarnation over and over again. A Soul learns, over many lives, that the highest law of the Universe/Source is LOVE. This holds all things together. The law that works in tandem with that law is FREE WILL. 

If you read each NDE you will find there is a space devoid of light that is not frightening but soothing and Loving to the Soul. From that space they see the light in the distance and will CHOOSE to go towards that Light. This is the moment that must be interrupted.

In this space CHOOSE to say (or call on your guides)  "I wish to GO HOME!" and/or "I choose to see this loop from my TRUE HOME, with Source, away from this planet." 

You will pull back and not enter the Light but return back to Source where you will see this planet and this "Light Loop" that pulls so many Souls back into another incarnation. By using your highest law FREE WILL you can choose your own path. 

Personally I feel this is one of my missions here. To share this awareness to those who are open and without fear so they too can step away from the Loop of this planet. 

Do share your view on the "Light" after incarnation. (Reminds me of a Moth to a Flame)

In my early 20s I was suicidal. This experience, 32 years, healed all of that trauma. It left me completely.) Here is my first experience 32 years ago: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ollnr5/32_years_ago_i_had_planned_to_end_my_life_just

The other OBE was 6 years ago: Heart stopped. Went totally WHITE OUT. Rose up and saw my body as I moved forward. There was a beautiful woman (long blond hair to her shoulders sparkling blue eyes) in a long white robe. As I got closer to her I felt the atoms in my body begin to energize into this feeling of total love and euphoria that is coming from her. The love this being, is sending into me, I could LITERALLY feel in each atom of my being. The atoms were emanating this zinger of loving light as they vibrated at blinding speed that was a HUM all over. (have no way to put it in words) No drug or orgasm has ever reached a minuscule amount of what that felt like. She told me that in each "Chapter" of our lives we need to look for the "lesson". Once we get that lesson we can move on to the next "lesson" Then she said.. let me show you what I mean: All of the sudden I saw a "Photograph" in the distance coming towards us at a very high speed. Once it reached us we were "IN" the photograph and could look all around at what was happening. The first photograph was my Mother in labor giving birth to me. Then I saw the next photograph approaching and I was learning to walk. The next I am in school. The next I am being bullied. The next I am in the hospital in pain as a child. The next I am studying piano music. Next meeting my good friends in high school. (Still friends to this day) Next falling in love. Etc. (Too many to write here and many too personal to share) These photos start coming at light speed. The two of us never move from our spots. The photos come to present day then beyond right up until the day I am dying. I am in my early 90s. There is a nurse sitting in a chair. Above my head I see holograms of medical monitoring. From the ceiling I see a beam of light entering my left arm that is administering "light medicine". I feel my breathing starting to slow. I see faces starting to appear around my bed. My husband then my parents and siblings. My husband is holding his arms out to me smiling. They all look young and are smiling and telling me not to be afraid that it is ok to let go. I start to leave the body and then...I am standing next to this woman in a field that has flowers and grass as far as we can see. She repeats to me what she said at the start. "Look for the lesson in EACH chapter of your life and once you get that lesson you move on to the next." She also says when you life is over you will have this kind of life review only with a difference. You will see each chapter of your life and how your words and actions were felt by others from WITHIN their bodies. (Perfect empathy lesson) She says I will be heading back into my body and not to be afraid. She starts to walk away and I say "Wait! Who are you...I mean..who were you in the earth life?" She says, "I was the wife of a very famous rock star known the world over. He is still alive. This is my work now to help Souls understand their purpose and give hope when appropriate." She smiles and turns to continue walking away. I feel my Soul pulled back back back and into my body waking up with a gasp and deep breathing. I don't say anything to the medical people who were working around me. As soon as I can see my husband (gay couple here) I tell him of my experience and then say " I wonder who that woman was?" He says, "My gut feeling? Linda McCartney!" Now...I am not a beetles fan at all. I don't own even one song of theirs. I google her name and sure enough. It's the woman in my experience.

I've rarely shared this with anyone. Only the hubs. The love was beyond mortal words. I still think about it every day. The atoms in my being were each registering this over whelming love energy. Can't wait to go back there one day. There are still days where I really struggle with this life. Every time I go to a funeral I don't feel sad for them. I feel a deep sense of euphoria knowing what they are experiencing right NOW. How all knowledge has been restored to them. How they are experiencing LOVE to the very atomic level of their consciousness. I remember feeling deep compassion and heartache for my loved ones who were still in their bodies. My admiration was off the charts that they were taking on a life on this planet which is considered one of THE toughest planets to live on.

Souls are very real. After those experiences I was reading as much as I could. I saw what religions really were. (money makers) And came across all kinds of amazing people and concepts. One book is called "Journey of Souls" written by a PHD Psychologists and what happened in his practice years ago when he was helping people who were dealing with anxiety. I even tried a "past life" regression. It was incredible but I decided not to do it again because I have enough to process in THIS life. It was an incredible experience.

Update August 13, 2020: Just ran across a beautiful lady who had this NDE. What she shares is entering the "light loop" (where she encounters Souls who want her help. My theory they were asking for help to return to the earth by birth or as part of a Soul group to "try again") then exiting back to the entrance to "home" or the Source. She is given the choice to return to her body or continue back to Home/Source which she does. This is amazing how it lines up to this concept! Here is her story on YT: https://youtu.be/zp9uLaBP-wcShe became my friend and we spent hours together. I asked her if we could contact once we woke up. I tried to get her insta gram name but I forgot it once I woke up. However I do remember the start of it. T then a Y  I think. She had interesting eyes. Green or blue or both... coloured hair not natural. She told me a secret about what she does in her waking life that wasn’t good.. I told her she shouldn’t do that but I also wanted to respect her choices.This is my first post in this sub so if i screw anything up please be gentle.

I am a lot like you, I read these kinds of post all the time. I know most all the tips and info, but more than that, reading about successful and first time APers' experiences has always given me hope and kept me motivated to keep trying. This post is paying it forward to all those people who wrote all those inspiring stories over the years and also to those still trying.

TL:DR - AP'd for first time, met a girl, flew around, returned. in the process I think I may have discovered a few tricks that might help others.

&#x200B;

Description of the AP

last night I went to bed and intentionally AP'd for, what I consider to be my first time. About a year ago I AP'd accidentally but it was foggy, and unclear, and lasted about 10 seconds. I wasn't really fully conscious either but, it was the boost I needed at the time, it gave me hope. Any way, three days ago I was going to bed and as i lay there saying my mantra, "I'm going to AP."  I thought to myself this is the wrong tense for a mantra. A mantra is a hypnotic suggestion and, as such, should always be phrased in the present tense. So it should be "I am already APing." which is what I started saying and holy smacks, did that work. I said the mantra to myself maybe 15 to 20 times and then I suddenly felt the sensations of the presence of my physical body fade away (without the sudden free-fall gravity sensation i've felt a few times, and it was not sleep paralysis either.) and then, the imagined world faded in, this transition happened in a matter of maybe 10 seconds as I am repeating the 19th and 20th iteration of the mantra. This lead me to a place of 80% clear consciousness but still foggy enough for me to forget to Stabilize. I returned to my body a few moments later and I was stunned, I had NOT just fallen asleep, I had ***transitioned*** into the dream world like I had always imagined was possible. I was and am convinced that I had found a major key.

the next night I was too exhausted from work but last night was just right. I got done with my energy work and my energy body was vibrating quite strongly, not sure if it was just the semi-full moon, or just a really good energy work session but my body was buzzing like crazy. What struck me was that I suddenly noticed that this felt just like the vibrational stage that I have been through so many times before, only to fall asleep. I'm not sure why i had not noticed it before but I did now. which made me wonder, what if they are related? and further, what if the separation of the energy body and my energy work are not just related but basically the same thing? I gave it a shot. so while I am saying my mantras in the next paragraph I am keeping my mind on my buzzing energy body, because it is already there in the astral world, I just have to forget enough about my physical body to make the transition happen.

Now with my silver bullet mantra, I knew how to do that... it's allot like the sun principal, the stars are always there, its just when the sun is up, the other stars get out shined to the point you cant see them anymore. my astral body is always in the astral, it's just when I am "awake" i cant sense the astral realm over the pummeling noise of the real.

Any way, going off of the info I had discovered the night before last, I created another kind of mantra "the more relaxed my body, the sharper and more alert my mind." I repeated this for maybe 20 times and I am also actively trying to let the tension out my body, and keeping an eye on my vibrating energy body. Once I was relaxed I kicked on the magic bullet "I am already Astral Projecting" sure enough, very soon I started to feel my body sensations fade out, like, rapidly and noticeably reduce, (but this fade out was not sleep paralysis (SP), I have felt SP before and this was very different.) and then, somehow, at some point, I tried to see through my eyelids, and there was a foggy representation of my room, and i thought "Thats it!, thats the thing, which means, i can do the other thing, okay, go, exit!" and I tried to roll out but I was very sticky to my body, but I was able to sit up and put my feet on the floor with full knowing of what i was doing. It was foggy and dark but i had enough clarity of thought to remember to stabilize. I used what I believe is called the "track method" to stabilize, I have a path through my house that i know very well and have walked many times physically. It starts at my side of the bed goes into the bathroom, then hallway, then kitchen, then back to bedroom, repeat.  I used this track as a kind of automatic stabilizer, along this path through your house you have many things you pass. I touch specific objects and do certain things as I walk this track. (I picked up this technique many months ago from a YouTube video which I cant seem to find.)  any way, when I get to the bathroom I look in the mirror, and turn on the faucet and splash water on my face etc. This engages many senses. after walking the track things became very clear, but i found myself in a kinda preschool setting. This may have been a point where i may have transitioned into a lucid dream instead of the "real time zone"

there was a young girl there not more than 12 years old giggling at me. she was flying around the room and I'm like, "how are you doing that?" and she's all "it helps to jump first" and so i do, I get a running start and jump and I fly around, and it is just the best thing. After a while I remember that I need to keep it short so that i can remember all the things. So I think about my physical body and bam, seamless transition, and I'm lying in bed pleased as punch as to what just happened.

So, now for the advice portion of the post. What I think works, why, and some tips I've not really seen posted here before, or at least much. I know it is quite presumptuous of me to speak as if I am some kind of expert having now AP'd a grand total of once, but I have been failing at this practice for so long that last nights experience has snapped into focus a great many things for me. it's like trying to wiggle your ears, before you figure it out, it seems impossible, but once you do it, it suddenly becomes much easier to do it again the next time. I feel that this has just happened for me.

GUIDANCE: my tips are in no particular order and to me, are more like ingredients that need to be in the right balance more than be in a particular order.

**Tiredness - not too much not too little:** Meditation can help with this, but you need to specifically notice your tiredness level. I have come to notice that when my motivation starts to drop off, and my mind starts to drift aimlessly,  I am becoming too tired and need to awaken a little.

**The edge of Sleep - learn to balance on it:** This is a skill that should be practiced in the manner that suits you best as there are many techniques. For me, I practice when I take a short nap in my car on my lunch break. I just try to float on the edge of consciousness for about 20 min. This can be (and was) agonizing in the beginning but has become almost automatic for me now. I am a super heavy sleeper so this was very difficult for me and required great effort to master. if you are a light sleeper you may not need to put much effort in here.

**A Stabilizing Anchor - have one in the dream world that is automatic:**  while this can be a conscious process of any series of sensory events, like the rope technique, if it is a conscious process, (i.e. something that takes continual mental focus and will) or it is super repetitive, it takes great effort to do when you are groggy in my experience. ( more effort than i have been able to muster any way) by imaginatively having a track to walk around your house you automatically know where to go and what to do because you walk this track every time you go to sleep, it is lively and dynamic, if you want to punch a wall you can, if you want to kick or stamp your feet because you are bored, do it. the basic path is memorized like a program, all you have to do is start the process and your unconscious mind will do most of the rest. like floating down a river you just plop down in your inner tube and let the river do the work. This way you will automatically stabilize any time you find yourself in your astral real-time-zone house. or at least, this was my experience. Once i started the track, every object i touched enhanced my conscious awareness and made me feel more awake. simultaneously it took very little effort to do because I have done it every time I go to bed for the past several months. the rope technique is not wrong, many people have used it, and quite successfully but, if you are struggling to AP, perhaps try the track technique.

**Mantra commands - make sure they are in the present tense!:** This was huge for me. simply changing my mantra from "I will AP" to "I am already APing" has changed everything for me IMO. (but time will tell)  also linking the relaxation of the body, to the alertness of the mind, I also feel, was a great key. by making these inversely proportional, the more relaxed my body got the more alert I felt in my mind. this means that AP is set up to be more automatic. if my body becomes totally relaxed, I should then become totally alert and AP.

**Energy work - weightlifting for your motor cortex and/or energy body**: Normally when you sleep your motor cortex switches off, this is theoretically the explanation for why it is so difficult to run or punch while in a normal dream. in an AP it is documented (somewhere i read in a study about 6-7 years ago) that the motor cortex is still active, which is a mundane explanation as for why AP feels so real. if this is the case then stimulation of the motor cortex could be a contributing factor for successful AP and this is my working theory...

Energy Work, if you are unaware, is a broad subject of mental exercises that are basically all different variations of the same idea. deeply developing a strong imaginary sense of the etheric/mental body. this can be as simple as imagining your hands tossing a ball between them. pushing on a wall. doing push ups or pull ups. etc. often when you do these types of exercises one will usually notice a tingling kind of sensation in the correlating physical body part. like, if you are imaginatively brushing your hands, your physical hands should eventually start to tingle. this should be a noticeable and distinct physical sensation.

After doing daily energy work for six months or so, in the Robert Bruce tradition, I can now powerfully charge my energy body, by having such a strong vibration during normal consciousness, I feel like I dont have to worry about waiting for sleep paralysis and the vibrational stage as I am basically already in the vibrational stage, and now the only thing left to do is forget about the physical and bam, I'm there. which is exactly what I experienced last night. however, as this is only one-in-a-row, time will tell if this is a reliable way to directly AP or not.

Just as a side, I have tried the Wake-Back-to-Bed method many times. always with the same result, I fall back asleep, even while sitting up in a chair. In the end, it started to feel counter productive. If was going to learn AP, I did not want to be dependent on waking up in the middle of the night to do it. I wanted to be able to do it any time, any place. my reasoning was, if AP is possible for me at all, it ought be possible for me to do it nearly any time I wanted to do it. similar to how i have heard monks, psychics, and magicians are purported to be able to do. that was probably a bit presumptuous of me but hey, here we are.

obviously virtually none of this is new, and all of these tips are scattered across the net, and most if not all are in the newbie guide. I likely could have AP'd much sooner had i put more effort into it i guess. but, I have at times, for weeks on end, put everything I had into it and gotten very little in return for my efforts. This was quite disheartening and has lead me down the path of creating more automatic mental habits and constructs. I feel that perhaps the greatest secret key is to make your astral projection experiments, habits and techniques as automatic as possible.  pulling on a rope until you loose consciousness is not a good method IMO, I have attempted many similar repetitive techniques over the years all with zero results. seems to me, something much more dynamic is required, like the track method or something similar.

if you've read this far, you are a trooper and I greatly appreciate your attention. please let me know if you experiment with any tips listed above and if they work for you or not.

thank you all!!!

10/30/21 Update:

while this mantra sadly did not turn out to be quite as "magic bullet" as I would have hoped, I still learned a lot and I thought you all might enjoy this interview with me an a fellow Redditor who has a small you tube channel.

[https://youtube.com/watch?v=rQotmyOEwd8&feature=share](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rQotmyOEwd8&feature=share)

&#x200B;Hello there,

In this post I want to share an epiphany I had a few months ago regarding astral projection which changed my approach to it completely. Once I understood what I am about to explain, the amount of OBEs I had completely skyrocketed, to the point I can astral project on demand. I later found I could apply the same rule to lucid dreaming, and I started to enjoy countless conscious dreams. So this is the story of how I got to the "core aspect" of astral projection, the key to induce it effortlessly on demand. I will start by explaining the conditions whereby I came to this "truth" or "top method", and then I will develop it a bit more to ensure that its understandable. I  I hope you guys enjoy the post and benefit from it. That being said, let's start!

I have been having OBEs for a few years now. A few  years in which I tried many astral projection techniques, and while some of them seemed to work better than others, I always had one single desire that obsessed me to the core: I wanted to understand what was the root technique, i.e. that background cause, shared by all fruitful OBE strategies, that actually separated consciousness from the body. You know, the skeleton of all techniques. It was the deepest of my fixations, and I was compelled to find out the answer to that, I knew there was a core method, it was undeniable: if many different techniques lead to the same results, then there was for sure some hidden and shared dynamic that, if emulated over and over again, it would always produce Out of body experiences.

But it was really hard at first to understand what this hidden method was, because I was conditioned by my own results. What do I mean by this? Well, if only one technique worked for me, then it would be easy to assume "oh, that's the true and only method". But  I had successful results with a wide variety of techniques, so different from each other: from tactile visualization, up to affirmations and pure desire, the ear ringing technique (using the ear buzzing sound to project) , the WBTB and many others. The challenge was in finding the single thing that united such different techniques. It seemed almost impossible!

You see, at first I thought imagination was a core aspect, but I rapidly discarded that, because many techniques dispensed with imagination. So then, imagination wasn't necessary. I kept discarding things just like that, trying to reach the substratum. I eventually thought it was pure intention, pure desire. This made sense to some extent, because all techniques required you to think actively about projection, whether you do this by imagining you project, or state it via affirmations, or whatever. It seemed like I succeeded with stripping away everything unnecessary. But then I had an spontaneous projection, which messed it all up. Not that it was the first spontaneous OBE in my life. In fact, I had a few of those during my career as an astral traveller. I was just ignoring them. Pretending that they were not there. Right when i thought astral projection had to do with a burning desire or intention, I realized that some OBEs dispensed with intention completely.

I was so obsessed with finding the key to astral projection in those OBEs I induced myself, that I was screening out those that happened involuntarily. I don't know why, but I guess it made more sense to find the how-to in the techniques rather than in...and then my mind went silent. I reached something important: a point of no-return. I realized something embarrassing: I had the answer in front of my eyes, but I kept pretending there was a hidden solution. But via spontaneous projections, the message was clear: it is not that those "spontaneous" projections weren't induced by me. NONE of my projections were induced by me! Its almost as if my unconscious was trying to tell me, via spontaneous projections, something like; "hey! its me who does it, not you".

At that point I understood the following: there is no method. We can't induce out-of-body experiences, nor lucid awareness in a dream. We don't really know how it is that the projection of consciousness occurs, or how lucidity pops up. We just get to experience it under certain conditions. All we do, really, is asking for projections to occur, while meeting the most optimal conditions for them to occur. That's the reason why spontaneous projections are kinda unconfortable for many and we try to screen them out, because they are trying to tell us about the illusion of method, and we as humans need to cling on a certain "how to", believing we are responsible for phenomena to occur.  But we aren't. It is "something else" (the unconscious, the higher self, or whatever you want to call it) who kicks you out of your body, or triggers lucidity while dreaming. And when it occurs naturally, we try to understand how we did it, instead of realizing it isn't something we did, and thus opening ourselves to that same gift.

When I understood that, I began to do the following (the "no-method" method), and it ALWAYS works: I just lie down in the morning (to ensure that I don't fall asleep), close my eyes and simply ask this "unconscious" or whatever it is, to induce an OBE for me. And then I evoke this feeling of TRUST. I trust him, I trust that it will do the rest for me, because I understand that every time my consciousness escapes my body, it is this kind of higher consciousness or being who does it, not me. And this feeling of trust is the way to get rid of responsibility; in giving away this need for control and responsibility for the experience to occur, you also get rid of anxiety, fear and other emotions that boycott the outcome. So then, i just allow myself to drift with that feeling of peace, KNOWING that it  will happen and I don't have to worry about it. Every time I do this, I get an amazing out of body experience. I just ask "the universe" to induce an OBE, and allow it to do its job. This same "method" (now you see why I refer to it as the illusion of method: you really don't do a thing) also applies to lucid dreaming: I just allow my higher self or unconscious mind or whatever to trigger lucid awareness for me, and go to sleep happily, knowing that it will happen.

To sum up, the answer is not in the techniques. All techniques are rituals we create to convince ourselves that we are the architects of the out of body experience, but we aren't. By acknowledging the one who DOES induce these kind of experiences, we get ourselves out of its way, we allow it to do its job and our emotions and feeling of responsibility no longer boycott the results. It is quite weird, even ironic to some extent, but it is also a relief in some way. You realize that you were never doing it wrong, because you can't do it. None of us have the supernatural power to separate consciousnesses from their bodies, its absurd. That being said, allow yourself to experience the OBE state, trusting your inner mind, knowing it will do this for you.

Exempt yourself from this responsibility and enjoy!

UPDATE: If you enjoyed the approach given in this post or found it useful, I am excited to announce that I just released an AP book on Amazon called "The Illusion of Method", which is an in-depth expansion of this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pc3ipt/my_ap_book_the_illusion_of_method_is_available_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI see alot of people here including myself starting and getting the ropes of Astral Projection, like a ton. We son't see alot of people giving advice to the newcomers either.

I think as soon as we all start having many successful AP's and become really good at it we shouldn't leave the subreddit or be inactive. With all of us learning at once lete try to guide others to project as well and be very active once we do get it down. 

I only AP'd twice (both lasted very short amount of time) but once I get long AP's down successfully you know for a fact i'm gonna be giving advice to everyone asking. Because someones advice is what got my second AP, which was to get earplugs and a face mask so I could focus and not be distracted.If you are doubting yourself or the possibility of being able to astral project, don’t. I saw my self and my wife, as if with my own eyes, sleeping last night. When I realized what was going on I flew out my window and tried go as high as I could away from my body. It felt like the experience only really lasted less than a minute, but my friend, I did it. I have a clear memory of the entire experience unlike other dreams. I remember seeing clouds look like they were rushing towards me when in fact I was rushing towards them. I remember looking down and seeing the lights of the city. Although things looked very different. Like my city in the OBE doesn’t look like my city when looking down on it. 
There were moments where I would doubt this page and worry about the legitimacy of being able to induce an OBE. I am so glad I didn’t give up and just kept at it. 

If you have questions I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.Sooo, this all started when I was telling my daughter how we are spirits in physical bodies, and when our body dies, they continue on. We know this because our spirits can can come out sometimes. 

She asked me that happens. I told her different examples how it can happen accidentally, but then told her about practicing to do it. 

She said, "That happens to me sometimes, and I fly around. That's not a dream?" 

Fast forward to this morning when she came into my room where I had a mask and headphones on listening to AP music (someone here recommended). Anyway she asked what I was doing. I told her. She wanted to try.

I made a shape in marker on a piece of paper. I put the paper in top of one of the ceiling fan blades. I told her that if she could "fly up" and  tell me what was on the paper, I would let her buy something on Minecraft. 

So I set her up with a mask and headphones, layed down next to her (she was a little scared) About 20 minutes later I felt her shake and the pop awake. She said she started to "fly up" a little but woke right away.

I asked if she saw the paper. She closed her eyes and said "It...was...an...X?"

It was an X!  I got it down to show her.

How cool is that?!Hello, My name is Devin Simms.

For those who don’t know, I have been teaching people how to astral project for two years. Constantly guiding and mentoring people on how they can have their first out of body experience.

I have had hundreds of OBE’s in the past few years and have tried many different techniques to see which ones provide the best results in the shortest time.

For those of you struggling to project or just want more information in general, feel free to ask me anything below!

Thank you!

**PSA: For all those messaging me about becoming a student please note that no mentor/teacher can guarantee an OBE, we can help and significantly reduce the time it takes to achieve an OBE but anyone guaranteeing you an OBE is lying. There is no magical trick, it all depends on the person.**The Wiki has been updated and made available! Gratitude goes out for the community members who have greatly contributed to the guides, videos and other sources that can be found in the Wiki. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/wiki/index

Also the related communities have been added. This is also still a work in progress.

The rest of the post contains some of the most frequently asked questions and most common misconceptions mainly aimed at newcomers.
_____________________________________________
Astral projection is a NATURAL phenomena, not a single soul on earth is excluded from the ability to do so. Religion, believes, it doesn't matter where you're from, if you put in the work you can do it.

YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK. Some people are natural talents, most are not. You reap what you sow. Practicing astral projection needs to be done 3-5 days a week. Once a month is not practicing.

Meditation HELPS, it is not mandatory. Meditation can give you focus and a certain state of mind what can benefit the process of Astral projection.

Vibrations are a COMMON, not mandatory. Not even everyone has them. SLEEP PARALYSIS is the same story. It's common, a possibility.

Astral projection is not necessarily dangerous. But you have to mindfull of what you do because you can encounter unpleasant thing. Don't give in to fear. You can compare the astral with a deep ocean. There are lower, darker parts where low vibrations/entities reside. Also there are higher, lighter parts where higher vibrations/entities reside.

"I don't know if I projected or not." If you did, YOU KNOW. Doubting? Didn't do it. The experience is overwhelming and all consuming. You will know when it works.

DREAMING is like looking through the window, LUCID DREAMING is sticking you head out the window and having a look around, ASTRAL PROJECTION is breaking the entire wall down and flying off into space. These are not the same. There is a difference.

Important: the astral is a reactive place, it reacts on YOU and what you bring forth with YOUR thoughts. Be mindful, don't do stupid shit, don't trust every thing you see because form is not fixed, beings with Ill intent can portrait themselves as everything they want.

SUPER IMPORTANT: have fun, go discover, don't give up when it doesn't work because it will. We are talking about the fabrications of reality here, the existence of physical reality has its roots in these mental plains. Whatever you believe this is, discover your being.

Disclaimer: add to this. In my eyes these are the most basic aspects of astral projection that cause the biggest misconceptions. Help beginners out and make this sub into a haven for knowledge and experience.

This post is from u/HopefulAstral and has been posted 7 months ago.

There are SO many people asking the SAME questions. This should not be happening since there great answers to these questions in the 'top' section of this reddit.

Here's some just to name a few that I've seen, and I'll be answering them as well:

Q: Can I swallow/scratch/move around while attempting?

A: Yes. I did this whenever I wanted to project and it never hindered me. It'll only hinder you if you want it to. Remember this is all a level of consciousness.

Q: Does it matter which position I'm in?

A: No. I've projected on my back, side, stomach, and in some weird shape (almost like a 4) with my legs.

Q: Does it matter what time of the day it is?

A: No. But I do feel the early morning 5-7 AM is the best. But I've reached heavy vibrational states at all times of the day (1pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm, 8pm) but back then I was too afraid to pursue the vibrations. But if you can reach that state you're good to go.

Q: Can I have THC in me and be successful?

A: Yes. Would smoke the night before a projection, or even minutes before.

Q: Can I masturbate and be successful?

A: Yes.

Q: Do I really need to change my diet and eat healthy?

A: No.

Q: How do I raise my vibration?

A: When you're awake, practice slowly exhale to the point in which it feels like you're holding your breath but you aren't. Doing that during the vibrations raises them.

Q: Do I need vibrations to project?

A: No. All of my best projections have been without vibrations.

And that's just to name a few.

We're stopping beginners from making real progress by having comments filled with people who have never successfully projected giving them advice that they don't even know works for themselves.

And I take responsibility for not coming to this subreddit more often after figuring out how to project. I simply just lacked interest in it and couldn't find the time with my new life schedule.

But here's a question for the more experienced projectors:

Why don't you just tell the beginners what they need to know and stop beating around the bush? They just want to project like you. Get off of your soap box and HELP THEM. You know EXACTLY how to project and you know EXACTLY what a beginner needs to know.

HELP. EACH. OTHER.FIRST \* 

&#x200B;

I have been trying to AP for a few years, but really studying , meditating and really trying consistently for 3 or 4 months.

One week a go found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/mmp8dr/working_on_a_new_ap_technique_related_to_the/) and it really helped me. In that same night I was able to hear that sound, focus on it and feel vibrations for the first time.Before one week a go I have never had sleep paralysis nor vibrations, and suddenly I started hearing this noise and remembered the post. Focused on it. My first vibration came and i felt very excited. Felt like floating for a few seconds but the excitation was too much and could not go any further.

Have been trying since but no luck, not until this night.At first slept hearing binaural beats. Used WBTB method, 3:30 I drank a cup of water, gone pee, and waited a couple minutes before going to bed.There I started, 'ohhhmmmmm'... for half an hour I was meditating singing this 'ohhhmmm' inside my head and vibrations came (remember, my second vibration ever). I was calm, let it happen, it became VERY strong and the sound inside my head was like a jet engine or something very loud.I don't know exactly what exit method I used. Some people try to roll, some people imagine a rope and pull it. I guess i felt something pulling me, rather. And there I was, floating in my room, looked down and behold... me sleeping in the bed.  O\_O

I went up, for me was like a tunnel. Something very bright was getting closer, and I saw a portal. The portal remembered me something like 'The gate' In Full Metal Alchemist, but it was round full of mooving parts. I Tried to reach it but i saw my hand like energy just passing by the structure. I went inside the portal and was so bright, like if i was trying to enter the sun or something.

After that I was at my home, found strange, did a reality check (i looked at my hands, normal. tried to pull one finger trough the other hand i could not. did a couple of full breathing) and I was not dreaming. There came my girlfriend... but different... The same person but with a different hair color and some tatoos. I asked about the date and she said to me '16 april, are you lost? (a joke)'.  So i looked over my room and grabed some paper, i could fully read a report i did for university (in there) i guess. So right now while typing, I think i was in a paralel time line, or something... it is very confusing to me.

After some time i was in a field, the sky was heavy with clouds and i could see myself but glowing!!For the record i am kinda afraid of heights. I started flying there but didnt want to go to high because was already afraid that my fear of height could hinder my experience. But i flew for a while, took some rain in the face and felt cold.

Woke up in my bedroom here, was 4:10AM.Tried again, and came vibrations and i exited again. Again saw me in my bed in a different position.

From now on i remember the portal once more but now stuff became very confused, more like i was lucid dreaming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And that is it. I have lots of stuff to think about.

I have huge interest in the mysteries of paralel words, multiverses, different time lines and etc but i did this AP with no intention at all. Was my first, i just wanted to do no matter what. I guess my inner interest pulled me to what happened.

&#x200B;

Now what i really want is to know more, maybe meet some higher entity that could teach me something. And that is what i will have in mind later when i try to AP again. Cant wait to the night to come.

I always believed that AP was real, same i believed UFO phenomena is real. Never had seeing any of it, never forced (never will) people to believe no matter how hard i did.but now i finally did AP, now i can say IT IS REAL AND I DID IT.

&#x200B;

english is not my main language, please forgive me the lots of errors and stuff.This is not the first time I’ve accidentally projected. But yes, it lasted 11 full days in my mind and I remember pretty much all of it. 

There was a guardian spirit with me the whole time which had never happened to me before. 

It was nighttime in a small town with a cemetery which is where I was. I didn’t have a body and was floating around kind of aimlessly until the spirit told me there was a job I needed to do. I spent around 3 days digging in a cave while my guardian spirit was away in the cave doing something else. I eventually ended up digging a skeleton out of the ground. After this I had a body and could no longer float. Once this happened the guardian spirit told me to follow him. At this point we walked through a forest for several days talking about our journey and my actual life. He told me what would happen to me throughout my life and answered several other questions, but I don’t remember what he told me just the topics. On the last day we arrived at a waterfall with a lake where lots of kids were swimming and he told me “*sigh* well this is it, here’s the destination. Too bad you can’t stay for long.” In a sad tone. He noticed I was sad after that and he gave me around 3 hours to swim and have fun there then I looked at him and He somberly looked at me and said it’s time to go then everything faded to white and I woke up. 

Some things to note. 

1. I can definitely tell he was a guardian spirit or a guide and was there to help me. 

2. The projection happened during an hour long nap after I had been awake for about 30 minutes.

3. The guardian was a tall person of color, but could never see his face, and he told me his name, but I forgot it the moment I woke up. I got the distinct impression I wasn’t supposed to know / remember these things. 

Have any of you experienced similar or do you possibly have insight into this. I’ve been told I have a natural gift for projection, but I know very little about it so info would be greatly appreciated! :)Soo ever since March, ive been visting a psychiatrist, because I got really suicidal after the death of my grandmother due to coronavirus. (She was basically a mother to me and I was with her everyday since I was born).

I really enjoy going to a psychiatrist, the fact that i can talk about ANYTHING with someone, and not be afraid to get critized or damage my reputation.

I told her about my ability to AP, and she told that she has had patients before who have told her that. She said that she has tried to do it ever since she had an OOBE in her childhood. She described the OOBE to me and asked for help on achieving AP.

Her OOBE went like this. She hovered above her bed and saw a gnome-like creature in front of her sister's bed. She looked out of the window and saw bright colorful lights floating around. Once she looked back, the gnome was gone. She described the experience as being aware of everything.*not an expert* just answering questions and like to hear others experiences
 💖please  feel free to  share your own experiences. 💖

***I will try and answer all the questions! If anybody wants to jump in and respond or give your input/ideas please you’re more than welcome too! Didn’t realize there would be so many! This is awesome!***Have you ever wondered why some people can astral project on a frequent basis, spontaneously and with little to no effort whatsoever? How do they do it, and what makes them different?

As one gets involved in AP circles, one encounters the following: some practitioners seem to be more gifted than others. But far from being a matter of innate skills or having abilities or talents that others lack, it's a matter of intuitive understanding. There are those who Astral Project on command with little to no effort, without relying on methods and without sweating in the process. On the other side of the coin we have those who no matter how hard they try, how much time they invest or how many techniques they try - they simply can't manage to leave their bodies. But again, what makes them different?

The answer is simple: the former understands the core nature of Astral projection, and therefore knows how to proceed. On the other hand, the latter type of practitioner does not understand the basic nature of AP, and therefore is not able to address the practice properly. But what is the core nature of astral projection, and why understanding it leads to AP mastery?

When deeply considering the nature of Out-of-Body Experiences, we inevitably realize that they are spontaneous. They happen all of a sudden, out of the blue without an apparent cause. This is best seen in the case of involuntary projections, or in those projections that are a result of a completely nonsensical, non-sympathetic technique. Rather than something you “do” or “induce” or “trigger”, it seems to be induced by the brain itself.
If you were to ask a natural or “gifted” projector how they do it, they would most likely answer: “I don’t know, it simply happens!”. After all, how are we supposted to know how it truly works? If we were to see it from a purely biological and materialistic perspective, we don’t know what chemicals, neurological processes, and similar stuff are required to have the experience - and even if we knew, we don’t know how to maipulate all those things, in the same way we don’t know how to regulate our body temperature, the heartbeat, and all other body functions. Those of us who can AP on command without methods understand that it is not the method that causes the experience, but the brain. Believing methods to work is like believing that we can “induce” body functions by visualizing them, for example. Visualizing how you leave your body is not what make the experience come true, but your own system doing it for you.

The talented/natural/involuntary projector knows in some way that the very nature of astral projection is spontaeity, and so it’s an effortless experience. This means that the best way to make it happen is to take it as child’s play, not trying hard at all - this is how you “align” with the nature of AP. But trying hard as if it’s a hard task will only move you away from the experience, because you are acting in the completely opposite way. Spontaneous experiences require a flexible and playful approach, AP is not a hard exam or building a company, but instead like a gentle dance.


THEREFORE. If you want to project on command without methods, you must necessarily start by not using methods. How are you meant to project without techniques by using them all the time? To be like the former  type of projector you have to act like them. Put down the tool you call method, and through the understanding that AP is something spontaneous that requires you to do nothing in order to happen, lie down and firmly know that you will make it. The secret to AP is not to be found in methods but outside of them. That’s why I say that understanding the core nature of AP leads to the understanding of the core practice of AP, which is a solid conviction that you will project. It’s what gifted projectors do: they lie down knowing that they will project. This deep trust in the inevitability of the outcome is all you need. So in order to be the guy who projects on command with zero effort, you need to act as if you were that type of projector. 

The following quote, extracted from my AP book The Illusion of Method, pretty much sums up this whole post:

"The Core Practice of Astral Projection is Trust; and its Core Nature is Spontaneity".


In realizing that AP is spontaneous and does not depend on you, what results from this feeling of positive “impotence” is trust. In not understanding the core nature, one inevitably thinks it’s all a matter of hard work and trying hard.If you are anything like me, you've been trying to astral project for a long time and can sometimes get close but never quite get there. Trust me I was in the same place, and after watching and reading every tutorial I could get my hands on I found myself unsuccessful and with more unanswered questions then when I began. But Fortunately for me and those like me, I had the foresight to write down what worked, what didn't, and why for every single attempt I made. And after reading through this list and compiling every single useful piece of information from it I developed a method that finally worked for me and I am optimistic should work for you.  


Let me be first make it clear that this tutorial will not help those who are simply afraid of astral projection,  or usually fail once reaching the vibrational stage simply out of FEAR. I was not afraid going in as I had the mindset that even if I saw something terrifying the first few times, which I did not, the benefits of this experience made such things arbitrary. As such I have nothing written down for that specific problem, my recommendation would be simply to think of your goal with AP and consider if that outweighs such a possibility. If it does not I recommend setting your goals higher, that problem is not something you are going to brute-force yourself out of, you should simply accept it is a possibility and that you are willing to take that risk for the life changing experience of AP. If you are afraid that thought will inevitably cross your mind during the process, you must be able to justify it within your mind to get past that. With that out of the way allow me to state some things that you will need, or at the very least are highly recommended by me.  


\- A pair of Earplugs 

   A set of very cheap earplugs can be picked up from your local Walmart's pharmacy, They need not be perfect, the idea         is simply to block out all unnecessary sounds that your brain can focus on, a slight hum through them will not be detrimental for this purpose and may even help during later stages. Please note that I DO NOT recommend over ear earmuffs as those are very cumbersome and will become uncomfortable.  


\- A Blindfold

  No need to go out and purchase a sleep mask, All I did was fold a dark pillowcase around my head so that when I rested my head down it was unnoticeable and comfortable, the important part is that it keeps your vision black when your eyes open and that it doesn't impede breathing. The darkness is the most important part as during the initial phases its not uncommon for your eyes to partially open and if you cant differentiate between the two it shouldn't immediately pull you out of your attempt.  


\- A reasonably warm room

  I recommend setting your room to be around 20 degrees Celsius (70 Fahrenheit). The idea here is that your room is Cold enough that you aren't sweating, But warmer than where you would usually sleep.  


\- Time

  While this technique has proven to be very effective for me and the two people I shared it with, It is, by design, not the fastest of methods. This technique breaks up most of the initial phase into separate phases to allow you to focus on one thing at a time and not be overwhelmed.  


Alright then with that out of the way why don't we get started.  


**Phase 1: Clearing your mind**

Lay down in your location of choice, insert your earplugs and cover your eyes. During this initial phase we are going to focus on stopping unnecessary thoughts from impeding your progress (don't worry I have a plan to achieve this). Once you have lain down, preferably on your back, you are going to begin breathing slowly and deliberately. Take this time before moving on to focus on just getting comfy, if you aren't comfy you doom yourself from the start. If, Like me, you have a wide back and find laying on your back to be inherently uncomfortable I recommend bending one leg up to provide more support. Make sure your limbs are not touching. Once you have a slow and deliberate breathing pattern established you are ready to begin. Make sure that your breathing is slow but not so slow that you are depriving yourself of oxygen, as in that case your body will reflexively force you to take random deep breaths that can and will jolt you awake.

Alright so you are comfy and have everything ready. Now all you have to do is begin counting your breaths. During this phase thoughts are going to come flying in as your brain decides its time to mull over everything from the day. I have three techniques for removing these thoughts in the order that I use them depending on how persistent the thought is. If a thought comes in, first I recommend simply acknowledging the thought and allowing it to pass. For example if I think about a movie I watched that day that I enjoyed ill simply think "Yeah that was a good movie". For smaller less persistent thoughts this will allow them to pass by giving your brain some form of conclusion on the thought. If that fails the second technique is to think of the conclusion of the thought you are currently having. Going back to my movie example I would simply think briefly about how the movie concluded, again giving your brain a conclusion and allowing the thought to pass. For the most persistent thoughts, I have found that simply thinking "is this more important to me than AP?". This solution will only work if you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve with AP, KEEP IN MIND that you should not use your EXPECTATIONS of AP for this purpose, mislead expectations will only hurt you, understand that you are simply along for the ride and that you are there to experience what AP has to offer, not to force what you think it will be onto it. You will experience many thoughts during this time and we are simply weeding out the baggage of the day so that any thoughts that may occur at a later time will not be so persistent that it pulls you out. Now then, keep counting till you reach 100, this should take 10-20 minutes depending on how you are breathing. If at 100 you find you are still getting new persistent thoughts, simply restart from 0 until all the thoughts of the day have been covered.

&#x200B;

**Phase 2: Numbing the body**

Great! now your mind should be fairly clear, don't worry about the occasionally thought that gets through as long as you don't focus on it for too long. Now then this phase is somewhat simpler than the last but JUST as important. Understand that a lot of the goal of AP is to self-induce sleep paralysis, and you cant do that if your body is constantly flailing about. While you shouldn't have been moving about during the first phase, we are going to specifically focus on that now.  


The technique is basically the same as the previous phase with some minor changes, Like before we are going to begin counting to 100 again, but this time we are going to specifically focus on not allowing the body to move whatsoever. simply passively make sure that your body does not move or flinch during this time, if you get to 100 without moving whatsoever, Your already ready to move on to the next phase, if not I have a simple rule to make sure you have enough time to achieve complete body relaxation. If you make a movement during this time simply subtract 25 from your current breath count so that you have more time to relax. If doing math like that requires too much active thought on your part, just move back to the last multiple of 25 you were at. For example if your at 47 breaths and u flinch or move go back to 25. This of course has exceptions like if your at 51 and move, it makes more sense to go back to 25 rather than 50.  


**Phase 3: The abyss looks back** 

Overused quotes aside, This stage is basically the same, Except this time as your counting back to 100 you are going to actively watch the darkness of your eyelids. after some time you will begin to see abstract shapes and colours, DON'T THINK ABOUT THEM, simply take note of their presence and allow them to flow around in your vision. You aren't trying to visualize anything at this time simply watch the show as a passive observer. Over time these visions will become more concrete, again don't actively try to think about them or perceive what they are, you are just an passive viewer in this show. Its like standup comedy, if you try to become a active observer you're going to get shut down pretty fast. Once these visuals become more intelligible you are ready to move on. 

Note: for some, even if everything is done right, the visuals will actually just completely go away. If you are sure you didn't mess anything up you can also move on after this. But obviously not before they arrive.  


**Phase 4: Visualization**

Alright, time to get a little more active! I'm dropping the counting thing now, like everything else you will get there when you get there and patience is key, but even more-so with this phase. I'm going to combine to separate parts of visualizing into this one phase but feel free to separate them in practice.

First we need to begin by visualizing our hand and arm in great detail, this is likely where people who are like me and have struggles with visualizing will reach the first major roadblock, don't let it stop you. this phase could take minutes or as long as everything else combined, its takes time and practice. If you have a very good imagination you can simply visualize your hand and arm in great detail in your mind, if not worry not I have a strategy as this is where I often got stuck. Perhaps this is not perfect for everyone but I have some experience in art and anatomy and use this to my advantage here. Like with drawing I start with the most basic shapes of what I'm visualizing and slowly build it up from there, adding details like fingerprints and hand creases once I have fully built up the base shapes and structures. Once you have it all visualized within your mind you want to separate your minds arm from your real one and practice moving it around and feeling it as it opens and closes and shifts, the more you feel, the better.  


Next we are going to visualize an object that we can hold in our new arm, it doesn't really matter what, so if there is something you know inside and out USE THAT! However again, if you're like me and are terrible with visualization I have a recommendation of what to use: a baseball. Baseballs happen to be perfect for this purpose as they are perfectly round and rest in your hand very easily. Furthermore they have stitching on them with a good texture, this helps greatly with the visualization as you can imagine running your thumb over the stitching and how that feels. take note of the weight of the baseball, its texture, and how it looks in your minds eye.  


During this phase or possibly even towards the end of Phase 3 you should begin to feel a slight or great vibration throughout your body. Its impossible to describe but you will know it when you feel it, if you aren't sure then that isn't it.

&#x200B;

**Phase 5: Separation**

Alright, the exciting part. But don't allow yourself to get excited or you will not allow yourself to capitalize on this opportunity. If necessary follow the guide for step one to calm yourself and prepare. I wont go into detail on separation methods here but rest assured there are hundreds of guides for that on this subreddit. Personally I recommend the rollout method and/or the rope method as they are easy to understand and we already established the visualization necessary in the previous phase.  


What I will say is that before you attempt to separate we gotta get that vibration you have going on from a 3 to a 11. Luckily its not overly difficult in my experience after all that visualization we did. All you need to do is passively focus on the vibration and think about it slowly increasing in frequency. This can take time so be patient. Often I find focusing on the forehead where your supposed third eye would be a great way to get this process started. If not think of something that vibrates like a phone or anything really and imagine as it slowly begins to vibrate faster and faster and takes you along for that ride. Once you seem to have reached the peak of this process, Now is the time to use your preferred separation method. Again, it can take time and often I find the times you are able to separate are intermittent and you just have to keep trying until that moment comes, maybe you'll have to keep pulling yourself up that rope for 20 minutes, who knows? But if you did everything right eventually you'll feel it click and you will be out of your body.  

**Afterthoughts:**

I'm sure lots of people don't have the patience for this guide and I completely understand, its not for everyone. But if you are as determined as me its worth a try before you give up right? Like I said in the beginning I came up with this method specifically to work for me through many nights of trial and error, if something doesn't work for you just change it. This isn't a hard guide, AP is more of an art than a science and you really have to find what works for you personally. That being said the time frames in this are really whats expected for beginners and what it took me the first time, id expect it to become faster after your first success as you have the confidence of knowing it can work and what to look for. This took some time to write out so if anyone gives it a try please let me know what worked, what didn't, and what you think! I'm writing this at 5am so while I cant see any mistakes in it at the moment I'm sure there are some. Please feel free to point them out in the comments so I can correct them!  


Happy traveling and don't give up!

TL;DR sucks to suck I cant summarize this sermon I've written out into a few lines, if you wanna learn you gotta read (IK I hated English class too)

Edit: though I cant say why (perhaps exhaustion or losing hope from failing too frequently), I found trying every night to be detrimental to success, I would recommend trying every second night and taking the days off to meditate for an hour to help with step one. You can also practice visualisation with this time and feeling your spiritual body.

Edit 2: Thanks for reminding me! During the time you are trying and preferably before. Remember to write down your dreams as it will help you remember the actual experience! No point in AP if you cant remember it.

Edit 3: a user has asked if i could make a video tutorial or one of those meditation guides. Id be open to doing it but since by nature this takes method takes time the tutorial/guide itself would have to be long. Im not going to just do it but if enough people in the comments are interested id be more than happy to do it to assist you. I have a 300 dollar microphone so it shouldnt have any bad mic quality issues. If you are interested let me know and ill get on it, likewise let me know if your more interested in the more indepth tutorial, the guided ap video, or both!First post in this forum, though I enjoy reading everyone else's! I'm just so freaking excited I wanted to share my experience because I only know one person who cares IRL, haha. 

I've been trying to AP and lucid dream for a couple of months now. Both intrigue me to no end and I feel strangely drawn to dreams/astral realm I guess you could say. I have had mild success with lucid dreaming, and I've gotten to the vibration stage once or twice previously. I also suspect I've dipped into astral from a lucid dream a couple of times, but I didn't know it at the time and it was incredibly brief. 

I layed down to take a nap yesterday, and as I was laying there I thought you know what don't even try AP right now( have been discouraged lately) just try to get lucid. I dozed off a little bit and woke up ( more like tuned in because I wasnt really asleep ) in sleep paralysis. I've had it a few times before but not recently and not since I've been attempting to induce  ( wanted to try to AP from this state). So I can't move but I'm fully aware and I'm like "Cool finaaaaaaaallly" but my mind was set on lucid dreaming and I didn't even think of trying to leave my body. I felt a strange twitching/spasm feeling like in my brain. Felt it build up for a few seconds. At this point it does not occur to me I'm in the vibration stage. And then I felt a brain seizure? Full body sneeze? Popping sensation?  And I sat up on my bed, but I could feel my body laying on my bed!! It was effortless. I didnt try any techniques or anything. I still didnt realize what was going on, still thought I was dreaming just lucid as fuckkkkk. I've never had this kind of clarity. I was in my bedroom where I was laying irl and it was my bedroom. I know what my dream bedroom feels like and this felt so much like my actual bedroom it was unreal haha. Still think I'm dreaming so I started doing things to cement the dream. Pushing hands through walls/bed. Bending stuff at crazy angles just anything to keep reminding me. I kept floating up, but I didnt notice it at the time. 

There were a couple of times I felt myself start to slip back into my body but I was able to stay out. One of these times was accompanied by violent shaking (earth body was still) and a vision of swimming like hell in water that had a yellowish glow. 

The weirdest part (maybe) was a painting up high on my wall in a weird spot that isnt there IRL. I spent some time intrigued by it, checking it out. It was maybe a landscape scene.  When I woke up or came back irl I looked for it because it just seemed like it should be there. Earlier today I reallllly looked and there is a nail hole right where my dream painting was. 

I didnt figure out what happened until I woke up or came back or whatever but it was definitely ap. I am just so freaking excited and proud of myself I wanted to share with people who can understand.  I cant (can) wait for next time. I know I can do this and be good at it. The whole experience lasted an hour in real time, and I feel really proud I held on the whole time.



Edit: I really want to thank everyone who took the time to read this and leave me kind words. I did not expect for anyone to really care or be interested I just wanted to put my story out there. I feel so extra motivated and encouraged by all your support. Thank you friends💙 

And an extra thank you for the awards, I have never gotten one before and it makes me feel really good!!!! 

I appreciate the hell out of this community. Keep going guys and I'll see you there someday!!So I had my first AP experience last year (posted about it too) and it was such a crazy experience for me. I woke up questioning what reality is and was amazed that we humans can even do this.
I stopped it at that though. I guess it was so out of this world that I didn’t try it again. I started to question the truth behind it. What it really was. I had doubts...and then...

Two nights ago I ‘woke up’ and unintentionally went into the vibrational state. I heard voices of people talking etc. I knew that I was crossing over to another plane. I asked my guides for protection. I felt good. I then decided to leave my body. Mind you this is only the second successful experience of mine. I was yet again excited and amazed. I flew down stairs and over to my mother chilling in the living room. I didn’t think she’d react at all but I startled her. Then I was being pulled back into my body.
I woke up and thought hmmmm not sure about that. I started to doubt AP as a whole and thought maybe it really is just a form of lucid dreaming...until tonight!

We were both chilling in the living room and she randomly says “so the other night son, something weird happened. I felt this presence and I saw a ghost, like I saw this shadow thing fly over me and just stand above me! I got so frightened that I jumped up in my chair and then straight away I said a prayer and asked to get rid of it and then it went away. I felt like it might’ve been you or your brother playing a joke on me” I was shocked. Did she just say that? Did I successfully AP and she sensed me? Perhaps that’s why I was being pulled back so quick into my own body? Because she asked her spirit guides to get rid of me? Idk. She’s always been one to sense a spirit or presence. She’s experienced a lot of other-worldly things but this, I actually whole heartedly believe. I mean, what are the chances?

This has got me so much more intrigued with AP.Hi my name is Gene, some of you probably already know me from this sub or the Astral Lounge Discord where I'm always answering questions. I enjoy teaching about astral projection and have helped many on their way, and often find myself teaching it even when out of body!

I've filled up more than 3 journals in the past 10 years, filled with various experiences, and I've recently created a website where I share some of those experiences (I'll be writing more when I get time). I also wrote a guide on there which addresses common questions and struggles:

[multidimensionaljournal.com](https://multidimensionaljournal.com/)

I also made a new YouTube channel where I'll be giving even more guidance and sharing my future experiences, be sure to check it out:

[https://www.youtube.com/AstralDoorway](https://www.youtube.com/c/AstralDoorway)

If any of you have any questions at all please feel free to ask!.... and frankly, I’m jealous AF. I’ve been literally trying for years to AP with zero success. 

Today I noticed a butterfly in our back yard and pointed it out. She said “oh yeah; that reminds me, I’ve been having these weird dreams...” 

She described, in detail, the process, all the stages, how it feels afterwards, everything. 

I’ve never discussed astral projection with her. I’ve never described it. In fact, all my conversations about it have been limited to online contacts. 

Cool. But damn...My husband and I listened to a self hypnosis video online last night because I am VERY into the metaphysical and in particular, astral projection. I have always failed no matter how much I meditate, try to “empty” my mind, listen to binaural beats, and use hypnosis. Last night, I convinced my husband (who is very skeptical) to join me in listening to a hypnosis video. I very quickly came out of it, unable to focus, pay attention, or follow his demands which is quite typical. My husband however laid there for nearly 40 minutes while I watched him. Suddenly his body jumped and he “woke” up in the middle of the video breathing heavily and said “did I just yell?” And I told him no, you d been laying there for 40 minutes quietly, are you ok? He responded with something strange:
He said he felt as though from his feet up, he was being peeled away from his body like a sticky note. He was suddenly in space and could see black with stars surrounding him. He could see all around him at once, he wasn’t a body or a point of light, just everything all at once. He felt like he was there for a long time, no feelings, just soaking in what he was seeing. Then, he felt the lower part of his “body” burn and he felt a huge push on his chest and he was back in his body. 
I asked him if he felt like he was asleep, he said no, if I tried to wake him, he would be responsive. I asked if he could still hear the commands from the video and he responded no, after a part in the beginning he couldn’t remember. Lastly I asked if he knew he was astral projecting or if he had any control, he said no. In fact, he said he’d been there before. He remembered being there before he was ever born. He said his first memory ever was of this place. Space with stars. He was there again. 
While I am saddened I wasn’t able to also experience what he felt, I am astonished that he experienced this! Is this typical for those who astral project?Omg I'm so happy! So I was gonna take a nap after having listened to like 20 minutes of a guide (lost interest) but I fell asleep and was aware of it!
So I could at first only lift my arms and they vibrated very harshly. Then I sat up on the side of my bed and kinda fell down on the floor because I didn't really know how to move. Couldn't see anything but I wasn't afraid at all. So I crawled out of my room and just decided to wake up and go back to sleep.
So I did and had some lucid dreams but the AP was so amazing!
Also when I meditated I just randomly saw my boyfriend in his apartment taking off a jacket in the hallway. Then he came to visit me and CONFIRMED THAT HE TOOK OFF A JACKET IN THE HALLWAY. HE WAS WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES. I literally saw him while meditating. I'm so goddamn happy this is amazing.
It really comes when you least expect it holy shit. I've been trying for maybe a month or so now? Really didn't think I'd have my first success this early but I've been begging my guides for help lol.
But keep believing in yourself! You can do it! It will happen!Astral projection has been a part of my life since I was 9 years old. It’s been a close companion. An old friend that’s been at my side for the last 40 plus years. In the beginning, it was simply fun and games, floating around my room, soaring over oceans, and attempting to visit my first crush (I never quite succeeded at that, but that’s another story).

As I got older and gained more experience (learning to move with the power of thought, contacting my guides), I began to make trips to other worlds, and different planes of reality. When I was a child, I use to think it was the coolest thing to dive toward the ocean, then suddenly pull up… Until I visited a world where there were spherical homes that orbited in its atmosphere like satellites, or when I flew (with the assistance of my guides) to a field in another reality where I said hello to a giant house cat with eyes that projected light. I began to realize that astral projection was more than walking through walls or gliding through the clouds. The possibilities were limitless, but even then, as I began to truly discover what I could do, I could never have imagined my next step…

Five years ago I had an accident that almost cost me my life and now requires that I walk with a cain. It of course changed many aspects of my life, but there was one aspect I could never have foreseen, and it all began in the hospital. I’d shut my eyes to try and sleep, but instead of darkness, I’d see images of things. Flashes really. Rivers, strips of land… Places I’d never seen before. At first, I simply thought it was a side effect of the pain killers they gave me, but after I arrived home, and stopped taking the drugs, these glimpses kept happening. It usually occurred early in the morning, after I woke up.

I’d shut my eyes, and instead of darkness, I’d be watching cartoons on an ancient looking television, or see legs (both women with high heels, and men with suit pants) walking back and forth on a sidewalk from the perspective of a toddler. Honestly, even with my astral projection experiences from the past, I thought I was losing my mind, but thankfully my mother, who is my best friend, assured me that I was still rational and quite sane. At the time I thought I might be seeing things from a past life, perhaps as a child.

But my mother, in her infinite wisdom, kept telling me not to place limits on these experiences. I needed to keep an open mind. Perhaps I wasn’t even scratching the surface. She was right… The glimpses turned into full blown journeys where I’d feel an incredible acceleration when I shut my eyes, and when the darkness lifted, I was in a parallel reality. Robert Monroe talked about it in his book on astral projection, and called it “Locale 3.” I named my experiences “Beyond Body,” because they were different from out of body experiences. There is no sense of separation from the physical, and the experience itself is more 3D than astral.

I’ve posted these experiences on my Youtube channel called The Astral Plane and Beyond, but I’ve also posted many videos on astral projection, and my suggestions on how to achieve it. I would love it if you stopped by. It is a place for those just beginning their journey into astral projection, as well as a place where more experienced travelers can share their trips.

But even if you don’t decide to visit, I’m happy to try and assist you in any way that I can. Sharing my experiences is something I never thought I would be doing, but here I am… my apologies for the long length, but as this was my first post, I wanted to properly introduce myself. I look forward to connecting with you. Take care.Hey folks! I am abuzz this morning. You don't know it yet but that's a top class pun. I have been experimenting with directly triggering the pre-AP vibrations by expanding the ever-present inner sound that we all have in the middle of our heads.

**Some background**: recently I have been experimenting with various meditation approaches to see if I could find a new internal 'lever' that could reliably trigger the vibration state with a minimal investment of time. The idea is that if such a lever could be found, it would lead to a reliable AP method that could be used at any time of the day, including normal bedtime. (For me, bedtime has been a complete dead zone in terms of AP success throughout my adult life. I have had more success at literally any other point in the 24h day.)

Last year I spent about a month passively meditating on the inner sound. I'm referring to that high-pitched tone that you can probably hear right now if you try. It seems to manifest at a point a few inches behind the eyes, roughly central to the mass of the head. Some people mistakenly refer to this as tinnitus--it has nothing to do with ear damage! I've had this tone available to me as long as I can remember (as a child I would lay in bed listening to it). If you listen carefully, it has other higher-pitched tones embedded within it, like it's a carrier wave for something else. My meditation would focus on these more subtle tones.

Nothing much came of these meditation sessions because I am about as disciplined as your mother-in-law's chihuahua. The tone actually became a little bit intrusive at night, so I set it aside for a while. (Note: Ajahn Sumedho, one of the few to have written about the inner sound as a meditation object, considers this constant awareness to be a feature, not a bug.)

This year I have been meditating more regularly for its own sake, unrelated to AP practice and with no expectation of attainment. I have been working with mantra meditation, and occasionally experiment with other 'audio' objects of focus, such as an imagined bass sound (possibly related to the Om) or imagined white noise. These have given me interesting side-effects in terms of strong energetic sensations throughout the body.

**The technique**:

- Go to bed and get comfortable in whatever position you like. Your normal sleeping position will be fine. Rationale: if this works, it will work quite quickly (i.e. 15-20 mins of work), and there is *no way* you will accidentally fall asleep because it's quite an intense practice.
- Relax for a few minutes. Let your mind wander just a little to turn your attention inward, then rein it back in.
- Find the inner sound. Everyone has it. Some people have a harder time getting a handle on it. Search within until you find that solid tone right in the middle of your head. Sometimes it is found closer to the back of the head. It is not in any particular ear--be careful not to lock on to any actual tinnitus sound you might have. It is a bright, clean tone with slightly crunchy overtones. (If you are familiar with sound design, think of a high sine wave with a band of bit-crushed white noise a couple of octaves above.)
- It is currently my belief that this inner sound is in fact some ever-present element of the very same vibration that we feel taking over our whole body before we are ejected into an OBE. I believe it is one narrow slice through a much larger frequency spectrum. (This belief is backed up by the experience of it expanding directly into the vibrations.)
- Once you've found it, your next task is to intensify it--to brighten and widen the slice. It's hard to describe how this is done. Sustained focus will make it louder and widen the range. Don't strain. It's easy to strain your neck muscles if you try to physically intensify the sound, but remember we also want the body to fall asleep...
- Once the sound is loud in your mind, imagine the roar of broad-spectrum white noise, like your head is in some rough surf. This is an imagination exercise. Try to send that white noise into the inner sound. Pipe it in there. You will find that the sound intensifies even further. You may also experience peripheral energetic sensations. I found that my face, feet and hands began to tingle at this point.
- Really *shout* that white noise internally. Like a scream with distortion cranked up. This is not a subtle practice. You are not seeking inner peace just yet. You want to crank up the internal volume as high as it can go.
- You might also try imagining a huge ripping bass tone and piping that into the inner sound. The important thing to realize is that the inner sound *responds to input* in the form of other imagined sounds, and these have secondary energetic effects on the body. Experiment with this--I haven't narrowed this down fully yet.
- Now imagine the inner sound spreading across your body (hopefully it is very intense now). Imagine a connection between the inner sound and your heart. As soon as I did this, my heart started thrumming in the manner often experienced during pre-AP vibrations. Intensify this sensation as much as you can without physically straining. You might also try pushing the sound down your spine to your lower abdomen. This might feel like silly imagination-work, but you will be able to feel the effects.
- Spread the sound, intensify the sound...spread the sound, intensify the sound...
- You may notice an absolute flurry of hypnagogic imagery at this point. Like it's on fast forward. I know I did.
- Before long, I felt the narrow band of the inner sound *explode* into broadband vibrations and I became aware of my non-physical body, which was flapping around like a freshly caught fish. There was nothing else to do, separation was already underway.

I like this technique for a couple of reasons. 1) It is *active* and *targeted*--you are not passively waiting around (or performing some other exercise) for a dip in consciousness to reveal the vibrations. 2) It does not require heroic amounts of meditative focus, and requires no particular visualization skills, making it potentially easier to teach to a wider audience. 3) It works at bedtime! 4) I am pleased to finally trace a line between the day-to-day inner sound and the full-body vibrations of the OBE--I suspect mastery of that inner sound could well be a path to even faster and more reliable integration of the physical and non-physical worlds.

**TL;DR:** get comfy and intensify the inner sound as much as possible by internally blasting (imagined!) white noise into it, without physically straining. Imagine spreading this hybrid roar across your body. Widen and intensify the sound until it reaches a tipping point where it becomes the AP vibrations and you are out.

If you feel like it, please experiment with this technique and get back to me!

**Further tips:**

- Interacting in any way with the inner sound will help you get results. Ultimately that inner sound is under your control--it's like an internal voice we do not normally use. Where I have said to "pipe sound into" the inner sound, it might be more useful to think of it as "creating sounds with" the inner sound...for instance, try to *speak* with the inner sound. Try to make little high-pitched whooping sounds or pew-pew sounds within it. You'll find that you can pulse the intensity and modulate it. This is the same 'muscle' that you will use to intensify it all the way to whole-body vibrations.

- Any 'loud' imagined sound you can summon up will be useful here as well. Try explosions, banging on pot lids, death metal screams (maybe keep the lyrics positive). The key is to try to make these sounds *with* the inner sound. At first this will be an act of imagination. As you slip towards sleep this will become real and you will begin to feel the interaction with the inner sound as vibration elsewhere in your body.

- If you have some favourite pieces of uplifting music that can reliably trigger *frisson* (that wave of tingling from your feet to head) try throwing in a few of these (from memory/imagination) early in the session as well. I only mention this because I have been doing this routinely lately, and it might be important. **Edit:** after experimenting later, I now think you should *definitely mix this into your session*, as it magnifies the inner sound massively and feels great.

- If you feel a wave of queasiness or a feeling like your head is expanding, you are headed in the right direction and should repeat/intensify whatever you just did. I just tried over lunchtime (didn't have time to get very deep) and I triggered a single wave of full-body vibrations that came with a hypnic jerk. If you find something like that, lean hard on it!I did it... I finally astral projected and it was amazing..

So I was laying in my bed and i started to get sleep paralysis, then i was lowkey tryna get out of it but i decided to let this one go for a run.

As sleep paraylsis is kicking in and i start getting vibrations, i start hearing voices in my head talking to me saying brandon, they were trying to teach me a valuable life lesson on like good and bad energy.

I started to get scared, as usual, fear started to kick in like me thinking theres ghosts around me and stuff and i was very scared and stuck, i started seeing gold wings and black wings, flashing back and forth representing the devil and god, while hearing the voice talking to me in the background.

And it stop flashing back and forth and landed on Gods golden wings and boom, i felt pure love and energy, i felt a big ball of energy and love and light in the middle of my body and i was so relaxced and not scared anymore.

And boom, i just stood up, i stood up and it was my room, but this experience felt very real but very glitchy like a video game, like it felt like i was having a constant seizure while walking around, i walked out of my room into the living room and saw my brother and mom talking on the couch. Bro this shit felt just like reality but i knew i was out of my body.

I tried talking to my mom and brother but they couldn't hear or see me, then i walk away and go to the couch and start of thinking of having sex, but a voice in my head was guiding me telling me not to do anything bad like have sex in the astral realm or manifest any stupid energy lol.

&#x200B;

Then I just flew up and out of my roof, i closed my eyes and started to get scared, i thought about entering back into my body and boom, i literally felt my soul glue back to my body and i woke up.

Fucking awesome, next time I hope its a more visual clear experience since it felt very glitchy and seizure experience, BUT AWESOME!I have used the techniques below for 58 years to Astral Project. For easy reference, I've distilled the information down to a "cheat sheet" format. If you'd rather just listen to a video than wear your eyes out reading, just click on my Astral Club Youtube link and chillax!   [https://youtu.be/usb6kSQ0vBM](https://youtu.be/usb6kSQ0vBM)

**1.** **Immerse yourself in Astral Projection**

**2.** **Read non fear-based books by Robert Monroe like “Journeys Out of the Body, Sylvan Muldoon “The Projection of the Astral Body”, and D. Scott Rogo’s “Leaving the Body” and others.**

**3.** **Watch non-fear based Videos on AP like Astral Club.**

**4.** **Keep your phone by your nightstand and record your dreams, lucid dreams, false awakenings etc.**

**Suggestion as you fall asleep: (Visualize as you say the words). Repeat over and over until you fall asleep.**

**“*****Tonight as I fall asleep my mind will come awake. I will leave my body. I will go where I wish to go.*** ***Do what I wish to do. And when I return, I will awaken and have a full memory of everything that occurred.”***

**Note: After every few weeks of this routine give yourself a break from AP. Don’t be surprised if you’re awakened to the vibrational state or even find yourself out of your body. Otherwise, return to the AP routine after your week pause.**

**Astral Projection Meditation**

**An astral projection technique for beginners**

To start with, find a relaxed environment and sit or lay comfortably. It’s possible to do this either laying down in bed or sitting in an armchair, there are even people who can do it while walking around but this takes a lot of skill.

**Step 1: Focus on your breathing**

Control it, deep breaths, in and out until you start to feel like your mind is emptying. There should be nothing on your mind except the sound and feeling of your breathing.

This is when you’ll start to feel strange, you might notice your body becoming numb or disconnected. You need to do the relaxed breathing until you get this feeling, it takes longer to begin with. Just sit or lay there, focus on clearing your mind and [controlling your breathing.](https://howtolucid.com/deep-breathing-can-supercharge-dreams/)

Now once you’ve done that for about 20 minutes, you’ll experience a heavy wave or a heavy blanket roll over your body, you may even lose the awareness of your physical body. Let this happen and don’t get over excited.

**Step 2: The vibrational stage**

This is where you start to shift your consciousness into a different vibrational frequency in order to project. This might be new to you, especially if you’ve never done this before.

&#x200B;

* Feel your body start to      vibrate and shimmer. Your bed may feel like it’s moving.
* Don’t panic
* Try and stay focused
* Let the vibrations pass over you
* Don’t move
* Don’t try to think about      anything

Now once this has settled in and you’re at the vibration stage, you can start to exercise your willpower. There are several ways of doing this, so it’s down to you to find the way that works best for you.

**Step 3: Visualize yourself moving WITHOUT moving**

This is where the Astral Projection techniques come into play. You need to lift yourself in your new relaxed state out of your physical body.

**Some common methods are to imagine your hand contracting and closing without it actually moving, focus on the feeling until you can almost see/feel your hand move.**

Imagine the hand moving up slowly, and try to see and feel this all while keeping your eyes closed and focusing on your breathing. Another way is to imagine a bar or a rope above you as you lay or sit, and visualize your hand reaching out to grab it. Really focus and try to feel the movement, just reach out with your astral body and grab the rope. Others like to float out of their body either upwards, or sinking downwards.

One of my favorites is the Roll Out of Bed method. Don’t try to control the roll. Just hit the floor. I promise it won’t hurt.

When you’ve found a way that works for you, and you’ve really focused on the visual aspect, exercise all your willpower and push/lift out of your body.

**Step 4: Rise from your body**

You’ll naturally be drawn strongly back to your body the first few times, this is natural and will improve with practice. 

**Roll Out and** **Get the Hell Out****!**

**You can quickly glance (no long gawking) at your sleeping body on your bed if you must. But your main goal now is to get as far from your physical body as possible to avoid being pulled back inside too soon!**

Now you’re free, you can go anywhere and do what you wish. To return to your body, simply ‘think’ it. That’s all it takes to return.

**MILD Lucid Dreaming & Galantamine Supplementation**:

Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams 

1. Dream Recall

2. Reality Checks

3. Lucid Affirmations

4. Visualize Your Dream

Try this supplement to help induce lucid dreaming and astral projection. **Note: Always consult your doctor before taking this or any other supplement**. Available in 4 mg and 8 mg sizes.I kind of stumbled across this. The key is intent. You will find leaving your body as easy as getting up to use the bathroom, your intent determines the outcome!! 

1  Go to bed with intent

Go to sleep with the intention of having OBE’s when you wake up throughout the night. Your intention needs to program your subconscious not to move or open your eyes upon awaking. It may take a couple days for the program to install but it works. 

2  Set Tasks

Know where you want to go before you sleep, focussing on tasks will help you stay out of your body longer. 

3  Natural awakenings

We wake up approximately every 1.5 hours. Going to sleep with the intention of having OBE’s upon waking programs you to be aware of these awakenings. If you wake up super tired then go back to sleep and wait until you feel more rested, this will help with remembering your experiences. There is no need to set an alarm, you already set your intention. 

4  Don’t focus too much on the exit

Don’t focus your mind on anything, keep your mind blank. All you need is the intent to leave your body. The second you find yourself awake, before moving or opening your eyes, immediately sit up without using your muscles. 

The best way for me to example this is: Think about how it feels when you wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, you sit up with a blank mind and the intent to use the bathroom. This is exactly the same thing, it feels 100% the same, what changes the outcome is your intent!

5  Don’t overthink things

As long as your mind is blank and you have the intent to sit up in your astral form, separation should happen immediately and effortlessly. Don’t expect vibrations, it will feel like you sat up in your physical body. 

6  Multiple Exits

Each time you return to your body you are still in the state to exit. Unless you have incredible information that you can’t chance losing, such as visiting the Akashic Records, continue with the separation process again. The more experience you get the longer you will be able to stay away and your body will rest while you are gone. When the time comes where you are too awake to have anymore exits; don’t move and keep your eyes closed, if you do this you should easily be able to remember all your experiences, you are still in the state to access this information. Once you have full recollection write detailed notes on all your experiences!! 

Please let me know how this works for you!!  And include any details that might be helpful to others. 

Happy OBE’s 🌈✨Fast but effective tip to make your chances to astral project sky rocket:

1- wake up after 4 to 6 hours of sleep ( preferably morning).

2- for about 10 minutes focus on your desire to experience an OBE, you can even ask your mind to focus on that as much as possible, build an intense desire to project, this will "blur" out distractions.

3- Try to fall back asleep, for most it's usually not easy but what helps me most is focusing on the cycle of the breath and how good it feels to exhale and inhale, try to feel that 'good' feeling as much as possible while maintaining the intense desire to project.

4- lying on your back will increase your chances a lot but many people find it hard to sleep or project like that , so you can do it on your stomach but that will also run you in the risk of sleeping and not projecting, choose wisely.

5- the most important part imo: now that your body is almost ready to sleep start to move your attention to your body's weight and signs of numbness, what your looking for is a feeling of heaviness (for me it's always my chest)

6- this step is where most people fail:
Now that your body is initiating sleep paralysis and you're slowly feeling your body is getting more heavy ,your enemy would be to say yes to the intense relaxation feeling and just sleep or move a part of your physical body. The moment you start feeling that the heaviness and numbness are increasing is when you should be careful of falling asleep.

but here's what can help to balance between being awake and sleep: start imagining that your body is being moved in certain motions (I personally start imaging my body is rolling out from the bed to my right or left) if you imagine carefully you should start feeling what your imagining more deeply and only after a bit of imagining you should start feeling the vibrations and you will enter the vibrational stage, my own trick is to wait for the vibrations to finish then just stand up , you'll will be 99% in the astral plane, but you can learn any other exit method.

Good luck!Warning: Long post. I've always had strange dreams immediately surrounding the passing of loved ones. But this was beyond any other experience I've had.

Tl:dr - I had an odd dream and also maybe astral projected with my sister's soul when she passed away.

A little background: 
Very recently, my sister had a sudden accident in her home where she fell and hit her head. She unknowingly developed a brain bleed and after 24 hours of no symptoms, she suddenly had massive symptoms and became totally unresponsive. Her loss of consciousness and going to the hospital happened late at night, and I didn't know anything about it until the morning. I didn't even know she had fallen. 


My odd dream: 
At this point, I knew nothing about her accident.  Before I went to bed, I was extremely apprehensive for some reason but attributed it to the pandemic. 

That night I dreamed in 3rd person. I was watching a woman who was similar to me but was not me. This person was meeting with my sister's best friend. Suddenly, she fell down and yelled about blood and her kidney. (Irl, my sister had kidney disease. Her medications had made the unknown bleeding worse.) I woke up and described it to my partner. At this point, I had no idea about my sister. We just thought it was an odd dream


The Hospital:
The next morning, I was contacted about the accident and went to the hospital. It was devastating. There was nothing anyone could do. No hope for recovery.  She was undergoing final testing for brain death...but one test kept being inconclusive. It was almost like her spirit wasn't quite ready to let go. 

Eventually, in the evening, we had to go home because of covid virus and they needed to limit who was there. We went to bed with plans to return to the hospital the next day.


My Astral Projection:
The next morning, I was awake in my bed. Suddenly I thought, "let me try to see where she is". I closed my eyes, and it was like a door opened and I slipped through it. Suddenly, I'm travelling down a road with a bunch of cars.  The road becomes a tunnel and I'm surrounded by the other cars on all sides. I'm going faster and faster. It felt a little claustrophobic, but then suddenly I'm hurled straight up. I'm travelling very fast and, as I look down, I can see the Earth getting smaller. I can literally feel myself being pulled through space at top speed. I knew I was with her. There were stars and galaxies and amazing colors as we traveled further and further away. It was beautiful. 

Then, my partner said something next to me in bed, and suddenly I'm back in my body.  

I find out a little later that the brain death tests were finally conclusive and my sister had passed.

So what do I think happened?
I don't fully have answers,  but I do believe there are things we don't fully understand. I also believe that people can be linked to other people by bonds which transcend what science understands.

I'd like to believe that somehow I witnessed the release of my sister's soul, spirit, energy, or whatever you want to call it. (I think the cars represented other souls.) In fact, I can still feel the intense energy of her release going through my body.

It was beautiful and, although I miss her terribly and I'm still in shock about her death, I feel honored to have shared this experience with her.I was once an atheist. The type of atheist to criticize any religion or religious person. I was judgemental preaching nonjudgmental behavior. I was a hypocrite and hated that side of me. I would doubt God at every turn. 

But having experience AP completely by accident before even knowing what it was completely changed that side of me. The more I leaned towards god, the more positive things happened in my life. When I was an atheist, I was miserable. I didn't have anything going for me but a "I'm better than you" attitude towards every one. Looking back, it was cringe.

The more I researched AP and the actual evidence on the CIA website made me a believer as well as my own experience. I was lifted out of my body one night for no reason at all. It was so weird. I thought I was dead and I overdosed on the current drug I was using, meth.

But I honestly think AP saved my life. And a life time of misery and close mindedness. I believe in a higher power now. I believe there's a god. And I'm happy.1. Almost everyone overthinks astral projecting. Stressing about things so small and insignificant that they actually give themselves a way harder time. For example, a few people I’ve taught worry about tongue posture. It’s irrelevant. Wether it’s laying down or on the roof of your mouth.

2. Stop getting excited. I understand getting to the vibrational stage and projecting is extremely exciting. However, you need to contain yourself. If you get too excited during any point you will be brought back. Stay calm, collected, and relaxed both when projecting and trying to project. 

3. Stop trying the same thing over and over again. This is why I’m my opinion mentors are so valuable. Because without one people have a hard time recognizing what they are having issues with and how to get around it. Keep a journal of every projection attempt and write all the details if you do not have a mentor. Then try and reflect on that. 

4. Don’t be afraid to try new methods. Certain methods work for certain people. There is not one method that works for everybody. You are all very different people, as such you will need different methods. 

5. YouTube is near worthless for information. Seriously, the amount of outrageous claims and information people on YouTube spread about astral projection is insane. Never, ever, ever listen to people on YouTube. If you seek more information look into Robert Monroe’s books.he came to me and we had a big old bear hug. I stupidly kept on wasting my time with him saying “I can’t believe this” I didn’t even get to ask what things were like, how he was doing etc. and he said I can’t stay long and then I woke up to a false awakening and then woke up IRL. Damn it!!# Here's my simple method to Astral project! This is a short and general explanation of my most basic and easiest way of achieving it.

1. Be interested and passionate, read books, meditate, and watch videos on astral projection, study it and contemplate it in much of your free time.
2. ***ALWAYS*** question your reality as often as you can. Ask yourself throughout the day, "Am I in the Astral?"… do reality checks to confirm. My favourite reality check is; hold your nostrils shut and try to breathe through them; if you can't, then you're in the physical. If you can, then you're in a dream. If you're in a dream, try flying or falling to induce vibrations to enter the Astral plane (this technique of turning a LD into AP is explained [here](https://youtu.be/phK2E9WQQug))
3. Before sleeping, intend to wake up in the middle of the night or set an alarm for you to get up and go back to sleep anywhere between 4 to 6 hours of sleep. This will act as a second attempt and give a jolt to your consciousness to boost your REM cycle. When you wake up in the middle of your sleep, simply walk around for a bit, or meditate, stay feeling drowsy so that you can easily fall back to sleep.
4. As you drift off to sleep (both when you first go to sleep AND when you wake up and sleep in the middle of the night), say affirmations such as, "I WILL Astral Project, I WILL be conscious while my physical body sleeps, I WILL travel to where I intend to go". You must feel this EMOTIONALLY, feel it in your body, desire it, crave it, WILL it. Do not say it robotically; believe every word wholeheartedly as if you are praying. ***OPTIONAL:*** Alternatively, if you are comfortable with mentally reciting mantras as you sleep; I was taught by my Gnostic teacher the following mantra which I have had much success with: “FA RA ON” - lull yourself to sleep with while reciting this. Without knowing how, you will spontaneously find yourself in the Astral plane at some point during sleep. It is pronounced; “FFFFAAAA… RRRRAAAA… OOOONNNN” (separated by a breath between each syllable).
5. Either as you fall to sleep or in the middle of sleep, you may begin to feel vibrations, DO NOT panic or get over-excited. Be like a Zen monk; go with the flow, remember your goal. You will eventually be able to simply WILL yourself out of your body, to simply get up, float up, roll out, or intend to stand in a location in your room.
6. Once you're out, DO NOT overthink anything, remain like a Zen monk and just get outside your house; that is your mission. Carry out your will, your desire. Achieve what you set out to do. Or, if you had no prior intent, simply just walk - explore and appreciate your surroundings; visual appreciation keeps you grounded. The Astral plane is VISION of LIGHT after all; your third eye is active in varying degrees in these moments, visually and peripherally take in the environment! Don't forget to breathe and stay calm. Enjoy your experience.
7. When you wake up, don't move; replay the entire experience in your memory in detail, then write it all down or record it as a voice memo. If you didn't Astral project, you must still record ALL of your dreams, no matter how insignificant you think they are. Every dream and every detail you manage to recall, the stronger you enforce your connection to the non-physical dimension and memory of it, massively boosting your chances of Astral projection in the future.
8. Above all - if nothing happens, that is FINE! Every attempt is progress, whether on a conscious or unconscious level. Your subconscious learns no matter what, success or not. You have to be patient; this is crucial. We sleep every day, which means you have every day to practice. The average lifespan is 70+ years old; there are 25550 days in 70 years, so you have at least 25550 attempts. Every night you don't do it is a night wasted; what else will you do when you go to sleep? Nothing. You might as well Astral project and make better use of your time. If you are truly patient and have faith that you WILL eventually Astral project, I guarantee it will happen.

If you have questions, it's best to first watch the video I just made where I talk much more in-depth about every step! Timestamps are in the description: [https://youtu.be/j6PJypJ-wtU](https://youtu.be/j6PJypJ-wtU)

***Good luck!***I’ve been trying since my last encounter with an astral being ( [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/qoymzl/i_met_a_spirit_of_some_sort_and_i_still_cant_wrap/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) ) to make contact again. I was able to again tonight. 

This time while meditating I drifted in and out of some very vivid dreams. When I was about to give in and fall asleep I reached the vibratory stage, and I was propelled upward very quickly. I do not believe this was a full AP since I wasn’t able to observe my physical body or fly around or anything. I just ended up back in a similar “room” to the one I was in last time. This time there was no ball of light, but I did hear a distinct voice. This time it was male and it said “I  am only speaking like this because you want me to. Everything I will show you has no use for words.” And that was the last time I heard any “speaking.” 

I felt an intense rush wash over me, like pins and needles, and it felt like my mind was being given images. It was a sort of astral PowerPoint presentation. This is where it gets hard to describe things because there was absolutely no communication using words, just very vivid and detailed images.  

Essentially I was shown that each of us has a sort of “life bubble” around us that can have only two charges: negative or positive. When it’s positively charged you literally give some sort of life force energy to EVERYTHING around you, whether you see it as being alive or not. When this bubble is negatively charged you actually diminish the life force of everything around you, like a void. 

One example that was used was between two people, one of them is negatively charged, and the other is positively charged. The one who is positively charged intrinsically sees their inability to give life force to the other as a sort of failure, and this causes their life force to diminish. With inanimate objects, it seemed like they actually decay faster around negatively charged bubbles. 

This was all presented in great detail, and as if this is a fundamental aspect of how the universe works. 

Take it for what you will, and keep those bubbles positively charged.Recently my 6 year old daughter causally told me that she sometimes floats to her ceiling when she's sleeping and then goes to the living room and back. I calmly said that I thought that was pretty cool and asked her if she was frightened. She shrugged and said no. Relieved that she wasn't scared by this, I said "I wish I could do that. It sounds pretty neat. But please be careful." She then said "Well, if you can't do it, that's probably because you don't have the 5 powers." Immediately I got goosebumps and calmly asked her to explain them, but she just kind of got distracted by something else, and I didn't push it. But it sent chills down my spine, and I'm not sure if they were good chills or bad chills. She's so little... Could she really be doing this, or were they just really vivid dreams? Should I help guide her? Or just let her experience it in her own way? Or advise that she try to not do it at all (not that she's actually trying to, but still)? A mother's instinct is to protect her children. That's where my heart is right now. But I don't want her to feel like I'm mad or judging her either. Perhaps I'm thinking too much into it. And I have no idea what the "5 powers" thing is about, but that part is very curious indeed. 🤔Was on second date and felt the connection and good vibes just like the first date when we were talking about yoga, meditation, manifestations, and spirituality but when I brought up AP and my experience with OOBE traveling to a different world, I felt the change in vibe and buzz kill. Got ghosted after that, oh well.All is consciousness. I have found that nightly exercise of the third eye results in better control during AP. Last night I went to sleep at 9pm. Woke myself at 12am, and meditated on my third eye for 2 hours not trying to project but simply sending energy there. I spent the first 30 minutes “knowing” each portion and each organ of my body and thanking it. Then moved to my head and mentally massaged my eyes and then my pineal gland. Then I breathed into the pineal gland sending white gold energy from my sacrum up through my body into my pineal gland with each in-breath allowing the energy to recycle back to my sacrum with each out breath. The last hour was a powerful AP that came effortlessly and allowed me to inspect the Engine of Time. A series of stacked gears made of pink-purple translucent fluid in which all of time interacts with itself in many dimensions (some looping back). The gears were not all turning in the same direction and there were some gears that floated outside but near the Engine.

Interestingly the Engine was inside a white room. That room was outside the infinity of time, but was an architectural infinity unto itself. 

After the spiritual experience I returned to my body, removed my eye cover and opened my eyes. I allowed myself to process the vision. I felt like there was more. I replaced the eye cover and breathed into my pineal gland again to thank it for the work. It felt a little sore. I mentally massaged it again and sent it the sound of a crowd cheering. Immediately I projected again into a room full of people having sex. I was one of the people. I felt a huge amount of energy being directed from my pineal gland into my sacrum. The tingling warm glow flowed down my core and energized my sacrum so much that I was immediately overcome with lust and desire for sex. 

I removed my eye cover, hit the bathroom and then gently woke the real life woman in my bed. 

Then we... [REDACTED]

;)My friend died in a violent car accident several years ago. She was only 18 and about to go to college. We weren’t very close, and I hadn’t thought about her in years until this happened recently.

This experience happened when I was lucid dreaming on a regular basis, and practicing lucid dreaming. When I woke up, I thought it was just a weird dream. But the more I think about it, I believe I AP’ed and visited her in the astral realm. 

In my Dream/AP, I was in a college dorm room filled with other girls. Girls were laying on beds doing their nails, hair, and other girly college dorm room things. I remember being so confused at why I was there. Suddenly, I saw my dead friend in front of me. Her face was absolutely mortified when she saw me. She looked like she was in extreme shock, her mouth and eyes wide open. I was looking into her eyes so clearly, and I said to her, “Wait a minute...you’re dead, but I can see you and feel you”, and I then touched her arm. She floated away from me so fast in that moment, and I remember having chills all throughout my body. I was so scared, I even remember thinking “Wow, I was just so scared but I didn’t wake up”. Then I returned to my body. 

Could I have visited my friend in the astral realm? Is she stuck there? Did she create a realm where she could live the college experience she was robbed of in our world? The whole thing boggles my mind. 

The dream was SO vivid and unlike any other lucid dream I had. I felt completely conscious, like I could think clearly and say exactly what I wanted to, although looking back I definitely wish I had said something different to her. 

Would love some input on this.I was hesitant on bringing up any of my thoughts of astral projection to my therapist but my last session I said fuck it and talked about it. It came up because I was telling her about how Ive been having nightmares and how I get sleep paralysis frequently. I also told her how I get a lot of anxiety when I find myself in that state between being awake and asleep were normal reality and dream state are mixed together. I decided to then tell her that I purposely try to induce that state to try and astral project and she seemed surprised but actually very interested in it. And I told her that I thought that my nightmares and my anxiety in that between state was from my attempts at ap and that fear of uncertainty. She actually told me that I should keep trying and that if I keep pushing my anxiety in that state could go away by progressing and just getting used to that state. I was surprised she was very open to it and made it seem like it could very well be possible. So Im going to keep pushing.I've been listening to the Hemi Sync Gateway tapes for the past two weeks with no results. Today I have a day off, so I decided to stay in my bed a little longer and almost fell asleep again around 11am but then it happened, I spontaneously flew out of my body. I had two very brief OBEs three years ago and knew what to expect, I started making out the outlines of my room and tried moving my astral body, it was such a cool experience and lasted longer than the previous ones, but the moment I flew out of my house and my vision started getting clearer, the fucking phone rang. I usually get like 3 calls a month and have sound turned off most of the time but of course that was not the case this time. My boss just wanted to check if I'll be able to come this friday. I'm so angry at myself right now for ruining my first OBE that lasted more than 5 seconds

So yeah, don't forget to turn off your phoneHey there so I’m in absolute disbelief as I’m writing this. I think I astral projected for the first time without actively meaning too. I’d been reading up on it for a while now and then I watched Behind her eyes on Netflix..

So I stayed up late last night didn’t fall asleep til 3, then woke up around 7 super thirsty, went to get some water and tried to fall back asleep. I was like half asleep half awake and then I was in these weird lucid dream and in the dream I made myself count my fingers (the technique from the show) and I saw that I had 6 fingers so I knew I was dreaming. Then I created a door (also the technique from the show) and walked through it. 

At that point I became semi conscious of my body again and it started intensely vibrating and tingling, the weirdest feeling ever. Then I felt a lift out of my body and I saw this beautiful purple light and next thing I know I’m freaking flying in the cosmos and looking down at planet earth. I didn’t know where to go or what to do and got kinda freaked out so then I was just like “go back to my body” tried moving and opening my eyes and it didn’t work. Panicked a bit said “go back to my body” again and then I jolted up gasping for breath. Counted my fingers again there was 5, I was back, phew !

Anyways that was the trippiest and most beautiful and unexpected thing to happen to me in a long time. Had to share here as everyone in my life would think I’m crazy lol.That voice in your head that is constantly trying to make you feel  guilty or ashamed about everything

The egoic-mind won't ever stop shaming and making you feel guilty. It is something that inevitably happens once you set on to the journey of coming to a place of no-ego.

Once you realize the ego is not something you wish to serve, it will make you "obey" by making you feel undesired emotions, sensations, thoughts, it will do everything possible to make you submit to the mind once again and bring you back into unconsciousness where the mind has control over what is going on.

The one thing you need to realize is that the mind is not going to work for you, ever, you must make it work for you. You do that by understanding the mechanisms of the mind, how it is trying to manipulate you, how it is trying to take your power from you or rather, making you believe that you have no power over the mind. Hence this post.

You believe you have no power over these thoughts, emotions, sensations. It is not true. They are merely temporary clouds coming and going in the unchanging sky that you are.

Now that you are aware of these tricks of the egoic-mind to keep pulling you back into this old personal identity of yours which was used to shaming and guilting itself (It is based on the conditioning you received as a child, teenager and adult up until this day), you were taught to feel shame and guilt, therefore your mind does these things on auto-pilot out of habit.

This is an old program of thoughts running in your consciousness right now, and you believe this program has anything to do with you. You take it personally and you feel like you need to "deal" with it. In fact, there is nothing to deal with. The only thing you need to realize is that you are the ever-present awareness.  Be aware of all of these things appearing to happen within your being, it is not personal, it is just the conditioning you were made to believe in and abide by that instilled the belief that you are only this body and mind.

Be aware that you are not these thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, desires, attachments, memories and imagination that originate by believing you are only this body and mind and personal identity.

Notice how the mind even says "You are useless" or "You should feel shame", it is saying "You" not "I", it is clearly something that is not you, funny, isn't it? None of these thoughts, sensations and emotions produced by your mind have anything to do with you, and yet it seems like they are paralyzing you in this way. What they are paralyzing is only the personal identity, the pure awareness that you are is not affected.

Realize that the personal identity can't exist without you. You are the one beyond the personal identity which is aware of the personal identity and its limitations. That which is aware of the personal identity and its functioning is infinite and unlimited. Stay in the place of seeing in which you observe with detachment the personal identity but  you do not log into it and identify as it. Stay aware of yourself being the consciousness in which all these clouds come and go but do not be attached to any of them. Let them flow.

You exist with nothing at all, yet the mind can't exist without you. You need to see clearly who is the bigger one, you need to understand that the mind has absolutely 0 power over you, you are that infinite in which it is appearing and is perceived by, the only way for it to appear as if the mind has power is to belief in the MERE THOUGHT that says it has power. That is on you to discern what is true and what is just a cloud.

Be aware of being aware of these thoughts, emotions, sensations. Do not identify your self as these clouds, as they are not what you are. They have nothing to do with you. They are simply a kind of conditioning program that you are aware of. Be aware of being aware of that. That is the greatest power you have, the power to be your self, the stillness that is deep within any kind of storm and any kind of bullshit the mind is trying to "attack" you with. What you truly are, is that stillness in fact.

Take a look, who is the mind trying to offend? It is trying to offend the personal identity you believed your self to be, once you completely dis-identify from the past, and understand that it has nothing to do with you now, you will be able to completely carry on with your life without any real importance given to the mind. The mind can't attack you, it can only attack an idea of who you believe your self to be.

If you understand, directly experience the fact that you are nothing, the mind is incapable of touching you. It can try and offend that old identity for how long it wants to, but it has nothing to do with you. Let it be. Keep on being your self. There is no need to give importance, significance or trying to figure out why or for how long this is going to happen.

They are just thoughts, emotions and sensations. You were conditioned to believe this has some kind of meaning and that these are important but this is just another conditioned belief. You in fact have nothing to do with these natural phenomena that occur within consciousness. You are the universal consciousness it self, the no-thing aware of being aware, you are beyond all phenomena which appear to arise and then disappear.

Notice how everything in your life comes and goes, except that one thing. That no-thing. Which is you.

Identity, emotions, sensations, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires they all come, and they all go. They are unstable, inconsistent, and none of them are you. As you are the one aware of being aware of all of these phenomena. You can't be something that is coming and going. You are the no-thing aware of that.

You are beyond all these phenomena, do not believe the emotions, sensations and thoughts that make you think you are scared. You can't be scared. It is only a thought saying "You are scared" or "I am scared" disguising itself to be you, but it is not you, it is just the mind trying to lure you back into unconsciousness. Overcome that, Transcend that, realize what you truly are. The being itself. The awareness aware of itself.

 [https://www.instagram.com/iameternallife/](https://www.instagram.com/iameternallife/) So last night I had my first AP experience. It wasn’t really anything special, but about 3 minutes ago, I left a 1 hour long AP in tears.

First of all, thanks to this [this video](https://youtu.be/_Mei-xh4Ans) for coaching me and guiding me thru this. 

I started off in a beautiful field. I was surrounded by red, blue, and yellow wildflowers. Many lavender butterflies spun around me, as they left twinkles behind them. Then this being spoke to me. It was a light purple light in the shape of a girl. She took my hand and we floated from the field into outer space. We danced together and spun around for a long time amongst the stars. 

Oddly enough, more lavender butterflies appeared and guided us into a massive golden portal. We entered the portal and there were beams of pastel light all around us.

We sunk down into a green garden with TONS of flowers, streams, and fruits. The scent of orange and jasmine was EVERYWHERE!!! We then were led into this beautiful town filled with pastel buildings. We went into this marble cathedral and we were in a big, baby blue room. I was led into a LAVENDER room with a white table and a white candle sitting in it. I looked around and saw images of myself in past lives.

In one of the paintings, I was a knight and the love of my life was this beautiful red headed maiden. We stood on a cobblestone balcony under the moonlight and held each other. In another painting, I saw a huge red lily. I asked the keeper (watch the guided meditation) why a lily was there, and he explained that I was once a red stargazer lily that was planted outside of a secluded temple in china. AND THEN the maiden from my OTHER past life carried a lily in her hair. THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER PAST LIFE! I was a King Charles Cavalier dog named who’s owner was Marie. I lived in France in the 1810s and we would sit next to a stream surrounded by LILYS AND LAVENDER!!! And THEN Marie had a baby girl named LILY!!!

After this, my lilac spirit guide took me outside. She held me tightly and a screen appeared. It was her life. Here’s where it gets...emotional. 

She was my best friend in elementary school. Unfortunately she had cancer, and passed away when I was 12. I always felt a certain connection to her, but I didn’t know that she was my spirit guide. I started bawling my eyes out. We hugged and the lavender butterflies reappeared and led us back out of the town.

I open my eyes. I’m still crying at this point.

I’m honestly shocked. This was such a touching experience. I hope that I can visit her again because that truly was what I needed in life. 🦋I love and miss you forever Abella. I will always remember you dancing to Dinosaur and the princess hat 💜

UPDATE:
So what’s with the lilac and lavender? Well...I found the one picture I had of her...look at the background of [this photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/UJgPYTO)She loved butterflies. She loved them. I was talking to her, even though she passed away, I was somehow having a conversation. She told me where she was and the next thing I know, I see I'm on a hill, surrounded by trees, cherry blossoms, and flowers and butterflies. Monarch butterflies, Swallowtails, etc. I remember it was sunrise, and sun was peeking through the trees. She was sitting next to me, wearing this really pastel pink dress.So, this has to be one of my fondest interactions between myself, and other beings. 

I went into the meditation with the hopes of making contact with the same beings that I had previously made contact with. But, I got something much more exciting 

First, I began with my normal meditation techniques, using a custom made crystal grid antenna array consisting of high-vibrational crystals, such as Rose Quartz, Moldavite, Amethyst, Merlinite, Aura Quartz, Selenite, and Lapis, along with others. 

Once I had that set up, I began to clear my mind,  ground myself, and expand my conciousness so that I can become one with my surrounding energies and the universe itself. Once I felt ready, I pushed my conciousness far out into the universe, so that I can meet with anyone who was willing to do the same. I showed whoever was listening, visions of our solar system and our planets, which planet I was on, and where my home was. I introduced myself, and my family, and I began to show them who we were, and what we are like. 

By this time in my meditation, I could feel myself bleeding out and becoming One with everything. I was everything, and everything was me. I could see every single vein in my body exploding with blue and white energy, flowing down into the earth, and spreading out, touching everything and everyone. I could see and feel everything that was, is, and ever will be within this existence. 

All of a sudden, I was shown what looked like a galaxy of some sort. Medium sized. Very white/sandy color. Cloudy, with a bright center, and two smaller arms. Like shark fin shaped, spiral galaxy arms. 

I was then shown a star system, with 4 inner planets, 1 large, possibly gaseous planet with a ring, and maybe 2 smaller outer planets. They were all spinning around this star very fast. 

The main planet, (which I believe to be theirs), was very Earth sized, with a sandy, brown color, with patches of blue and green. Their atmosphere looked blue/purple, and very thin. 

Next, I saw a family of beings, wearing what looked like very thin, fine, blue/white, silk dress/robes. They had what looked like pale purple skin. They were very happy, and loving. They had large, flat, angular faces, and had what looked like normal sized eyes, noses, mouths. Very human, yet very not. 

I was then shown what I now know to be a memories of these beings. I saw these strange hills, of blue/green and orange land. I saw a medium sized planet or moon, just over the hill, with a small, very dim star about 2/3 the brightness of our own, surrounded in a dense cloud of sandy white dust. 

I saw homes in the side of of the hills, and they looked like domed, honeycomb-like structures. Very simple, and made out of a strange, pasty/white cement like stone? I have no idea what material it actually was, that's just my best description. I saw the beings standing in front of their home, almost like a family portrait. They were happy, and all looking at me, like they were introducing themselves to me, or perhaps saying goodbye, I'm not sure. They smiled at each other, then all smiled at me. The taller beings in the back, with their hands on the shoulders of what I assume was their children in front of them. 

After it happened, and after I returned, I was left with a sense of awe, and a longing to go back. 

This experience has been absolutely breathtaking, and I myself have trouble knowing it happened. I shared my life and location, and someone across the universe shared theirs. 

I was truly an amazing experience, and I can't imagine what else is out there for me to explore.When I was about 3 - 4 years old I was still wetting the bed pretty frequently. I thought my experience was normal untill something happened in my mid 20s that gave me, what I would call, an epiphany.

As a kid I would wake up in the middle of the night because I needed to relieve myself. I would stand up, walk to the toilet, sit down to pee (I was a tiny kid) and wake up in my bed. My wet bed.

This happened about once a, week for almost two years. (let's just say my parents were at their wits end haha) The other nights I simply never had to pee. When I did have to thou I'd go to the WC and wake up in my wet bed.

Now a couple of years ago I started getting into Astral projection and after month of practice and a couple of aledged psychedelic trips and an extensive dream journal I had my first full on OBE.

The feeling was... Strange. Like I've been there before. And suddenly it dawned on me. I walked to the toilet and sat down, not to pee - but to remember.

Apparently as a kid I'd just leave my body behind to go pee, not realizing it, untill I'd wake up in a wet bed.

It was so freaking obvious yet I never made the connection untill that day. The experience was so similar, something went "Ohhhhhh" in my head and I finally understood. My mom died when I was turning 5 and the dreams and bed wetting stopped right then. 

Anyway, that's enough weirdness from me for today I think.Imagine my surprise, after working torwards astral projection for over a year now and telling no one, that my 9 year old daughter has been doing it for years on accident. A few months back while getting ready for bed i asked her to take the top bunk because my mom was staying over to which my daughter replied, might as well i always feel like im up there anyways. She told me she always feels like she is floating up against the ceiling as she is falling asleep. We talked briefly about astral projection, as I don't want to overwhelm her or scare her. I did tell her though if she sat up in her dream she might be able to control her dreams. 
Today she described to me an experiance she had this morning. She said she woke up earlier than everyone else but her eyes were not open. She sat up in her bed and saw her whole room, but in the middle of her room there was a tiny image of her room within. She said like a miniature bedroom, inside of her bedroom. She looked down into it and it began to spin. 
Has anyone else experienced anything like this?So this all occurred literally around 30 mins ago when I kept trying to go back to sleep but kept going into sleep paralysis.

 The first entity I made contact with was just whispering in my ear, and told me to "turn gay and watch the world burn down with her" lmao. I shook myself out of the sleep paralysis and then tried going back to sleep.

 I then went into sleep paralysis for a second time and I don't remember this entity contact too much, but I remember it was a very playful entity who kept making jokes with me ahaha. He was a bit upset since I couldn't understand a lot of what he was saying though since I think my telepathy skills are still very weak.

I then went into sleep paralysis again and asked to speak to the Galactic Federation. Now this is where shit gets crazy. I literally hear a phone line ringing in my head and an alien sounding entity answers and I literally can't understand a word he says. I tell him I can't understand him and he then he patches me through to a different entity who literally speaks perfect English and literally sounds like a human Female. She then asks me my full name and what planet I'm from and I tell her I'm from Earth. I can't remember a lot of the stuff she was saying since it's all pretty hazy but she told me that she was gonna be astrally teleporting me to the Federation Headquarters and I could literally feel myself switching fucking dimensions and vibrating really hard. She told me this process was gonna take a few minutes so just stay calm and hold on tight. I was getting pretty scared so I decided to shake myself out of the paralysis again.

 I then tried going back asleep and then I met a shadow entity who was pretty scary. At first, I was obviously quite scared but then instead I decided to hug the entity and show it love instead of fear. Then it literally turns into pure light and then turns into a female who looks like a Human. She told me she was just testing me then taught me the process on how to exit my body but it took a while since I could only understand around 75% of what she was saying. (The rest just sounded like gibberish.) The process I used was I used my astral arms to extend up in front of my body and grab an invisible ledge type of thing to pull myself out. Once I exited my body I was teleported into what seemed to be this entities house (it just looked like a modern styled apartment) and she was just asking me lots of questions about my life and what I do. (I remember she had a little boy there who appeared to be her son too) This didn't last very long since she then said I had to leave since she had some work to do. She then guided me on how to return to my body, but I couldn't really understand her but I managed to figure it out on my own lol. Overall, fucking crazy experience and I still can't fucking believe this shit is actually realOK so I've been doing an experiment where I try to open my astral eyes and see the astral plane without projecting. My theory is that's how psychics might see things: their astral eyes are open. So far it's going pretty well! I've been able to (slowly) walk around places with my eyes closed while seeing the energies of things around me.

You know how you can see objects in the astral plane that aren't there IRL? It's because they used to be there IRL. They were there long enough that they made an imprint on that spot and their energies are still lingering there after they're gone. Years ago I had a chair in my room that never got used, just sat there. Eventually I donated it and forgot about it. This morning I was walking around my room doing this experiment and I saw the chair still there. I was confused and took a minute to remember what it was. There are other 'objects' in my house with the same story. It's harder to see things that move than things that stay still. If I look at a ceiling fan it's just a round haze with no individual blades. Trees look like shapeless blurs on sticks. Things moving across a space, like cars driving by, seem invisible. So yeah don't try this near traffic.

I'm stoked! This is really cool! I'm gonna keep practicing until my astral vision is as close to perfect as it can get. Highly recommend you guys check this out for yourselves. If you do, lmk how it went.I have always been fascinated with Nikola Tesla. I am an electrical engineer with a physics degree as well so naturally someone like Tesla would be an inspiration to me. 

A few of his quotes that has always stuck with me:

“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.”

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.”

His theory with 3,6,9 and how they are fourth dimensional numbers that come from “higher energy”. 
“If you knew the magnificence of 3 6 and 9, you would have a key to the universe.”


Then I learned about AP and found this sub. I’ve been reading a lot about AP here and around the internet and will one day do it myself. Things regarding stories about Tesla start making more sense, astral wise, and I can’t help but think Tesla was one who knew of and possibly practiced Astral Projection. 

Do I think this means I can be like Tesla? Absolutely not. But thinking and reading about all the stories on this sub makes me wonder if I could understand those types of answers when I am able to AP.

What are everyone’s thoughts regarding this theory?I have tried to listen to the tapes before, but nothing but a semi sleep happened. However, this time i put on nr.2 of the first CD and managed to do the practices better, my body started to vibrate and i just kept focusing on that until I eventually just rolled out of my body. 

I flew out of my body with speed and hit the roof and wall on the other side of my room, I must have intended and wanted too much to get out.. I try to slow down my speed with thought and it worked. I floated over to my window and had a look outside. A different vibe and environment, nicer and sunnier in a way than in awakened life. I also heard people and city noises around. I went outside and were about to jump of the balcony, but didn't have the courage. 

Cool that it worked so fast. There is something in me that makes me not want to try it again, or go too deep, the fear of the unknown perhaps.Hi everyone! After discovering this sub through the sleep paralysis sub, I have been trying to astral project for several months. After practicing meditation and trying to AP 2-3 times a week when going to sleep, I had only been able to get to a place where I was deeply relaxed and most of my body was numb, but no vibrations and I would always give up after 45 minutes and fall asleep. 

Today I was taking a nap (sleeping on my back), and when I woke up from the nap I realized I  was still partially asleep. I thought “this could be my opportunity to astral project”. So I let myself fall deeper back into sleep while just observing the process. I started to feel these very strong, fast, pulsating vibrations that I could feel throughout my whole body. I thought “okay I guess I should try and leave now”. 

At first I tried visualizing leaving my body, which didn’t work, so I actually leaned forward and tried to get up out of bed. It was extremely difficult, like I was being pulled back down into my body. Moving was really difficult, kind of like moving in sticky, slow motion. At first I thought “well maybe I’ve just woken myself up from getting out of bed” but I looked behind me and saw myself sleeping. 

I don’t know if I was able to fully separate from my body, as shortly after I got pulled back and woke up. The whole experience felt like it could have only lasted a minute. But this is a huge breakthrough for me and it shows me that I am capable of astral projecting! Thank you to the community for all the advice here, it’s helped me a lot. Hopefully I’ll have more stories to share in the future.I’ve been following this sub for awhile and this is my first time posting here. I just APed and I feel so stoked! Early this morning I decided to try and AP so I when I reached the vibrational stage I let myself be consumed by it and get stronger rather than fight it. (For a long time I would fight it because it usually sent me into sleep paralysis) The vibrations subsided and I felt light, so I swung my arms up and popped out of my body and felt myself float towards the ceiling. I reached out and touched the ceiling and could clearly feel the rough spackling. It was very solid and I wanted to go outside, so I pressed my forehead to the ceiling and slowly pushed my way out. When I looked out it was a whole different world. The building was right by the ocean and there were people and some kids playing on the beach. It was also sunny and bright and breezy. I flung myself out and started to plummet towards the ground. Just as I was about to hit I swooped back up and started flying off towards the ocean. The whole time this is happening, I’m just thinking how effing cool this is. Flying was a little difficult and I was surprised at the wind resistance that I felt. I tried to manifest a glider but couldn’t so I just held my arms out and pretended I was holding onto one. That seemed to help and I was able to turn better. Looking down, there were all these small islands and many of them had inhabitants. They looked stocky and not quite human. Kind of half human, half beetle and fully clothed. Some of them wore nice suits. Then the wind picked up and the residents on the islands started hurrying about like a storm was coming or something. Then I smelled smoke, similar to a campfire. I didn’t see a fire anywhere so my mind went to “what if my apartment is on fire?” So I slammed back to my body and got up. No fire, apartment was fine but when I looked down, there were a bunch of beetles crawling on the floor. I walked around and they were everywhere. My boyfriend wakes up and they are also in the bed. I’m thinking “something is not right” because the bed is in the wrong spot and the floors are hardwood instead of carpet. So I say out loud. “This isn’t real, this is a dream”. And I focus on waking up for real. Which I do after a moment. 
Infestation dream aside, I am so happy to have had that experience and I hope many more will follow. I want to thank you for reading and thank everyone on this sub for sharing your experiences. I really don’t think I could have done it without your help.I’ve astral projected my whole life since childhood. In that time I’ve had thousands of experiences including travels into the past, possible futures, and outer space. 

Note: I posted Part 1 over 200 days  ago, and it has earned over 800 thumbs up with close to 2000 comments! Since that first post on Reddit, I have written a number of other articles detailing my Astral time/space travels as well as “how to” information.

If anyone has any further questions about out-of-the-body travel, I’d be glad to do my best to answer them. My purpose in posting this information is to get more conscious AP’ers on the Astral Plane. I see this goal as my core life’s mission.

Check out my Astral Club YouTube Channel! https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZEAs an experienced Astral Projector for over 57 years I’ve enjoyed incredible Astral Journeys with such beauty and awesome majesty that the crude modern English language is scarcely sufficient to describe. However, there have been a small minority of trips that exposed me to dangers and traps that caused me a degree of trouble when I encountered them during an Astral Projection. Surprisingly to some, my list does NOT include non-human Astral denizens that seem to generate the most fear for new AP’ers. While these creatures do exist, they deserve an article all their own.

Hopefully, this list will help you to steer clear of these hazards to Astral Projectors so you don’t have to blunder into them like an idiot as I did!

1. High Voltage Substation and Power Generating Stations

On two separate occasions I had projections where I flew too near a high voltage substation and another time too near a power generating station. Both times I was drawn like iron filings to a strong magnet. Imagine how ridiculous and a little scared I felt being stuck in my Astral body to those powerful electro-magnetic sources! I couldn’t break free no matter how hard I tried. Only my Astral Cord recalling me to my physical body was able to rescue me from my embarrassing predicament.

My theory is that the Astral body must have some electro-magnetic properties that are attracted by very powerful artificially created energy fields.

2. Cemeteries

I recall energetically flying over the countryside having a ball when I suddenly encounter a cemetery. Instantly, like a plane whose engines just inexplicably shut down, I plummeted to the ground. Rising to my Astral feet I found myself surrounded by crosses and headstones. A heavy weight of sadness permeated the ground and my Astral body. Seeking escape, I thought about returning to my physical body and was rapidly retrieved.

Strong emotion, like sadness, can alter an environment. The Astral body is not immune from such a negative influence.

3. Battlefields and Places of Violent Death

Other places to avoid in the Astral body are places where many people met violent ends, like battlefields or mass disasters. As a history buff I had visited the Gettysburg battlefield many time before in my dense meat form. However, when I did so in the Astral I was shot down from the sky as suddenly as I had been over the large cemetery. It took a supreme effort of will to enable me to put one transparent foot in front of the other to survey the field. The colors of gray and black were dominant, and sadness and depression filled the atmosphere. I saw several soldiers wondering about the battlefield while another stood at attention, forever on watch. I tried to engage the guard in a conversation, but he just looked through me as if I wasn’t even there!

4. Ultra Secret Military Bases

On a regular basis I have students ask me if I’ve tried to check out highly secret military bases. Usually the questions are connected to crashed alien craft or hidden away alien themselves. I answer that I have checked out one or two such secure places, but tell them to beware. I have encountered both electro-magnetic countermeasures which repelled me from entering a building, and in another instance I found myself drawn into an electronic trap that formed a containment room for intruding Astral spies. While I was there I was bombarded with some type of radiation that felt like ravenous ants were crawling and nibbling on every inch of my body. I’m not sure how long that went on, but when the power was switched off I got the hell out of there and never returned!

5. Bars, Drug Houses, Sex Clubs

I’m not your Dad, nor your mother. As the kids say, “you do you”. All I can tell you is that visiting bars, places where drug users frequent, and sex clubs can be a very negative experience energetically in the Astral. The energy being emitted is of a very dense, lower Astral variety. If you’re looking for a spiritually uplifting experience, these ain’t the places to visit during your Astral Projection. Many of the spirits in bars are people who died, but still crave their physical addictions, or merely the thrill of sex and violence and maybe some rock n roll! I believe that at least some of the bad behavior of drunk patrons is influenced by the unseen dead inhabiting bars and clubs.

If you have any questions ask away. I’ll try my best to answer all questions!

If interested, I have a Youtube Channel “Astral Club” https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE. Check it out if you want to see some interesting Astral Projection videos.About an hour ago I had a terrifying experience that was in line with astral projection. I was (and am still, to a degree) a skeptic. If you are also a skeptic I encourage you to read my background, but feel free to just jump to the experience as well. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Background:

I came across this subreddit last year, and before then I had never heard of astral projection. Reading the posts here as someone that has never heard of this practice before was really strange. People here were claiming an array of impossible sounding experiences that I'm sure you're familiar with if you have been here for any length of time.

I more or less wrote this subreddit off as fantasy. I thought it was fascinating that so many people seemed to tell these stories, and I certainly wanted to believe that astral projection was real, but ultimately I was convinced that these experiences amounted to nothing more than either lucid dreams or crazy delusions (sounds a bit harsh but that's the outsider perspective). As 2020 progressed I would occasionally visit this subreddit and read some of the posts. The posts in this subreddit were intriguing for someone who wanted to believe (but heavily doubted) that we are more than just our physical bodies.

As the year went on I began to have strange dreams. They were never convincing on their own, but taken together they were enough to unsettle me and make me take note. About once every two months I would have a dream that seemed in line with some of the posts here. I understood these dreams as my subconscious being influenced by this subreddit, and I more or less left it at that. Still, I was unnerved.

I've been able to occasionally lucid dream for at least 5 years now. Over that period of time I have had probably about 20-30 lucid dreams, so I am familiar with what they feel like. In university I study psychology and I am all too aware of how our unconscious desires (like me wanting evidence for the soul for example) can influence dreams and experiences. I know exactly how manipulative our minds can be to convince us of something we want to believe. Now with that, let me get into my experience.

AP Experience:

Last night I had strange dreams again. They were mostly normal and pretty tame, but they unsettled me enough to keep me up between 4:00 - 5:00am this morning watching stuff on my phone. Eventually I fell back asleep, and fell into another dream.

This dream took place in my basement. I was watching a three man band record songs (no clue why, I have no experience with this and I know no one who plays in a band). One of the people in that band was a cousin I haven't seen for about ten years. Eventually I get up and leave the band to perform, but I accidentally shut off the light on my way up the stairs. I hear the guitarist miss a note because of this,   so I felt like I wanted to apologize. In the dream I knew I had to leave soon (as in, go somewhere else, not leave the dream) so I was going to write the band an apology note that they would see when they came upstairs. When I tried to find something to scribble on I heard the band come upstairs, and we all sat down at the table.

I apologized to the guitarist (whose name was Steven, he was balding and overweight with a green golf shirt on, again I have no idea as I know no one like this at all). He was totally cool with it though, he said not to worry about it. Then the conversation changed and my cousin started talking about how his daughter was helping out with the band. Here is where I became lucid.

I recognized that I was in a dream, so I took note of my surroundings. They seemed real to me, and so I got up and placed both hands on the table. Again I was blown away by how real the table felt, how the shape matched my actual dinner table. After this though I fell through the ground into a black void. I was still conscious though, and I felt no fear at this point. Thinking back to this subreddit, I remembered someone saying that the trick to turn a lucid dream into an AP was to demand clarity. After this I said "Clarity", and that's when my experience happened.

Immediately I could feel a rush of conscious awareness, exactly like waking up. Lucid dreams always seem to lack some aspect of consciousness, and this was a change I could feel instantly.  I felt myself moving forward, and all around me I could see what I described at the time as being a galaxy. In retrospect I'm not sure if it was a galaxy, but I know I could see space and stars.

I felt terrified, and the depth of that fear is hard to properly describe. I could not believe what I was seeing and experiencing. I could not believe how aware I was of this experience. I could not believe that my consciousness could go from a lucid state to this new state. So with that I proceeded to IMEDIATELY will myself back to my body.

Instantly (I know I'm saying these words a lot, but it's hard to describe it in words, there really doesn't seem to be a jump in time between my experience there and here) I was back in my bedroom, and I could feel my heart hammering. Traces of what I had seen lingered. I was staring up into the ceiling and I could see what appeared to be a brush stroke of the galaxy and stars, and strangely there was also this third appendage there. This appendage I still have no idea about. It seemed to come from the roof and touch my chest area. It wasn't a rope like others have described, it was more like...some sort of arm or something? No clue.

Anyway after laying in my bed and seeing that I just shut my eyes and hoped for it to be over. I felt the sleep paralysis subside, and I rolled over and lay for a moment thinking about what had just happened. My eyes even filled up with tears at this point although to be honest I have no idea why, could be a response to the fear I felt or just the overwhelming experience. I rolled over and furiously noted the details down of the experience in my phone for me to recount later.

The fear didn't really leave me, and I'm still extremely unsettled thinking about it even an hour and a half later. I did notice that in retrospect I am trying to justify this experience and make it seem less real than it was. My rational mind is telling me "of course that didn't happen, you simply must be wrong about the details" even though that doesn't line up with my experience. The brain's defense mechanism seems to go both ways, both trying to have me believe in something I could not otherwise believe in, and to convince me that what I experienced must have been different than how it actually was.

That's my experience. I remain somewhat skeptical but the one thing I can't get over was that this actually was different from a lucid dream. That's what every post says here, and it's one of the most commonly asked questions (ie "wasn't that just a lucid dream?"). This was one thing I never even slightly believed because of how easy it is to convince yourself that what you experienced wasn't a lucid dream when you desperately want that to be the case. After experiencing it though, I can tell you that the difference between the two was immediate, and out of everything I experienced tonight this is by far the most terrifying thing. If what happened to me was AP, then you really do have to experience it to believe it if you are a skeptic. It's worth mentioning too that I'm terrible at controlling my lucid dreams. Only about one in five I can get something I actually want in the dream (only ever tried it with sex and flying), and even then I tend to immediately wake up due to excitement. The difference between my typical lucid dream and this experience is something I just can't get over. Also the feeling of abject terror. I am well acquainted with nightmares and never once have I felt as terrified in/after those as I did tonight.

Thanks for reading all that. If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them below. I'm still in total disbelief that this happened.I've been practicing astral projection for about 5-6 years now, and as I start practicing more consistently again I thought why not help any beginners here, as the topics on this sub-reddit are more questions than guides which makes it a bit diffcult for newcomers to find help.

This technique is called Phasing, and I'll tell you why. When you separate, what happens is that your consciousness is perceiving another reality/dimension/vibrational frequency which are all the same thing. Astral projection in a nutshell is transferring your consciousness from the dense 3rd dimension here in waking life in our physical body to the less dense, thought-responsive 4th dimension (which is where dreams, concensus realities like heaven and hell, and the astral realms are manifested at)

So by understanding this fact along with the knowledge of existence being in a vibrational universe where everything that has and will come into being is made of a frequency/sound/electromagnetic pattern which are all the same thing, called sacred geometry (sacred meaning "fixed", not holy but the symmetrical building blocks of our universe that holds everything together), you can start to understand that astral projecting/astral traveling at will is only a matter of being able to switch perspectives, tuning into another vibrational frequency like a radio.

Switching your perspective from the physical (feeling your body in bed for example) to the non-physical (which is what every ap technique is, whether it's the rope technique or the roll out method you are still trying to maintain awareness with the non-physical until the point of separation) is the key to having a successful projection. So it's all about relaxing the body deep enough then finding the method that is most comfortable for you that can hold your attention after relaxation so you don't lose awareness and fall asleep. This is just one of those many techniques, but a very effective one.

1. Close your eyes tightly for a few seconds, it'll make it easier to keep your eyes shut during the practice.

2. Close your eyes and look ahead into the darkness. while still keeping your gaze roughly centered, notice the changes you see but keep them in your peripheral vision (blobs of light, abstract shadows, etc.)

3. Try making out whatever you see in the darkness for as long as you can, it's similar to watching the clouds and seeing what it looks like, just keep doing this as the blackness behind your eyelids change in form, shape, and color.

4. What will happen at some point during this is that you'll feel a "shift" in awareness. You have phased, meaning you are in the non-physical. The blackness behind your eyelids will feel now like a dark room you could walk in like Eleven from Stranger Things, this is called 3D Blackness/The Void State/Mind Awake Body Asleep/Monroe's Focus 10. When you reach this state, simply get up or visualize your destination and you'll have fully separated.

You can do this technique at anytime, any place (if noise doesn't bother you which is why daily meditation comes in handy), if you want to project at that moment. What keeps most people from projecting is the self-doubt, "is this working? am I doing it right? this is stupid but i'll do it anyway" which creates a mental block preventing you from separating, because your focus is still on the physical when practicing after repeatedly distracting yourself. Just focus on your breathing until your body feels numb, then do a separation technique and everything else will fall into place naturally. Good luck

Astral Hack: If you want this process to go even faster, look up with your eyes closed as high as you possibly can without straining and do the relaxation and technique looking in that direction the entire time (normally this is at the center of your forehead). This works because it tricks your body into falling asleep faster as it's where your eyes naturally roll back to when asleep. Doing it this way can make you separate in 15 minutes depending on how good you are at relaxating the body (I do either Wim Hof breathing or 3-3-3 breathing through the nose; inhale 3 seconds, hold 3 seconds, exhale 3 seconds until my body feels numb then I switch to slow breathing)**The Post-sleep method:**

If you're interested in exploring non-ordinary states such as out-body-experiences and have been attempting a conscious projection from the waking state, you might have already discovered that trying to maintain awareness when entering into sleep is one of the most difficult methods to start with. Relaxing the body, quieting the mind, and accessing an altered state deep enough for a projection requires a lengthy preparation routine, and it's not uncommon for the first signs of vibrations to immediately disappear as soon as you notice them. I understand how frustrating this can be because of the effort spent trying to access this state. It can make projection seem impossible and give you the impression that you do not possess the capability. You have most likely been taught that you need to maintain awareness for a prolonged period while you're body gradually falls asleep and walk this tightrope between consciousness and unconsciousness. I've experienced this frustration on countless occasions and easily wasted 1-2 hours trying to reach that perfect state. The result was only continual failure.

However, there is a far easier method, a method that can bring you success in not months, but days. Personally, it is something I succeeded with unintentionally and once I experienced it, I never looked back. I came to learn it was referred to as the "dream-exit-induced lucid dream").  Several astral projection authors have already mentioned this approach and advised the trainee to attempt a projection not when entering sleep, but instantly AFTER waking up from a dream. 

1. "*Trial will prove convincingly that, if consciousness begins to function a little too strongly, after the subconscious has effected a slight separation, on entering sleep, the phantom is more apt to coincide again than it would be in a similar condition when waking from sleep. In other words,* ***most projections will be more successful consciously - if they begin in the hypnagogic state***, ***when coming out of sleep.*** " Sylvan Muldoon, 1929, Projection of the Astral Body
2. "*To enter the relaxation state full of energy and wakefulness is great insurance for maintaining conscious control.* ***The best approach to take in the early attempts at the Condition D exercise is to*** ***start it immediately after you wake up from a nap*** ***or a night's sleep***\*. *Start the exercise before you move around in bed physically, while your body is still relaxed from sleep and your mind is fully alert*".  Robert Monroe, 1971, Journeys Out Of The Body
3. "*Student,* ***you must not move when you wake up... be motionless and practice a retrospective exercise*** *in order to remember your internal experiences: remember where you were, what places you visited while in the astral body, what you did, what you saw, etc. This practice must be performed daily without ever becoming weary*." Samael Aun Weor - 26 techniques for Astral Projection.
4. "*Cycles of indirect techniques. This is a* ***universal and most effective*** *way to obtain a lucid dream experience. It has been refined by the OOBE Research Center’s work with thousands of people all over the world.* ***The secret to indirect techniques is to perform them upon awakening, when the human brain is physiologically quite close to lucid dreaming state***\*, *or still in it*". -- The Phase, by Michael Raduga, who has created quite possibly the most thorough and comprehensive instruction manual for this particular method.
5. "*Research has shown that most of us awaken and then quickly return to sleep a number of times during the night. However,* ***these spontaneous awakenings provide one of the most useful opportunities for entering into lucid dreams***\*. *We may learn that deliberately re-entering a dream after one of these intervals can lead to a lucid dream, but if we don't remember to do so, we will continually miss these opportunities. The clarity and stability of a mind trained in shamatha is a reliable basis for remembering to take these opportunities*". B. Alan Wallace, Dreaming Yourself Awake
6. "*If you* ***remain perfectly motionless upon waking from a lucid (or nonlucid) dream*** *and deeply relax your body, there is a good chance that REM will reassert itself and you will have an opportunity to enter a lucid dream consciously.*" Stephen LaBerge, Exploring The World of Lucid Dreaming

&#x200B;

I include these quotes from lucid dream authors for the reason that they have clearly recommended an identical approach to enter a non-physical reality and for the fact that a lucid dream can be easily and swiftly converted into an astral projection.

The reason a projection can occur quite readily after awakening from a dream can be attributed to several factors:

* After a sleep cycle, the physical body is naturally in a deep, deep state of relaxation. Thus, a thorough and prolonged muscle relaxation routine at this time isn't necessary.
* The mind is considerably more relaxed and capable of focus soon after a sleep cycle instead of before one. If you have attempted to induce a projection when entering sleep, you will probably know the drowsiness experienced when trying to maintain awareness on the borderland state can be overwhelming and often cause you to fall asleep, sabotaging your projection success. On the other hand, the drowsiness is significantly reduced after a natural awakening from a sleep cycle. The less drowsiness that is present, the more focus you will have. As you already know, this focus is pivotal for retaining enough awareness to both induce and remember the projection. 
* In the moments after awakening from a sleep cycle, the "momentum" from the dream world you've just exited is still present to a degree and greatly helps when trying to project the astral body. This is because, during the dream state, the etheric/astral body has already been active to an extent and is, therefore, less attached to the physical body. After awakening from a dream, the looseness and flexibility of the astral body caused by several sleep cycles can be used greatly to your advantage. The more time spent awake, the more firmly the astral body will be connected to the physical, which means the more effort required to cause an exteriorisation. It would be beneficial to spend the least amount of time awake as possible. 
* Fortunately, a fleeting, unhelpful, distracting thought in this state doesn't appear to be enough to sabotage your projection attempts. This appears to be due to the condition of the brain in the moments after an awakening - mainly, its naturally deeply relaxed state following several hours of sleep and the recent occurrence of a dream which hasn't alerted the mind too greatly to a point where it cannot regain an altered state. When trying to project entering sleep, if you have been awake for a lengthy period, such as 45-60 minutes, and then attempted a projection, both the physical body and mind tend to be too alert to allow a quick and easy transition.
* The reason it is more advisable to make your projection attempts between the hours of 5-7 am is that sleep naturally tends to be lighter in the rapid eye movement stages. The brain is more active and able to wake up with less sloth and drowsiness, but it is also deeply rested from several hours of sleep, making it both easier to remember and execute an intention. Furthermore, during the phase of rapid eye movement, the temperature of the body drops to its lowest point during sleep. Voluntary muscles of the body, such as the arm and leg muscles, deeply relax to the point of near immobility and a transient paralysis occurs, which is categorised as "R.E.M. atonia." (This is to prevent the body from physically performing actions played out in dreams). To summarise, R.E.M. puts the sleeper in a condition with a simultaneously rested, alert brain and largely paralysed body - in other words, the mind-awake-body-asleep state. This deepest state of physical body relaxation which exists immediately after a dream is what facilitates the release of the finer body.

&#x200B;

I would not claim that there is one supreme method for every individual, but if you are a frustrated beginner who has not yet succeeded you could project very quickly if you consider this method. Before you retire to sleep, affirm either mentally or out-loud that "*the next time I wake up I will remain still*", "*I will wake up consciously after my next dream",* and/or "*the next time I wake up I will instantly remember to attempt to astral project*". Alternatively, you can affirm this throughout the day and visualise yourself succeeding in waking up and remembering your goal. Intention is the key to success with this approach, and as long as your desire is sufficient there will be a moment when you actually wake up from a dream with your body lying still and your objective firmly in mind.

Lying still isn't a prerequisite for making this method work, but it certainly helps. However, I must still stress that even if you have moved a great deal, even for as long as 60 seconds, and you believe you have remembered your intention far too late, you must still perform an exit technique. Although you may not succeed with this particular attempt, it is likely you will wake up from your next sleep cycle 1-2 hours later and perform an exit technique far sooner, as soon as 30 seconds, in an almost automatic, involuntarily manner. It could take you by surprise. This is because you have set your intention and it isn't very difficult to remember a recent action. Perform an exit technique with every early morning awakening, from the hours of 5-7 am, whether you have moved or been awake. It is possible to project if you have been awake as long as three minutes before you remember to perform your technique. Every automatic and consistent repetition of exteriorisation techniques will take you a step closer to achieving your goal the next time you awaken. Eventually, you will notice that you can project even if you have moved your physical body. If you have spent 3-4 minutes attempting to project and success hasn't been attained, simply fall back to sleep and make your attempt on either the next awakening or night.

As the days pass, you'll find yourself remembering your goal earlier and earlier with each successive night. At first, upon awakening, it may take 3 minutes to remember your intention; but gradually, as each night passes, the time spent recalling your intention will rapidly start to decrease. It could reduce to 2 minutes on your third night, then down to 1 minute on your fourth night, and finally, as soon as the 7th day, you'll be remembering within 20-30 seconds upon awakening what you are supposed to do. In this state, you are primed for a non-physical experience. It's that state closely resembling the famed mind-awake-body-asleep condition, but this time it's something that has presented itself to you The optimal time period to attempt a projection would be in the early morning hours - usually, from 5-7 am. Once you realise this is a state you don't necessarily have to chase, but instead, only to have to recognise, you will understand why the authors I have quoted recommend it. 

It is often advised to develop awareness when entering sleep, or while dreaming, but it is not as often suggested to develop awareness upon awakening. We aren't taught to cultivate this skill, but I would like to recommend it for anyone who hasn't experienced a projection because it is perfectly achievable to train yourself to make your projection attempt during the first 10-45 seconds after waking up from a sleep cycle. The window to another dimension is wide open at this time.

Once you are able to wake up with a calm, focused mind, you have a number of techniques ready at your disposal:

&#x200B;

**TECHNIQUES:**

* **RE-ENTRY into the ASTRAL PLANE**: As Samael Aun Weor suggested, recall the dream world you just left and imagine with all your senses that you are back in that scene. You must feel that you involved in the scene, not simply observing. You have to feel the ground you were walking on and objects you are holding with absolute conviction and belief that it is truly occurring. If you maintain this for 30 seconds, there is a high possibility that you will start to feel a shift and notice tingling sensations in your body. Once you detect this, all thoughts must be focused on that dream scene and nothing else. The success of this method depends directly on your ability to concentrate. Absolute concentration only needs to be maintained for 10-12 seconds before the projection is complete. Ignore any roaring sounds or peculiar sensations. Do not direct any thoughts towards the physical body or try to analyse what is occurring. My first ever wake-induced projection occurred with this method, and it was completely unintentional. I had simply woken from a pleasant dream, visualised it in my mind, wished it was still continuing, and pretended I was involved in the scene again. To my astoundment, this brief act of role-playing induced the vibrations state in a matter of seconds and caused an unbelievably swift entry into the non-physical plane with full and alert awareness. If you imagine the dream scene you left and feel patchy, incomplete vibrations at any point, it is a sign that a projection is possible and you must intensify your visualisations with all your will power. Also, you can imagine an entirely new dream scene and still successfully transfer your consciousness to that environment.

&#x200B;

* **MOTION**: A movement involving motion, such as spinning, skiing, swaying, rocking, lifting, bouncing, swimming, climbing a rope, or exploding into the sky can cause an exteriorisation of the etheric/astral body. A sign that the technique of your choice is working would be a stretching feeling at the navel, almost as if your abdomen is being split in half. Observe if your physical body encounters signs of tingling, similar to a pins and needles sensation and the chill-like sensation that washes over your body during a dreadful moment when watching a movie. If you choose to use Robert Bruce's **rope method**, ensure that you do not neglect to involve your other senses, such as smell. For an example, give the rope a smell of rubber. If you need some assistance, look for something in the house which smells like rubber, such as a new plastic dumbbell weight tightener. Smell this, pause, and remember the smell. You will need to recreate it for later. Including this smell of rubber can be extremely helpful in your projection attempt.

&#x200B;

>Do not only feel the rough material of the rope in your hand, but also vividly feel the twisting, circular pattern of the rope. Feel its braided, wave-like strands dig into your skin. To intensify this, imagine the rope leaves splinters on the upper palms of your hands as you're climbing it. When one hand grabs the rope, pull it down and actually feel your elbow bend. Then feel your elbow bend on the other arm when you reach out for the rope to take you higher. Climb the rope at a brisk pace. Pretend you are in a race with someone else, and if you find yourself losing concentration at any point, you can add counting along with your action to stop any nonsensical words entering your mind. Count 1 when you reach the left arm, then count 2 when the reach with the right arm, then count 3 when you reach with the left arm again, and then count 4 when you grab the rope with the right arm again. This counting keeps your mind focused on the task.  
>  
>The point of including smell, touch and sight is to completely immerse yourself into this rope. Although the rope is imaginary, the effect it is having on your astral body is *absolutely real*. As you are concentrating, a sign that you applying stress on the finer body is a brief moment of feeling less solid. This might occur for only a second or two, but the sensation is similar to moving at a speed so fast your body feels as if it has become wind. Once this is felt, definitely continue with your rope-climing action. Soon, if you've maintained the action, a moment will come when the body muscles will suddenly tense up, as if they are all being clenched at the exact same time.  The bed will now start to feel like it is rumbling, as if there is a small engine underneath the mattress. Do not pay any attention to these sensations  
>  
>If a sensation of this kind is felt, instantly amplify the rope or (whatever motion technique) you are using. If you enjoy imagining you are bouncing, then feel the hard surface of your ceiling hit your scalp with every bounce. If you prefer to imagine yourself spinning while standing in one spot, feel the rush of air on your forearms and shoulders. Keep spinning and include rapid movement of the waist, which should cause it to tense up  These motion techniques can also be performed in cycles, alternating between them every 3-5 seconds as Michael Raduga has suggested, or every 30-60 seconds as Robert Bruce recommends in his recent interview with LifeLessons.com, Part 3. There is also the option of not alternating at all. A projection is perfectly possible if you choose to use only one technique, such as climbing a rope, continuously for 90 seconds until the vibration state is reached. You can always choose one technique to focus on, or select a new one each day.  
>  
>These motion techniques might cause a feeling of sudden vertigo and the sense of your body rising up from the bed, sometimes as little as 6 inches. It may be accompanied by brief dizziness after the vibrations subside, but this will not persist. It is likely that motion techniques will result in a live projection, where you will be transported not to an unfamiliar destination, but your own bedroom or wherever you made the projection attempt. After all the sensations and sounds have disappeared,  you will sense your room, see it emerge out of a kind of mist, and feel your bed again as if nothing happened.  
>  
>Grogginess and heaviness will be felt, and the initial identical appearance of your bedroom can easily fool you into thinking you have failed, so the performance of a reality/state check at this point is critical. The environment will feel and look so solid you will scarcely believe that you have succeeded. In the beginning, it may be necessary to perform more than one state check. The grogginess/heaviness, dizziness, and apparent solidity of the surrounding environment are all hallmarks of a classic etheric projection. The vibrations associated with this type of projection are liable to be more crude, harsh and dramatic. Personally, I would ascribe this to the thick, solid denseness of the etheric body. I have found this vibration state similar to the rumbling felt on a train, and even the vibration that occurs when holding an active game console controller, except it would be felt throughout the entire body.

&#x200B;

* **LOCATION**: You can also imagine you are in your downstairs kitchen, or even bathroom. Once again, imagine that you are in your room of choice while engaging all your senses as actively as possible. For example, when you first wake up, promptly imagine that you are in your kitchen and washing a plate. If you need to improve your tactile sensing ability, rehearse this and take 5 minutes out of your day to actually run the tap water on your physical hand. Then sit down immediately, and recall the sensations. Pretend that your hands are still under the tap. Remember the way you felt its cold, numbing fluid on your hands, and the way your fingers felt almost glued together on impact. Take note of the way the water slides over your wrists and the ticklish feeling that accompanied it. Practice this, at a point during the day, without any distraction for 60 seconds. Then, if necessary, repeat the process of running the tap water on your hands, then immediately sitting down in a chair with your eyes closed, and re-enact that same action in your mind. This will greatly increase your tactile sensing ability because of it's relatively easy to recall a sensation you just experienced. Go back and forth with this for as many times as necessary until you can recall that sensation at will. Then, to intensify the realism of your imagination exercise, now include the smells of any aromas nearby, and add the hearing the sounds that would be in that location, such as the refrigerator. You are convincing the mind that you are completely in that location. The more vividly you imagine this, the higher your chances of succeeding. Tactile sensing is usually more important than the visualisation of images when using this method, so it is not an issue if your visualisation skills are substandard. It appears that the further distance involved, the more pressure that will be applied on the etheric/astral body. The kind of projection associated with this method appears to occur more slowly than other methods. Just maintain concentration and exclude all unrelated thoughts until the transition is complete. You will find yourself in a peculiar in-between state for some moments, where at one point you feel your normal bed, and a second later you can actually see yourself in the environment you are imagining. It is not uncommon to keep switching back and forth for 12-15 second before the process is complete.

&#x200B;

* **VIBRATION IN THE EARS**: Many authorities have stated that there exists a humming or hissing sound throughout the body, and if the trainee is quiet and relaxed enough to notice it, a projection can occur. This sound genuinely does exist, and if you prefer to avoid any techniques involving imagination or sense of movement, this technique can cause an exteriorisation by simply remaining still, placing your attention on your eardrums, and blocking out all distracting thoughts. If, after waking up from a sleep cycle, you maintain absolute focus on your ears, as if trying to detect your own heartbeat, you will likely soon feel a metallic, electric-like rush of energy surge through your body accompanied by a sizzling sound. Esotericists label it the sound of Brahma. I found it to be identical to the sound heard on the overhead train power lines. it is also not uncommon to hear a whooshing sound in the ear. Once you have detected any sound or sensation, ensure the body remains perfectly still, and focus only on intensifying this sound. It will feel as if your body is rapidly starting to melt and disintegrate into dust or water, and you will find yourself in a non-physical reality. I have found this method is ideal if the projector awakens lying in a prone position. Convince your mind that this sound is the only thing that exists in the universe, and you are waiting to detect it. This mindset will help to prevent your attention from wandering. If the sound isn't detected within 1-3 minutes, you can fall asleep again and attempt to capture it the next time you awaken.

&#x200B;

* **TAROT CARD PORTAL**: If you are someone who works with symbols and enjoys a visualisation technique that doesn't involve imagining movement, this technique could be suitable. Imagining a tarot card in the moments after waking up from a dream can be surprisingly effective and might shock you when it generates the vibrations. The image you visualise seems to take on a life of its own. Successful execution of this technique will usually result in a direct transition into the astral plane, bypassing the etheric transit area where you perceive your room, body and local surroundings. When wide awake in the daytime, Take a tarot card of your choice, for example, The World. Have a deep, intense look at this card, notice all its properties: the red lion in the bottom right corner, the eagle above it, the red bull at the bottom left, the human face on top, and the pose which the main character holds in the middle of the card. Keep the card in your hand, close your eyes and recreate an image of the card again in your mind. If necessary, verbally repeat the properties as a list and recreate the red lion in the bottom right corner, and everything else, to the best of your abilities. After 30 seconds of this, open your eyes, and look at the card again. Try to observe what details you missed. Stare at the card for 20 seconds, then close your eyes again to recreate the image. Once you have been able to recall at least 80% of the card's contents with ease - and this will not take long - you will have gained enough familiarity with the card to recall its image instantly after waking up from a sleep cycle. The daytime preparation is the key to the success of this technique.

When you have managed to wake up from a dream and remember your intention to project, immediately recreate the image of the tarot card in your mind. Do this whether you have moved your physical body or not. Imagine the card in as much detail as possible and visualise as a large, three-dimensional doorway in front of you. Make it as real as you possibly can for only 10-40 seconds.

Immediately picture the red lion in the bottom right part of your vision. See its eyes looking at you. Notice its mane. Observe its lines and wrinkles. Involving this much detail will give the image life.

Then promptly imagine the bull in the bottom left of your vision screen. Gradually maintain these two images. One might disappear while another remains, and probably the image that remains will alternate between the two, but you must persist. It will help to trace an imaginary finger and draw the lion and then the bull. Take your imaginary finger and repeatedly use a circular motion to recreate the image. Use your finger over and over again to draw the heads of these two creatures. Repeat this until you can comfortably retain the images of just these two creates first.

Ensure to keep the images in place and not allow them to drift upwards or sideways. Every time the images morph, bring them back to their proper position.

With this method, you do not need extensive training in maintaining a single image in your mind without distraction for a prolonged period. As I have already emphasised, you do not need to perform a strenuous concentration/meditation session to enter an altered state deep enough where projection is possible. The state already exists as soon as you wake up. You might have been taught that before a person begins having projections they need to maintain an image, such as a candle, in their mind as a way of mastering the basics first, and then projection can be attempted at a later stage after some experience. Once again, this is not true. You can have an astral projection very soon without extensive training in meditation. The post-sleep state is ripe with natural potentiality, and any imaginative exercise at that time can propel you so rapidly into that specific dimension as to be breathtaking. If you have done this with sincerity, the vibrations will hit you with a force, suddenness, and intensity. If you feel burning in your body, ignore this and direct all of your attention on to the image. Allow the vibrations to become as strong as they need to be without acknowledging them. The card will now rush towards you like a train and you will actually enter into its environment. Once you have succeeded, slowly look at your surroundings, remind yourself that you are now in your astral body on the astral plane, and affirm that you are and will remain completely emotionally calm.

The tarot seems to be especially effective in the post-sleep state because of its ethereal properties. Any otherworldly image you visualise contains a current of its own which acts like a magnet, pulling you into its realm. Combine this with the momentum of the dream world you have just exited, and the potential power of this method becomes clear.

If you remember to remain still and execute a technique, the entire projection process - waking up from the dream, inducing the vibrational state, and projecting to a non-physical environment - can happen very quickly, as quickly as 30 seconds in total. You will have bypassed the lengthy preparation period that involves deliberately relaxing the body, quiescing the mind, and trying to attain the delicate balance between alertness and drowsiness.  In the beginning, it is ideal for a projection to occur as quickly as possible when the mind is as fresh as possible.

Do not feel discouraged if a technique is successful on one day but not the next. This is why it is beneficial to have a selection of techniques. For some unknown reason, a technique can work for three successive nights, but not be effective again until another month has passed. It does not mean your abilities have deteriorated or the success of the technique was due to luck. It just might be worth considering the subtle energies in the body do not remain in an identical state day after day. Learning to regularly use different techniques will also develop versatility.

If you find that when making your attempts to project you are lying there with nothing happening, despite using several exteriorisation techniques, this is an indication that you haven't reached a state deep enough for a transition to occur. The very act of analysing or checking whether you have reached that state yet in the middle of an attempt is enough to completely halt any progress. Holding the mind completely clear of any distracting thoughts for a prolonged period is challenging. It requires considerable skill and experience in meditation. Inducing a projection when entering sleep is certainly achievable after practice, but a projection from the waking state can be induced far quicker when exiting sleep because the mind does not need to maintain absolute concentration for as long as it would be normally required with the traditional method of descending into sleep. Whereas a clear or blank mind would need to be sustained for anywhere between 3-10 minutes when entering sleep, this same state of mind would need to be sustained for less than 45 seconds if you chose to make an attempt immediately after a dream. The conditions that need to be met for a projection when entering sleep are possibly far too demanding for a beginner. The conditions necessary for a projection when coming out of sleep are not as exacting, and with experience, you will notice that you can project when you have moved an arm or had a distracting thought. You can quickly regain your focus and induce the vibrations. This doesn't appear to be anywhere near as easy when using the opposite approach of entering sleep.

The other issue you might have already experienced is the fatigue associated with trying to induce a projection as you are entering sleep. The sheer amount of time spent quiescing the mind and relaxing the body can actually exhaust the trainee, and you may find that just at the precise moment your body was ready to project, your mind was too exhausted from all the minutes you spent descending into the state and fighting off sleep.

**What to do if you are stuck in the vibration state:**

Should you find yourself stuck in the vibration state, the usual cause for this is a lack of sufficient intensity in the technique you are employing. You have stimulated the astral body enough to initiate a take-off, but more power needs to be gathered to complete the take-off.  If this ever does occur and you feel the full, powerful vibration in your body but without actually transitioning, you only need to apply more force.

For example, if you are imagining you are climbing a rope, then feel vibrations but cannot complete the process, intensify this by imagining you are in a rocket shooting up into the sky. The motion of a rocket is obviously more extreme than simply climbing a rope. Do not be afraid to imagine something this extreme. If you are unable to move beyond the vibration state and feel that you spending long periods contained in that state, this extreme kind of movement would be required.

Your etheric/astral body will respond to this sudden and extreme increase in imagined intensity by immediately deepening the vibration state and then rapidly exteriorising out of its shell. You will actually feel an upwards movement at this point similar to the sensation when inside an elevator which travels to a higher floor.

Imagine that you are in this rocket which endlessly keeps travelling higher and higher into the atmosphere. When you believe this rocket has reached as high as it can go, you continue at travel even higher. Believe with all conviction that you are inside this rocket that will not stop going upwards. You will know you are doing this with enough intensity when you feel your teeth begin to clench and your torso is becoming tense, as if it is being stretched out.

&#x200B;

**Etheric Substance:**

There is another area I would like to touch on. From my perspective, it appears an additional reason a conscious, wake-induced projection can seem very challenging is due to an etheric substance attached to our energy bodies. I have detected it during an etheric projection and I believe it is responsible not only for the extreme grogginess that is felt during that type of experience, but also for the relatively short distance that can be travelled during an etheric projection. I've noticed that can be sensed as a heavy tingling and ticklish sensation all over the arms, legs and back while out of body. It can also be detected when passing through walls because of the gel-like sensation that is experienced. This substance seems to act as a kind of glue, keeping the energetic bodies closely attached the physical and making the projection process more wearisome than we would like it to be.

This etheric substance can be loosened, however, with a daily practice routine. A consistent, daily rehearsal of the exteriorisation methods I mentioned earlier could pay dividends. If possible, take 20-30 minutes of your day and rehearse several motion techniques, in bed with your eyes closed. Imagine you are climbing a rope, then 30 seconds later, imagine you are swimming, then 30 seconds later, imagine you are on a ride at a theme park. The alternating of motion techniques will not only help to maintain concentration and relieve boredom, but it is actually stimulating and developing the astral body to a degree. Additionally, it loosens the etheric matter which is firmly attached to the energy and physical bodies. You will likely feel intermittent tingling in your body during your daytime practice. This is a positive sign and indicates that the energetic bodies are being loosened  In your daytime attempts, you are not trying to induce a projection. It is a rehearsal. This preparation vastly increases the likelihood of success when you make your attempts at night because you are stimulating and developing aspects of the energy body, while and at the same refining your the ability to execute a technique in trance.

If you have found that after several weeks you aren't succeeding in waking up and promptly executing an exit technique, begin by first improving your dream recall. Every time you wake up, just lie in your bed and recall the last scene you were involved in. Learn to do this comfortably and consistently. Write down all the dreams you have, if you don't do this already. Once you have accomplished this, then progress to waking up and just simply observing the hypnopompic images that play out. Do this for several days. This is an invaluable practice because you are training the brain to wake up with intent and perform a deliberate action, instead of waking up idly with an absent mind. This only needs to be performed for a few minutes. 

When you observe the images, take it a step further and then just manipulate the images for a few seconds. This will become easier the more often you practice. Observing images in the moments after waking is far, far easier than observing them when you are ready to fall asleep. You are not attempting to project into the images. The purpose is to become familiar with the altered state that exists after sleeping. Once you can do this comfortably for a few minutes, you can then progress to making an actual projection attempt on your next awakening.

In summary, if results haven't been forthcoming, return to the basics:

* \- **Wake up, lie still, and simply remember the dream you just left**. Write it down. This is to cultivate the habit of waking up with a goal in mind.
* \- Then **wake up, lie still and see what images reveal themselves in your mind's eye**. This is to develop the ability to recognise the twilight state that exists in the moments after awakening.
* \- Once you are **waking up and remembering to perform this action, you can now set your intention to perform an exteriorisation technique** the next time you wake up from a sleep cycle.

If you haven't succeeded after consistent, daily practice, there is always the option of using an alarm or android app that can activate for 3-5 seconds and then switch off by itself. Every time you hear or feel this alarm waking you up, practice lying still, even if you moved. Soon, after using this item, you won't need it. You are just using it to develop an automatic reaction.

If you are intent on experiencing a full, conscious projection from the waking state, I believe this method can help you achieve your goals. If after many attempts you haven't succeeded, you could post a detailed breakdown of the specific obstacle you face and I would do my best to offer some help, and many posters on this forum who have already recommended this approach have also provided priceless videos, links, and tips on this method, which you might be able to find in the search option.

**Method Summary:**

1. The objective is simple - to wake up from a dream and promptly become aware of the fact.
2. Just before you retire to sleep, set the intention to wake up, preferably without moving, in the last 2 hours of your sleep schedule. Truly believe that at one point during the night/early morning you will wake up and instantly aim to induce a projection.
3. Wait for an awakening to occur between the hours of 5-7 am. Once you realise you are in bed, remember your goal, which is to enter a non-physical reality.
4. Instantly perform an exteriorisation technique, regardless of whether you have physically moved or not.
5. Your technique can be to either re-create the dream scene you just exited, use a motion technique (such as climbing a rope), or imagine you are immersed in another environment nearby (such as your kitchen). Either alternate the techniques or focus on just one.
6. Be prepared for any tingling sensations, metallic-like sounds, or strange images. This is the vibration state you are about to enter.
7. If sensations are felt, immediately intensify the technique you are using to fully establish the vibration state by involving all senses to an even greater degree. Narrow ALL thoughts on this single technique and nothing else for 10-20 seconds.
8. After 10-30 seconds of being immersed in the vibration state, wait for an environment to emerge, which can be either a familiar or unfamiliar location, depending on the technique you executed.
9. When the vibrations have ceased, perform at least one state check to confirm you have transitioned from the physical body to the non-physical body.I've had sleep paralysis well over a thousand times and this is my experience. I hope it can help some of you.

Sleep Paralysis is only scary because you're scared, you feed it fear and it becomes worse but it's all because of your fear.

Sleep paralysis is there for your protection, it's your guardian angel against self-inflicted harm caused by acting out your dreams.

When the fear is gone it turns into a wonderful experience of joy and a great launching pad into lucid dreams.

Sleep paralysis is a blessing in disguise, the fear is a challenge you need to deal and when you overcome it you'll have grown as a person and oneironaut.

Conquer the fear, take control over your sleep paralysis and travel the dream worlds.

Well first what do I do when sp happens? What I do now is to relax into them, place and focus on them and mentally surf the waves of vibration.

But to get to this point I've spent many many sp in fear because I didn't know what was happening and I too saw "demons" and felt "evil presences" but this was because I didn't know that I was the one creating everything through my fear of it. Nothing scary you experience is real, it's all a manifestation of your emotions.

The key here is reducing the fear and going in with a positive mindset.

I'll try to explain why it's often scary because if you understand how it works then there's no reason to be scared of it.

For most people, me included, the reason why sp is often a scary experience at first is because of the mindset. It's often because of two things. It can be because you've read about all the scary things you'll experience during sp. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because then you'll say that you had a scary experience and then you give someone the same mindset and so it repeats over and over again with new people reading about it.

The second way generally, for people that never heard about sp before is the primal Fear of the unknown(Fotu) and the brain making assumptions. This is multilayered and affects everything to some degree. So, it often happens when it's dark in the room. Fotu. You discover that you can't move, and it's dark. Your mind tries to find an explanation and what it comes up with is that something must be holding you down, it focuses on that and suddenly you can see or see some evil thing holding you down. You mind creates something that will match what you're feeling. If you fear this imaginary(but very realistic) thing then your mind makes it even scarier and so you have an negative spiral of fear that amplifies itself each time.

Realizing that nothing you are seeing is real and its just your mind and imagination playing tricks on you, combined with the understanding that sleep paralysis is there to protect you. It made my experience of it much less scary, and I realized that was because I no longer feared it as much. And that realization itself, every time made the experience less scary and more positive.

After a while the fear was all gone and now without the scary things there to bother me I instead starting feeling excited about experiencing it and now instead I was in a positive spiral that made the experience better and better each time. So unless I'm stressed and feeling bad already I almost never experience sleep paralysis as a bad anymore.

Now it's no longer an exhausting experience that ruins my day but instead it's a great experience that actually gives me a boost of energy and a good mood for several hours if not the whole day after it happens.I read in this sub yesterday that somehow eating banans right before going to sleep increases your chances of AP/LD that night. and it just happens that I was going to sleep that night and in a table close to me there was a banana so i said why the fvck not 🤷‍♂️. I ate it,  slept around 11. woke up at 3:45 went to bathroom stayed awake a little bit then around 5:30 i became sleepy as hell so I went to bed. Somehow, when I went to sleep this time, I got my first ever AP experience lol it was very short and lasted maybe just 10s but it WAS an AP. after feeling paralyzed and feeling the vibrations I tried to AP and then felt like I was going out of my body from my legs, felt my legs started floating above me but I couldn't make all of my "soul" out so I just gave up.
worth noting that this happened to me 6 hours after eating the banan so i don't know if it's just a coincidence ( i don't think so I tried a lot for a month to AP but i never succeeded like this time ) or after the 6hrs the banan somehow released its magic in my brain lmaoI don’t even know where to start. I just projected for the first time. I’m absolutely terrified. I had never purposely tried doing it, I’ve just been researching it for a while and was very skeptical about the whole thing but always told myself if I became aware of the opportunity at the right time I’d try and take it. 
As a skeptic, I’ve always kept the comments in the back of my head from you guys saying that when it happens YOU WILL KNOW. And holy crap you guys are right. NO DOUBT.
I’m definitely in shock right now. I think it’s scary for me because I still don’t understand it. I definitely won’t attempt it again until I’m better educated. I’m afraid to tell anyone close to me cause they’ll probably just think I’m crazy.
So I’ll explain how it went down.
I was very clearly lucid dreaming. I don’t sleep well from about 1:30 am on. I go in and out and am restless. So back to lucid dreaming. I’m in what I think was some kind of nursing home. I don’t have a reason for being there. I get these small white granules on my hands, like little tiny white beads that in my dream I think are a cleaning agent so I go to rinse them off in a sink and as I’m washing my hands I notice how detailed everything is around me so I focus harder and start inspecting a plant next to me. I’m blown away by the detail and suddenly remember everything I’ve been reading about astral projection. So I essentially (no way to even explain how) mentally willed myself out of my body. I just said “okay, leave your body”
The “vibrations” took over which I felt strongly in my back and shoulders and upper arms and there I went, flew right out of my body. Whizzed around the room for a few seconds seemingly out of my control and Immediately saw an old women who scared the crap out of me AND I NOPED RIGHT OUT OF THAT. 
I’ve never been this scared in my life. I need guidance. I’m afraid of what this all means and to be frank about it I’m afraid of what my mind is capable of. 
I really need to speak with someone who is experienced with this and can help me channel the positive side of all this. I have so many questions. 
Please, please. I need help with all this.# ROLL OUT and GET THE HELL OUT METHOD OF ASTRAL PROJECTION!

I developed this method as a kid to astral project. I think you'll find it a lot easier than some of the other complicated techniques out there.

1. Surround yourself with Astral Projection topics. Read books by Robert Monroe and other astral projectors. Watch Youtube videos on the topic.
2. Give yourself pre-sleep suggestions as you fall asleep. I would use the following. "Tonight as I fall asleep my mind will come awake. I will go where I wish to go, do what I wish to do, and when I return I will have a full memory of the events that transpired". BE VISUAL and inject controlled EMOTIONS as you recite the words. The subconscious mind, which we are attempting to communicate with here, responds best to visual and emotional stimuli.
3. Eventually, you will find yourself awake in a paralyzed body. DO NOT PANIC! This is the VIBRATIONAL STATE. You'll know it because it feels like you put your finger in an electrical outlet.
4. WILL yourself to **ROLL OUT** of your body onto the floor. Don't try to control the roll. Just fall to the floor. Once out, **GET THE HELL OUT!** I have talked to too many new astral projectors who stayed and gawked at their sleeping bodies, only to be pulled back inside of their physical form in an instant. Crawl, walk, run as fast as you can to get as far away from your sleeping physical body as possible. In this way you can prolong your new and exciting astral projection.
5. Emotional Control - strong emotions of fear or excitement must be controlled. Otherwise, the astral cord that connects your astral self to your body will interpret these emotions as possible threats, and will pull you back into your hard physical shell.
6. Keep your phone by your bed to record your experiences as soon as you awake. Do NOT wait!
7. Lastly, be patient. I know the "Amazon Generation" wants everything NOW. However, AP will come when you are truly ready - and not a minute before. I guarantee it will be worth the wait!

I’ve started up a new Channel on YouTube, Astral Club [https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE](https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE)

I’ll be discussing astral projection topics, answering questions, talking about my experiences in Time and Space, and helping people to join the astral projection club!Many of you are reading the posts on this subreddit, just trying to get to the vibrational stage. There is a shift in what you need to think in order to actually astral project.

In order to actually astral project, you don't need to focus on getting vibrations, because you can project before then and sometimes they don't even occur.

You need to focus on getting outside of your body once you are able.

I can't tell you how many times I thought I was just relaxing, and I was actually able to astral project. I probably missed so many chances to astral project just because there were no vibrations or sounds.

If you want immediate results, wake up naturally and don't move. Stay conscious and try to astral project. You will immediately start astral projecting after a couple of seconds.

Do not make vibrations your goal, make astral projection your goal and you will achieve both.

edit: If you want to hear what you may hear during the vibrational stage, click [here](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526). And remember, vibrations don't always happen.I am so fucking excited. This literally JUST happened. I decided a few hours ago that I needed a nap, and I woke up about an hour ago to people coming home. At that point I thought 'now is the time to try it', and so I got comfortable and closed my eyes, cleared my mind - attempting to perform the exercises that have worked for me before - and within what felt like minutes, I could sense vibrations all over my body as usual, but this time they built and built and didn't stop, and it felt like I was enveloped in a cloud of this sensation. 

Then, all of a sudden, there was this loouuuud ringing - like a really high pitched gong that didn't fade away - in my right ear (I'm deaf in the left), and what sounded like a woman talking, saying "she's nearly there", and some more I couldn't make out, and the ringing continued and continued and then all of a sudden it stopped, and I could still feel the vibrations slightly and I realised I had my eyes open. But they were closed, I could feel it. I was seeing through my eyelids. I breathed in deep and it felt like I was filled with energy. It was so strange that I barely remembered to try separating, but try I did.

Sadly it felt like I was pinned to my bed, I could feel the sensation of my arm lifting as I tried to reach above me, and I attempted to roll out as well but to no effect. I was about to try the rope method when my vision began to fade around the edges. As it did, I felt the sensations dim and I could tell I had returned to my body. But I know I was close, I know this is real, if I can just reach out and grab the rope next time... The things I could do.So, basically, I told my roommate about Astral Projection, and that I’ve been trying to explore it recently more, as I’ve dealt with sleep paralysis all my life. He was not into the idea, said it was creepy, didn’t want to fuck with it at all. To each their own. The two of us live in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment (this is important for later).

Anyways, a week or two goes by, and one morning I wake up in a semi paralysis and I’m trying very hard to transfer to projection. It sort of works, but I feel like I’m getting thrown in every direction I try to go. Almost like my astral body is hammered drunk but wicked fast. Clumsy, flying in the direction I’m trying to go with little to no control. 

So, I want to see if my roommate is in his room and if I can see him sleep. I fly into the room for. a split second, see him, then kind of involuntarily am flung into the living room area then I wake up. 

Skip to a few days later, we’re both drinking and shooting the shit, talking about stuff and he asks how the projection is going. I say it’s going so so. It’s hard. He tells me that 2 days prior (the morning of my haphazard projection) he had sleep paralysis. And while he was in that state, I flew into his room, looked at him, then flew back out. 

I was like... what the fuck. So I explained what happened to me that VERY SAME MORNING. We really crossed paths. He was spooked to say the least, but clearly, this shows that people in that plane can interact and see one another

Whole thing blew my fucking mind.I was taking a nap and I started feeling like I was going to have an OBE.  But i could sense a negative entity standing over my bed.  I didn't want to fight it even though I'm very capable of doing so.  So I tried to not have an OBE.  But I was too tired so I just decided to have an OBE.  But I raised my vibration and radiated love.  I spun around and got up out of my physical body.  Then I floated toward the ceiling.  The negative entity was either gone or doing a very good job of hiding.  He probably didn't like the frequency I was on or the energy I was radiating.  

I started falling back down so I manifested a grappling gun and used it to pull myself up to the ceiling.  Then I manifested a jet pack and used it to go through the ceiling.  So that was interesting.  Manifesting objects isn't easy in the real time zone.  So I was impressed I was able to do it.  So if your being harassed by negative entities just raise your frequency and radiate love and they will flee.  It's the best way to get rid of them.This will teach you the easiest method for leaving your body and how to stay out longer while having the best possible experience.
 
You just need to train yourself to stay still upon awakening and mentally expect to exit your body and it will happen immediately. Understand this and you will have “Exits” rather than “Attempts”.  

The key is intent. You will find leaving your body as easy as getting up to use the bathroom, your intent determines the outcome. 

I have added information to my previous post to ensure the best possible experience. 

1  Go To Bed With Intent

Go to sleep with the intention of having OBE’s when you wake up throughout the night. Your intention needs to program your subconscious not to move or open your eyes upon awaking. It may take a couple days for the program to install but it works. 

2  Set Tasks

Know where you want to go before you sleep, focussing on tasks will help you stay out of your body longer. 

3  Natural Awakenings

Everybody wakes up approximately every 1.5 hours. Going to sleep with the intention of having OBE’s upon waking you to become aware of these awakenings. If you wake up super tired then go back to sleep and wait until you feel more rested, this will help with remembering your experiences. There is no need to set an alarm, you already set your intention. 

4  Roll Onto Your Back

It is helpful to roll onto your back if you think you may want to exit upon your next awakening. 

5  Don’t focus Too Much

Don’t focus your mind on anything, keep your mind blank. All you need is the intent to leave your body. The second you find yourself awake, before moving or opening your eyes, immediately sit up without using your muscles. 

The best way for me to example this is: Think about how it feels when you wake up in the middle of the night needing the bathroom, you sit up with a blank mind and the intent to go to the bathroom. This is exactly the same thing, it feels 100% the same, what changes the outcome is your intent!

6  Don’t Overthink Things

As long as your mind is blank and you have the intent to sit up in your astral form, separation should happen immediately and effortlessly. Don’t expect vibrations, it will feel like you sat up in your physical body. 

7  Multiple Exits

Each time you return to your body you are still in the state to exit. Unless you have incredible information that you can’t chance losing, such as visiting the Akashic Records, continue with the separation process again. The more experience you get the longer you will be able to stay away and your body will rest while you are gone. When the time comes where you are too awake to have anymore exits; don’t move and keep your eyes closed, if you do this you should easily be able to remember all your experiences, you are still in the state to access this information. Once you have full recollection write detailed notes on all your experiences!! 

8  High Frequency 

Your frequency should be high when you exit your body. Like attracts like, your experiences will match your frequency and expectations. 

Please always be supportive of others and include any details that might be helpful. 

Happy OBE’s 🌈✨🤩Havent had an experience like this in a very long time. I went out of my body and could not go back in/snap out of it, so it wasnt an accidental projection where u fall out of your body for no reason. Everything in my appartment looked the same except for my usual white door was a matalic black. So of course I interacted with it and behind the "door" was the inside of a huge spaceship. I was greeted by tall blue/pink aliens. 

I wanted to make this post because there were many humans on the ship with me, so maybe theres a chance one of you could've been there last night.Astral Projection and Lucid Dreaming are Meditative attainments classified under the art and science of Dream Yoga. For our ancestors, this was life, and it was normal to live in both the dream world and the living world. Dreams of these types are meant to fortify your waking missions and endeavors, to replay/connect your newly formed neurons, escape limitations of Earth-time, and to collect an array of spiritual information with your Electro-spiritual Form. I have used a mix of modern neuroscience, personal mastery, and correlations to our history to form my own understanding of attaining dream mastery.

Your Astral Body (Electro-spiritual Form) is independent of any mental faculties or disabilities. Your awareness and consciousness are literally powered and the cause of extra-dimensional forces that precede your human form You can be aware of your entire body and mind at once because there is a "field" of awareness that exists beyond the limitations of "speed" or "light". This form is beyond conception and remains dormant only because in our human realm, we are collectively "asleep" and unaware of our true nature. Hence the USA President, the majority of humans are low consciousness You are only required to quieten the waking functions of the Mind and Body to become aware of your true form. For "thinking" and whatnot is merely energy circulating within lobes of the brain designed for complex thought. When you reduce the energy of these areas, the energy collects into your outside form. The habit of "being awake" and "thinking" is extremely strong; the cause of ADHD or Restlessness. Meditation trains this same energy to recede from the troubled mentation and into the Astral Form. When focusing on the breath or a mantra, there may be background thoughts trying to grip your attention. The goal is to continue your efforts despite those tempting thoughts. The moment that you "forget you are meditating", and then return to your focus, is the bicep curl of meditation and strengthening the mind. Each time you remember and gently return (no frustration, simply returning), you strengthen your mind's ability to sustain focus. The more you do this action, the less you will forget, the stronger your meditation becomes. The gradual increase in strength is what the yogis and monks refer to as "attainments". You are literally attaining certain definable abilities of Consciousness; such as the ability to "never forget" that you are meditating, and then the inevitable states of bliss that fruit as consequence. Eventually, your consciousness can remain both detached from active thinking, and present within extra-dimensional realms. Hence LD and AP.

You can use this information to form your own method, but I'll give you an example anyway. We will sensitize your Astral Body and understand the challenges posed.

1.) Assume your pose (Fetal, Lotus work best. You need mental alertness)

2.) Take 7 slow, deep breaths to signal your nervous system to begin rest mode and chemistry. Allow mental chatter to be present (background thoughts remain for some time), avoid gripping tempting lines of thinking.

3.) Begin relaxing all muscle groups. Doing so will collect your Chi/Prana/Bio-electricity away from active muscles and into your spinal cord and Third Eye. Take about 15 seconds or 3 easy breaths into each area. (You can do both sides of the body at once, or for extra oomph as a beginner, each area can be done separately. Relaxing muscles is what quietens the mind)

4.) Since we are sensitizing or *realizing* our astral body with this method, begin noticing what it means to "move awareness" while attempting to feel this physically. With this, you are slowly gaining insight into True Imagination. True Imagination is attained when you realize that Imagination is *everything.* Imagination is what we use to create and influence reality. When you connect your imagination to things that you **actually feel**, especially your electrical/astral form, you will be able to *move your imagination "out" of your flesh form.* Hypnagogia (swirling colors and static noise) will eventually stabilize into the dream world. DO NOT do superman shit until you have stabilized this imagery and snapped out of fear or excitement. The breath will lead you into the dream world. When you arrive, try to meditate in the dream world to extend your range. There will be plenty of time over the rest of your life to do anything you can imagine.

That's it. Reigning in the overthinking Mind will happen automatically as you play around with your True Imagination, moving your awareness around, and remaining focused on this practice. The identity will slowly loosen from your body and psychology, and back into your True Form. This is the practice that will lead you into the insights necessary to re-attain your dream abilities. Some of you will intuit faculties of telepathy, manifestation, chakra opening, psychological mastery, and more with the activation of your True Imagination.The proper term is “Survival-Bias” but I didn’t want to scare anybody with the title. 

Everybody, especially beginners, should remember that AP is hard. This sub tells of all sorts of success stories, but given the nature of AP most will only believe in it if they have succeeded.

Trust the process, persevere, and don’t be hard on yourself. You’ve got this.question in subject titleFinally after many attempts and research i managed to have my first experience last night. I settled down in bed with a youtube video and headphones. It was a guided sleep meditation for unblocking chakras. I think the key to it was constant mantras in my ears keeping me slightly aware. Literally an hour an a half into the video, i feel really tingly and like something is shaking the bed. I attempt to take the earbuds out, and im looking at them but the music is still going, (must have dreamt i pulled them out) then if felt like hand were grabbing and pulling on my blankets, i got scared and tried to hide deeper into the blankets, suddenly i realized, wait this is it! Could it be! I thought go up! And i went up the hands stopped pulling, it was dark and i couldnt see, so i thought clarity now. And immediately could see my bedroom. I started walking to the window and was afraid id trip cuz it was still a bit dim. I hopped up and floated to the window about 8 inches off the floor. Opened the window, screen was still in. Pressed my hand through it. Felt wierd, and then squished my body through. My butt got a little stuck but i pushed outside. And stood up. The sky was purple and blue, and like a nebula.I tried a couple of small jumps and made it to the field in behind my house. And then i attempted to clear the edge of trees to see if i could fly over the city. The trees were pretty dark and maybe a bit scary. Cuz suddenly i was back in bed. Oddly no feeling of beig pulled back tho. I used to feel jealous, cuz the majority of people on this sub have had experiences or been really close. I beleived it could happen and did my best to stay positive but was hurt that i couldnt do it yet. But now! Im very excited! Even if it wasnt a projection, it was soo different from anything that ive ever experienced before, that i am pumped! Thank you to everyone on the sub who has offered advice! Its a very helpful community. To anyone struggling. 2 and a half years is a long time. Keep going!


Edit: not sure of the rules for linking vids, but this is what i listened to while settling down to sleep, i think the constant mantras in my ear are what kept me on aware enough. https://youtu.be/HbiCtddk8dII understand, this is the internet, a lot of people here don't have personal experience, and it's so easy to get influenced by others here, but PLEASE, be skeptical about things. I don't want to tell you what to believe, but so many people give in to this fear about astral projection, fears with absolutely no basis whatsoever. Whether it's this prison planet stuff, or evil entities waiting to possess/kill you, whatever. It is just SO IMPORTANT to not just believe things, cause belief gets you nowhere, it might just get you stuck in false belief traps instead that might not necessarily be true.

There's a lot of fear and negativity here lately, and I just want to remind people to be skeptical and open-minded, don't believe everything you hear. Maybe there's something to the fact that the actual astral projection experts, who have written books and have workshops, don't really speak about all these scary things and conspiracies, and maybe you should be more skeptical of the random people here on Reddit.

Once again, I don't want to tell you what to believe, I'm just saying, be open-minded, but skeptical about things. Don't believe things that you don't have really strong personal experience, that you don't have evidence for, cause otherwise, it might just get you unnecessarily trapped in belief systems that aren't actually true, and then there might be unnecessary fear there. Just be mindful. Happy early holidays.I got one delivered today, I'm currently wearing it as a necklace. It's 1am right now, I've been "asleep" for just over an hour and have been projecting the entire time. This is astounding, it's absolutely incredible! As soon as I close my eyes I'm practically leaving my body instantly. Even as I type this and I'm AWAKE I can feel the vibrations like I'm not entirely attached to this physical plane. 

I've never, ever found it THIS easy. Honestly, it's a little scary. I'm freaking out. But please, I'm telling you, TRY this crystal if you're struggling with AP and I imagine it will help you also!I went to bed with the intent of trying to astral project. I put on some binaural beats on Spotify and meditated in the beginning. I started dreaming about some irrelevant things, but in the middle of dreaming I started to become conscious and hear the binaural beats again. I started thinking whoa I’m waking up. I literally told myself “I’m going to astral project” and that’s when I jumped out of my body. My whole body went numb. I saw my hands come out first. I went through the roof of my house and into the galaxy. Right when I came out of my body someone greeted me, but I couldn’t see who it was I couldn’t control my astral body and just kept flying upwards into the galaxy. Eventually I tried to control my body by telling myself to go back to my physical body. I don’t know why? I did come back , but I started going around my room and jumping on the bed trying to fly again haha. 
Damn I got too excited and woke up haha. Wow that was a lot of fun. THIS SHIT IS REAL YOU GUYS. Even though it lasted literally a minute.
(Sorry if this was hard to read. I just woke up and I wrote down what I can remember)What I think happens when we die is if we were not enlightened before we died we might want to reincarnate to come back and be enlightened and when you die you remember your 1000000 of past live which makes us similar to god level knowledge we will know the truths and lies we will know why we are here and since you have some time to travel the astral plane when you die we must’ve traveled all of it before we chose to get reincarnated wich means we already traveled the astral plane and learned everything of anything makeing every life significant. - Patman Youresh 13 year oldhttps://ibb.co/jvN6vGw

I included my exact train of thought as I reacted to the new, initially confusing experience.

It was the most interesting, life changing experience in my life, and I feel a powerful urge to share this knowledge with others.

I’ve read a few books on astral projection and related topics, but since I’m a visual person I could never really imagine what it was like.

I was honestly afraid to try astral projection, but after actually experiencing it, it’s not scary at all, it’s just different.

The only unsettling part was when my hands got locked together by the Qi energy between them. I wasn’t aware you could feel “physical” sensations so strongly without nerves or a physical body.

I also don’t understand how I could think completely normally, without a brain. It makes me wonder if our brain does anything at all. 

Why aren’t scientists studying this intensely??

Good luck on your astral voyages, it’s lots of fun!Is this strange or has it happened with you guys before? When ever I am trying ro Ap and I reach a vibrational stage where literally I feel my astral body is about to leave. Somehow my dog knows, she comes barking at me even though she lives on ground floor and I am on second. This has happening to me for the fourth time. Once she slept with me when I was about to AP, she woke up and started barking at me. I don't know why but looks like she has interrupted my AP several time. I don't understand. Is she trying to communicate something to me? Or is it normal for pet to feel that. She is just 5 month old.I still don't know how I pulled this off. I'm a beginner at AP (started 3 days ago) and haven't had much luck with it. However, my most "successful" attempt was last night and turned out pretty funny.

I managed to AP and start floating out of my body. All of me felt light as a feather except for my head; it felt like a heavy weight and I couldn't lift it. My body slowly floats up but my head stays down, so I end up floating upside-down in the air and unable to flip right-side-up. I have no idea why. After struggling for several minutes I start panicking because I'm stuck. It's 3am and I'm dangling upside-down in my room like an idiot, but I don't want to restart because I've been trying to AP for days. I couldn't tell if I was alone on the astral plane or not, so I flail my limbs and yell "Can someone who's good at this please help me?!" Moments later I hear the response "You should start over" and wake up back in my body, properly oriented and laughing my stupid butt off at the mental image of what just happened. Ofc it was scary in the moment, but not after it was over.

I'm gonna try again tonight. Wish me luck lol.Whenever i see anyone mentioning our planet they always call it the prison planet, why is that? and what exactly made you refer to it as that?I had never heard of people deliberately inducing OOBE before stumbling on this subreddit a few months ago. You guys have helped tremendously. I grew up not believing in hardly anything besides hard science and it wasn’t until maybe a year and a half ago I began being open to things like this. I bring this up because maybe you think you don’t have the right ‘spiritual background’ to be able to expand the limits of your consciousness. You absolutely have what it takes. Be patient and put in the work. And appreciate the small progress you make because one day all that work will bring you to a moment where you’ll be able to get out of bed and decide to push your consciousness through a sliding glass door into another dimension. 


This is a hopefully understandable breakdown of my method for beginners like me. I’m convinced if you do them you’ll enter altered states of consciousness (lucid dreams, false awakenings or sleep paralysis).  It’s then up to you and your research to AP from the altered states. I’m not knowledgeable enough with AP’ing from them to give sufficient advice. Steps 1 and 2 are important but not the essence of this method and you can find more useful and detailed posts about 1 and 2. 



1. Do lots of reality checks throughout the day and make simple statements like “I’ll question my reality if I see a dream sign” 

2. Meditate at least a little bit during the day or at least try to be present. 

Catch yourself daydreaming about what you plan on doing tomorrow or what you did yesterday and simply stop that train of thoughts, notice what you see, hear, feel, smell etc.. Or if you’re with someone - pay attention to them. This will be good for you and others in your waking life and also help you be present while you’re dreaming. 

3. Set an alarm for 4 and a half hours or so after you predict you’ll go to sleep. 

If you have a partner you don’t want to wake up and don’t have a smart watch alarm - Drink a half a cup(?) of water or so before you lay down and you’ll probably wake up around 4 hours later. 

4. Wake up 4 or so hours later and do a [meditation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/18h2bi/ssild_official_tutorial_20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where you do cycles of focusing on what you see, what you hear and what you feel until you start recognizing your thoughts becoming irrational, then go to sleep. You need to read the linked tutorial to understand how to do the meditation. The post explains it better than I can but don’t worry - it’s not a complicated meditation. 

Since starting this meditation a few days ago, I’ve been in many states of altered consciousness much more frequently. I think it works because you are doing nothing but listening to a sound of a fan or feeling your body or seeing blackness and you’ll seamlessly have an irrational thought like ‘McDonald’s over the hill is green’ and you’ll go back to focusing on your fan sound or body or blackness for a split second and the you RE Cognize or do a double take at the irrational thought. You’ll laugh at yourself and think “Why was I thinking McDonald’s over the hill is green? That makes no sense”. This is the exact thought you want to have because hopefully when you’re dreaming and you see something that makes no rational sense, you’ll laugh and think, for example, “Why am I seeing a green McDonald’s up on that hill? That makes no sense. I might be dreaming.” This training during a REM stage has gotten me into many altered states of consciousness much more frequently than before I started it. 

The first night I tried this meditation I set the alarm for 3:00 am. I woke up went to the bathroom went back to bed and did the meditation. Within a few minutes, likely around 3:05, my thoughts started getting irrational and the meditation became difficult so I let myself fall asleep. I had a dream sequence that spanned at least two days of dream time that included several false awakenings, a nightmare or 4, an AP attempt while within a false awakening and eventually questioning my reality thoroughly and becoming lucid and I woke up into my waking life. I was amazed and needed to write in my dream journal. I picked up my phone and it was just 3:43. 

In the months I’ve been trying to AP and lucid dream, nothing like this sequence of events has happened so I think it’s fair to assume the meditation was the cause  of it. 

5. Once in an altered state of consciousness, use other people’s methods of exiting. 

There are several posts about getting out from lucid dreams, false awakenings and paralysis. I’m not in a position to tell you how as I’ve only done it once and it was from paralysis. 

My only advice is if you’re in sleep paralysis, don’t just lay there or expect something to happen first. Just get out of bed like you always do. It’s intuitive and possibly easier to conceptualize than levitating or pulling a rope. Before I when I was experiencing vibrations in paralysis I was expecting something else to have to happen first before separation. But it seems to me from my experience last night as long as you’re paralyzed, your physical body can’t move, so if you decide to get up with the simplicity of just getting up like you always do, you’ll easily separate.1. **Go to the bed and lay down in a comfortable position.**
2. **Close your eyes.**
3. **Focus on the third eye point in between two eyebrows.**
4. **You start feeling sensations of slight pain and pressure.**
5. **Continue focusing on the pain in the third eye point and stop your eye movements completely.**
6. **Remain silent with a non-REM state.**
7. **When you stay in a non-REM state your body becomes paralyzed and now you lost your body from your consciousness and only remained in awareness and consciousness.**
8. **Now try to move this consciousness from that position something like floating, turning, moving.**
9. **Just try to move consciousness, not the body (body should be totally paralyzed for astral travel).**
10. **Boom! You are now outside of the body!**

Follow these steps every day and spend at least 1 to 2 hours for each session. You will successfully remain outside the body from the very first day if you can free and relax your body totally and only become aware of consciousness.

**Practice More If You Fail!**
**Also Third Eye Awakening is Helpful in Astral Projection [Visit Us](https://awakenguru.com/open-your-third-eye-chakra/)**Yesterday I was kind of shocked to have my child begin to describe that she has been going out of her body at night for a few weeks now. She says she used to be able to do it when she was really little but has figured out how to do it again recently in the last few weeks. This is how the conversation went. She has a mature vocabulary and is very articulate and I honestly believe her because she is not the kind of kid that just makes up stories. (Using D for daughter)

D: guess what! I’ve figured out how to go out if my body again like I did a long time ago when I was little!

Me: oh really? That sounds interesting.

D: yes! It’s just the most amazing thing and feels great! 

Me: how do you do this honey? You do this in your dreams? 

D: no- it’s not a dream but you do have to really think about what you would like to do while you are falling asleep. Also it helps if you think about the house being in a weird dimension with everything reversed... you know like the bathroom on the OTHER side of the house and then you can look at our stairs and jump off of them from the top!

Me: you make it sound so easy! I’ll have to try that! (Laughing)

D: no mommy- it’s actually not very easy at all. But I will try to teach you how to do it if you want!

Me: ok! So... when you are out of your body what do you do exactly

D: I jump of the top of the staircase! 

Me: that’s all you do?

D: well it’s incredibly fun! You don’t get hurt at all and it’s like more fun even than going on one of those rides at the amusement park like the one at the beach with the really huge rides!!

Me: oh I see- so it’s not like a regular jump

D: oh no- you can take the biggest jump of the highest place and never get hurt. 

Me: so you can do this anytime you want to?

D: well mostly I can and I bet you could do it too

Me: let’s do it together! We can meet up and you can help me with the big jump

D: well... I will only be able to hear you not see you but you could probably hear me I guess

Me: you are invisible when you do this?!

D: not exactly - I can be myself but there just isn’t really seeing like you are used too. But we could probably hear each other if we are doing it together 

Me: hmmmm. That sounds very interesting. Do you always jump off the stairs when you do this at night? 

D: the reason I just want to keep talking about it is because you know when you have tried a new food for the first time and it’s really yummy and you just can’t stop saying how great it is? That’s how it’s like. 

Me: ok! you can keep talking about it. I don’t mind! 

This was about as far into the conversation as I can remember accurately. I would love to hear what experienced people have to say about this and how she has described her experience. Even though she only stays at our house “in a weird dimension” is this still some kind of AP or just a little OBE child’s play? Just a dream?**Good evening everyone!**

Tonight's upload is focused on your pineal gland activation session aswell as your AP/OOBE session.

What you will experience in this track is the **963Hz frequency** which is said to awaken your higher self and it can also be used in your pineal gland activation meditation. Your brain will also absorb the deep **10Hz alpha brainwaves** which is embedded to the track.

The alpha brainwave is scientifically studied to be a great enhancer to concentration and deep relaxation. This brainwave is frequenctly used by many travelers as it will activate the neurons in your brain which will result in pure serenity.

Here is some more basic information about the **ALPHA** brainwave:

Alpha brainwaves are dominant during quietly flowing thoughts, and in some meditative states. Alpha is ‘the power of now’, being here, in the present. Alpha is the resting state for the brain. Alpha waves aid overall mental coordination, calmness, alertness, mind/body integration and learning.

Alpha brain waves are present in **deep relaxation** and usually emerge when daydreaming or during light meditation. It is an optimal time to program the mind for success and it also heightens your imagination, visualization, memory, learning and concentration.

Wishing everyone a wonderful saturday evening and please dont hesitate to contact me in either the comment section or give me a private DM if there is anything I can aid you with.

**LINK:** [https://youtu.be/mMEIDr7UTk8](https://youtu.be/mMEIDr7UTk8)I felt myself vibrating all over and the next thing I know I was out of body. I willed myself to go out of my room and all of a sudden I found myself in an empty castle hall, it had a very temple vibe to it. Then this woman with blue hair and wearing a traditional red celtic looking dress appeared and she asked me to follow her. She took me to this group of men who I somehow feel I know (maybe from other lifetimes) and I immediately knew that this one tall guy there is my future husband. All of a sudden I was in this dark room with illuminating lights, like outer space, and a voice told me I could ask any questions I want, and I did and I got the answers. It was so bizarre. Next thing, I felt my astral form return back to my body and I could still feel the high vibrations when I awoke. It occurred to me that I’ve just accessed the akashic records and the blue haired woman is one of my spirit guides. She even told me her name. My crown chakra
was still vibrating when I awoke. 

This excited me as it’s the very first time I experienced anything like this. Do you have similar experiences you can share?

UPDATE:

I’ve been getting sleep paralysis ever since I was a child and everytime I feel this surge of vibrations and paralysis come on, I would always fight it and try to wake up. But this time, I let go and went with the flow and next thing I know, I was out. Also, before the voice from the Akashic Records spoke to me, I found my hands suddenly and automatically do rapid hand movements like that of mudras in meditation. In hindsight I think it was a code or key.https://i.ibb.co/4RgGp5h/emerald.png

Taken from "The Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Athlantean"

Glossary: 1. Darkness/night: material body, matter

Edit: 2. "bondage of words" may also be "thoughts"

EDIT! As /u/Frankandfriends has pointed out, this apparently is NOT the original and ancient Emerald tablets. This was written by "Brotherhood of the White temple" new age syncretic cult in the 20th century.Okay so I want to share this! I've been trying with no luck, then took melatonin and it was so much easier.

I was really curious and looked in the mirror. I'm bald in the astral realm apparently. Is this normal? I normally have long hair.

Also I was completely alone. I wasn't able to travel other places yet, it was my first time so I'm sure later on I will be able to. The only person I saw was my body in bed.

This was so interesting! Even though no one was around, I asked in the astral realm if I should continue. I heard a no and not sure if it was from the sounds I was listening to or not.This is my first ever post on reddit and it is a fairly long one so please bare with me haha.

Approximately 2 years ago i came across the subject of Astral Projection. At that time i still was fairly religious so i took it with a grain of salt.

However time went by and my interest in Astral Projection grew. I watched a lot of video’s, read articles, listened to podcasts etc. 

After a few months i started to try it out for myself. I began with lying in my bed and trying to relax myself until I felt some sort of vibration. Then i would try an exit method however, i kept failing.

After a year of trying on and off i came across reddit. I made an account and joined my first subreddit, which was this one haha. When i saw the amount of people and information in this subreddit i got so happy because i found a whole community that was interested in Astral Projection. 

After browsing this subreddit i came across the 3 days seminar of Michael Raduga (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BTW). This is when i noticed that i was actually making Astral Projection difficult for myself. All this time i was doing the direct method, which is trying to Astral Project while fully awake. The indirect method has been much more successful in terms of coming close to Astral Projection for me. For the indirect method you need to set an alarm for 2 to 3 hours before you usually wake up. Then you wake up by your alarm and stay awake for 5 to 10 min. After that you just go back to bed and set an intention for Astral Projection. 

When i started doing the indirect method i kept having  sleep paralysis and lucid dreams. Which was really exciting for me. However, i still was not Astral Projecting.

UNTILL YESTERDAY! i was sleeping at my girlfriend’s house and suddenly woke up around 5 AM in the morning. I decided to try to sleep again. 2 minutes after i close my eyes i started to get heavy vibrations and heard weird noises and voices. I tried to intensify everything and thats when i started to see a tunnel with green dots everywhere (little bit like DMT visuals). I was moving through the tunnel really fast until after 10 seconds or so everything just stopped. Thats when i tried an exiting technique. I simply just “stood up” and appeared in my own room back home. I thought “holy shit am i really astral projecting right now?”. I went downstairs and saw my mother on the couch. Then i walked through my house and saw a black cat, which is weird because i do not own a cat, however, i did own one about 5 to 6 years ago but it never came back again. After a few minutes i wanted to go back to my body. So i simply just though about my body and i immediately woke up.

My advice to people who are having trouble with Astral Projection is to just take a break from it for a while. As you can read i did not even go to sleep with the intention to astral project later in the night. Sometimes it just comes to you.

Thanks for reading and maybe we will find each other on the astral plane, who knows!I found this doc, it's really mind blowing! It explains quite everything about the Astral Body from the silver chord to the "death" of an AB

It's quite long but I think it's worth a read! hope y'all enjoy it

**THE SEVEN BODIES — OR FIELDS, OR DIMENSIONS.**

According to the septenary conception, the Spirit-Man is composed of two distinct strata: the Divine Triad, constituted by the "Christic I," and the "Inferior Quaternary," linked to the personality and which is mutable like it. In these strata, each series or body has a denomination and distinct characteristics, specific functions and manifestations limited to the field or dimension to which it is linked, since each of these bodies vibrates in a distinct dimensional universe.

&#x200B;

**THE PHYSICAL BODY.**

The physical body is the fleshy outer cover (envelope) in which we live—something similar to a diving suit: heavy and almost cumbersome, which we use to act in the physical environment.

It is composed of chemical compounds that are cleverly manipulated by the phenomenon called life.

In fact, there is life in each of these chemical elements. Everything inside us is life. We exist with our major life seated in a compound of a myriad of smaller lives that organize this compound.

As our body is made of Matter, it operates with ease in the physical environment since the body and the environment belong to the same electromagnetic dimension.

&#x200B;

**THE ETHERIC BODY.**

As the name indicates, this body is of an extremely tenuous structure. It is invisible because it is diaphanous, of dense electromagnetic nature, but its wave length is superior to that of ultra-violet light. This is why the etheric body is easily disassociated by ultra-violet light when it is exuded by the physical body. We can say that it is quintessential, almost reaching immortality.

The physiological equilibrium reflects the harmony that prevails in the cosmos—the function of the etheric body is to establish health automatically, without interference of consciousness. While it distributes vitalizing vitamins to the physical body, this equilibrium makes sure that the vital functions stay in balance and that the corporeal set maintains its harmonic equilibrium. In this way the physiological equilibrium promotes the cicatrization of wounds, the cure of localized diseases, etc.

We should really think about the importance of the energetic structure that, although, it is not known by medicine, *Eppur si muovo.*

Functioning as a plastic mediator between the astral body (the rougher body of the spirit) and the physical body, the body *or etheric double* is of material nature: it belongs to the domain of the flesh-man. There are people who confound the etheric double with the astral body, calling it, simply, "double." To make the differentiation and still avoid confusion, we always add the specification "etheric" to the word "body" when we refer to the "double."

**Etheric Diseases.** A great number of diseases that are considered settled in the human body, in reality have their seat in the anatomic substratum of the etheric organization. It is from there that they pass to the somatic body, where they appear as vital dysfunctions. This fact, only one among others, deserves the special attention of medical scientists because it opens fields for investigation which have not yet been explored by lenses and scalpels.

This research, however, does not even get the attention of spiritists, because almost all of them are tied by the excessive amplitude of the conception of "perispirit." At the moment, they do not know anything (and they are not even interested in knowing anything) about the physiology of the etheric body. It is surprising to see how close they are, in this respect, to materialists and others (including some scientists).

&#x200B;

**THE ASTRAL BODY.**

In the second century of our era, Origenes, philosopher of the neo-Platonic School, taught that the spirit had a vaporous body, the "aura." In the 4th century, Saint Cyril of Jerusalem said: 'The soul of the dead have subtler bodies than the terrestrial bodies. The name spirit is generic and common: everything that does not have a dense and heavy body is a spirit." At the same time, Saint Hilary of Poitiers stated: "There is nothing in Nature or in Creation, be it in the sky, be it on the Earth, be it among visible things, be it among invisible things, that is not corporeal. Even the souls, be it during life, be it after death, keep some corporeal substance, because it is necessary that everything that was created, has to be in something."

All thinkers of the primitive church made a distinction, as Saint Paul of Tarsus did, between the spirit (pneuma) and the intermediate soul (psyche) and the rough physical body, (soma). John of Thessalonica, in the second Council of Nicaea, declared: "The angels, archangels and also the souls are really spirituals, but not deprived of a body. They are endowed with a tenuous, ethereal, igneous body."9

This soul—of which so many authors of the past demonstrated a surprising knowledge —received the generic name, "perispirit," from Kardec. This denomination comprises several subtle bodies, even the etheric one, although it is physical. For Kardec "soul" and "spirit" are, therefore, synonyms. For us "soul" and "perispirit" should be synonyms—both expressions designate the covering set of the spirit, from the astral body to the others that are subtler bodies (with an obvious exception of the etheric body). It is advisable to have this conceptual difference always in mind, to avoid future distortions in the understanding of the subject of this book. Everything makes us believe that the "soul" to which these and other sages refer, is really the astral body.

**A Bridge Between the Physical & the Astral.**

It is through the etheric structure that the volatile acts, desires, emotions, and any manifestation of the superior consciousness act upon the physical body, or more precisely on the physical brain.

The etheric structure promotes the necessary frequency degradation between the spiritual field of the astral and the physical field.

The most spectacular actuation of the etheric double occurs during sessions of physical effects. This kind of work is quite rare, and depends on the assistant's and operator's special care and preparation.

For a spirit to become materialized—to be touched, felt, weighed, etc.—it is necessary that its spiritual form be covered by material substance. This substance—ectoplasm—comes from the etheric double of a donor medium. The ectoplasm is exuded by the pores and natural cavities. At the beginning it is a kind of heavy, dense gas, that little by little is condensed, takes a viscous, plastic form and covers the communicating spirit, until it takes the shape of the body that the spirit had when it was incarnate. With this new body, that is, the counterpart of its astral body, the disincarnated can remain among living beings for some minutes: it listens, speaks, walks, touches and can be touched, as if it were a common living person. In the last century, the well-known scientist William Crookes, over two consecutive years, investigated the materialization of the spirit Katie King. It was a classic case and caused justified repercussions for two reasons: the indisputable credibility of Crookes and the assent of the spirit to undergo scientific researches.

In common mediumistic phenomena—much less the spectacular—the importance of this mediator almost does not appear: it is not touchable. Without it, however, communication between the astral and the physical fields would be impossible because a bridge is missing: every communicating spirit that acts, tied to a medium, has to use this intermediary phase of frequency that permits the resounding coupling with the nervous system of the medium to the modulation of the spirit's thought and its expression through psychography, psychophony and other means.

**THE MENTAL BODY.**

The mental body is the vehicle that uses the cosmic "I" to manifest itself as a concrete and abstract intellect; it is in this body that the will gets transformed into action, subsequent to choosing the volitional act. It is a field of elaborated reasoning, from which the powers of mind, the phenomena of cognition, memory, and the evaluation of our acts, surge because it is the seat of the manifested active consciousness. While physical sensibility and emotions flow from the astral body, the mental vehicle can be considered the source of the intellect.

In a certain way, the mental body is still an inferior covering, because it is a consequence of these phenomena or functions that conventionally are called "intellect." Only on superior levels of consciousness—where the virtues that result from affective love for all beings are present at their highest degree—the highest spirituality, which is our essence—can manifest itself.

\*\*Concrete Mental Body & Abstract Mental Body.\*\*This field, body or dimension of the Spirit-Man can be divided in two, for a better

understanding:

— Concrete mental body, also called the inferior mental body: it deals with simple, quite objective perceptions, e.g., the ones of material objects, people, houses, vehicles, etc.;

— Abstract mental body, causal body or superior mental body: it elaborates and structures principles and abstract ideas ad infinitum; it is the process responsible for scientific and technological advances, and also for our entire philosophic foundation.

Examples:

— The perception of a cube through our senses (getting to know the size, color, edges, weight, smell, taste, or the sound that it makes when it drops on the floor or when it comes in contact with another object) are typical functions of the concrete mental body or inferior mental body. It registers what is outside the skin and impresses our nervous system.

—The evaluation of volume, area, weight and properties of this same cube, by comparing it with other similar objects or through more sophisticated methods; the formulation of geometric theories, relating symbols and laws: these are some typical functions of the superior mental body.

\*\*The Aura — Mental Projections;\*\*The mental body has an approximately ovoid form that involves the physical body. Its

peripheral portions constitute the aura, and the aura is of varied color and size according to the frequency of the vibratory fields generated by thoughts. It is easy for clairvoyants to perceive what is going on in the minds of people: good thoughts are of light, crystalline, brilliant colors; the inferior ones (hatred, envy, vengeance, etc.), are of dark, dense and unpleasant colors. The aura, consequently, reveals the tonic note of the mental field of a person. The mental Energy can be projected into Space, by means of structures known as thought forms. They consist of an energy nucleus that has its form modeled by the mind that projects it, they can harm or benefit a person, according to the will of the person who creates it—consciously or unconsciously. The negative ones take the form of darts, arrows, projectiles, or turbid fields, for example. The positive ones, more efficient, take the form that the operator wants them to have; we can, for instance, use the mental energy also to benefit disincarnated spirits, by cleaning and dressing them and giving them food, with the objective of improving their spiritual conditions.

The natural field of this Energy is the mental field. When projected, this Energy normally acts first on the mental field or body of other beings, and from there it goes— already converted to psychomotor actions—to the astral end etheric bodies or fields. However, if it is projected with emotions, the lower (and more negative) the vibratory frequency of the emotions, the darker and murkier will be the magnetic masses that cover this Energy. In these cases, where the generation of thought-forms is included, the emitted mental energy will reach first and directly the astral body of the target person, from there it goes to the etheric body and then to the physical one.

Thoughts are life power—we should never forget this. The energy that they project is proportional to the potency of the mind and to the will power of the emitter.

**THE BUDDHIC BODY.**

There is almost nothing to be said about the vibratory structure (or field, body or dimension), closest to the spirit. This body is so distant from our physical standards, and from our means of expression, that it is not possible to compare it by describing it. It is possible to say that buddhi is the perispirit according to the etymological acceptance of the word: it is the first vibratory structure that, by involving the spirit, demonstrates it in an active way.

However, a short time ago, we were allowed to discover an interesting property of this structure that can be used, and in a very practical way, in the treatment of the incarnated and disincarnated (since both are, first of all, spirits).

As this body is timeless (as the superior mental body is, too), we used the technique to reach this superior dimension of people, as a starting point to scrutinize their pasts. In this way we could detect anomalous situations, very painful events, deeply rooted in time, in the extremely tenuous stratum of a hidden past that happened at very remote times.

We said extremely tenuous stratum; but this does not mean that it is inactive.

According to the Cosmic Law—as enunciated in the sentence: "...your *sin will find you out."* (Numbers 32:23)—any kind of disharmony provoked by a conscious being will vibrate in the transgressor's consciousness until the abnormality—including both the causes and the consequences—is totally dissolved. As any disharmonic act has life power, the psychic environment of the agent of the perturbation presents the tonic note of disharmony.

As we have already exhaustively observed, in such cases the person loses the greatest good of the spirit—PEACE. He suffers quite a lot, he considers himself an unpardonable sufferer, a sensation that denotes a deep rooting of the consciousness disease that, quite often, has affected numerous existences.

This kind of deep suffering can only be relieved or solved through the dissolution of the disharmonic foci. And this, as far as we know, can be achieved in two ways. One is the spiritual elevation of the transgressor, awakening to a life full of love and being good to those next to one; the other one is the use of specific techniques, with the projection of manipulated energies by capable operators.

**THE ATMIC BODY OR THE ESSENCE- SPIRIT.**

Is there any way to define That Thing which, by definition, transcends symbols and words?

Through millennia and successive civilizations, any attempt to describe what we designate by "spirit" is considered incomplete because of the inefficacy of words.

The concepts of Vedic Philosophy continue to be enlightening due to their transparency. According to the Vedas, the One and Universal Being—Brahma (The Non- manifested), transcendent and eternal—becomes immanent in his temporary action, when he manifests himself. The beings that he emanates, contain his essence, in the same way as the thinker is in his thoughts. The absolute, the universal, is manifested in each individualized being, even in the very small ones, exactly because it is absolute, and, therefore, escapes human understanding, it transcends whatever exists.

This omnipresent absolute, manifested and manifesting in each being, is called Atman or Spirit. The pure atmic "body" or "Spirit," this Cosmic I constitutes the Divine Essence in each created being. We are all identical to God in the sense of Being (Essence), but different from Him in the sense of "exist": God does not "exist"; God Is eternally present.

It could not have been for any other reason that Jesus said; "You \*are Gods."\*Once a guru taught his disciple, who was feeling depressed facing the difficulties of

existence, the following:

You have to see yourself as you really are: a spirit with terrestrial clothes. The real person, the 'I' that you are, is not your body, in the same way as I am not in my body—that is something fragile and suffering. **We are immortal and divine spirits.** Strong and indestructible. Always trying to get better, to improve, to purify our qualities. At the moment we are on mission here on Earth; we do not know what the mission is, but it will undoubtedly be for our best.

&#x200B;

**Unfolding Phenomena.**

Under certain circumstances, artificial or natural, the astral body can separate from the physical body, by taking with it all the other coverings and even its own spirit. This normally happens while the person is asleep, when he loses consciousness and the vital functions are lowered to a minimum level necessary for metabolic exchanges.

Many sensitives can easily get out of their bodies, in spontaneous trances. But this can also happen to common people, in pathological or special occasions, as for instance, a strong emotional shock, debility due to long periods of sickness, voluminous hemorrhaging, surgical shocks and other traumatic conditions. People can go to distant places, they can describe these places, evaluate their actions and those of others, they can have physical sensations, everything in perfectly conscious conditions—thanks to the connection with the physical brain, through the silver string.

**The Silver Cord.**

The spirit remains attached to the body, independently of its distance from the body, by means of the silver string. Even the Bible mentions it:

*Or ever the silver cord be loosed,or the golden bowl be broken,or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.*

If it gets torn up, however, death occurs. It is irreversible.

&#x200B;

— Ecclesiastes 12:6

According to the reports of spirits, when superior entities tear up this string, the moment a person dies, there is a lightning of great intensity, produced by the liberation of Energy.

This luminous and brilliant string, constituted by some form of high intensity energy, is tied to the physical body by the etheric double, in which it is rooted by the head and by a myriad of filial connections that involve the etheric structure. It could be compared to a cable of high tension if it were not inconceivably ductile: it can achieve the greatest thinness, thus allowing the spirit of a living person to escape from the physical body (and from the etheric) on astral trips of millions of kilometers. It does not break and maintain the spirit as the owner and guide of the body: through a marvelous process that has not been explained so far: all vital functions of our bodies are preserved.

**Apometric Unfolding.**

The spirit can get away from the physical body in a more efficient way by imposition of a magnetic nature, when commanded by a trained person. This is the basis of Apometrics— the main subject of this book. It is a widely used technique in the treatment of incarnated and disincarnated spirits. This phenomenon, which we call "apometric unfolding," opened the doors for our systematic investigations of the astral dimension, a real universe, parallel to ours.

We realized that, after some time, the sensitives trained in the apometric unfolding, acquire such consciousness of their potentialities and limitations that they move in that dimension as if they were on the physical plane. They go to other places, sometimes very far away, to work, help, assist incarnated or disincarnated spiritually sick people to whom they give inestimable aid.

&#x200B;

**Properties & Functions of the Astral Body.**

The ease of getting separated from the physical body is a characteristic of the astral body. It is immaterial and of magnetic nature, it does not have a fluid constitution as the etheric double does, neither does it form materialized objects, because its nature is completely different from Matter. However, it can easily be molded by the action of mental power. This property is helpful in treatment techniques of sick, crippled, mutilated or injured spirits, that still suffer from the diseases that caused their death. But we can affirm in advance, that all of them are recomposed in their natural form and high physiological state through the projection of healing Energy that is mentally emitted by the operator (energetic pulses, commanded in slow counting, usually up to seven or ten).

One of the most important functions of the astral body is sensitivity. We know that it resides in this field or body; the physical body only transmits received stimuli; the record of painful or pleasant sensations is up to the structure. Vices are of a psychic nature exactly due to this fact; their origin is in the astral: it is the astral that feels. For this reason we take our vices and passions with us when we die; if it were otherwise, there would be no reason for the disincarnated to go on suffering physical pains, or carry painful deformations with them—as has been verified in spiritual sessions.

Sensation is the roughest form of feelings. It is primary, instinctive. Emotion is much more complex, it is linked to desire; it can be exacerbated until it reaches the abnormality of passion. We cannot forget that sensations, like emotions, are very important states of our consciousness, since they give color and power to our acts.

Our biggest struggle—fighting against ourselves, which favors our evolution— consists precisely in restraining, controlling and dominating desires, feelings and, mainly, passions. From the instinctive and animal impulses, such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, up to higher feelings, as for example loving our fellow creatures, solidarity, friendship, affection, tenderness, etc., or the unrestrained passions of possession, power and concupiscence, all the emotions and desires manifest themselves in the astral world. Through evolution, feelings and sentiments go from the astral to the other levels of consciousness that are peculiar to superior spirits.

&#x200B;

**Food & "Death" of the Astral Body.**

Our astral body constantly loses Energy, needing, therefore, an energy supply for its sustenance, similar to feeding the physical body. But the nature of this food varies very greatly; it goes from protein broth for the more materialized spirits, provided by the astral assistance stations, to quintessential energies that feed the superior spirits, which are gathered (through prayers) directly from the infinite reservoir of cosmic energy.

The spirits that inhabit the inferior astral, that are still rather brutalized (animalized), used to eat even human food. If there is a loss of energies without the necessary replenishment, which can happen due to passions, the spirit can lose its astral body and be reduced to an inactive ovoid, according to what André Luiz reports.

The normal means to lose this body, however, is through evolution; in the same way we lose our physical body when we die, we also lose the astral body. The spirits that are more evolved, and do not have this body anymore, cannot be seen by the rougher inhabitants of this plane—as we mentioned before.

In summary, evolution takes us farther and farther from the dense organizations that are a trait of Matter, until we abandon them completely. Involution, on the other hand, can  also take away this body—exactly in the same way as one loses the physical body, due to vices and passions.https://obe4u.com/astral-projection-guide/Last night after much research and study to further my AP means, I decided I would visit my friend in his dreams. He had no knowledge I was planning this and doesn’t truly believe in these type of ideas. I managed to successfully visit him in his dreams while I was projecting and he spoke to me about it this morning. :)

Just wanted to share this experiment’s success with everyone. Have a blessed day!Ok so why don't we raid area 51 via ap, while its getting "raided" in the physical world by dumbasses.

Like im deadass, all of the ap community should try to reach area 51 while the "raid's" going onI astral projected to a city of souls last night that may change a lot of what I believe the afterlife to be like. 

It was my very first astral projection, so I’m just going to take it from the beginning. I felt the vibration, then all of a sudden I felt like I was kind of flying/kind of not. I saw a combination of both my ceiling staying still and clouds rushing past. 

Then it stops and I feel like I failed. I stand up to see if I could see my body laying on the bed, but for some reason it was hard to see for a couple minutes. My vision kept going in and out of blackness 

But soon enough, my vision cleared and the first thing I notice is my recently dead cat, looking very much alive, laying next to my body that I wasn’t currently in. 

I asked him what he was doing here when he had such a crappy life with me (he had a very short life after being given a wrong diagnosis from the vet. Once the vet found out what was really going on, it was too late). 

Blanket, my cat, replied me with human words in a voice that was surprisingly fitting for him haha. He told me that he had an okay life and he expected it to be that way. Then, he brought up what looked like a holographic screen that held all this information about him. I later came to find out that all souls could pull up this holographic information panel. 

He showed me on the screen and explained to me that he is assigned to live 10 more lives where he “learns a lesson” (I translated that to mean living a kind of crappy life) before he gets to live a very plush and pampered life as a cat. 

I later found this to be true for every soul- that living a certain amount of reincarnations in a certain matter was required before receiving an upgrade, and that this arrangement was customized for each individual soul and what it needs to evolve. And that my cat, along with all beings, wouldn’t stay animals forever - earning enough upgrades to finally become a human was a huge milestone for souls to reach. 

I asked Blanket where Harper is, my bird that passed about six months ago that was like a daughter to me and is my entire reason for wanting to learn astral projection. He said he didn’t know

I walked away and began calling her name as the walls and entire scenery changed around me. Suddenly I was in an aviary, and though there were dozens of parrotlets that looked exactly like her, I knew which one was her.

We locked eyes and I called her name and she flew directly toward me and I was so happy. I finally did it. I finally astral projected and got to see my baby girl. 

She talked to me like a human in a voice that surprisingly fit her, just like Blanket did.

I started gushing how much I love her and how I’ve missed her, but her responses were short and kind of sad/angry. I asked her if Brent Atwater (a pet psychic) was honest during our appointment and if Brent was really speaking to her, because Harper was a lot more talkative through the psychic than she was being to me in person. Harper said no, it wasn’t true. 

I asked Harper if she had a good life with me and she said no. And I was just so confused. Harper was the happiest bird in the world when she was alive. She didn’t live in a cage, I had playgrounds set around my entire house that she could fly to and from freely. I gave her hours of love and attention everyday. I took her everywhere with me because she loved it and loved people. I took her to class where the tables were set up in a U-shape and she walked from student to student, walking up on to their shoulders and nibbling their ears and trying to pick the keys off their laptops and give them kisses and then fly onto the teacher’s head. 

Her telling me she didn’t have a good life was a complete shock. 

She morphed into a short, pretty, human girl with brown hair. I didn’t know enough about the science of everything to know why, but I thought it might be who she was going to be in her next life.

She walked away and I followed her as the walls and scenery shifted around us. 

All of a sudden, we were outside walking in a highly populated area in a city that looked like New York and Hogwartz combined. 

I saw every type of being in this city. Animals, humans, all kinds of different aliens, and demons.

It was fascinating, but my main focus was Harper. I ran after her and she goes into this brick building where there’s a handful of people and aliens sitting down, waiting in this room for ~something~. 

In some cases, I had no idea what the frick was going on. But then in other cases, I had an automatic knowing/understanding of how it worked. I somehow just ~knew~ that this was a city souls went to live for a short time/temporarily before choosing to go live another incarnation. I think I knew this because I had probably lived there on many occasions between past lives 

Harper was still giving me the cold shoulder and I felt like she was acting uncomfortable around me in a way as if I was some kind of predator

And that’s when it dawned on me. I remembered how I always use to pet her under her wings and on her belly. I was told I shouldn’t do that because it can turn a bird on, but I just didn’t believe it turned her on 

I told her how sorry I was and she told me how much it messed her up inside because I was her mother, yet she was sexually in love with me, yet she didn’t want to be.

I kept trying to explain to her how sorry I was and how I didn’t know, but I felt like a disgusting creep while doing so. That I shouldn’t try to be making someone who feels sexually violated by me to forgive me. I felt my heart breaking because I love her more than anything in the universe and felt eternally terrible that I had done this to her. 

A few bright red-skinned demons with black horns ran into the room with guns and bombs, but no one was scared. I somehow knew that they couldn’t permanently hurt us, but I didn’t know what would happen if the bullets actually hit us. Would it temporarily hurt? Would we feel ourselves die and then respawn? Would we spawn back where we were or go to some reset point and have to walk all the way back to where we were before? 

Anyways, I didn’t want to risk the annoyance and I didn’t want the building to shatter around us because I knew it would have to be fixed and cleaned up. 

So I stopped them with my mind and crumpled them to the floor. However, one remained standing and preceded to move his hand toward the trigger and his will was more powerful than mine in that moment, so I wasn’t able to stop him. The bullets went painlessly through us, but the whole building got messed up and everyone was just kind of annoyed at this a-hole punk demon. 

That’s when I found out that I was a little well-known around the city. Fame was measured by how much influence you had on your surroundings by using your will, and apparently in my times spent there between past lives I showed that I had a respectful amount of will-power.

Not a Godly amount or anything, but enough to impress the people in the city. I never pulled up my holograph screen because for some reason I felt like I didn’t want to know how many more lives I’d have to live until receiving an upgrade. But I assumed I lived enough lives where my next upgrade would probably also end up taking me to a new in-between-lives city for more higher-ranked beings. So even though I was all that and a bag of chips in this current city, I would probably be of low influence compared to others in the upgraded city until I lived more lives. So not exactly impressive, just what’s bound to happen to everyone eventually. 

Harper explained to me my well-known-ness and how she couldn’t even fully trust that I am me because apparently there were 2 separate accounts of shape-shifter souls who pretended to be me, saying they were astral projecting, in the past (because souls could somehow look up if someone had actually died). It ended up being a kind of famous ordeal in the city because they used the disguise to get away with doing a lot of annoying things. So apparently before they were figured out to be shape-shifters, people thought I had become some kind of huge jerk in my current life haha I was just really happy they were figured out and I didn’t astral project to a city of people who hated me 😂😂😂

Soon after that, I ended the astral projection. I just didn’t want to continue making Harper feel uncomfortable. So I walked away, saw the scenery morph into my bedroom, waved to my dead cat, and laid back down into my body.

One other interesting point is the humanness of having to maintain the city. As I was following Harper to the brick building, I noted how the sidewalks were dirty. And then I had a ~knowing~ where my brain told me with confidence that the city will get better over time as all souls continually reincarnate. 

One last note, I know for a fact Harper was the happiest bird in the world while alive. I think the pain didn’t hit until after she died and she was able to think about her experiences with a more logical mind. Also, I think the human she morphed into could be my future daughter. 

My husband had a vision of what our future daughter would look like and his description matched the girl Harper morphed into. If this is true, then I’m sure she knows this, which would make thinking about her experience as a bird more painful because no one wants to be the daughter of someone that turned them on- that’s just effed.I had read all of Robert Monroe's books a few months ago and they really blew my mind.  I had tried a few times to actually do it and had come close..my body would start vibrating but I became scared and it always stopped.  However, the past week I have been meditating very consistently.  Sunday morning I woke from my alarm at 530 AM, but I didn't actually have to work I just hadn't turned my alarm off by mistake.  Now, wide awake, I wasn't sure what to do with my time...so I meditated.  It was easily the deepest meditation I've ever been in...found myself in the in between part of sleeping where you are half asleep and half awake but can't move because of sleep paralysis.  Suddenly I got the whole body vibration episode and this time I was not scared.  I believe this was because consistent meditation heightens your baseline vibration.  As the vibration reached as high as it would go I remembered what to do from the books...so just to test i lifted my arms up and saw myself leave my body...tested again and sat up in bed independently from myself.  It felt really bizarre...and for some reason I thought okay, i just did that.  Time to go back, I'll go farther next time.  So i thought about my body and snapped immediately back.

I think  my takeaway here is that if you are having a hard time getting to the high vibrational state, maybe try meditating for a few weeks or longer first before you try again.  I never really got anywhere till I did that.  I also got there by not intending to, and just literally vibrating higher by meditation.  Not sure if any of that makes sense--best I can describe it.  Hope that helps anyone who felt stuck.This shit IS REAL and is nothing like a dream! I’m an extremely vivid dreamer and this was sooooo different!

Last time I did it I pictured a rope flying by me to grab and it flung me across the room. I wouldn’t recommend that.. seems like the slower you try to exit the body vs forcing it out leads to a better the better experience, at least in my case.

Before going to bed I asked for help in getting me out of my body from my guides. After that I laid there in bed breathing deeply picturing my astral body rising to the surface of my body. I said in my head ok, I’m ready to exit will you help me??

I went into the vibration stage 4 times before someone or something said don’t climb, roll. Boom, I rolled right out of my body! I tried to fly but I couldn’t. I tried to go through my window but couldn’t.. I need to set better intentions next time maybe?? I looked over at my sleeping body and went to my husbands side of the bed and pictured reiki energy coming from my hands to him in the most pure and loving way possible and I could see the colors entering his body. After that I just explored the house hoping to find the entity that helped me out but I was alone... 

I looked in on my kids sleeping, and my pets sleeping and I swear one of my dogs( the one most bonded to me) could see me! I didn’t speak out loud but sort of sent him a “ who’s such a good boy!” Message telepathically maybe And he awoke from his bed and rolled on his belly like he would for belly rubs and his tail wagged before he fell back asleep.. he looked right at me is this possible?!

Any advice on how to actually exit my house? I couldn’t open doors or anything. Maybe my guides set it up that way for me to take baby steps? I don’t know but I’ve been trying for 7 to 12 months I’d say so DONT GIVE UP because even though I was just in my home IT was STILL INCREDIBLE! This was just last night. I’ve tried everything others have recommended on here the only thing different I think was asking for help in exiting my body more gently and it fucking worked! Lol I’m on such a buzz right now! I think them helping is how I kept entering the vibrational stage( I’ve only ever been able to do it once in the past) almost immediately after a failed attempt, it was “them” my guides or whoever was listening to me giving me chances to try many times in one night vs over many nights..

My only regret was not looking into the mirror, I forgot to check myself out in my astral body. If that’s even possible lol..

Any advice for helping me advance my flying skills and entering the astral realm now that I know how to exit my body?

Much appreciated in advance! WOW what an experience don’t give up its worth all the work!✌️🥰

(Thanks for the award! Wowzerz! What a day!!)Last night I managed to leave my body as it was in the plans.This wasn't my first time, I put lots of time and effort into practicing and I managed to have 4 experiences by now. (I don't know how to change my "never projected yet" flair. lol)But yesterday, it was something else.Got out of body, called for clarity and awareness and manifested a chocolate bar in my closet just by saying "there's a chocolate bar in this closet".Simply insane how lucid and vivid the experience got in the moment i ate and drank, felt like real life, even better.Opened my room door, and found myself in front of a huge stairway, started floating through it and reached the top of a mountain. My spirit guide appeared in that moment and told me "This is where you'll learn how to fly properly. Jump."I did without hesitation. After a few seconds of free fall, i said "stop now" and I stopped right there mid air. started floating, enjoying the wonderful view a little bit, then called my spirit guide to ask him to show me more.He stared at me without saying a single word and my vision started tunneling, I found myself alone in this weird dimension where every form of life was human look alike, pure yellow flesh, and huge wings. Blue eyes. enormous eyes.They were really happy to see me, one of them hugged me and told me that I was more then welcome there and wanted to show me around. So I followed this being.They showed me a sort of castle where people go to have a good time with their loved ones, they pretty much go there all the time to drink, bless each other, play darts with darts that go across your body without hurting you LOL, well... i kinda lost the count of how many things this beings were doing in there and I also can't really remember some things.The super realistic game I tryied was a sort of darts, you wear this sort of "crown" and your vision starts to change, you look in this "game area" and different targets start spawning and you have to throw this invisible dart that you only can see and feel from your vision (the others see what you see on a sort of screen that was literally the wall) right on this targets and the more accurate you are the more points you get. The more points you get the bigger the prize is, the bigger prize was a ring that I didn't manage to make me explain what was useful for. Lol. It was sort of a super evolved VR.This beings seemed really interested of my presence and lots of them started to form a small crowd to see me interact with who was showing me their dimension.Anyway. I also got brought in this museum where I could've see small clips of events that happened in that dimension, I got left alone in there and it was really hard to understand how those sort of "clip portraits" work, so I went forward looking for help, just to find this amazing room that opened to a pool in the middle of the mountains, wonderful purple sky with 3/4 huge planets fully visible in the sky.I didn't had any clothes on or at least I didn't felt any, saw lots of this beings having a great time in there so I just joined and started having multiple conversations about my universe and my life while chilling in this pool ahahah they seemed really interested.I got tunneled back to my body when one of them said "so how does it feel knowing you're so far from your physical body laying somewhere in another dimension right now?" Thought of my body right there and got slammed back. I felt so betrayied. :')

No joke, like, it was simply amazing. I never thought I could feel that comfortable speaking to all those weird looking beings. It was an amazing experience, and I'm blessed I got the possibility to enjoy.Thanks for reading! :D Love and light friends!  


Edit: Someone explained how to change the flair. I got suggested to select the "experienced projecter" after a long talk. If you think I should demote it to something else, let me knowI’m not saying AP isn’t real or possible, I’m just wondering why, if it is, there aren’t examples of people stealing information from high-security government buildings or from corporations. This seems like it would be a huge threat to national security in corporations and governments worldwide. Maybe I just don’t have a good understanding of astral projection since I’ve never done it, but from what I’ve read people say they can visit real-world places and even phase through walls. This seems like it would be very problematic to the privacy of anyone’s information.Astral Projection is a natural capability of any spirit, regardless of the planet said spirit is incarnated in.

You exit your physical body every single night, even if you don't remember it. It happens. :)Hey guys,


So I thought some of you may appreciate this story. I know a lot of people struggle with the concept of the afterlife, what astral projection really is, whether or not we actually visit some higher planes of existence while out of body or is it our brains projecting these realities for us to explore etc. My mind is pretty much made up after well over a decade of having these experiences but I'm not trying to convince anyone about anything, just sharing something that happened to me last year.


During that time my mom was at a hospital after an unexpected cancer diagnosis, waiting for an emergency surgery. She never had any Astral experiences but she's heard a lot about them from me over the years. I never managed to spark her interest. However, during her time at the hospital she started having a lot of spontaneous lucid dreams and it freaked her out quite a bit.


One night, I was sitting on the couch at my parents' place where I stayed temporarily to keep my father company. Everyone was asleep and the whole apartment was dark apart from the TV that I was watching. All of a sudden, I felt my mom's presence very distinctively and it felt as if I'm about to actually see her. I even thought 'would I freak out if my mom walked into the room right now?'. It was quite alarming and made me consider the worst for a while but I managed to calm down and brushed it off.


I went to visit her the next day and the first thing she said was 'I think I visited you in my Astral body last night'. I was quite shocked because I didn't even have an opportunity to share my experience with her. She proceeded to tell me how she found herself out of body in the hospital room, thought she died and freaked out because she didn't know where to go or what to do. So she thought about me because I'm the only person she knows who could give her some directions and she immediately found herself in her apartment. She described exactly what the 'real time zone' looks like, how the entire apartment was dark but there was a certain glow that helped her find her way to the living room where she found me sitting on the couch in the dark with the TV on. She said she approached me from behind my back but before she could do anything else, she got kicked back to her body. 


My mom is fine now, the surgery was successful which was a quite miraculous outcome and now she's convinced that someday she will return to the astrals, a concept that she finds both terrifying but also fascinating.Through much trial and error, I have found a method that should work for anybody. 

I used to do methods randomly, hoping one work, and sometimes it did, but they were unreliable. The method I am about to share with you is a reliable method used by people like Robert Bruce, Robert Monroe, and all the other Roberts out there. This method worked for me the first time I tried it this morning, Here is the method.

You want to wake up early in the morning, preferably 6 to 7 hours after you had initially gone to sleep the night before.

With this method, you don't need to get up and walk around, but if you need to, then go do it.

Lay on your back immediately after waking up, and put your elbow on your bed, with your hand up. Your forearm should be vertical. This is so that if your arm falls, it will wake you up and you can continue.

After a while of doing this, you will be in a state where your arm is not falling, and you are not going to fall asleep on your back, you are awake but relaxed.

At this point, once you are SURE that you will not fall asleep, you want to put your arm down and relax.

you are going to stay on your back for a while. The longer you stay on your back, the more likely you are to astral project. I would say you're DEFINITELY safe after 1 hour, and pretty safe after 40 minutes.

the whole time you are on your back, you need to be thinking about astral projection. Tell yourself you will astral project, imagine yourself astral projecting, use every method you can to prime your subconscious with the idea of astral projection.

After an hour or so has passed, you need to roll over and try to fall asleep with the intention to astral project.

At this point, you will feel like you are not going to fall asleep, this is ok. Just MAKE SURE you do not give up, because you WILL fall asleep, no matter how awake you feel.

At some point, you will drift to sleep without realizing it, but this dream will be no ordinary dream. This dream will be very wacky. You will hear strange voices that your mind will turn into a dream, you will see very high-quality images close up, and hopefully, your subconscious will realize it is dreaming and wake you up.

When you wake up, you will have very VERY strong vibrations, so BE READY AND DO NOT BE AFRAID. maintain your goal and try to astral project.

What to expect during the vibrational stage: Strange noises, some of which I have re-created [here.](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526) You will get strange visions, you will feel like you are floating or sinking, etc. It will feel very alien to you, so just be ready for that.

From there you do an exit method, [here's the best website I have found for methods](https://obe4u.com/astral-projection-guide/). If the website doesn't work, refresh the page.

It is recommended you do this in pitch black so you have no distractions, and so you have no fear. If you are scared, just know that all of this will be gone after you have astral projected, and if it makes you feel any better, many people in the community have said that they actually ENJOY the vibrational state, and to be honest, so do I.

Happy Travels!Hi everyone and thanks for reading my post! I am posting my experience today because my dad passed away yesterday and I am struggling. But I am going to relate this to my AP(Astral Projection) experience that happened some time ago.

My experience with AP changed my entire way of thinking. It only happened to me 1 time and by accident.

About 7 years ago I was in treatment for addiction issues. After going through the motions of a 12 step program, I wasn't sure I could get true meaning from that method of recovery. I needed something more concrete to believe in.

During my time in treatment, I picked up an old popular book that was given to me. 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle. I read this book probably 3 times trying to understand the meaning and how to apply it to my life. I found that although I didn't agree 100% with the book, the underlying principles were hitting the nail on the head for helping me understand my ego and how it controls my thinking.

Anyways in this book there are a few sections that revolve around meditation and experiencing your thoughts. One day I hit a deep meditation while reading and decided to pause in order to dive into my brain's nothingness. This continued until I reached an almost a dream-like state.

I wasn't asleep, but I wasn't fully awake. If I wanted to, I could have snapped out of it, but I didn't want to run away from what I was experiencing. 

This is when my AP experience began. I left my body and zipped out to space. It happened so fast I really didn't understand what I was seeing or feeling

I felt like I was still myself, but I was a million different me's all in one. I felt this sense that I had lived in this universe since the beginning

I was experiencing this in almost a third person perspective and I wasn't in my body. I was a ball of light. As I was experiencing this, it felt as if I had lived all these different lives. Looking around, I could see Earth and how beautiful the planet looked in the darkness of space.

I was not alone. There were millions of other lights just like me that were flying around the planet. There were so many lights, it seemed to illuminate the space around the planet. 

Soon it became apparent that these lights were exactly like me and had millions of their own lives and experiences. I know this because a light touched me. We shared our experiences with eachother and I felt this intense sense of comfort and connectedness with this entity. I also felt like I was gifted an immense ammount of knowledge, but I couldn't take it with me when it was time to return.

I came back to my body shortly after and it felt like I really didn't have control over what I experienced. I began crying profusely.

It was really overwhelming at first. I couldn't understand what I was seeing. At first I felt disoriented, then I felt a comfort I've never felt before. After I experienced this, I felt I've had to share with just about anyone who will listen. 

Growing up I went to Catholic school but it just never worked for me. If anything, catholicism lead me to be more of an agnostic. I felt I could never deny a creator because life has always seemed too miraculous. However, after my AP experience, now it seems my beliefs line up more with Hinduism and Buddhism(I still think they are wrong too lol).

Now that I am experiencing the death of my dad, who was my best friend, I am struggling to believe in what I experienced with my AP. I am struggling to make sense of it all again.

I feel like I have been obsessed with dying since my experience. I read everything about reincarnation stories, near death experiences, other people's AP experiences and even about religious phenomena. Maybe I should get back to meditation

Out of everything that has happened to me in my life, my AP experience was the most significant. I never felt the need to return to using narcotics or alcohol because I still carry that feeling of comfort with me today. I just pray that my dad is able to experience this same comfort.

I am in no rush to leave and I don't feel afraid to die.  However, my ego seems to be more worried about those I love that pass away and what happens to them rather than worrying about where I will be going. I wish we had all the answers to life's mysteries.

I know you are safe Dad and surrounded by love now that you are gone. You were a blessing and a light to anyone who got to experience your life. Thank you to anyone who read my postFirst time AP’d tonight, I was listening to a guided meditation, "fell asleep", Woke up, went to go turn lights on, the light switch didn’t turn the electricity on so I though our fuse was broken, but then when I looked at my phone, the lock icon turned into a human and walked "off the left side of the screen" and that’s when I realized, holy shit this is AP!! I walked through the door, back in my room, took a few steps then when I tried to jump and exit the house everything spinner and I was back in bed. 

Still nonetheless this was amazing ✨🔥So like I've said in previous posts, astral projection is a matter of perspective switching like tuning into a radio; this is broken down into two very important stages that facilitate a successful projection for anyone who desires it: The Relaxation Stage and The Separation Stage. Let's seriously understand this because once you do you'll be able to custom fit your own method that will always work for you regardless of time, area, positioning, crystals, binaurual beats, mudras, incense, etc. Once you master the foundations of how this detachment of consciousness from the physical body actually works on a personal level it won't take long for it to click either because of this guide. By focusing on the two stages individually (being in the present moment), you can project after reading this post. *I posted this earlier today but deleted it because I didn't like the title*

-----

The Relaxation Stage:

Not worrying about the separation stage yet, you need to find a comfortable spot to separate which obviously is something that is specific to you. A lot of guides like to emphasize being in a quiet place but that doesn't actually matter, it's only advised because its assumedly easier with no noise (which is a unrealistic situation anyways if you live in a noisy home) but again it won't hinder your progress if you don't worry about it, same with body position. I sleep in the same room as my younger brother who plays Fortnite and watches alot of shows while I mediate laying on my back and I can still reach the mind awake body asleep state as easily as I could on the downstairs couch sitting up cross legged; caring about the noise creates a mental block that prevents you from separating. I actually use the sounds I hear to make it easier, I imagine what I'm hearing which puts me in a trance faster as if it was white noise or a binaural beat. Instead of pushing away, lean into it.

Another thing you hear is the emphasis on the breath which has merit, it's very important because the process of astral projecting is just relaxing the body so that you can shift your awareness from the physical (what your body feels like, the noises around you, the room temperature) to the non-physical and holding that focus until you pop out your body (by visualizations, looking at the darkness in your closed eyelids, other separation techniques). The focusing of the breath accomplishes both tasks of relaxing the body while keeping you aware enough to reach the hypnagogic state without falling asleep, but the problem appears when you just breathe normally because it gets boring. So what should be done? Adopt a breathing pattern. 

It gives you something to focus on long enough to fully relax the body, reaching the mind awake body asleep/void state and it works fast enough to prevent you from falling asleep too quickly. HOW you’re breathing is more important than what breathing pattern you use. The best way to explain it is feeling the air coming from your stomach when you inhale then exhale to what feels comfortable. Repeat this way of breathing while simultaneously keeping your tongue pressed to the roof of your mouth near the teeth and you’ll get to point to where you completely lose awareness of your body. Continue this breathing even further, more than you think would be necessary. After hundreds of failed attempts you learn to not take chances because you decided to get lazy. If you don’t experience the things I describe in the hypnagogic state, you need to continue focusing on the breathing pattern until you do and it will happen so trust me, been doing this for a while and yes you’ll fall asleep on some attempts but so what? Every time you practice you get better at staying awake so it’s a win-win.

What I Personally Do For The Relaxation Stage:

1. Keep my tongue pressed to the roof of my mouth near the teeth
2. Inhale from the stomach for 4 seconds through nose, Hold my breath for 7 seconds, then Exhale through the mouth for 8 seconds making a ‘whoosh’ sound (with tongue at same position)
3. I repeat this over and over not worrying about how many times I do it. Whenever I lose focus, I ask “How do I feel right now?” It pushes me deeper as I continue back to the breathing pattern.

-----

The Separation Stage:

After a few minutes of doing this breathing (the first time for me took 40 minutes but it didn’t feel like it, then on the second try I got it down to 15 minutes) you will feel different. You won’t be thinking about your body and when you do you’ll realize you’ve felt weightless for some time. You might see some irregular shapes form from the darkness behind your eyelids. You’ll lose sense of time. Hell you’ll even realize you stopped doing the breathing pattern and have to keep reminding yourself because you’re so lost in the random thoughts and imagery. You are in the hypnagogic state, the state required for bridging your awareness from walking around in the physical to flying in the astral. You get to this state instantly throughout the day when you daydream only now you’ve consciously decided to walk on this bridge. We can now continue into the last and easiest stage since you are already 98% done; The Separation Stage.

What you did just now leading up to this was priming the physical body for projecting; you've distracted yourself so much with the breathing pattern that you no longer are focused on the physical, you are now focused on the non-physical. All you have to do in the separation stage is well...separate. Get up, imagine climbing a rope up, imagine yourself floating up, try to remember a certain location with as much detail possible, etc. There are infinite possibilities for how you leave your body (see it as a dense vehicle piloted by your consciousness) so do what feels easy. In this state of awareness, the ego is silenced so any thought you make to separate will successfully facilitate a projection without doubt inhibiting progress so don't stress about hypothetical situations, the future doesn't exist yet remember so focus on the present moment; the relaxation stage then moving to the separation stage. This is what is meant by "Just let go maaaann"

What I Personally Do For The Separation Stage:

1. Now in the hypnagogic state, I do different things each time based on what feels easiest at the moment. The first time I purposely reached this state, I intuitively thought "I wanna see through my eyelids" and almost instantly my vision shifted from the darkness behind my eyelids to being able to clearly see the blue light of my alarm clock reflecting off the slanted ceiling above where my physical eyes would be looking at while at the same time physically feeling my shut eyelids. Another day I just sat up after reaching the hypagogic state again, techniques always say "feel the sensation of getting up" or some other nonsense but when you actually reach this state there's nothing to "think" about; I had the intention of getting up and I did, it was as realistic as waking life and that's when the fun begins :D

-----

That’s literally it; relaxing with breathing pattern, reaching the hypnagogic state, then separating. It’s simple which is why the ancients could do it but simplicity can easily lead to complexity when seen through the lens of overthought. Relax and practice and you’ll do great, see you later astralnauts.

Oh, and I’m making a YouTube channel talking about this type of stuff relating to consciousness and how science, religion, and spirituality all talk about the same thing but from different perspectives/conscious awarenesses. I’m uploading my first video this week about the consciousness levels (I posted a model on r/consciousness), if you wanna subscribe I’ll link it here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm0jNxxQ-b1EMIXNHfns8xg/aboutI’ve known about AP for about 6 months but started getting into it a few weeks ago. However I’ve always been a little hesitant and haven’t put much energy into it. I don’t know very much about it. I am a firm believer in your mind controlling your reality. Anyways, let’s get into the process and experience.

1. I woke up earlier than I normally do, so I was still tired
2. I let myself doze back off while repeating one question to keep my mind active- “what is my life purpose?”
3. I find myself in a lucid dream, but I don’t remember the context. It was fairly normal and there were people.
4. (TRICK) since I was lucid, I actually went up to someone in my dream and told them, “I’m actually going to astral project now.”
5. I willfully “ascend” my awareness out of the lucid dream and it goes back to my real body. It almost felt like an external force was pulling me there.
6. As awareness goes to my body, I feel an uncontrollable and strong electric buzzing/tingling throughout my body and especially my feet. This lasted for about 10 good seconds. 
7. As this is happening, I will myself to stay calm and remember the process I’ve read on the internet
8. It finally settles down and I know that I am in the astral realm, but I cannot move
9. While I could not move, I felt something guiding me and telling me that negative entities are only fear so stay confident when you get up
10. As soon as I get comfortable in this state, I immediately get up and hover over my bed. At this point I was still kinda freaking out inside, but I focused on breath control and keeping a positive mindset.
11. I walked down my hallway, and then realized I can do anything, so I flew around the country. No destination, just flying. It felt so real and nice. I could just will myself to glide through the air. 
12. In the Astral I did occasionally feel some kind of negative thing creeping up on me but the guiding voice constantly told me to stop feeling fear and just focus on the positivity
12. I woke up out of nowhere. 

The lucid dream was far hazier than the AP. I simply had greater awareness in the Astral realm

I don’t know very much about all of this so I would love to hear comments and feedback, and answer questions! Happy to share my experience with everyoneThe excitement is overwhelming right now, just as much as the experience! I’m still fairly new here and discovered the practice about a month ago. I have been able to lucid dream since I was in high school but this is way more different. 

I can usually wake myself up with no alarm so when I do and go back to sleep, this is when I try to AP. The first time the vibrations and the unknown channeled fear in me so I backed out. But after the 4th attempt or so I decided to just give in. So, I wake up and decide I’ll AP no hesitation. I close my eyes and feel the vibrations pretty quickly. After a while and a lot of mental preparation they’ve become kinda cool and easy to channel. They came and settled then I started hearing weird noises. Kinda sounded like I was being prepped for take off with someone guiding me. Then I separate from my body in a downward direction, like I went through my bed. The feeling was unlike anything I’ve felt but it was seamless, except I got stuck at my knees haha. The noises and voices saw I got stuck like arial control reporting issues. I then relaxed and became unstuck. Then my eyes opened on my bed and I head a voice that said “Hi I’m Daniel” I was a bit nervous and I couldn’t talk or move to much. Kinda like when you have a nightmare and you’re too scared, feeling paralyzed. I think it might’ve been because I didn’t know how to move this other body quite yet. I actually ended up rolling out and I was about to talk and move! I looked around my room, everything was fuzzy and no one was there. I was kinda sad that I didn’t find Daniel, but I wanted to explore. I went to the door and try to push it but it felt like any other door in reality (I excepted my hand to go through), but I concentrated and I was able to float through it! After that I wasn’t at home anymore, I was in someone else living room. I have a suspicion that this maybe my gfs house but I’ve never actually been there (we have a long distance relationship) and only seen it on FaceTime. However, I didn’t realize it wasn’t my own living room. I intend to see my girlfriend while APing but not that quickly. After that I tried floating through the ceiling because I wanted to go outside, but I ended up opening my eyes and it was over. 

The whole thing was possible because of the practice I’ve been doing and the determination I’ve been setting forth. I’ve been telling myself that I will AP for a couple weeks now and here we are! But I still have so many questions, who was daniel? Was that really my gfs living room? And why didn’t I look in the mirror or eat something (I guess I got caught up in the moment)! Well, I just wanted to share my experience and I had to write it down. If you made it to the end thank you for reading, and If you feel your close to AP just keep practicing and one night you’ll get there! I wish you all luck with your goals of reaching the astral plane and the goals you may have when there! Stay safe everyone!

Edit: I was awarded my first awards ever, thank y’all so much!!! I hope my experience can help or motivate some of you achieve AP!So I have a friend who passed away back in 1997. About 5 years ago I dreamt about him visiting me in my room. I was having a casual conversation with him and the setting of my dream was really in my room. He even looked at my laptop and he told me how advance technology has become. He even looked at my family photos on the wall and asked me if those are my kids at the photo. The strange thing is the setting of my dream. It’s really in my room and the way my rooms looks is the same as in my dream. Did I AP and talked to my deceased friend? The other strange thing is I called his sister right after that and she told me it was his death anniversary. I didn’t even know that. So was that AP or something else?We have two perspectives here:

1) What you see in AP is manifested internally, within your mind.

2) What you see in AP is literally happening in the external world.

I'm going to attempt to explain how **both** points of view are true simultaneously and how there is little difference between them. In doing so, hopefully the concept gains more traction in this sub, or at least opens a wider channel of discussion on the matter.

In asking whether AP is objectively real, many fail to realize that everything you see around you that you have convinced yourself is "objective, external waking reality" is *already* a manifestation of your mind. The outer projection of everything you experience is a result of your inner state. Astral projection however, is the mind unrestrained from the sensory input of your body. That's why the main technique for entering the astral state is keeping ones mind awake while the body (and its sense organs) fall asleep.

It isn't common intuition that everything you see "outside" of you - in the "real" world - is literally all happening in your head. Information is gathered from the environment via sensory organs (in the form of a spectrum of vibrations), transformed into bio-electrical signals, transmitted to the brain and then translated into something coherent inside your skull. So everything you typically think of as waking reality is constructed within the brain...however, it should be considered that **there may be no fundamental difference between inside and outside if we can grasp that the mind actually and fundamentally has no limits.** This is the key. As Robert Bruce puts it in his book *Astral Dynamics*, it is impossible to point to where your mind is *not*. 

This is something I think many people in this sub don't fully grasp. They think it has to be one or the other, not understanding that if the universe exists entirely through self-awareness, then both scenarios can be true.

Let me reiterate: *it is impossible to point to where your mind is* ***not***.

> It is my considered opinion that when you have a dream, an OBE, or a lucid dream, you are not actually moving outside the boundaries of your own mind, because your mind has no boundaries or limits (apart from your own beliefs). -Robert Bruce

If it's the case that your mind extends beyond the physical limits of the brain, then it can reasonably be speculated that dreams and reality are the same kind of phenomena, just expressed to differing degrees. Its just that the "real", waking world seems to be held firmly in place only because it's a projection of *everybody else's minds too*, and we all implicitly and explicitly agree on rules that govern how the "external" world should be. Remove physical sense organs from the equation and those rules become irrelevant - and you're left with astral projection. 

The point: *You astral project literally into the external world, which itself is an extension of the mind* (be it your mind or the collective mind). Except this side of the external world isn't held solid by physical observation, yet it persists "externally" nonetheless.
 

If you're *still* not getting it, I did a quick crop of [a page out of Robert Bruces book Astral Dynamics](https://imgur.com/R6aiBAf) which covers this idea in the very first chapter. This book is referenced heavily in the stickied "beginners" post at the top of this sub, so it's surprising to me that this concept has managed to slip through the cracks.

This short TED talk by Donald Hoffman helps explain the root concept in more scientific terms, [Do we see reality as it is?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY) (though he doesn't discuss dreaming/AP, only how your mind constructs "external" reality internally).

You can also look to things like philosophical idealism, eastern philosophical concepts and panpsychism. Within Hermeticism an entire chapter of the Kybalion is devoted to the assertion that "All is Mind". 

> "What do you understand by the word 'dream'? Is not the dream something like a drama, a play?...To one who really understands what has been said here, a dream is no different from what is seen in the waking state: both are plays of consciousness...We call one thing the waking state, another thing the dream, but in essence both are events happening in the consciousness and essentially they are not different." –Sri Nisargadatta MaharajHere’s the link for the npr article 

Edit: For those who don’t want to read the whole thing. The “rhythm” refers to a sequence of electric pulses that causes a “decoupling” of body and mind.

This is probably the biggest news this community has received since the gateway protocol. 

Don’t be dismayed by science backing up what many have known for decades. Be open to new interpretations.

I have a cool story to tell you about my friend. Let's call her Maddie. 

Maddie is from the UK, and has been astral projecting since she was about 5. 

When Maddie was in her teens she asked her astral guides to show her the man she would marry and spend the rest of her life with. They told her his name was Martin. Maddie would tell her parents all  the time she was going to marry Martin. 

A few years later she started to meet a guy regularly while astral projecting. They would meet up every week and fly around different countries or areas and just talk. He told her his full name (indeed Martin), and she also shared her name.

After a year, Martin said he wanted to try to contact her in real life. He gave her his address and said he would try to find her on Facebook. He noted he was from Uganda. 

The next day Maddie went to find him on Facebook using his details and address, however she had already received a friend request from a Martin along with a message.

She opened the message from him and he had described all their astral adventures and memories 
to a tee, and that he was from Uganda. He sent her photos and he looked exactly like his form she had seen in the astral travel from her guides. For about a year they called and video chatted and she then flew over to Uganda to see him.

She said she has never felt such a connection with a person before. They astral projected again together most days while she was over there. They are now engaged and she plans to move to Uganda (she loved it there). 

I see pictures of them all the time on Facebook now and they look really happy together. 

It's funny how she met what she believes to be her soulmate through astral travel. Amazing story. 

Edit: 

For anyone who disbelieves me, please join the Facebook group 'Astral Projection and Psychic Experience'. 'Maddie' (changed for privacy reasons), runs this group and she often shares her story on there.

Her and Martin comment on each other's posts on there and you will be able to see the love they have for each other .Hello friends, I see a lot of posts in this sub that people often claim either they are possed/controlled by some "things" or someone in their head, etc. I mean maybe I should have minded my own business but since their number seems strongly growing and they have a bad influence on people who are new on this and who have a lot of questions in their mind, so I wanted to create this post with the idea that might be helpful for some of them. First of all, you all need to understand that the human brain is so interesting and can't be predictable. Also on the road to achieving this goal, we go through a lot of phases (REM, easy to be manipulated by noises, feelings, visuals, etc.) that we have no idea some of them are real or not because our brain just creates things and THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT IT DOES. So let me explain what you guys do; People who have already a problematic psychological background,  (I know this because I always check their activities in the other subs, and literally all of them are also active in the subs like gangstalking, targetedenergyweapons or seriously problematic subs and posts, etc etc. you know what I mean) come here and try AP to find hope of their problems or have some problems on the road of AP. But instead of seeking some professional help or educating themselves about it, they just create posts with a lot of questions, which is normal of course because that's why this community exists, but instead of taking our advice, just keep claiming that they are under the control of some things and keep pushing that idea and also giving some serious doubts of new members of this community. Please do not take this as an offense. In order to get rid of some doubts like what is possible or not, you have to educate yourself about it. If you have some serious doubts just read the books of Robert Monroe and Willaim Buhlman. Also, we are so lucky because we have a lovely person, Rick, who has been doing AP since he was a child and also has a youtube channel about it. (Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVk\_OmMmRs0RnmOQTHXyrA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVk_OmMmRs0RnmOQTHXyrA))  These people are/were masters on AP. They all try to educate people and help them about it. Think about it, some people who regularly achieve AP, doing this with love and passion. But you, my friend, who either never achieved a real one or not master it, also decline people's help and keep acting like you sure about it which is ridiculous. At the end of the day, we all have to face our decisions and consequences. And nobody will give a fuck about it but you. Even the loved ones can help only until at some certain point. 

Lastly, I know sometimes it's been hard and for some of us, it has always been hard since childhood. I had some problems also and I just wanted to help you and avoiding the possible information pollution. And I suggest to this sub and mods that we have to take care of some posts because like I said seeking help: of course, but instead of taking advice and insisting about some things: dangerous. It gives serious doubts about the new members of the community. Thank you for reading it, I do not want to be harsh but we have some serious problems about this sub I believe. I'd like to see your ideas about it!Everybody has their reasons for travelling in the astral plane. Some people like to view there akashic records, some people like to experience the other side of the veil, or some people wish to seek out their loved ones who have passed. 

In a lot of cases when you encounter a deceased loved one it can simply be manifestation of your own. It can also be a negative entity posing as your loved one to steal energy from you.  In this case you're extremely vulnerable and just seeing your loved one brings enough emotion that makes you want to believe that this experience is legit.

If you are astral projecting an encounter a deceased loved one, a way to know for sure is to ask them a question that only they would know. Because you're speaking with your thoughts telepathically, as you ask the question to them in your mind think of a ridiculous false answer. If they answer the question truthfully it most likely is them, if they repeat the ridiculous answer that you were thinking of in your brain, you know they are false.

For those of you who do not know how to astral project and simply just encounter them in a dream it is still easy to know for sure if it is actually them.  If you remember a glow around them and either wake up in tears or felt really moved by the experience, it usually means you made legit connection. Overall in my opinion the best way to go about this is reach out through your spirit guides.

Wanting to talk to my mom and see her again was one of the reasons I became interested in astral projection. It was only after a lot of attempts that I finally found a true connection. I found myself talking to my mom but she never acted like herself, or it was basically a demon in disguise taking advantage of my vulnerability wanting to drain my energy. It was only till I invoked my spirit guides for the first time prior to a projection that I met her for the very first time.

One night as I lay down waiting for the vibrations to kick in, I set my intention to make a connection with my mom and called upon my Spirit guides for protection and assistance. Shortly after, I felt my guides trying to help me out of my body. The feeling feels like a vacuum trying to suck you out of your body, something that would freak you out if you didn't know who or what it was, but since I always call upon my guides before projecting I knew it was them.  I was in a trance state that I was only half projected out of my body still laying in my bed, I was able to hear and vaguely see the other side of the veil.

Above me as I laid on my bed I saw one of my spirit guides. After talking to her about my life, she told me that she had a present for me. Because Spirit guides look after you, and because I set my intention, I could tell that she knew that I was trying to make a connection with my mom. She told me that she had a present for me. I could then hear and feel the presence of my mom and spirit guide. I heard my mom go silent after I told her that I missed her and loved her.  My spirit guide told me that she was crying. I then heard my mom cry and then tell me that she loves me.  She reached out her hand and I held it. I felt very emotional and the crying took me out of the trance state. I went back to my physical body.

After laying down in my bed going over what had just happened in my mind I wanted to make more of a connection with her.  As I laid down the vibrations came in almost immediately.  I seen my spirit guide and she reached out to me with her hand. I took her by the hand and she took me really quickly through what seems like a bunch of different realms or dimensions until I found myself in a large room. There was a TV next to a couch with really tall ceilings.  In front of me was a spirit guide, but not The same Spirit guide that took me there, but a different one. Behind her on the couch was my mom. I was so happy to see her as I knew for the first time this was actually her.

 I went and sat down beside her on the couch and held her hand. I remember asking her if she's been to the astral plane and she said yes, I remember talking to her about different things and remember hearing her laugh. She sounded like her sister, my auntie Joanne, which is funny to me because she used to always tell me that she thought that she sounded just like her. So it would only make sense that that is what she would sound like. 

 As we sat down on this couch hand in hand, the couch started flying up through the ceiling above this house.  I looked over at my mom as she smiled. I remember the couch moving over these tall bushes and my mom looked at me and said "hey Derek look we're controlling this with our minds!". Above us was a clear night sky with stars. I felt embraced with love and this feeling is unexplainable in words. Communcating with my mom, the mom I knew before the long battle of cancer, was an amazing feeling.  This is the mom I remember, not the one fighting the battle. This experience was something from the movies. Finally after so many failed attempts of self manifestations and false shapeshifting energy vampires,  I had finally made a legitimate connection.  And I owe it to my spirit guides.I (24F) wanted to share this experience, as I’m still trying to make sense of it.

For context, I’ve been trying to astral project for weeks now, and have been going through some major existential and spiritual crisis. Everything I thought I knew of the world around me was stripped away a few weeks ago. I decided to go to one of those saltwater float tanks where you can enter deep meditation without outside stimulation. I also brought my sodalite and rose quartz with me. Whether you believe this is a mind trick or a real spiritual experience, I can at least assure you this did happen. Whether it was in my mind or actually happening, I don’t know. It felt very real to me though, NOT like a normal dream I’ve ever had.

I closed my eyes and the next thing I remember was moving through lights, there was tons of lights all around me. I was moving incredibly fast through the lights too, and all of a sudden it halted and was completely black, empty space. At this point, I kept trying to separate my spirit from my physical self. My spirit would sit up a few inches, but would quickly fall back down into my body.  Trying to separate my spirit from my body felt “gooey”, I can’t describe it any other way.  This is when I first noticed I was separating from my body though, and I knew I was astral projecting.

Finally, my eyes were completely closed, but I was literally sitting up and turned around to see myself in the tank. Next thing I know I was watching my body floating in darkness from the ceiling. Even though it was dark I could see my body perfectly. This is when it got entirely strange.

I remember watching my body be surrounded by 4 light beings. 1 was smaller and felt “younger??” than the other 3. I felt they were ancestors that had passed, and/or spirit guides. They were otherworldly though, but not in a creepy way, I felt they were there to help me. I had feelings of a deep love run through me. I remember them giving some advice, but they weren’t speaking. It was like we could read each others minds. It sounds insane I know, I wouldn’t believe it if it did not happen to me. They mentioned something about me eating healthier. Also reminded me to be nicer in general, but especially to my family. They told me I need to pursue music still. And the final advice was for me to stop worrying about life after death. They really drove that point home, that I don’t need to be scared about dying. They said I don’t need to have the answers to my existence in this lifetime, but I did get the feeling there was a larger purpose to everything. 

They let me quickly look at what my spirit/higher self looks like. It was light that looked similar to my physical body, but perfected, golden, and made completely of light. I realized that I had CHOSE to look that way. Like I could make my spirit shift into anything, but I wanted it to look like this. I felt appreciation for this physical body that I’ve never felt. They then faded away and I just sat near the ceiling and watched myself float.

Next thing I know I was awakened by a loud crashing noise?? and I jolted up back in my body. The room was so dark  and quiet I couldn’t see or hear a thing.

Do other people ever see these light beings? Also do people normally awake to loud sounds when astral projecting? I haven’t read too many stories on astral projections. I’ve only read up on how to do astral projection and the spiritual/emotional benefits. 

Anyways, thanks for letting me share this experience. This is just the start to my spiritual journey. Let me know what you make of my experience. I came out of it feeling so weird, but better than I’ve been feeling. I was in the tank for an hour earths timing, but it felt somewhere between a second and an eternity that this all happened.Just putting my two cents here for everyone else.

It's not like lucid dreaming.

It's not like imagining.

It's not like shamanic journeying.

You are straight up, yourself, physically, in the astral plane.

You'll know when it happens. It's completely different to everything else.

In my experience, I was floating on the roof of my room.Theres no way people just don't know about this stuff it must be intentionally being kept out of public knowledge. I feel like we live on an evil planet run by evil people who want to keep us in the dark. It's like we're NK of the wider universe.Firstly, I want to point out that it is 100% fine to be a skeptic. You would be dead by now if you believed in everything and anything you have heard of. Soo yes, the skeptics deserve to have their questions answered, not harrassed.

1. Theoretical science DOES approve AP. The current most accepted theory of everything, the string theory, needs 11 dimensions to work properly, which means that the 5th dimension, aka the astral plane is real and does exist.

2. The size of the community. There are nearly 200k members in r/astralprojection, lets say that only 10k of them are active and have APd. Would you expect 10000 random people to lie and fake their experiences for no absolute reason at all? 

3. CIA documents. CIA has AP documents that are published on their own website. https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/nsa-rdp96x00790r000100030004-1
The document describes astral projection in great detail and does in fact say that the tests were successful and that the high ranking officials should get a quick emergency gathering to talk about AP in terms of national security and espionage.

4. History. AP has been documented for thousands of years.

5. Our conscious experience of the world is literally an illusion. There are no colors, only certain wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes gather and our brains translate. There are no sounds, just the vibrations of the air around Us. Our brain just creates the reality around us with the information that it can gather.

6. My experience. I have APd atleast 10 times now. I try each night, sometimes i fall asleep, sometimes I only reach the vibrational stage and I dont leave my body entirely. But once a while I succeed. Each night I get further, my experiences get longer and more fascinating. My first experience lasted about 5-10 seconds max. My previous experience lasted up to a minute if i had to guess. I swear on everything I have and ever will have that those are not lies and actual experiences ive had, whether they are dreams or something more is up to debate.

Also sorry for any broken english, not my language.I’ve been going through a massive physical/mental/spiritual shift recently due to me discovering that I was misdiagnosed with ADHD as a child. The stimulants I was taking for 18 years fucked my brain up, but the new path I’m on has led me to become very spiritual. 

I have been trying to AP for a couple months now and finally had my first breakthrough. 

I used the hemi-sync gateway experience on YouTube and BOY did it work wonders. I was able to completely disconnect from my body, but I noticed I wasn’t able to control where I wanted to go. All of a sudden, I got sucked up out of my apartment and into space, looking down on Earth. 

Confused as hell, I looked to my left and saw this incredible angel, glowing with white and gold light. She told me she was my spirit guide and said,

 “Your spirit is all that matters. Don’t get distracted by the physical. Everything you have thought about the world is true and you will learn in time. Use the physical world as a way to fuel your spirit, but that your spirit is all you take with you into the next life.”

It was so vivid and so clear, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I’m not strong enough yet to hold onto the experience, so I found myself back in my apartment short after that. I ended up seeing myself sleeping and right then, the voice told me to wake up and I shot out of bed and instantly recorded what I saw. 

Can’t wait to experience the next hemi-sync tomorrow night, but man, what a fucking experience that was. 

LINK: https://youtu.be/ze2jcwu4ddAI listened to a few gateway experience tapes, took out my headphones, and proceeded to just fall asleep like normal. It was my first time listening to these tapes. They had a strange effect on me. Something was going on, maybe something subliminal. Not sure. Anyways. I had a very weird, vivid "dream", that I was in a desert, with pyramids. But it was like I was being shown something like an observer. I saw Egypt, I think as it were a very, very long time ago. I saw the pyramids, lining up with celestial objects, like they were ancient telescopes or something. They said something about the pyramid and mars, a Stairway to "heaven", a link between celestial bodies, something about Mars and a 3 day transitionary period, of a key time. Then something about a Meridian, an energy line in the middle of earth, to tap into it. Then something about SETH or the cult of SETH, ask SETH for guidance. After that Something showed me a planetary weapon called, " the claw of GOD. " Something that would destroy planets. Basically melting them down in vertical lines from top to bottom. I think there was more. I just woke up and I am in chills.I was afraid. I’m finally admitting that. I’m not afraid of anything potentially bad happening in the plane. I know it’s our natural state, but what I feared was the realization of the truth. I know AP is real. And I know it’s unbelievably powerful, beyond anything in our human understanding. I know it’s beautiful. But I was scared to surrender myself and become vulnerable into the faith of the universe. I know I’ll be alright. But that’s always been a hard thing for me to do in my waking life. I’ve always wondered why I couldn’t project. But now I know. It’s because I wasn’t opening my heart up to it. I was scared it will be too intense. I tend to avoid any situations that allow me to feel anything a all. If there ever comes a day where I do “step” into the plane, it will be a life changing and emotional experience. I learned the need to let go in order to open my heart to the universe and accept it’s love. I am beyond thankful for this realization. This awakening brought me to tears. I now know the universe loves me.  

I am setting intentions that whoever is reading this will feel the acceptance of love, the way I felt it while writing this. Happy travels. You’re not alone. 

P.s. the way I had written this post originally was present tense, as in, ex: “I’m scared” - as in that is my current state throughout the entire text. After finishing, prior to publishing, I went back to change everything to past tense. Words are powerful!You may think this as...um..well.. unusual.  

But are planets like earth, alive beings? 

Think of it as the same way as humans.
Microbes, cells, and everything else work to create us, humans. 

Yet without deeper understanding of science and microscopes, we would've never known these cells and microbes exist. Even though they keep us alive.

Well, Earth has everything to keep it "alive" 

Plants, animals and water all keep Earth a "living" planet. 

Have you, in your experience of the astral realm..tried to find a deeper understanding of planets? Are they higher beings? Something we humans can't comprehend? 

Mere Cells can't comprehend the human body, yet...they make it alive. We are the "mere cells" which keep Earth alive yet can't fully understand it in the physical realm. When I mean "us" I'm still talking about plants, animals and....water. 


Are Planets entities in a sort? They don't have to have knowledge, or a thinking mind. They could be just..."mere cells" in a deeper...

more complex system. 
 
They follow rules, and stick, like cells. 




.............So...........Is The Universe.....an entity? 

Cells after cells after "cells" work deeper and smaller, from galaxies, to suns, to planets, to natural beings, to microbes, to atoms...... 

What...is...this? 

Are we living in a entity itself? The universe? Can we make an effort to understand what all this is about? Is death a mere illusion?  

Is Life a...mere..illusion? 

What can we figure out from Astral Projection?I don't know what else to say or how to explain it  but it's not the first time it happened lol and  it felt so good

Also... I just realized that if I'm a virgin.. does it means that I basically lost my virginity to myself....?One of the major causes of failure when it comes to AP is derived from a heavily rooted conception we have of this phenomenon: the idea that during AP we "project" or "transfer" our consciousness to the astral plane, getting it out of its fleshy vessel. Although this may or may not be true, I have found that this idea becomes a hindrance for the practice of AP in people who can't leave their bodies. The reason is quite simple: when you think that you are in your body and you have to get out of it, you put a lot of responsibility on yourself. You feel that if you don't do it, if you don't do this miracle of leaving the body, then you will remain there. This is really bad, for you start to doubt whether you will be able to do it or not, and you also feel a tremendous haste for immediate results, because the more you are doing the technique, the more uncomfortable with the idea of failure you will be. This goes on and on.

To solve this problem I have come with a simple trick that one can add to any AP technique (although it has more natural affinity with the Rope Technique), which consists of thinking the other way around: instead of You moving towards the astral plane, it moves towards You. This simple idea can change dramatically the way you react emotionally to an upcoming projection. Basically it's about replacing this unnatural idea of having to leave your body by deliberately getting out of it, replacing it with a more relaxed idea: the astral plane coming towards you. This will put you in a more passive role, allowing you to approach the practice with more calmness, serenity and openness to the outcome. In other words, instead of trying to "go" to the astral plane you allow it to approach you, therefore you stop worrying about everything (e.g. you stop having haste, because you don't have to arrive there, it comes to you instead; you don't worry about doing it right or wrong, for it is the astral plane who goes towards you, etc). Unbound by the emotions, thoughts and the feeling of responsibility that ruin all chances of success, you enhance your results. 

 So if you feel attracted to this idea, and have difficulties with having your first OBE, try the following version of the Rope Technique: When you use your imagination to climb the rope, don't try to "pull yourself out" of body by doing so. Instead, try to pull the astral plane towards you, imagining that this rope comes from the astral realm. Feel the calmness that derives from not being the one that has to move, and enjoy this passivity as you pull the astral plane in your direction. At the same time, stop feeling your physical body and the physical world by deliberately ignoring them. Get immersed in the act of pulling the astral plane towards you via the rope, and open to this subtle world as if you were an enormous vessel that's about to contain (perceive) it. Get rid of the extrange and complex idea of "moving outside your own body", replacing it with the more natural feeling of the astral plane approaching you, the same way as the emotional plane and the mental plane invade you pretty much every day all day with incursive emotions and thoughts, respectively. Feel how it is the physical plane that LEAVES you as the astral COMES to you. The resulting sentation of bliss will dissipate all anxiety and difficulty to leave the body.

Of course, this can be applied to any other AP technique, for it has to do with the very on idea of the projection of awareness, not with a particular technique (although it fits perfectly well with the rope technique in my opinion). So if you feel that your own emotions, thoughts or feelings are preventing you from having an OBE because of the pressure you put on yourself to "do" it, try this instead. This will dispel the illusion that it is you who has to do the insane act of leaving your body, and replace it with the idea that the astral plane comes to you naturally, just as any other phenomenon showing up in the temple of your being.I have successfully APd about 20 times. Just ask me questions here if you are interested in anything.

Doing this because I want to help as many as possible.If you're concerned about if ap is real just try it. 

Also if you do happen to do it and you believe it's all in your head then I implore you to try and visit high security locations such as Area 51 or the Vatican.

When you can't get in ask yourself why it is that your own mind has decided you can't visit such places and even put up guards to stop you.

In closing, ap allows you to do impossible and endless things. Have a fun time.

Edit: just because the guards can stop you doesn't mean that you can't get in. Fight your way in if you so choose or find a different method. Also make sure to ask some more experienced ap-ers b4 you do.I woke up at 2:22
I woke up at 3:33
I woke up at 4:44 with a burning in my chest. It was like anxiety pain x10. It got so bad that I had to get out of bed and vomit. When I laid back down, my entire chest started to vibrate. I heard a ringing in my ears so loud it hurt. It all hurt, honestly. I remember thinking that I didn’t care what happened, but I just wanted the ringing to stop. And then this being (?) was in my room and it picked me up out of my body. I was laying in fetal position and it picked me up like a baby and took me out of my body. I remember floating. And then it took me to this room with a giant window. Outside of it was the most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen before. We just sat and looked at it for awhile. I remember feeling like THIS was my reality. It was so much clearer than anything I’d ever experienced before. I remember telling the being that I was ready. That I don’t have anything to lose back in my “real life” anymore. And then it felt like it gave me a “smile” and just sent me back. 

Can anyone give me some feedback on this experience? I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve heard about astral projection, but not a huge practicer. So if there is another place you could point me to get more answers that would be great.Okay so in my previous post which went number 1 upvote on Reddit, so thanks on that guys! In my previous post, I gave information about my strategy on astral projecting and initiating sleep paralysis. A lot of people had questions and I didn't go super in-depth, I only went in-depth on the initial experience, so here's me going in-depth on my strategy!

&#x200B;

This is the strategy! It has three stages to it, so follow each stage and you may succeed!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginner Strategy First Stage!: The main goal in this strategy is to fatigue the body. The way I fatigue my self is by following this step by step strategy. First way to fatigue body. - Try to stay up till 1 or 2 A.M, and set an alarm for an early time that you're not used to waking up at. So say if you usually wake up at 10, set an alarm for 7:00 A.M. Once you wake up at the given time, your going to do something for 30 minutes to fully awake your mind but still keep the body fatigued. After that, you're going to lay back on your bed, all lights off, no noises! No fan, no binaural beats nothing, you're going to need to focus on a noise that I will inform you about.

&#x200B;

Second Stage Following Beginner Strategy: As your laying on your bed, make sure you are laying on your back, if your laying on your stomach and get sleep paralysis, it's really uncomfortable. So lay on your back and just fall back asleep, your gonna wake up multiple times, but not fully wake up. Once you fully are awake, you're going to hear a ringing in your ears, everyone will hear it! Once you hear the ringing, bring your focus to the ringing, after a couple minutes of focusing on it, the ringing will start becoming reactive. It will fade from no noise too loud and then out, you will feel a tingling sensation in your head or ears as well. As this ringing intensifies, that means your close to sleep paralysis! You're going to feel the sleep paralysis kicking in, the numbing of your body, it's going to be very strong! As soon as you feel this get ready for the separation phase!

&#x200B;

Third Stage Separation Phase: AS Soon as you feel sleep paralysis kicking in, start imagining your self climbing a rope, imagine your hands gripping the rope, feel the texture of it, make it super detailed and realistic! It's going to feel real because your body is separating while you're thinking it, so you're almost as if you're there climbing the rope. When I was doing it, it felt immensely real. As your climbing the rope, EVERYTHING In your body is going to intensify so be prepared for it! Keep doing it, climbing the rope until you know you're out of your body. IT IS IMPORTANT to start visualizing AS sleep paralysis is kicking in, not when its already done! Note - You can also imagine you on a swing, or swimming, doesn't have to be a rope! Just don't try to stand up from your bed, its going to be hard!

&#x200B;

Good luck let me know how it goes! Tell me your experiences and I will respond! :) <3Through trial and error, I have come up with a formula to reach the vibrational state almost every time. I have tried this formula and it has worked twice in a row. When I look back at my successful attempts, I recall using this method without being conscious that I was doing it. The method is as follows:

First, you want to be caught up with sleep. If you have a sleep deficit and you are tired, this method will likely not work because you will fall too deep into sleep and forget that you are trying to astral project.

Either use the wake back to bed method, or take a nap shortly after waking up for the day, I tend to get lazy and fall asleep when doing the wake back to bed method, so I prefer taking a nap (and so does Robert Monroe). Lay on your back on either your bed, a couch, whatever. Just make sure you are comfortable.

1. start relaxing as much as you can. Breathe deeply, focus on each body part, and try to relax it, use hypnosis on yourself, whatever. Just. Keep. Relaxing.
2. Eventually, you will want to start paying attention to any voices/sounds that you hear in your head. When you focus on these sounds, it will almost seem like these sounds are coming from nowhere. I tend to hear people talking, I focus on what they are saying. At first, they will only say one word, as you relax more and more, you will start hearing full sentences. 
3. try not to force thought. You want to try to not think of anything, and let your subconscious thoughts take over. By listening in for voices, music, etc, you are not thinking but rather letting your conscious mind rest while listening in for sentences that "seem to come from nowhere".
4. During all of this, you want to be telling yourself that you are going to astral project. Tell yourself things like: "I astral project all the time" "It is easy for me to astral project" "I astral project without trying" etc.
5. Eventually, you will start falling asleep. You can tell if you are falling asleep if you get a random thought, and think that it relates to what you are doing. You will likely then think "how tf did I make that connection?" This is a good sign you are heading for sleep.
6. Head for sleep. At this point, you will likely fall asleep and start dreaming, and you will be relying on your subconscious to wake you up to astral project. If you do not seem to be getting any more relaxed while laying on your back, then roll over onto your side and continue relaxing deeper and deeper, constantly affirming that you are going to astral project and that it is easy for you to astral project. Keep doing this no matter how awake you feel, and believe me, you will likely feel like you WILL NOT go to sleep, but you will.
7. At some point during your dream, you will either realize you are not dreaming or you will remember your goal, at that point you will likely get taken back into your body.
8. Focus on the hypnogogic sounds. Listen in on the sounds and do not be afraid. Being afraid will ruin this state. Just listen to the sound and try to relax more and more. I made a couple of sound files of what you may hear, I recommend listening to them so that you know what to expect. Sound files >>>> [https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526). Start from the bottom of the list going up.
9. Do an exit method, such as rope technique or roll over. 

It may take you a while to finally exit, but this method will help you at least reach the vibrational state and experience what it is like. If you are afraid of the vibrational state, then you need to get there and just MAINTAIN it, don't try to astral project, just stay in that state and make sure that you are relaxing with it. As long as you are relaxing with the vibrations and hypnogogic noises, you will maintain them. You can maintain them, as far as I know, indefinitely.

Pro tip: you do not want to move throughout this whole process. Not even if you have an itch.

If you have any questions or experiences that you'd like to share, be sure to join our official [Astral Lounge Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PYmWjXfkH2).I decided to make this post in case that someone may find it useful. 

For me, Astral Projection meant much more. I needed to confirm that there is something more, that we are something more, that we are not just flesh and blood. That while our scientists try to go to mars, some of you have already been there. While they want to explore our galaxy, there are already some of you that have seen it with their own sight. There is so much more to this that I can not possibly put it into words. So much potential for a better world. 

Let's go back two years in the past. It was autumn, that morning I had school at 07:15 AM. So I woke up around 6 AM. I tried the Phase technique, I cycled through techniques until I felt something, like increasing vibrations while being drowsy, as If I told myself: "It is time". I immediately rolled over, and as I was rolling over I felt something that I described as full body orgasm of incredible sensations, it was simply magnificent... And there I was on my knees on the floor next to the bed. Since I couldn't see, I asked for clarity. As I look around my room everything was grey, I said: "Holy shi.. this is real, THIS SHI.. IS REAL!". I turned to my right and there it was, my physical body laying on the bed. Then out of nowhere, I was being pulled towards my body, I used all my will to resist and get out of there. I went through the door, the feeling was weird but familiar at the same time. I levitated out of my building, when I was outside the colors appeared, but they were more brighter and intense. I forgot to mention that I felt more like myself there than I was in the physical world. I wanted to fly so bad, so I did. I flew around the neighborhood, but at a low altitude. For some reason, I could not fly higher. Since my goal was to prove to myself that this is real and to fly. I started losing concentration and went back to my physical body feeling like a million dollars, I was rested but full of energy. You can imagine my face at the school half an hour later. 

That was my second day of trying to Astral Project. Thank you for reading this, I will see you in the Astral <3When this happened to me as a kid I tried really hard to tell myself it was just a dream but there were too many physical facts telling me it wasn't. 

I was 8/10, woke up in the middle of the night to my room exactly as it was in reality, with a pair of glowing red eyes staring at my from the bottom of the bed. I stared back, and eventually my eyes adjusted to the dark and I could see it was a woman in her thirties, and I just /knew/ it was me in the future. Older me smiled. As I came to this realization, older me reached down and pet my cat fluffy and I heard her purr. I didn't feel threatened, but I was obviously scared, so I pulled the covers over my head and just tried to go back to sleep. I woke up with the covers still over my head the next morning. 

It seems like I may have astral projected to the past to visit myself, but this also leaves questions like how I was able to see myself, my eyes needed to adjust to the dark, and my cat purring in response. Yall have any thoughts?There is a giant rock carving structure thing called [The Gate of The God’s](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhgvxO8CWu51_BolHusQPKtIZSkBdvRivzivR6v1lETiTu4QKlv9qm7xQ&s=10). I saw this in the Netflix documentary called ‘Ancient Aliens’. It’s said to have an immense amount of electromagnetic energy (it is located in the ‘zone of silence’ where many UFO sightings and other weird occurrences have happened including consistent meteor strikes). The Peruvian Shamans say there was a man some time ago (thousands or hundreds I’m not sure) who possessed this ‘key’ that fell from the sky and it was made of gold and other materials. They said he put the key into that small circle you can see in the middle of the keyhole shaped door (might not see it but you have to zoom) and he essentially vanished into thin air. They speculate it is a wormhole into another time/place/dimension. I have never been able to project anywhere past my front door so I put it to you guys to explore this place. I think you could learn a lot of things there!I had a AP  where i went into a hall where at the end lord ganesha was. He looked happy and exactly like in the google pictures. I am christian and never thought about him before. He talked with me but unfortunitaly i forgot what he said. I am upset about myself cause of that. For me that was an important spiritual experience. I am praying to lord ganesha everynight now same as to my old gods. Any similar experiences?I just did it for the first time (first time on purpose anyway)! I'm so jazzed, haha. It really is possible to do! My feet got stuck in my body, but i could see myself, my son, and my husband.

I used the WBTB method. I got up 4 hours after sleeping, drank some weak Chai tea, read an article on my phone, then went back to sleep on my back with the intention of projecting. 

I woke up to my alarm a couple of hours later, turned it off, then tried projecting to a location. That didn't work, so I tried again by invisioning the mirror in my bathroom. Didn't work either, but it DID put me into the vibrational state. Full body vibrations that felt GOOD. Slightly different from what I've been experiencing in meditation. 

Anyway, from there I invisioned a ball chain hanging above my belly where my hands were - like the chain on a ceiling fan. The longer I imagined it, the more real it became. More detailed, as tho it were right in front / above me. Still vibrating, I could just barely reach out and grab it with both hands. I was having some trouble pulling myself out, there was this resistance. I could feel the pain from the chain digging into my hands. So I decided to sit up and see what happens. 

So I sat up. It felt like I actually physically sat up, but I still had the chain, so I kept pulling. It felt like I pulled myself to standing, like I was really standing on my bed. I got impatient, and sort of opened my eyes, then looked behind me.. And I was out of my body!! It was unnerving to see myself like that. 

I couldn't get my feet out of myself though. I tried pulling the chain again. Definitely stuck. 

Then my son kicked me, and it kicked my consciousness back into my body. It felt like I could do it again, but I was too excited and wanted to tell someone about it. 

Anyway, keep trying!

Happy trails 💙Sleep paralysis plagued me for years since I was a kid and i fucking hated it because it made me so scared.

With time I learned to keep my calm and would just relax and go back to sleep but now I discovered this sub and I was shocked to see how sleep paralysis is basically right before astral projection and now I feel cheated.

I'll definitely try to do it next time I get sleep paralysis. I can actually induce the paralysis easily by sleeping on my back. Hopefully it works out! It's just difficult getting over the fear of what kinda stuff or beings I'll see if I astral project.

Biggest fear would be I leave my body, and just see all types of things in my room just watching me sleep. I'd might as well pass away from the fear lol.I have AP'd my whole life (34f) but never really thought much of it or had much control over it, it just happens randomly and I go with the flow. 

Lately I have been more in tune with it and trying to have better control over things like walking or where Im going etc which are usually not successful, I struggle, its hard work! I have the most success when its random and Im like yewwww lets go.

So I felt AP come on, rolled out of my body as usual and was really excited and was hurdling through the sky really fast not knowing where i was going, tried to put my arms out infront of me like superman which I have never done before and felt that gravitational pull downwards like I ruined the AP and was heading back to my physical body but something was holding me up which confused me so I turned behind me and looked and it was a 30-40yr old Asian looking man, didnt get where in Asia he was from so don't want to guess until I see him again and can ask. He was wearing a light blue button office shirt and was very clean cut (compared to me who has tatts, coloured hair and dresses alternative) He had a big grin on his face and said hi and told me to not move, I felt safe in his presence like I've known him forever so I did what he said and went with his lead.


We came back to the ground, Somewhere on earth, and there were a lot of trees surrounding this beautiful old stone house/building which was kind of t shaped with pitched roofs. We landed on a cobble footpath outside a glass heavy front door to the building and he introduced himself I keep thinking Michael but I could be wrong (need to confirm if I see him again details are never fully clear when I AP, still working on that) and he was my guide/guardian/looks after me, I didnt quite catch the actual term he used.  He said lets go in and opened the door and I heard something behind me and it was one of my dogs who was soooo excited to see me, dancing on the spot wagging her tail with this big goofy smile on her face, he laughed and said she can come in too. We go inside and I asked if this was his house or church as it was really pretty inside and he said its like a church but it was kinda like just an old historic building but beautiful,  my dog came in too and was wandering around sniffing things.


He then stood in front of me and said he has been really proud of me over these last few months and he had something to tell me (he was super loving and happy to be in my precense and had the biggest grin on his face), he got a piece of paper out which was a list of names and stuff written next to them  then laughed and said he needed to check in with someone who I can't remember what name he said and its funny my dog followed us here then he apologised for getting sidetracked then tried to go back to what he was saying but I kept on loosing my focus, he was clicking his fingers infront of me telling me to keep focus and concentrate but I lost my concentration and came back to my body. 

I instantly felt the AP pull back hard and I was struggling to go back into AP and I could feel someone pulling on my hands trying to help me back out but it didnt work and now I'm wide awake still trying to take everthing in. 


Just wanted to share this experience.I personally don't know whether I believe in the beginning of the Age of Aquarius thing, but at the same time literally nobody on earth believes that I can leave my physical body and travel to another galaxies. I do however feel more energy shifting lately, I can kinda feel my astral body wanting to leave my physical self. Also, last night when I was meditating, I could move my astral body while still being in the physical realm, which was weird. I do notice everyone on this sub saying that they get more energy shifting and vibrations lately, it could be placebo tho.

&#x200B;

I will just participate because, what if it is real and I actually will ascend to the 5th dimension, and because I think its cool if like-minded people come together and do something.Keep in mind im not an artist, I just paint for fun. So this isn't as accurate as I'd like it to have been but its pretty damn close! Refer to my previous post about my AP experience to see what inspired this. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/OegN1M9Hey my names Johnathan ,

It started when I was about 7,I had a dream of a burning cigarette in a bush then about 2 weeks later that exact moment (with the exact thoughts of realization I had in the dream) occurred.As I kid it kept happening more & more often to the point I’d be talking to people I hadn’t met yet & then boom , weeks later that moment would happen. Ive been very spiritual & a believer since a child because of this ,only recently I’ve discovered that was a form of astral projection. Since stumbling on this page I’ve been practicing AP & I’ve found I can get into this state within 15-20 min even in the middle of the day ,admittedly I can’t go very far (a block or two away) but I’ve noticed my visualization skill has gotten 10x stronger. I can even close my eyes consciously and start visualizing crazy details from a different POV. Is this normal or do some people just have a natural inclination to AP?This sub is getting really popular and the quality of the content is declining everyday. I beg to all of those newcomers: before you post anything , do your own research. Only then will you know if AP is real or not. There is so much information on this sub and out there that please, go and read about it before you come here flooding this sub with the same questions over and over again.

Read the Robert Monroe books or get into Hemi-Sync (I've seen way too many links for that on here already).

Look at Michael Radugas 3 day seminary on youtube.

Download the "90 Days to OBE" PDF from Robert Bruce.

There is so much information out there, but if all you do is ask questions here, then you're in the wrong sub. 

Dont believe everything that is said on here either, we welcome critical thinkers and its up to each one of us to do the proper research and put in the time to find out if this is real or not.

Stay safe, much love.

Edit: Mods what if we have a weekly thread where people can ask all the questions they want?Hi this is my first post here I hope someone finds this interesting and i would be interested to see if anyone had a similar experience or any insights on what happened. I've told a fair few people IRL and they are bemused by it at the very most really!

A bit of background information  about me, I am 31 F and I have never learnt too much about AP neither have I ever tried to do it. I have been building up my spiritual awareness and practice over the past few years spending a lot of my lockdown in Australia learning about past life regression and more about why we are here. I had a reiki session the week before my AP and I had the experience on a Sunday night a around 6 months ago now and it's not happened since. I will explain exactly what happened,  I am aware it sounds pretty out there but hopefully not to this community, please be kind as I haven't shared this publicly before but it was so eye opening I want other people to know.

I went to bed as normal but felt very restless and tossed and turned a lot at first which isn't normal for me. Once I'd fallen asleep  I was definitely dreaming really weird stuff at first but it was definitely just normal dreamy things that I can't  remember. My memory begins when a girl who was with me at this point in my dream  said we were going to take you to venus. She came off as pink and fairy seeming with a wand she pointed at my body and was said were opening your 3rd eye and laughed and said it wasn't even in your head but everyone thinks it is.

It was at that point I knew it wasn't just a dream I was there I could feel the environment, the breeze and everything. This has never happened before and was a completely different experience than I dream. It was so real I could feel I was really there at this point,  it was hyper real like more real than life. We got into a pink elevator, this girl who felt like a leader (maybe she's my guide?) I felt completely comfortable following her, she had a knowledgeable your guide vibe. 


Once we got out the elevator as soon as I stepped out there was a real alien guy there. This made me jump as he had huge blue almond shaped eyes that were further apart then ours and looked almost human but incredibly tall (7 or 8 feet ). He had medium wavey pale blonde hair a very small nose,  small ears and a very wide smile with round slightly weird teeth. He was wearing a blue tunic that was very unusual as it looked like a cowl neck. He had a blue gem in the middle of his head and the blue was dazzlingly bright.

 He gave me a big hug like a parent does with a child they haven't seen in a while. I put my arms around his neck and he swung me up and looked me in the eyes. I could see the wrinkles by his eyes and all the details of his face , I was thinking this is amazing. Telepathically he gave me a big feeling of happiness and reassurance it was the most amazing feeling of love and safety like I was his family. 

When he put me down I looked at my body and it looked like  a fake suit you put on for a film like Mrs Doubtfire with a zip at the back that you can put on to change your body shape. It freaked me out but I also just felt bemused like 'oh ha my body is just a suit I put on'. It kind of melted away after this point particularly my chest and disappeared like it could just be thrown away.

We moved on at this point , I was in a little tour group it felt like with the girl leading the way around this place showing me things.  It had a really beautiful baby pink sky I felt a bit like I was at a theme park on one of those kind of walking chill rides where you just marvel at cool things like Disney world?! I asked if we were at venus and she laughed at me and said no if we were everything would be going a lot faster. I could feel everything around me,  particularly the way the atmosphere, it felt way more flowy like a strong current.

 I then said I felt cold and they were like we can grab you a jacket from here and I walked over.  I noticed it was like a rack of clothes from different eras and uniforms like on a set of a theatre show.  i looked at myself and I saw I was wearing this old fashioned wimpy restaurant outfit (this was an old fast food place in the UK) and there was some roller skates as well on the ground. I held the pleated skirt out and could see every seam and marvelled how real it seemed. 

On the rack there was an old man's waistcoat and a few other things that I thought hm these aren't helpful for my coldness but I realised they were outfits from past things from my lives and I also realised I wasn't cold anymore i just needed to see those outfits.

I became aware of two young boys that were on the little tour with us and I thought do I know you are you my brothers? (I don't have any in real life) and they looked me a bit like duh and I realised they were also 'me'. They were only around 7 or 8 and working class looking from UK history.

An older working class man again from some point in history appeared with us and along with the pink fairy girl they were really quite funny and sarcastic with the way they spoke to me which I liked it was very real and comfortable.

 At this point the girl sat me down and I noticed a hologram next me I said is this what earth is really like and I brushed my hand through it it felt like going through water but less strong. Also incredibly real I can remember exactly how it felt and kept doing it to marvel as how it felt.

Then I saw a tiny dog hologram and it made me smile then it  turned to being massive dog which scared me and this man made some comment about it not being anything to be scared of (I have a fear of large dogs in real life).  I asked why I felt scared of big dogs for no reason but he didn't elaborate. 

At that point I was like ok I know that this is real and I'm not in my body am I ok? I felt a bit panicked as I course sense I wasn't in my body and I knew I couldn't wake up or roll over. The girl told me I was totally fine it had only been 20 'of your minutes' as time isn't a thing there. She showed me a picture of my body back in bed with the my cats that I sleep with. I was a bit like am i dying or something then as soon as I thought that I opened my eyes and was back here in bed.

It was noway a normal wake up my eyes shot completely open it was 6am and I was very, very awake and excited.  I got straight up and wrote notes incase I forgot but its still in my head I can recall the whole thing perfectly. I couldn't go back to sleep as my body was buzzing and I was incredibly excited and amazed by what had happened. 

I did some research after this and felt very blessed it had happened. I had no interest in space or extra terrestrials at this point and ashamed to say I assumed alot of people who had stories were dubious. Now it had happened to me I spent a lot of time seeing if anyone else had seen these blue aliens. I've come to conclusion he was a variant of the nordic or tall white aliens. 

It was an incredibly positive experience it made me feel part of something bigger and encouraged me to explore more about the universe knowing it's not just us. Thankyou for reading all the way![CIA Declassified Experiment Proves Paranormal Activity](https://youtu.be/dm72Onm43io) 

I have encountered the same angel twice.   (Astral projection experience) 

Each time was amazing and the most memorable times of my life I could never forget. I think about this everyday. I will talk about one interesting time, it was late at night but I was wide awake. I was laying in my bed thinking about universe as I always do. I asked myself what do I want to know. I then just asked in a praying way to show me the universe. almost in a meditation form. I never went to sleep and as soon as I asked to see the universe I felt a strong presence over the roof of my house. I was not alone. I stayed laying down as a illuminated white spirit slowly moved down closer until in my room. the best i could describe the appearance was a bright white gas about the size of a normal human. then all of a sudden it felt like my room was starting to shake like I was on a rocket ship that was about to take off and within a minute later i was pulled out of my own body until I was at the roof of my room looking down at myself laying there. almost like a 3rd person view. the spirit took me through my roof over my city off earth. i could see everything in great detail. it felt like we were moving so slow yet I know we were going super fast until reaching light speed. I was never scared during this time i felt very safe even being so high up off the ground until I left earth. This is when the spirit revealed its self to me and it was an angel a man named Michael. a short haired clean looking man that was all white. he did not speak with voice but when he showed him self i was instantly enlightened with a bunch of information. everything he wanted me to know I knew. We began to visit areas and other planets that were just beautiful and mind blowing to see. we reached an area from a distance and he showed me another spirit. it was Shiva. a blue alien like lady the size of 7 planets. when i seen her the presence was over whelming . she had her mouth open like she was yelling holding a spear in one hand. the vision of her was still like a picture. almost like the angel was showing me a vision but not the real thing. regardless when I seen Shiva i was hit with a blast of air and intensity I will never forget. this was a great warrior of the universe. someone who had defeated many evil realms. worlds vs worlds conquering through infinity and never being defeated. I am not sure why Michael the angel showed me this but i am very thankful and fascinated with the experience. I never knew anything about Shiva until I looked into it after this taking place and everything seemed to match up. gives me goose bumps just knowing this stuff is real. the spirit world is vast. lots of evil lots of good. everyday I try to make contact again but it seems to be a very rare thing. Michael has visited me in one other great astral journey showing me signs of the after life. maybe I will share it one day. for those who doubt I understand. I also like to see things for myself. I would suggest praying and being passionate and sincere when you do. you might just get a visit or two like I have. praying is a great way to be fully focused in your curiosities. I am not telling you to join a religion of any sort, this is just one method of many that works for me. I've seen all the proof I need... I am also a exalted lucid/vivid dreamer aswell as astral projection. I've been practicing for 25 years everyday. I'm obsessed with exploration in the spirit world, or even those unique places I am able to create myself. A world of infinite power with no rules where anything is possible. (side note: I am more spiritual then religious, I choose my belief's off my personal experiences.) Its much to complicated to pretend we are capable of having all the answers!I´m not christian but having to be a god fearing man has always bugged me, isn´t god about love? Why should we fear him then?So while I was flying around my vision started to get blurry and weaker, so I decided to get into a meditative position and hum "Ohmmm". It's suppose to increase clarity or something like that and not only did it work , but other voices , voices of an angel ohmed with me in a choir synchronization like way that sounded so fucking cool. It was like 12 extra voices all ohmming at the same time.We go to dream/astral world everytime we fall asleep, we can choose to train ourselves to be conscious of that journey or we can stay asleep like most of the population

If we go to astral anyways, we are literally living 2 parallel lives all the time, and we are only utilizing this physical body while we also have our astral body, in my opinion its really stupid not to try to do literally anything in astral since we are living in that dimension anyways, just like we want to live the most beautiful life here in physical realm

Ok sorry about those random toughts, i wanted to share with you some crazy stuff which really make it easy at least for me to do AP

The first one is this audio, its so called 8D audio, it has binaural beats and isochronic tones at the same time, the brainwave is Theta, Theta waves is mostly known for out of body experiences, very slow brainwaves, its best to listen to this audio with headphones, but not necessary, i find this audio just like some kind of cheat code which really smoothens out the whole proces of separation for me

Here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRe0SEOUTEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRe0SEOUTEI)

&#x200B;

The second tip, this one is actually very simple, yet very complex, i took it from a Buddhist Anapanasati sutra writen by Shakyamuni Buddha, he basically says and explains this technique of experiencing absolute absorption, im not sure what that means, but i found it incredibly useful for AP, it literally brings my ap to the next level and im really excited to hear your experiences on this one

Here are his steps:

1. Focus your mind on the tiny point on the nose which first gets in contact with the air when breathing in, you need to Fixate your mind on that spot all the time
2. Also fixate your awareness on that spot, buddha speaks that mind and awareness are not the same thing, you dont have to understand this 100%, just put your intention to this and you will make it
3. DO NOT follow your whole breath as its going through your body, just focus on that tiny spot on the nose which gets first contact of air when inhaling, fixate on that spot and dont let it go
4. By watching and focusing on this spot, we are actually watching the whole breath if you think about it, thats the beginning of it, we are a gatekeeper only watching the air going in, not watching air that has already passed through the gate, buddha says this is the more sophisticated technique of watching your breath
5. After some time you will literally feel the need to continue doing this because it just feels so amazing, he says this is our natural state of our bodies, after some time you will start to lose the feeling of your physical body, we are starting to enter the absolute absorption which he mentions, from this situation AP becomes efortless, im experimenting with this for about a month now and i will honestly never stop, i even replaced all my meditation techniques with this one, its just the most powerful thing ive ever done and with fastest results

When this technique is used alongside the audio i shared earlier.. its pure magic

I hope you guys will give it a try, thanks for your time!So I managed to float out of my bed like the exorcist scene except I floated right into a standing position I opened my eyes only slightly in case I was still lying in bed and realised I was standing up, so I try to fly (I thought you fly during AP?) I fell down twice and realised I was awake then went back and lied down in bed I then opened my eyes and I realised that I was actually lying down in bed the entire time, that’s how real it felt, that’s how real astral projection feels. When I lied down I think my mind gave up for the night and I just went to sleepI started to learn projection when I was 12 years old and I’ve had many projections. I have helped people before on this subreddit in their experiences. I’m sorry if I don’t reply to all of your comments but I’ll try to. Ask me anything.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, helpful, and silver! really means a lot to me.As the title says, I've been trying to AP for 5 freakin' years & last night I finally achieved it! I want to thank one of my best friends who helped me get into the mindset needed for a successful AP. He told me that I should try thinking of things in the form of the elements. Basically earth being the physical & what is around us, air being your thoughts, water being your emotions, and fire being your intentions. You should relax and try to tune out/shut off the earth and air & focus on the water and fire. It's kind of hard to shut off the air when you are trying to think about what water(emotions) you are feeling at the time BUT if you focus on your current feelings & what your intentions are it's much easier to get in the correct state of mind (well, at least it was for me?).   
\~  
I was a person who was taking things WAY TOO LITERAL before & I thought that I had to think of a place I wanted to "go to" in order to "travel" there... in reality my friend told me that it's not someplace you go out of your body for because that would just be an OOBE; It's a place you are going into your own body/mind for! & when it was happening here is what it felt like:  
\~  
Focusing on my emotions/intentions, letting the feeling of my physical body fade, keeping my mind awake to focus on the emotions/intentions after the feeling of the physical faded, the feeling of falling forward (i was laying on my side) until I "fell" through the bed, having my body try to pull me back up a few times while "falling" but I just stayed calm, finally "fell" all the way until I landed on my feet in a different house, my sight in the astral faded in and out but I could see for the most part, walked like I was tipsy or drunk, had a hard AF time texting lol, tried to turn lights on but other lights came on instead of the ones I wanted, I could very properly talk and hear people/entities, I called for a certain person & they ended up coming over to the house and knocking on the door, I could answer the door and hug them/talk to them, I could physically feel them, & I got so excited about being able to feel them/have a proper conversation with them that it snapped me back into my body lol  
\~  
I tried to get back into the astral after that but I was so excited that I achieved AP that I couldn't go back. I will be trying again tonight BUT that was such an amazing experience! It was short-lived but sooooo worth waiting 5 years for! The feelings you get in AP are so strong it's insane! Just wanted to share with you guys & possibly help someone get into the mindset just like my friend helped me!My friend Jane had been complaining about how her room had bad vibes and she was having nightmares every night. She said she didn't feel safe in her room. She asked me and a friend of mine if we wanted to spend the night, and we agreed. While we were sleeping, Jane in her bed and my other friend and I on the floor, my spirit sat up from my body and walked over to Jane's full length mirror in her room. When I looked into the mirror it was all black, and inky, and there was a ton of negative energy swirling in there. As I was wondering how I could fix this for Jane, i happened to glance at a poster she had of wolves in a forest setting and a wolves head made of stars. I looked at the wolves head outlined by stars and it blinked at me and out jumped a wolf. I stammered back a bit, and looked at this wolf who transformed into this beautiful woman wearing a wolf skin. Her and I danced in front of her mirror weaving our hands back and forth, until all the darkness was gone, and it reflected what was in the room as it should. I could see Jane sleeping peacefully on her bed, in the reflection of her mirror. The wolf lady turned back into a wolf and jumped back into the poster. The stars glistening on the poster. I turned to where my body was laying and laid back down. I didn't tell my friend right away, but we talked a few days later and she mentioned that she didn't have the bad feelings anymore since we had spent the night. I told her what had happened, and she told me how she had drempt about the wolf woman before.Today I wonted to try an experiment. So, I’ve read that there are those on this site that prefer to read about experiences, rather than watch video, so this is what I’m going to do: I will choose experiences from my Youtube channel and share them here in text. I will leave a link to the actual video, and if you wish to watch it after reading, you can simply click the link. My hope is that these experiences will inspire you to continue on your own journey, and as always, I’m here to answer any questions you might have. So with that, I hope you enjoy:

I’ve always been curious about life after death, but more specifically, what heaven is truly like. I was raised as a Baptist, and I can recall listening to my pastor’s fiery sermons on the subject… heaven would be this place where you’d meet up with loved ones and spend eternity with them in harmony… In my own mind at that age, I suppose I pictured it as a place in the clouds, where you’d meet Jesus and finally see God… I would never have imagined, at that early stage, that I might actually get a glimpse of it before I passed, but then again, it was my life before I began to astral project. 

It’s been years since the experience, but my eyes still well up with tears when I think about it. It was, without a doubt, the most extraordinary astral projection experience I’ve ever had. So, some years back, I left my body carrying a single thought in my mind… LOVE. Nothing else. When my soul emerged, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore. I was somewhere else. I looked around. The first thing I noticed were the walls. They seemed to be forged from light, and have a life force of their own. I stared at them for a long while, until something else drew my attention away:

It was a globe that turned slowly, suspended in midair. It looked like a detailed miniature version of the earth. In fact, at that moment, I believed I was looking at the earth itself. Then I saw a black man in white robes. There were two things I still remember clearly about this man: First, his goatee was perfect (funny, the things that stick in your memory), and second, his eyes were forged from the same light as those walls. When I saw him, I instantly felt connected to him. I remember expressing to him through thought (telepathy, in my experience, is more about sensing feelings than actual words) that I was going through a difficult time in my life. This man took me in his arms, held me, and gently kissed my on the cheek. 

I must tell you that I’ve never, in my whole existence, felt a love that intense… it was so powerful… so overwhelming that I felt that there was no way I could have contained it inside of me. Then he walked me over to the walls that seemed to transform into a kind of mirror. I could see myself standing next to him. In the reflection, I was also wearing a white robe, and my eyes were forged of light as well. I also noticed how much taller he was than me… I felt like a child next to him.

Then we turned, and he walked me toward some kind of passage way. At that point, i instantly returned to my body and opened my eyes. For those of you wondering, since that time, I’ve not retuned to that place, and I’ve never had an experience equal to it.I've been meaning to share some of my experiences for awhile, so without further ado, here is one that struck me as odd, but definitely intriguing: 


After leaving my physical body, I flew for awhile before descending into what looked like a giant ship at sea. At first, I just observed what appeared to be a group of people in conversation. Nothing abnormal about it at first... in fact, I thought they didn't see me as no one looked in my direction. 


After a short time, a man approached me and asked who I was. I was surprised at first and responded with a general 'just visiting'. Then he said: "But how did you get here? Do you still have a body?" That's when I realized he had somehow pinpointed me as an 'outsider' I guess. I remember telling him that I had a physical body that I had left behind to explore. He asked me more questions about leaving my physical body, and appeared in awe that I could 'leave my body while still alive' (his words). I remember him repeatedly saying "but you're still alive right?". 


It was definitely a strange but interesting experience. I have no clue who he was, where he was from, how he knew I didn't belong there, etc. Just thought I'd share one of my memorable encounters with an astral entity (not sure if that's even the correct term?). Starting out with this post, that's not to say it isn't partly related to the pineal gland. However, the thalamus has to be involved somehow. I'm sure people have made this connection on their own well before me. And honestly, looking into the functions of these brain regions, and reading into the third eye chakra, makes it pretty clear to see. Also, considering melatonin secretion is controlled by the thalamus and not the pineal gland, it's possible DMT secretion is also controlled by the thalamus, as both of them are tryptamines.

**The Thalamus**
-----
-----

&gt;Every day, we constantly absorb information through our sensory organs, which the brain then needs to process correctly. The information initially reaches the main relay center, the thalamus, and then travels to the cerebral cortex. The neurons in the so-called higher-order thalamus form the connecting lines between both areas of the brain. The thalamus is essentially the size of two walnuts and is located in the middle of the brain. **All sensory perceptions converge here first**, before being transmitted to the higher cortical centers of the brain, and the sensory system as a whole.

-----

Essentially, all of the sensory information taken in from our sensory organs, sight, hearing, taste, touch, is processed through and by the thalamus, before being transmitted to other parts of the brain that are associated with sensory perception. Our sense of smell seems to be one of the only things that doesn't go through the thalamic system. Going with this, the thalamus acts as a "rate limiter" for our perception of reality. As I am sure many of you are already well aware, we aren't experiencing reality as it truly is. And this is true from both an occult, spiritual perspective, as well as a scientific standpoint. The thalamus is responsible for filtering out any perceptions that it deems unnecessary for our survival, and further processing it into our view of reality as it exists to us, or at least the average individual during waking consciousness. This process of filtering "redundant" information is otherwise known as sensory gating.

-----

&gt;Sensory gating describes neurological processes of filtering out what the thalamus considers to be redundant or unnecessary stimuli in the brain from all possible environmental stimuli. Also referred to as gating or filtering, sensory gating prevents an overload of irrelevant information in the higher cortical centers of the brain.

-----

A quote from a neuroscientist that I vibe with a lot and use all the time, "**The world around us is not the world we perceive because the thalamus filters out what it considers to be irrelevant information**,” said Katrin Preller, a researcher on the project at the University Hospital for Psychiatry in Zurich. “**We don’t necessarily perceive all there is because that would be an overload of information**.”


**Third Eye**
-----

Basic info pulled right from the wiki, and all that really needs to be said on here. 

-----

&gt;The third eye (also called the mind's eye or inner eye) is a mystical and esoteric concept of a speculative invisible eye, usually depicted as located on the forehead, which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.

-----

So, I'm hoping the connection here is obvious. And, for those wondering about the pineal gland and its connection to DMT, hopefully, this ties it together.

**Altered States and the Thalamus**
-----
-----

&gt;The brain is capable of building worlds during waking life, but also in the complete absence of extrinsic sensory data, entirely from intrinsic thalamocortical activity, as during dreaming. Some of DMT's effects may be explained because serotonin has evolved within the brain to hold the thalamocortical system in a state in which the consensus world is built. When serotonin is replaced by DMT, the thalamocortical system shifts into an equivalent state.

-----

&gt;LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects.

-----

&gt;Here, functional connectivity analyses revealed increased DMN-TPN FC (Default Mode Network / Task Positive Network - Functional Connectivity) and so decreased DMN-TPN interaction after psilocybin. Increased DMN-TPN FC has been found in psychosis and meditative states, which share some phenomenological similarities with the psychedelic state. Increased DMN-TPN FC has also been observed in sedation, as has decreased thalamocortical FC, but here we found preserved thalamocortical FC after psilocybin. Thus, we propose that thalamocortical functional connectivity may be related to arousal, which is the state of being awoken or of sense organs stimulated to a point of perception.* We suggest that this process is compromised in early psychosis, explaining similarities between its phenomenology and that of the psychedelic state

-----

Visual snow is the perception of static that encompasses a person's entire visual field, ranging from colorless, rainbow, and based on what i've read, plenty of other color configurations as well. It is a symptom associated with HPPD, a neurodivergent condition that some people acquire after using psychedelics, dissociatives, cannabis, and more. HPPD is also accompanied by other visual symptoms, one of them being auras. Personally, I see auras around most, but not all light sources, which differ in color, shape, and intensity depending on the source of light and the color it stems from. One of the main theories for VSS and HPPD seems to be thalamocortical dysrhythmia, with increased activity directed being towards the visual cortex.


-----

&gt;Based on research on the minimal temporal interval to sensory discrimination, we may conclude that consciousness is a noncontinuous event determined by synchronous activity in the thalamocortical system.

-----


To put it simply, desynchronized activity in the thalamocortical system is connected to a variety of altered states of consciousness, with data pointing towards hallucinogens, meditation, dreaming, psychosis, as well as other conditions associated with visual alterations.

Decreased thalamocortical activity has been observed in people practicing mindfulness and meditative techniques, and the thalamocortical circuit sees decreased activity during Non-REM sleep, with increases during REM sleep. Psychedelics are known to induce activity in the brain that mimics REM sleep, so the connection is pretty obvious.

**The Pineal Gland**
-----

The pineal gland rests directly behind the thalamus in the brain, and is much smaller in size. I have never been able to find much in the way of sensory perception being relating to the pineal gland.

-----

&gt;The main function of the pineal gland is to receive and convey information about the current light-dark cycle from the environment and, consequently produce and secrete melatonin cyclically at night

-----

So, it senses light levels in our environment and secretes melatonin when it gets dark enough in order to help put us to sleep. It's also implicated with the secretion of sex hormones, as well as "bone metabolism," because melatonin produced within the pineal gland is thought to deposit calcium within our bones. There is absolutely no data backing this up, but in our world of nonstop artificial light, the pineal gland produces less melatonin or does so irregularly. Which could be a part of the reason for its calcification. And, melatonin is a tryptamine, as is DMT and Psilocybin. Melatonin secretion is partly controlled by the thalamus and promotes "spindle formation" within it, a process involved with consolidating memory during sleep. And since psychedelics are known to impact the thalamocortical system, it's entirely possible that melatonin does something similar.

And to end this, the thalamus looks [a lot more like a normal eye](https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/ts/20160721024744/ri/590/picture/2016/7/Brain_Diagram_shutterstock_233671144.jpg) than pineal gland lolI posted this method the other day, but I have to post it again for anybody who hasn't seen it. I've been using this method some more, and today I even got to the vibrational stage TWICE in one day!! I haven't been able to get to the vibrational stage in about a month and now all of a sudden with this technique I'm getting multiple vibrations a day!?!? There are a couple of things I'd like to add in addition to this technique that may help you understand it better and could possibly lead you to full astral projection:

make sure to keep your goal in mind, and try not to let your mind wander. After about 30 minutes of affirmations and keeping your mind on the goal of astral projection without thinking random thoughts, then you can roll over and relax more.

keep in mind this technique is trial and error, and you'll have to experiment a little bit with it until it works for you. With that in mind, here's the technique

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through trial and error, I have come up with a formula to reach the vibrational state almost every time. I have tried this formula and it has worked twice in a row. When I look back at my successful attempts, I recall using this method without being conscious that I was doing it. The method is as follows:

First, you want to be caught up with sleep. If you have a sleep deficit and you are tired, this method will likely not work because you will fall too deep into sleep and forget that you are trying to astral project.

Either use the wake back to bed method, or take a nap shortly after waking up for the day, I tend to get lazy and fall asleep when doing the wake back to bed method, so I prefer taking a nap (and so does Robert Monroe). Lay on your back on either your bed, a couch, whatever. Just make sure you are comfortable.

1. start relaxing as much as you can. Breathe deeply, focus on each body part, and try to relax it, use hypnosis on yourself, whatever. Just. Keep. Relaxing.
2. Eventually, you will want to start paying attention to any voices/sounds that you hear in your head. When you focus on these sounds, it will almost seem like these sounds are coming from nowhere. I tend to hear people talking, I focus on what they are saying. At first, they will only say one word, as you relax more and more, you will start hearing full sentences.
3. try not to force thought. You want to try to not think of anything, and let your subconscious thoughts take over. By listening in for voices, music, etc, you are not thinking but rather letting your conscious mind rest while listening in for sentences that "seem to come from nowhere".
4. During all of this, you want to be telling yourself that you are going to astral project. Tell yourself things like: "I astral project all the time" "It is easy for me to astral project" "I astral project without trying" etc.
5. Eventually, you will start falling asleep. You can tell if you are falling asleep if you get a random thought, and think that it relates to what you are doing. You will likely then think "how tf did I make that connection?" This is a good sign you are heading for sleep.
6. Head for sleep. At this point, you will likely fall asleep and start dreaming, and you will be relying on your subconscious to wake you up to astral project. If you do not seem to be getting any more relaxed while laying on your back, then roll over onto your side and continue relaxing deeper and deeper, constantly affirming that you are going to astral project and that it is easy for you to astral project. Keep doing this no matter how awake you feel, and believe me, you will likely feel like you WILL NOT go to sleep, but you will.
7. At some point during your dream, you will either realize you are not dreaming or you will remember your goal, at that point you will likely get taken back into your body.
8. Focus on the hypnogogic sounds. Listen in on the sounds and do not be afraid. Being afraid will ruin this state. Just listen to the sound and try to relax more and more. I made a couple of sound files of what you may hear, I recommend listening to them so that you know what to expect. Sound files >>>> [https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526). Start from the bottom of the list going up.
9. Do an exit method, such as rope technique or roll over.

It may take you a while to finally exit, but this method will help you at least reach the vibrational state and experience what it is like. If you are afraid of the vibrational state, then you need to get there and just MAINTAIN it, don't try to astral project, just stay in that state and make sure that you are relaxing with it. As long as you are relaxing with the vibrations and hypnogogic noises, you will maintain them. You can maintain them, as far as I know, indefinitely.

Pro tip: you do not want to move throughout this whole process. Not even if you have an itch.

You’re probably already familiar with what it’s like to have sex as a physical human being, but did you know that you can also engage in sexual liaisons outside of your physical body? Yes, it’s true. You’re not limited to the physical. There’s a whole other world of sex, pleasure, and unbridled passion awaiting you outside of your physical shell. And today I’m going to tell you all about it.  
There’s more than one way to have non-corporeal sex. You can have sex in your dreams with a dream character. You can have sex while astral with a corporeal being, or sex while astral with another astral playmate. You can also have sex with a demon or low vibrational entity. Or you can go completely beyond the confines of the physical and non-physical and have a blissful ethereal experience that is unlike anything you can imagine; yes, better than any kind of sex you can imagine!  


So let’s go over each of these and I’ll explain what it is and how to achieve it.  


**Dream Sex**

Having sex in your dreams is fun, pleasurable, and safe. It’s just you and your dream character and no one ever has to know what you’re up to. Thanks to my ability to lucid dream, I’ve been blessed to have had sex with every hot actor, fictional character, and good looking real-life friends, when I want, the way I want, and as many times as I want. And you can do this too. Just learn how to lucid dream and, when the situation presents itself, you can snap your fingers and engage in sexual activity with whoever you want. If you aren’t a master at lucid dreaming, you may still end up with a sex dream accidentally. But believe me, it’s worth learning how to do it lucidly.   


If you’re a woman, dream sex can actually lead to having a real and true orgasm. More than likely you will wake up while in the throes of your orgasm and find your body actually having one.  


If you’re a man, this is more tricky. Mostly what I hear from men is that they wake up with an erection and extremely horny, but don’t actually ejaculate in the dream or upon waking. If you’re a man, and you have, please let us know this is possible. Half the world awaits your testimonial.  


Dream sex can lead to a lot of frustration though. Most of the time it doesn’t lead to a climax, so you wake particularly hot, bothered, and unfulfilled. Still worth trying though.  


**Corporeal Sex** 

[Read more...](https://www.psychicloki.com/2020/05/astral-sex-ecstasy-of-out-of-body.html)I've been able to AP pretty consistently for the past 4 years. I always mention it to friends to open them up to the possibility of APing too but all claim they can't do it. A) I personally don't think they've actually tried and B) they probably don't even believe the concept actually exists.

Anyway, a particular friend constantly brought it up and spoke out against it to other people. Basically labeled me as a conspiracy theorist. So I told him to write down 8 random digits and leave it on his desk at night. It took 4 nights but I was able to AP into his room and I took note of the numbers which I texted to him the following morning.

I also described his room layout and what he was wearing. I sent the message this morning. He's read it but hasn't replied yet which is unusual for him. It's just a shame he lives 3 cities away as I'd love to have told him personally.**After 57 years of Astral Projection I can’t say I’ve done it all. But I’ve done enough to write articles for Reddit! And after all, what higher accomplishment can there possibly be in this life?**

**1.** **Flying**

**When I just feel like just having fun I’ll leave my body and find a spot in the sky and just WILL myself there. Like a rocket I’ll take off and find myself among the clouds in an instant. Flying through thunder clouds is energizing, but so is flying along a crashing surf or over tall, windswept mountains.**

**2.** **Tourism**

**Do you crave the excitement of walking on the Chinese Great Wall, roaming in the Roman Coliseum, and figuring out the Riddle of the Egyptian Sphinx? The only fly in the ointment is that you’re barely on a Six Flags Park travel budget! With Astral Projection you can visit these monuments to man’s ingenuity without spending a dime.**

**I’ve checked out many tourist traps in my time, with Stonehenge, Mayan step pyramids and the Sistine Chapel being among my favorites.**

**3.** **Healing**

**I have insomnia from time to time and I find that absorbing energy on the Astral Plane can help get me by during those tough times. You can help to heal others too by projecting energy into their bodies. Note: Have fun experimenting with this activity.** ***However, keep following your doc’s advice and your medical treatment plan. Most times the Physical Plane is the best place to get medicine for the physical body!***

**4.** **Reduce Fear of Death**

**Of course I’ll never die, but chances are the rest of you will! Seriously though, I find AP reduces my fear of physical death. It’s nice to know that I won’t just wink out of existence when my physical shell craps out (both literally and figuratively I’m told)!**

**5.** **Communicating with Relatives who’ve Passed**

**I have been able to say goodbye to my grandmother and my father-in-law within days of their passing. I find that many spirits hang around near the Physical Plane for a few days to a few weeks before they pass onto a higher plane. This is the best timespan to say goodbye if you missed your chance earlier. Once they’ve moved onward it’s generally too late for contact – assuming they’re not the type to get stuck in the lower Astral like substance abusers, control freaks, and other troublesome earthbound types. Note: Don’t be fooled by ghost machines on the market today. They either don’t work or you just attract lower entities wanting to screw with gullible physical humans. Understand, that just because someone has died doesn’t mean they suddenly gain the wisdom of the Universe. A live dumb ass is just a dead dumb ass after kicking the legendary bucket!**

**6.** **Time Travel**

**This is one of my favorite activities. An experienced AP’er can travel to the past to view dinosaurs, or travel far into the future to see the end of the Earth as it’s swallowed by the Sun. I’ve had a blast doing both! However, if you’ve never seen a North American Mammoth herd from about 20,000 years ago you haven’t lived, my friend! I flew in front of a bull who had to be 13 feet (4 meters) tall! And those enormous tusks must’ve really impressed the ladies!**

**I could write a book on this one, and probably will. Just keep in mind that the past is fixed and can’t be changed (sorry Back to the Future fans)! However, the future exists as infinite possibilities until humans as a species collapse them all save one that we collectively chose to become our joint reality.**

**7.** **Parallel Worlds**

**A cousin to time travel is parallel world travel. I’ve seen parallel realities in which George Washington was killed early in the American Revolution, causing the United States to never be born! In that reality the South did eventually split to become a separate group of states under the British Empire. In their 1980’s the first Olympics was held where the North and South competed as one team for the first time!** 

**In a more personal experience, I returned to a parallel Rick in error that had two daughters instead of the one that I have in this reality! I was only able to remain in his body for about 10 minutes before I was forced out by slightly disparate vibrations that didn’t quite match mine.**

**8.** **Akashic Records**

**I’ll be honest. I’ve never been. But I’ve had a number of students who’ve traveled to this plane where the records of all existence for this iteration of the Universe are held. So, it’s a thing.**

**9.** **Under the Ocean Exploration**

**I’ve only done this a couple of times because deep, dark oceans have freaked me out since I saw the movie “Jaws” as a kid (at the New Jersey seashore no less)! Seriously, who the hell swims out to the buoy at night buck-naked?** 

**Any who, in one trip I was feeling depressed (bad time to project), when I sighted this 12 foot (3.5 meter) tall glowing Astral tulip-looking plant/animal in the depths of the ocean. It broadcast a call to me promising me warmth, peace and rest. However, some small part of me sensed an alien intelligence, and a desperate hunger. I was halfway towards the damn thing when I snapped out of the trance state. That was my last deep ocean Astral trip! Note: This was definitely an Astral lifeform. You’re not going to see it pop up on any NatGeo Special any time soon.**

**I’m sure you’ll have better luck if you’re feeling good for your deep sea trip. Just stay away from big, glowing tulips!**

**10.** **Outer Space Travel**

**This is one of my favorites as well! I’ve checked out weird ruins on the “dark side” of the Moon, flown through the Sun (told myself it was like fire-walking), rode a tumbling asteroid cruising by Earth, and sailed on an ice rock circling Saturn to name just a few trips. Yes, there’s a book here too.**

**11.** **Psychic Side Effects**

**I’ve noticed that when I AP a lot my senses of telepathy (reading minds) and precognition (knowing the future) start kicking in hard. I have to be careful during those times to let people say their piece before I answer them. Otherwise, they start looking at me like my head is about to start sprouting horns!**

**In one interesting case of precognition I swear I listened to a message on my phone about 12 hours before it was actually left on my phone. Yes, that one did send serious chills down my spine, and concerns about my personal sanity were self-expressed!**

**12.** **Gain Spiritual Wisdom**

**You can meet some interesting characters and entities on the various Astral Planes. Some will waste your time, but others can really impart some true wisdom that you haven’t encountered previously on this spinning ball of dirt and water. I’ve had dealings with beings some people might call angels, as well as low creatures just out to leech energy from alcoholics and drug abusers and everything in between.**

**13.** **Merge with the Consciousness of Animals (****Proceed with Caution on this one****)**

**I almost didn’t list this one because it has its hazards. But since I’ve done it on a few occasions I thought I’d be a hypocrite and maybe a little condescending for not listing it as a thing that is possible in the Astral.**

**I’ve merged with a large cat running wild in the future of North America. When I took control it was running. I promptly proceeded to flip head over heels, tripping over my own four feet. Yes, I felt like an idiot. Actually, like an idiot in substantial pain! I eventually got the hang of walking on all four sore legs after a few minutes (you try it sometime, it’s hard)! I left after about 15 minutes.**

**Another time I merged with a big, hungry fish. No, I don’t know what it was. They don’t have mirrors in the ocean and it was dark beside. I didn’t try to control the voluntary brain this time as I can barely swim as a human. I more or less audited the experience and leaped just as it bit into a smaller fish. I couldn’t see too well as the ocean was only lit by the moon, but I “sensed” the location of my prey ahead.**

**A third time I wrote about in my Reddit article, “Seeing through a Dino Croc’s Eyes”. Check it out if interested. I was only in the monster for a handful of minutes, but my mouth watered for weeks afterwards whenever I smelled rotting meats in garbage! I also had a tendency to unconsciously size up small animals as possible prey items. Thankfully for the neighborhood garbage bags and four-legged pets these side effects gradually faded away in a few weeks.**

**14.** **Astral Sex**

**If I hadn’t mentioned this one, someone on Reddit would’ve commented for sure!** 

**Yes, Astral Sex is a thing. On the lower levels of the Astral Plane sex is similar to our physical manner of “knocking boots” without quite as much wear and tear on the naughty bits. The overall sensation is like a stimulating electric current running through the Astral frame. If you’ve ever put your finger in a light socket it kind of feels like that, only replace the discomfort with pleasure instead.**

**On the higher Astral levels sex becomes a true joining of souls, all one’s secrets being revealed for your partner to see and in some cases live as if it was they who had experienced or committed them. Even when you separate a part of them lives within you always.**

**I could talk about the Astral Sex black rot disease as well, but I doubt anyone would care about that subject anyway…**

&#x200B;

**If you have any questions or comments, and if I know Redditors you do, just leave them below. I’ll do my best to answer them on a prompt basis.**

**If interested, I have a Youtube Channel, Astral Club, where I discuss a wide variety of Astral Projection related topics** [**https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE**](https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE)

**Thanks!**

**Rick (alias Morgoth37)**TLDR: does anyone else feel that dreams are a form of astral projection?

Personally, I remember almost all of my dreams. They are incredibly vivid in sound, scenery, even taste. Even what some people might classify as ‘nightmares’ are fascinating. Though not actively lucid, a common understanding while I sleep is that flying is normal. In every type of scenario. However, flying doesn’t always mean an absence of danger or fear. 

The common denominator is that the locations are recognizable as Earth, although the places, while in sleep, seem absolutely familiar, are not completely applicable to ‘now’ when remembering them when you are awake. 

Examples being : 

Being close to large bodies of water such as the ocean or fierce rivers, not necessarily in a threatening way but explorative and slightly frightening being up close and personal with sea life so large it takes your breath away. 

Flying through a forest and seeing every leaf on the branches, smelling and feeling the vastness of it and the loneliness. Which turns into a deep terror when realizing you aren’t alone. 

Intense apocalyptic settings, strangely disguised with lavishness. Haunted or disheveled homes (though even in sleep, not afraid enough most of the time to wake). Occasionally recurring settings, which oddly seem like a “childhood memory”, though obviously they are not. For your physical body. 

Navigating without fear. Soaring above and drinking in the beauty. This is rare, and usually fleeting. In sleep, the reminder that the flying is ‘special’ can trigger waking. 

While I am grateful for this - what I see as a gift to see and feel the extraordinary, 

Most of the time I wake up so, so exhausted. 

Sweaty. Panting. I have been told by all my romantic partners that I am (haha) a “nightmare” to sleep with. I tell my current partner that my journey asleep made me more tired than our shift the night before. 

Many times I see people from my life relevant currently, but also see people I haven’t seen or thought of in decades. Random people of course. Scarily familiar as friends, but upon waking, cannot put a name to the face. 

The dark parts of interaction - monsters of the worst nights are difficult to explain, because they are disturbingly and absolutely human but I can’t fathom where and why such heinous energy was decided to frequently make its appearances. (Not recurring visual threats. Always different) In a messed up way, I don’t mind these dreams or travels because they are so insanely fascinating. 

It does take time when I wake up to recover. Especially if it was violent in any nature. 

TW *graphic*, a particularly horrific night, I found myself in a beautiful, secluded forest with my ex boyfriends brother (have not seen in 6 years), when he points a camera through the branches up top and says “let’s see the range”, and a deep flash shakes the earth. Both of us are at the top of the trees. He says “they know”. 

Next thing I know we are flying down in terror, and I end up with gunshot wounds to my neck and side of face with blood running down my body as I am flying down towards the ground. A horrifyingly disfigured man in a wheelchair has killed the person with me as we are trying to fly to safety, and mocks me for being selfish and shoots at me too. As i neared the ground, dozens of people appeared so I felt at ease. 

That is just one casual example. 

Still alive, knowing it could be it but also knowing (as an experienced dreamer of sorts) that it’s okay is recurring. Because I wake up when it gets to be too much, and after some time to soak in the sun and my ACTUAL surroundings, I come back to a homeostasis. 

These moments of unconsciousness loosely tie together. As if my body is still and the mind can transport to different planes of reality, scary, strange, or beautiful. I have always been this way, even as a child. 

Sincerely curious if anyone else has this relationship with 'sleep.' Are we just dreaming, or is it something else?Hey everyone! I'm really excited about this because I've been trying to AP for a very long time, not always consistently but yeah. This morning I woke up at the usual time but was too tired to work out, so instead I wrote down my dreams (I also attempt LD'ing and had an LD this morning before I woke up) and then went back to sleep with the intent to LD or AP. I didn't really use any affirmations or anything but just had the intention and basic belief that it would happen.

Well, it did! I don't really remember how, exactly, but it was after I had woken up and then gone back to sleep very quickly once more. I just simply... left my body and appeared in my friend's house.

My friend is someone I met on Reddit late last year, I have never seen the inside of his house and have only seen the occasional video of his lawn and his dog running on it, and one or two face pictures. That's IT. 

I instantly knew that I had AP'd, everything was a lot more vibrant and clear than in any LD I've had, and I could easily control what I did. I walked around a little bit, kind of looked into the rooms, looked into a mirror (I just looked like myself but a bit older or something), and then ended up snapping out of it.

Well, as soon as I woke up I was really excited, but I had to be sure (because I've also suspected the AP is just LD in disguise) so I texted him to ask! I drew a basic picture of the layout and he confirmed that everything was where I said it was except, for some reason, the big empty table that I saw was actually in a different room than the room that I saw it in. But other than that, from the floor being made of wood to whose bedrooms belonged to who was the same!

I'm honestly so excited right now and I can't wait to AP again! I just wish I could better remember how exactly I did it, it felt so natural so maybe I've overthinking it whenever I try.Alright, here's my [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/gqenwf/sooooooo_close_just_barely_did_it_right_now/)

[Method I used](https://youtu.be/YQjAIlFZWWc)

I don't care if no one reads this, I feel as though it is important to share and log whatever experiences we have on this. Last time, I tried Raduga's method and got my hands floating outside my body, but couldn't leave. I tried again today and this method freaking works man. 

I got to the same state after a dream I had in a rollercoaster, I passed out on on it and woke up with my body asleep, phasing. but this time I slipped down and tried to get up. It was SUPER WEIRD getting up but I did  and I open my eyes. 

I saw my bed and there was no body, but Raduga said that's normal so I didn't feel bad. I also saw my room as it should, so I did what he said and went straight to my bathroom to look into the mirror. Why the hell did he want that??? I went there and saw my reflection, I looked like a fucking human troll-face mixed with [this meme.](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5afee48f1e000043008e5ecd.jpeg?cache=b8hhvq4ej2&ops=1910_1000)

It scared the f outta me, I know it sounds funny but I was scared for a minute. So I left the bedroom and phased through my bedroom wall and flew away. I had swimming goggles on for some reason so I just took them out.

Well this is where it gets just a little disappointing. Outside was full of people and looked different than my street. I saw a cute girl from back in highschool and... it gets sexual. During it, the experience started to fade away and I woke up. I saw out the window and it was raining, so I didn't actually AP, I'd call this a lucid dream. Was still a really good step up. I still don't know how to AP, but I'm enjoying what I'm getting. Maybe a little too much :)

I will now proceed to watch the second video of the seminar for answers.Ive been doing research into soul trap theory, reading robert monroe books. I cant seem to wrap my head around reincarnation and what not. Or is it my 3d mind's interpretation how this physical space in the universe works? Ive felt my sould leaving my body once during deep meditation and am just curious about the meaning of life beyond earth.Hi All,

I think there is a serious problem going on in the astral projection community. There is too much emphasis on the techniques of how to actually exit your body, like the rope method or roll over method, and not enough focus on how to even get to that point. You may read or hear things like, lay down when your body is ready for sleep and relax until you get to the vibration stage, which eventually will lead to sleep paralysis.... to me that is grossly generalized and there is no real substance to a tutorial like that. It doesn't take into consideration people who have trouble silencing their busy minds. How is a beginner supposed to understand what it's like to be in a non-physical state of being without first understanding what it means to be connected to the non-physical realm?

Astral Projection is very much a mindset where you discard your physical worries and anxiety at the door. When you are in the non-physical realm, there is no anxiety about what you look like, sound like or what you're going to have for dinner - you are thinking differently then when you are physically awake. In order to successfully separate your mind from your body and actually experience what it is like to be out of body, it is crucial for your mind to let go of any and all physical worries. An example of what I'm talking about is the state of mind we all find ourselves in right before we fall asleep. Your mind kind of veers off and thinks about random things that don't have too much rhyme or reason. You actually allow this to happen - you give yourself permission without realizing it. You need to try and tap into this subconscious part of you. The part of you that doesn't try to control every moment to moment and have a say in every single thing going on around you. Doing so allows your mind to just be and attune with your immediate surroundings. One of those surroundings will start to unveil itself to you in the form of sensations you feel, hear or see. This is the non-physical realm presenting itself to you. The astral plane is always present, it's a matter of you being able to silence your ego and listen and attune to it. Your mind must be simplified to the point where all you are focusing on is your breath or what your body feels like against your bed or even that tingly feeling your hand or foot is getting. While also realizing your going to travel to somewhere - somewhere non-physical. Once you do so, you can simply have a conversation with your body (because mind and body are separate). You can tell the body that it is time for it to go to sleep and that your mind is going to stay awake as this happens. Physically relax every single muscle of your body all the way from your toes to your chest to your back to your hands to your jaw and eyeballs. Let go of controlling the situation and offer comfort to your body that all will be fine. You are simply going on a journey to the non-physical realm and you will meet back up later. You can practice these things at any time to get better at them. But when it comes to actually projecting, it is exponentially easier to achieve an out of body experience through the indirect method -- which is when you got to sleep regularly and wake back up in the middle of the night. Your mind, which only needs about 2-4 hours of sleep, will be ready to work, while your body, which needs about 6-8 hours of sleep, will be ready to go back to sleep fairly quickly. 

So now, both your mind and body are on board to have a non-physical experience. From this point on be aware and tap into the numerous sensations you may feel, hear or see (vibrations, itches, light and dark in your peripherals, hearing voices, feeling pulses around or on your body, tingly feelings, pressure feelings, shifts of perspectives, etc.). If you continue to pay attention to these feelings, they should increase in intensity, gradually. If you remain calm and in that mindset mentioned above, you will be pushed into either sleep paralysis or just straight up disconnected mind from body and free to explore.

Hopefully this post reaches who it needs to and I do expect to get some haters out of this - which is all good to me. I will respond to any and all comments of those in need of help and will ignore any negative feedback. I am simply trying to help those in need or feel stuck at a certain stage -- hoping  to offer them different mindsets to try so they can breakthrough whatever mental barrier they are currently dealing with. I made a YouTube video on this very topic that also includes a new exit strategy i'm sure many of you have never heard of. The strategy is good for both calming your mind and body down and getting it more in tune with the non-physical, as well as actually leaving your body during sleep paralysis. If you are interested here is link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpwFSf0UDc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpwFSf0UDc&feature=youtu.be) PEACE AND LOVE!!When I first discovered this sub, I thought I'd found a fun place to be a voyeur of some of the next level craziness that only reddit can so efficiently provide. I read your accounts of what you'd seen, read about how hard some of you have been trying to get that first projection, and I was in awe of how wrapped up into this nonsense people get. 

But then a funny thing happened. The more I read about your experiences, your feelings of connectedness when you successfully project, and your theories about consciousness interacting with the physical world, I remembered that when I was a little younger I had a lot of similar experiences and held the same general beliefs. I suddenly looked inward in a way I had given up on, then basically went full Simba and "remembered who I was". I began taking an unbiased approach to AP and, long story short, have found something that has brought real value to my life.  I even think I managed to AP  once, but only for a moment (I got stuck on the floor -- is that a thing?)

So to all of you APers, I want to apologize for being a douche and looking down on people I didn't understand. And I want to thank you for helping reignite an important part of me that has been cold and dark for a long time. 

I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from all of you!

Cheers!Oh man, that was wild to say the least
This was my 2nd attempt this week, last time I did it, I woke my self up thinking that I was Astral projecting

But today, I decided to go with the flow and wait things out
It felt like one of my eyes was closed, and the other was open. The one that was open was gradually gaining focus and before I knew it everything was vivid and real. I get up, I look at my room, and it looks almost identical to my real life room, but there were some differences, like missing items, different posters on the wall. That's when it hit me that I wasn't in my room, and that maybe I am Astral Projecting.
So I decided to try and fly, AND IT WORKED, I STARTED FLOATING AND IT WAS SO EASY. I then ZOOMED through the sky and there I was up in the air. The area did not seem familiar at all. It looked like it had just rained, as it was during the day, but it was cloudy with that feeling of dampness. The ground looked wet from rain from earlier.
I decided to fly through the sky and I did, though it was definitely hard to control 
Then I saw people on the ground, so I decided to fly by them to see if they can see me. One old lady was able to, so I went up to her and asked here where I was
She said "Finland", I said "wow that's crazy, I'm not from Finland, I'm from Canada"
Her face changed from being casual to a look of surprise and awe. So I told her I'm doing this Astral projection thing where I leave my body. She wanted to offer advice on how to get back, but I told her "no it's okay, I don't need help, I know how to get back, thank you!" and then I zoomed away.

But then I started to freak out a little bit, like what if I'm stuck? So I decided that I had my share of fun for now, and started to regulate my breathing. Slowly I started to open my eye and reality started to gradually appear. But again, that open eye and closed eye feeling was still there. I got up, looked at my room, and it was different, so I knew I wasn't back to 'real life' yet. I tried to fly, but I couldn't, my body was grounded this time. So then I tried again to regulate my breathing and open my eyes, and that's when I woke up again. And here I am!

During the whole thing, I felt stiffness in my body, and that one of my eyes was closed while the other was open. But my 'Astral body' was so light and free! I also wonder if the open/closed eye feeling is the feeling of my physical eyes closed, but my "third eye" being open.

Crazy stuff, can't wait to do it again!

Edit: quick edit, something I forgot to mention earlier. So before freaking out and trying to force my self awake, I remembered reading that you could manifest weapons. So being the weeb that I am, I tried to manifest Zangetsu (Main character's weapon from Bleach) and fire off a 'getsuga tensho' (think of it like energy wave/beam). So I couldn't manifest the sword, but I still wanted to try. I was looking at the ground, but then I thought if I do end up launching an attack I could cause damage to people/structures down below. So instead I looked up to the sky and tried to do it, but it didn't work :(
Then I decided to try and wake up

Also this morning when I left the house for work, the weather was the same way like it was during my AP session. Could be a coincidence.

Finally, I have Aphantasia, though I'm not sure if that's relevant or not, maybe it's why I couldn't manifest the sword? Who knowsSomething exciting happened to me that I wanted to share with you guys. 

Tl;Dr: Seen my cousins astral body while meditating, got the nerve to ask him and he confirmed he's been leaving his body. 

A couple of weeks ago I was meditating and trying to reach my grandpa who had passed away recently. I didn't really believe it was possible, but that wasn't going to stop me from trying. So I imagined that I could see him and thought of every feature of his I could bring to mind. Then I imagined I could smell him and brought his smell to mind as much as I could. I started to feel very close to him, feeling I was immersed in strong memories and remembering how it felt to be in his strong presence. I felt a bubbly kinda feeling in my stomach, like when you're on a swing as a kid and you go really high and it feels funny in your stomach. I felt really good. Then I imagined him talking to me and just the things he'd likely say. So I was deep in meditation at this point.

Then a thought popped into my mind of my cousin who's still living. I think because his brother passed away and I was happy for my grandpa to be reunited with him. When I thought of my cousin something strange happened. I actually seen him. The rest was just my best mental imagery, but for a split second, I seen a bright little body, peeking around a door jamb. It was my cousin who's still living, looking a little younger than he must be now, but bright as day, as if he was lit from within.

I told a couple of people the next day and wrote it in my journal. A couple weeks pass and I decide to reach out to him. We haven't spoken to each other since we were kids and we were never close, it's a big family and he lives kinda far away and is a lot younger than me. But I got his contact info through family and just wrote him and asked if he has been astral projecting ha ha. I thought for sure he'd think I was crazy! But I knew what I had seen.

He wrote me back this morning and he actually said Yes! He's been leaving his body for a while now. I was very happy to have outside validation. I told the people I had mentioned it to and everyone is very surprised. This would be a huge coincidence. I have probably 100 cousins, it's a huge family lol. 

Thanks for reading!Any experienced projectors here who have been to other planets?

99% of my projections are to spiritual worlds/ dimensions but a handful of times, and I have no idea how, I have been to other inhabited planets where I was able to communicate and interact with the entities living there.

I have no idea how this worked. Did I appear to them as a 'hologram?' Did they have technology to translate a spiritual body to a physical one? All I can say is these were definitely physical planets in our universe inhabited just as our planet is.

All three experiences involved humanoid populations that were similar to our earth but somewhat more technologically advanced. One had a similar history to ours but with an alternate timeline (maybe it was a parallel universe but not sure).

One planet garnered all its energy from its oceans.

Another had sophisticated AI 'robots' that seemed to have true consciousness.

Another had cats running around much like here we let squirrels run around and live freely.

I'd love to hear any other projectors' experiences!Curious if anyone else has experienced something like this?

This was years ago, but it keeps coming up for me. I was with my mom (who died awhile back) in a setting like our old living room (her comfortable/chill spot). I was talking with her and she was a little confused about what was going on. I very gently told her she had died, and she looked at me kind of sad, like, “Ugh… that explains a lot.”

I immediately felt someone grab me from the back of my neck, like a puppy being picked up by its mother. I felt the bungee-cord like feeling on my neck/back, like someone had ripped me out of that room for breaking a rule. I was immediately back in my apartment, eyes open, fully awake, no transition.

Has anyone else ever been “kicked out” of the astral plane like this for breaking a rule?i ended up doing it from a dream the first couple times. then from falling asleep after waking the last few times! my head kinda hurts now lmao. anyways i wanted to share the good news. 


i didn’t do anything crazy and wasn’t able to talk to anyone special. but i did try to talk to myself in my hometown kitchen and scared the fuck outta dream me lmao. that part may have been a lucid dream but the way i came out of my body and clumsily walked around made me think it was ap then as well. 


every time i came out of my body i did a front flip type exit? i felt tingly and like i was dangling in the air. and i was scared to move my arms and legs bc i thought i would be moving my psychical body, but when i decided to just go for it and move, it was my “dream” body to my relief lol.


i’m so excited :) thanks for all the support in my previous post!Hi! Don't know if this is interesting to anyone, but a family member of mine - I'll call her K - met an old Oxford and Cambridge trained Swedish psychologist who dedicated his career in the 70's and 80's to researching parapsychology at the University of Gothenburg. He did some past life regression sessions with K and also a couple of astral travel sessions, and she told me in detail what happened. I don't know how to do this whole astral projection thing, so it's a strange world to me, but being close family, I've known her all my life and trust her with my life under any circumstances, so I'm not doubting her word. K isn't vocal about these things, so few of us know about it.  


She has always had a close connection to Greece, and felt like she belonged there, and had vague memories of a life in Athens. These experiences were strong enough that she bought a house in Greece some years ago to get closer to her "history" and the memories she has of this particular life that was brought forward during her sessions.

&#x200B;

It starts out a little bit weird, I must admit. But this is how she remembers it. The first image is not from astral projections, but rather an image that she strongly felt was a memory from a previous lifetime, and I can't refrain from linking it to the lifetime she experienced doing astral travel that I'll recount after this.

In the memory, she is in a library as a young girl. She's not supposed to be there, and she knows the library belongs to her father, and that she is browsing without permission. It is a round room, and she sees a large projection of something the girl doesn't recognise, but that K easily recognises as Earth, being projected in the center of the room. She remembers someone coming. 

This is what I remember her saying about her past life hypnosis session The astral session is the last one:

She saw herself as a 10 year old girl. She was named after the colony ship she was born on. Her name was Atlantis. She was the daughter of Atlas, one of the most influential living scientist on their old home planet. In all secrecy, they had constructed a colony ship in the orbit of their planet, and about 1000 of the highest ranking scientists and military leaders on their planet had left their world behind to travel out to the stars, never to return. Their goal was to find a planet or moon that supported their life functions, as their planet was rapidly dying. The water was disappearing. The general population knew about this, but didn't know the urgency. 

She was born with the ability to do astral travel. Her mother, a doctor on the ship had the same ability, and encouraged young Atlantis from an early age to do it. Her father, Atlas didn't believe in such ridiculous psuedoscience, and focused all his attention on trying to figure out what life and conciousness was, and how to create it from a quantum particle point of view. Their focus was this in particular, something they referred to as the "code of life", but also on time and how to manipulate it.

Atlantis was unusually smart for her age. She was born on the ship, and the pressure the people lived under had made her about 10 years older than her actual biological age of 10. 

They had spotted Earth long ago as a possible candidate, but explored other regions on their way as well. There was always something wrong, even with the best candidates, and they'd have to keep on looking. When they finally got to Earth, they discovered that the atmosphere and temperature was close to perfect. It was a world with a lot more water than their old one.

However, they couldn't land, as the ship wasn't constructed for atmospheric entry. K also told me they wouldn't have been able to land even with an appropriate vessel, as the world they were seing through their screens was a much older world than the one in front of them. I struggled with understanding this part, and it stuck with me for some reason, but after some years of casually thinking about it from time to time, I think maybe it had something to do with time dilation. They were traveling at a speed as close to the speed of light that anything can possibly be, and had been traveling at this speed nonstop for almost 20 years, so maybe that has something to do with it.  

K could see herself as Atlantis leaving her body to travel down to the planet to investigate. First, she saw a surface riddles with burning lights, and heard a voice saying "watch out, there are many active volcanoes down there", and it seemed as though the entire surface was barren and littered with these volcanoes. But then she passed a "vail" of some sort which she seems to have linked to time, and immediately the surface looked much more livable. It was green, and she could see that there were lots of safe places to be.

They solved it with sending the particles of their bodies and equipment down through "time tunnels", which would reconstruct their physical shapes once they reached their destination. I'm guessing this is  some cool sci-fi teleportation. This was one of the coolest parts in my opinion, as I've always been a bit of a sci-fi fan. Anyways, they left the ship, which had been programmed to self destruct without continous maintenance to the various systems, and arrived on a predetermined location that they had calculated to be the optimal place according to a wide range of different metrics. They ended up on a platou on a medium sized island, with a narrow land bridge linking it to the mainland. This was the first time Atlantis ever saw real vegetation, other than as pictures in her books from their old planet.

They started to build shelter using their advanced equipment, but within a short amount of time, a lot of them fell ill, and several died before they could find a way to cure it.

After a period of clearing forrests and vegetation to create a settlement, they started to figure out how to farm properly. They named this new place Atlantis, after the ship they called home for so many years. 

They had occational contacts from the outside world on the land bridge. These seems to mostly be primitive humans, who looked anatomically very similar to the newly arrived, but taller. They put guards on the land bridge to keep people and animals out. 

After a few years, they had a stable settlement and had finally started to master this new world. But they were eventually found by the outside world. A tribe from further in the Mediterranean from a place called Athens had decided to launch an attack on this new small settlement. They were frightened, and belived these mysterious strangers had dragons. In reality, what they had seen fom a distance were the big machines built for burning large areas of forest and vegetation, so understandibly they were frightened. The population of Atlantis was a mixture of scientists and military personell, and they sent the military personell to defend the colony. They had met hostility before, and had in their posession modern firepower, but had chosen not to deploy them yet. When the people from Athens saw their weird looking armor, they became even more frightened, but still tried to fight. Atlas himself made it down to where these arrivals from Athens had docked their small boats, and when he showed up in golden armor with artificial lights shining on them, they interpreted it as nothing short but the arrival of a god, and threw down their weapons and surrendered. They were used as slave labour for the colony after this. 

They had stopped their scientific research, and had enough on their plate just running their colony. They had discovered that teleporting them down from the ship had left them infertile. The process of dissolving their bodies in one location and rebuilding it in another hadn't been able to properly reform their DNA. Their genetic code was damaged, and they couldn't reproduce, and would eventually die out no matter what happened. Over time, the people from Athens started to integrate with the colony, and some even fell in love with each other. Eventually, they were freed from their labour responsibilities, and offered to either stay there or be allowed to go home if they chose to. Quite a few stayed. One of them was a young warrior named Apollo, who had proven his courage several times. He was rewarded by serving in the newly built palace that housed Atlas and his inner circle. Apollo was chosen to escort Atlantis, who had now grown into a young woman, on one of her hunting trips. They both liked each other, and soon they fell in love and became a couple. He asked the name of the most beautiful plant on her home planet, which she informed was called Aphrodite. From that day on, he referred to her as Aphrodite.

One night a few years after this, she had a dream that something terrible was going to happen. Her father had been sick for a while, but in her dream she saw how the earth opened up underneath them, and how black and grey clouds engulfed and burned everything around her. She ran to her father, and told him about what she interpreted as the end of their colony. He had grown very sick the days before this, and explained to her that he was dying. If this place would come to an end, he wanted to end with it. She tried to plead with him, but he was determined. She gathered as many as she could who believed her, and set sail at dawn the day after. Apollo was with her. As soon as they made it a couple of miles away, she saw the top of the central mountain blow off, and soon the island was covered by hot ash and gas. She could see how the island started to sink, and after a while, only the mountain itself was visible, with a thick plume of ash rising high into the atmosphere.   


After many weeks of sailing, they reached Athens. It had a natural harbour deep enough for their boats. The only settlement she could see was dotted up the north-western side of a steep hilltop some distance inland, with some wooden buildings on top of it. The vegetation was much more barren than on Atlantis. There were no temples or big buildings, which surprised her. She met Apollo's family, and they were delighted to see their family member come home after years. They thought he had died. Apollo had a problem with jealousy, and he started becoming paranoid about Atlantis sleeping with other men. She tried to get him to understand there was nothing to worry about, but eventually, he was too far gone in this idea, and she had to leave him. Apollo had introduced her to the community as Aphrodite, which was now the name they knew her by. She spent the rest of her days trying to help people.   


Now, we come to the astral travel part. She did a session with the same psychologist after this, and she was transported back in time and back to her old life in Athens, and then navigated back out to sea, towards her old home Atlantis. She recognised the area, and could see that some parts of the island was above water still. She could see the road they built to the palace area right before the eruption, and her own private garden was still there. She went in to the underground bunker blasted deep, deep into the bedrock underground. There they had created two large rooms. Atlantis had taken it upon herself to document their history and everything that had happened on clay tablets that she had stored in the inner room. Some tablets had to be stored in the outer room, and K could see evidence of looting. However, the looters hadn't touched the tablets, and just let them lay on the floor, as they didn't see the value in them.

 K glided through the inner door, which was entirely intact, and could see that her tablets were safe. When she came up to the surface, she saw some guards standing outside the surface entrance to the bunker. She tried to contact them, but they didn't notice her. She found it odd that people were still there. She mentally tried to ask them which place this was, and the answer she received was "tina... atina... atlantina". Then, she somehow just knew that they were dead, but didn't know it yet, and had kept guarding this place even after their earthy duties were relieved of them. She hovered around, and looked upon the landmarks they had created once upon a time, and could see the row of red houses that the workers had lived in. Then, she was transported to modern times, and was suddenly under water. K felt a strong feeling that the tablets were safe in their storage, and that humans who did construction work on the sea floor would eventually find them and be able to learn their history. 

She could also see the impact the small colony of Atlantis had on the early civilizations that would later crop up, and she could see how the name Atlas over time had transferred over to the mountain range the Island had been connected to by it's land bridge, how his name had traveled far and wide and in a way made him immortal, and how the name of some of the people she knew in that life had influenced Greek mythology over thousands of years, and she understood that other mythologies probably worked the same way: how the actions of a single person early in the cradle of what could become a future civilization could be transferred from generation to generation over many thousands of years through folk tales, and eventually make that person a god in later mythology. She felt a sense of "full circle", and that her task was done. Then she returned to her body. K has seemed very calm and content ever since this.  


Hope this was interesting to someone. I felt I wanted to share it to see what you think. I would love to learn astral travel myself, but perhaps these things are not my strength. I'm just happy she shared her experience with me so that I could somehow take part in it, in a way.I'm gonna get right to it, I've been studying and practicing astral projection for about 8 years now, I've had a very inconsistent amount of luck when it comes to reaching the astral form. Recently (after MANY tests), I've discovered that the best way to reach that form isn't to try to astral project at all, but to learn the first step of lucid dreaming. Once you successfully get the hang of the 'reality checks'(the first step), you can very quickly apply it to astral projection. Once you realize that you're dreaming, instead of trying to control your dream, you force yourself to leave your body. Now this method has worked for me plenty of times, if it doesn't work for you please let me know so I can experiment until I find something that works for EVERYONE. I believe we all should practice this innate gift we have, I just want to help where I can. Good luck to everyone out there. If anyone wants to collaborate and come up with a COMPLETE method then please let me know.A video on youtube that plays binaural beats has claimed in the description that NASA has been hiring astral projectors to scan planets for quite some time now. It also claimed that the astral projectors had given information on the planets later backed up by scientific evidence. Does anyone know if this is true and if so could you elaborate or provide links that have evidence?Everything can be learned by looking inwards.In a prior article / video I posted to this sub, I discussed why you can astral project even if you're bad at meditation.   


Now I'm going to discuss the reverse, why meditation is very important for achieving astral states.  


As a synopsis:Mindfulness allows us to become connected / at one with our activities / the world around us versus being "subjected" to stimuli, emotions, excitements and things that invade our consciousness.   


In this way, meditation is about taking sovereign control of consciousness again. The biggest hurdles that people face trying to sustain an experience "on the other side" is they get interrupted by their thoughts. Often, fear or panic sets in upon experiencing such an event as leaving the body, these thoughts cancel the experience before it ever happens, or prevents an experience lasting for more than a couple of minutes.  


Also, just general excitement or thinking "OMG I can't believe this is happening" cancels the experience. So when you do get an experience, it only lasts like two minutes.  


The way around this is mindfulness meditation. You can actively practice going into states where you are connected to the world around you without any excess thoughts invading your thought space. This allows you to sustain an experience for much longer, or even achieving an experience, if you practice it enough that it comes second nature.  For full explanation about this subject (this article is a shortened version) see my video at: [https://youtu.be/3y3f57O79mA](https://youtu.be/3y3f57O79mA)If you've missed my previous attempts at astral projection and interactions with spirits, those posts are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/qoymzl/i_met_a_spirit_of_some_sort_and_i_still_cant_wrap/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/qwm7ql/made_contact_with_a_being_a_second_time_was/).

Last night I was doing my usual meditation before bed, laying on my back. This usually leads to me simply falling asleep, but last night I felt myself get up and stand next to my bed. I saw a figure in bed curled up,  faced away from me, seemingly fast asleep. I figured I  was in a dream. Standing on the opposite side of the bed next to this sleeping person was a woman dressed in what looked like a bright white flowing night gown, and she had long dark brown hair. At first I assumed this was my girlfriend, but once I saw her face I realized she was not even really very human. This was the point where I realized that the person in bed was my physical body.

This woman was standing there, kind of acting like she was shy, or she didn't really want to look directly at me. When I moved closer to her she turned her face toward me and I noticed she had *huge* almond shaped eyes,  almost like  she was an anime character, and she was very subtly *glowing*. Immediately I asked if she was M.,  the spirit I had encountered a few weeks ago, and she said she was.

What happened next was very similar to my previous two experiences. I felt an intense rushing, like I was moving through a tunnel on a roller coaster, and then before I knew it I was standing on this vast plane, it looked like a purple glowing platform that extended infinitely in all directions, and the sky was the dark universe. M. was standing next to me, and gestured toward this immense staircase. It looked similar in shape to a Mayan pyramid, but it was much, much taller and steeper. At the very top was a glowing portal, emitting bright white light that was almost too bright to even look at, with tendrils of light extending off of it. I didn't get a chance to go toward this staircase to investigate, because M. looked at me and sent another ball of information to me. It happened like a camera flash. Suddenly I felt like I was lying in bed  again, but I was obviously not  awake.

This next part is going to be very difficult to describe, because I believe that M. tried to show me what time and space look like from her perspective (assuming the 4th dimension). To preface this, as weird as this sounds, I need you to picture a metal steaming tray, the kind with leaves that can open and close like a flower, something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/m2PTM3P.jpg). I was able to "see" specific moments that were related to each other in regard to astral projection all lined up and connected. I saw the moment I first learned about it, then a moment when I was first attempting it, etc. all leading up to this very moment, it's impossible to describe but it's as if each moment was shown on a metal leaf of that steaming tray and it was closed up so those moments were connected. Then it seemed like the petals of the flower, or the leaves of the steaming tray "opened up" and all those moments fell back into the places I am familiar with them being, with many other events in between them. This went back and forth a few times, opening and closing, and I essentially just felt like I got it and that stopped happening.

Once this vision left me I was back on the vast plane looking at that immense staircase again. There were no other beings present, it felt kind of empty and echo-y in a way. It was just M. and I standing there looking at each other for a moment, I once again marveled at how  human her face looked, except  for those eyes.

After  this I slid back to my body and woke up in the physical realm again. I was unable to fall back asleep because I couldn't stop thinking about this experience.

Any idea what that staircase might be? That wasn't explained to me, and I didn't get a chance to move closer to it.Please answerSo here was how it went!


My mind woke up and I was already (instinctively) thinking and feeling myself swaying left and right. I was trying to stay calm and focused on my breath. After 3 deep breaths I felt my astral body float upwards OUT of my physical body. It felt like coming out of a cocoon or plastic wrap. I thought in my mind to stand up and felt myself going from horizontal to vertical. Now I was ready to open my eyes. It was dark and blurry. I was squinting and blinking to see as I was floating up backwards REALLY fast. I started to see the earth and it had vibrant colors and moving like its alive. I got so excited and popped back into my physical body. It was amazing!!! I know its not a dream because I really FELT all this. And I also felt this fast flying backwards feeling in another AP attempt that I thought was just a dream (in AP note below).


Afterwards, I was thinking in my head to write this down in my notes on my phone. I was having difficulty stumbling and clicking the wrong buttons. Then I’m like, “why am I thinking to do this, just get up and do it.” So I woke up and wrote in my AP notes. If you want to see, it is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/enp3qd/my_ap_historynotes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


My last attempt was 5/12/2019. I don’t really try to AP, it sometimes happen when my mind suddenly wakes up. Anyway, that’s all, good luck!!!Today we had a post from someone who claimed that in the dark space on internet there is a file with God frequency and the file cost several thousand US dollars.

There have been some other post to find that file and another one to create such file.

Now yes there a Brainwave Entertainment Industry and sells various binaural monaural isochronic tracks from few dollars to few thousand. Hemi-Sync , Holosync, iAwake are few of the well know names in the industry.

The person mentioned that the the file was based on Monore Focus 15 but intensity of amplified. Now if you understand how binaural beats work you can say that above claim 100% false.

Here is some explanation of how binaural beats work  
The frequencies can be classified in 4 main states:  
Delta from 0,5 to 4Hz - Deep sleep and coma;  
Theta from 4 to 8 Hz - Drowsiness and the first stage of sleep, trance and dream;  
Alpha from 8 to 14 Hz - Relaxation vigilant, awareness and integration;  
Beta from 14 to 30 Hz - Alertness and concentration;  
Gamma - Waves are very rare and related to frequencies above 30 Hz in the range 30-90 Hz and are typical of states of deep meditation and great energy

Above frequencies is transmitted using carrier frequency.  
You can read more in detail here  
 [http://www.thecymartist.com/binaural-beats](http://www.thecymartist.com/binaural-beats)   


Now Monore tracks are more complex and have interwoven carrier and base frequencies.   
There is a tool which can be used to reverse engineer the track but its difficult

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUmRig3e2kw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUmRig3e2kw) 

Good news is some of the tracks are already reverse engineered and the frequencies are reported. There is also a open source software which can be used to create your own GOD FREQUENCY , you can use the already reverse engineer information and create your own   
**You can download the software and examples including the focus 15 one.**

Does the tracks work ? As discussed widely there is no one button solution unless you are truly gifted. There is a big debate if any of brain entertainment tracks work at all, but general consensus is  everything, including binaural beats, even magic wand... are just tools. The real magic is done by the mind and consciousness.Has anyone here attempted to access the akashic records? I’ve tried twice now and both times have almost succeeded however I feel as if there if something holding me back.I’m not sure this is the right place to post my experience, but here we go.

In 2016, I went to bed completely sober. As I fell asleep, I experienced something that felt more realistic than real life.

I was at at a small house and talking with people I have never met before. Everyone was laughing, smiling, and having an amazing time.

As I was sitting on the couch in this house, someone reached over and touched my leg. Surprised, I looked over and saw a woman. As I looked in her eyes, I learned a new perspective. In her eyes, I saw that everyone was connected through consciousness. That everyone consisted of the same consciousness that just experienced different things throughout their lives.

After that vision/dream, I view everyone as the same entity; just experiencing different things. 

I wish I could return to that state. In comparison to what I experienced, this life on earth is complete hell. 

I don’t know what it was, but it was more than a dream. I’ve never experienced something like that since.

*Also, I’ve never experimented with psychedelics.Did not expect it to be what it was.I was told astral projection is like having the keys to the universe. I projected once while full of love and energy, I laid down for 10 seconds and arose out of my body and floated up to the ceiling I could see in all directions at once. I got excited and snapped back into my body, It happened right after I was finished watching an ancient aliens episode about grays and astral projection on tv, that episode has been deleted and erased since then, I haven't been able to find it, Incredible experience!!!I just wanted to share with people what I have come to learn over the past week, as it could potentially help those who are struggling to AP. 
First let me start off by saying I am not a doctor, just a mere person who has stumbled upon something that personally works. If you are looking to include more vitamins/minerals to your diet please consult your doctor or do your own research. 
I started taking magnesium before bed to aid in ADHD symptoms. While I believe it has been helping with my restless mind, I’ve also witnessed an unexpected effect. 
In the past week I’ve delved into lucid dreaming and also AP. Both of these in the past haven’t come easy to me. However, last night I’ve had one of the most astounding AP experiences, interacting with past and future versions of myself. I can only assume that this is the product of the magnesium intake before bed. 
Now, doing a bit more research, I’m finding that there are multiple studies on magnesium and it’s effect on sleep. I believe it to aid in deep muscle/brain relaxation, allowing for an increase in natural
brain activity. 
Anyways, I just wanted to share what I’ve recently stumbled upon, as it may help other who are struggling.

Edit: As I’m doing more digging on this I just want to emphasize speaking to a professional health care provider. It seems if you have existing kidney issues, your kidneys can have a hard time processing a consistent increase in Magnesium.I just want to see her again, she is on a ventilator right now and since I can't go visit her I would like to try and astral project to her and tell her I hope me and my son love her and help to keep fighting to stay alive

She spoke to my uncle before and said that she was scared because she's in pain and doesn't think she'll make it.

So please if you can guys can help me or maybe if I could give her some positive healing energy or something to help her get through this mess it would greatly be appreciated 

I just lost my father yesterday and don't want to lose my grandma too, please help if you can

Thank you so much everyone for the prayers and kind words it all means so much to me and my familyAnd is there really a hole at the south pole that leads underground?At one point

I was tripping really hard (solo) on a high dose of LSD, and a demon appeared to me. Red, gnarly skin, red eyes, long sharp teeth, and huge horns. 

Of course I became extremely scared. I tried to “fight it off,” not knowing what I was doing. If a demon is a negative entity, then negative emotions that I was projecting, such as hatred and anger, only fueled the demon. 

The hallucinations grew worse and I felt thousands of bugs crawling on my skin. Then I saw visions of a huge demon army marching in tune to a war beat. I knew something was wrong so,

I googled, “how to get rid of demons,” and eventually came to the conclusion, that projecting love and kindness would turn the demon towards my side, like the story of the demon king Mara and Buddha. So I projected those emotions with the help of Beach House (thx) and the demonic qualities of the demon disappeared. It became a grayish, more neutral looking figure and then said something to me and disappeared. 

I didn’t really know what happened. I thought there was something wrong with my life and mind, and went on a sort of quest to fix myself. I came to know incredible things, mental, physical, and spiritual, and my life became much, much better because of it. On this path of awareness, I learned what the demon was.

It was me. From the future (a couple days ago). A couple days ago I astral travelled consciously, while again tripping really hard, and I travelled through time to my past self (all this was intended), and scared the living fuck out of him by appearing as a demon. Why? So that past me would assume that something was wrong with him, and strive to fix himself, eventually coming to a state of near perfect mental, physical and spiritual health (which is me now).First time ever visiting this sub and wanted to share my experiences.

My first and oldest memory. I'm 4 years old and I wake up in my bed. I am experiencing a sense of hyper awareness I will continue to experience for the rest of my life. My first thought is "I'm here.". I look around my room and say to myself "Ok, I need to get my bearings. I'm in my bedroom right now.". Then I walk down the hall and into the living room. I see my two brothers and my mom and think "That's my mom and those are my brothers. They are getting ready for school... I don't go to school because I'm too young." and then I had this feeling of being ready. Like I was ready and able to handle what was happening. I then sat down in front of the TV to see that Nick Jr big blue face that used to talk between shows and the hyper awareness faded and I just became me. 

I've always had these moments of awareness where I seem to step outside the perspective of my human brain and feel like I am outside looking in. I am still in my body but I feel separate and my body seems to me like some sort of weird octopus tentacle. I've often used this state to do what I've been calling "waking meditation" where I just focus into that state and observe my surroundings and know I am real and that this universe is mysterious and not what it seems. It makes me feel like a floating consciousness and not a physical being.

As for my experience as a child I sometimes wonder if that was my consciousness (or soul) truly entering my vessel for the first time or if it was just me experiencing this sense of awareness that seems innate in me for the first time.

I've had many other experiences along the way such as I believe angels will guide my intuition if I allow it and convey love and wisdom to me and their sign to me is the number 11.

I'm excited to join this community.I love this subreddit. Sometimes I feel like you guys are the only ones that get me considering everyone I seem to talk to about this irl doesn’t believe me or has no clue what I’m talking about.

Edit: I’m still trying to get to everyone and will respond to everyone, I’ve been a bit busy lately. Thank you for all of the responses and awesome comments. You guys have opened my eyes to a lot of things that I have yet to do in the astral realm and have inspired me to take things to the next level! Thank you!btw, don't comment, just read this then ignore it.

Story:

For months, I've been trying to astral project because of the stories from others where they travelled to different worlds, met entities, and practised their art in various realms. I was heavily interested.

Yet, I've tried various techniques but it doesn't work for me either it strains me, something prevents the method, I fall asleep, or just plain nothing.

Then, one night I was in a point where I could feel I'm nearly there. My whole body was asleep but my mind awake, though I was still inside my body. It felt like the only thing needed was the will or choice to leave.

For some, I felt nothing. Absolute peace. 

I realised this: 

This wasn't for me right now or maybe... in this life. I didn't have enough reason that makes me want to leave my body, or if I did I would've just been standing in my room like an idiot before going back. 

I didn't know what to do: *travel the world?* I wanted to close my eyes comfortable with the scent of books in the air and the rain pattering in the background. *Meet other entities and other worlds?* I wanted to do this before but now... *no*. Apart of me felt like I want to explore and understand everything from the various worlds to entities, dimensions, the past, present, and future after I finish my life.

The only reason I tried this because it sounded cool in the stories of others.

I reflected on my methods and realised something: My wishes to project felt hollow, it didn't have the same will and intent as I had when I made affirmations to wake up at a specific time (I'm good at affirmations) or when I imbed myself with motivation and reassurance.

Maybe I'll try this soon but not right now at least. Or maybe I could try searching for that reason right now.

# From me to you

* Reflect on your methods, remember will and intent is important
* Try imagining yourself finally ap-ing and think about what you'll do and where you'll go
* **Have a purpose or a strong enough reason and will to do this.**

\-------

Tl;dr: just see the 'from me to you'

btw, don't comment, just read this then ignore it.Last night in bed, before the clocks set back one hour i found this sub. I read the AMA’s and found the wiki with the flowchart on how to achieve AP so i gave it a try. I tried to concentrate and be still but then my eyes started twitching and I felt my heart beat heavier than usual. I wasnt fully committed and a bit scared so I backed out. 

I got out of bed and went to the living room where my wife was up late binging on the laptop. I told her about my attempt to AP and she got SO scared and worried so she made me promise not to do it. But man, I was too curious to find out. 

We finally went to bed after an hour and I know I promised my wife I wouldn’t make another attempt but I think my mind unconsciously did it in my “half-dream” state.  Just laid on my side very still, closed my eyes and focused on the faint “sounds” around me. The sounds started to get louder and louder in my head and i started to feel the vibrations underneath me. At the same time the sound flatlined and I knew I achieved it. 

I then told my self to get up and my AP got up from my body. I had to sorta push up from the bed to separate myself then jumped out to the side of the bed. I was so estatic I cant believe what I just did. I then went to the bottom side of the bed and saw that my wife was awake beside my body. 

Our room was different, our bed was different. I then stumbled on a plastic bundle of tissue paper at the bottom side of the bed and managed to catch it before it hit the floor. My wife then was looking towards my direction but I dont think she saw me. I got so excited to tell her that I did AP and I wanted to calm her down so I went back to the side of the bed and jumped high to fall on my sleeping body. I squeezed myself in then I finally woke up. Kinda like how Leo woke up on the beach in Inception. 

I laid back for a few minutes, mind blown about what just happened. I then woke up my wife and told her I just did AP and she got mad at me. Oops.I had 3 hours of sleep last night and laid down with my kids for a nap. I could feel the vibrations start and sleep paralysis. I tried to wake myself up and then remembered no wait just lean into it. So I sat up. I could feel it. I kept trying to open my eyes and did but thought I was opening them in my physical body so I closed them. Turns out, I was opening them in astral but was confused. I could still see my room in my head even with my eyes closed. I didn’t leave all the way but I saw blurred images, like heat waves in the shapes of figures in my room. Then I just laid back down and opened my eyes in my physical body. Now I want to try again and leave my body all the way.Soul is the thing that contains memories right? So what happens to it during Alzheimers???Any reports or known instances of this happening?I recently finished the My Big Toe trilogy, written by a nuclear physicist in the language of contemporary Western culture. Thomas Campbell worked with Robert Monroe from the beginning of the 40 year research. This is the most in-depth book I have found on the “Big Picture”. The books detail both physical and non-physical realities, consciousness, spirituality, our purpose, accessing different realms and dimensions, OBE’s, timelines; going back and forward in-time and the purpose of time, and going beyond time; he even explains how to do Transcendental Meditation and build your own mantras. He explains how you can heal and manipulate the physical from the non-physical, change your reality and what makes it so; our guides that constantly help us and the Rulesets that must be followed. The information is based on first hand experiences backed by science. I cannot recommend this book enough!!Hello, and welcome to r/AstralProjection, the biggest and best subreddit on Out of Body Experiences (OBEs). Dedicated to serve all astral projectors/out of body experiences of the world. Welcome, everyone!

The below FAQ may have some long answers in it, but I tried to give the most common questions the shorter and simpler answers

**FAQ;**

Q| What is Astral Projection?

A| Simply put, an experience that many people have that shares similar qualities. Usually it is described as your soul/consciousness separating from your body to go anywhere you want in the world and more

Q| Is it real?

A| Are your dreams real? Are your thoughts? Is your perception of the world? Does it really matter? Well, if it does matter to you, the truth is that nobody knows. The majority of people here believe wholeheartedly that they are leaving their bodies and visiting higher dimensions. Others think it's all in the mind, like mainstream science which tends to say it's just some dream-state induced by a deep trance. Some think they're all just using different words for the same thing. Nobody can tell you what to believe, only you can. But I can assure you that people actually do experience projection, no matter its 'realness'

Q| If it's really what some say it is, can I get hurt?

A| Well, this is where common sense comes in handy. It's not easy to do, but you need to ask yourself if you're mentally fit. Do you or your family have a history of mental problems? Are you pretty grounded in reality, or are you more loosely tethered? Are you pretty mentally stable, or not so much? Do you suffer from anxiety, pre-existing sleep paralysis, sleep-walking, panic attacks, depression, etc..? If so, proceed with caution. You are solely liable for anything that happens to you when you decide to undertake any willful practice

If you're mentally stable and aren't prone to anxiety or panic attacks, you should be fine because those are usually about the worse that can happen. You can **never** be physically harmed by AP itself

Q| Can you pull me out of my body?

A| Can I? Probably not, not that I would if I could. I can give guidance but I refuse to give anyone an easy way out. I've also never heard any verifiable account of someone doing it (Trusting a source implicitly doesn't qualify it as verifiable)

Q| Have you ever been inside Area 51?

A| I have to point you to the rules section below this FAQ, specifically rule no. 8. This subreddit doesn't have to do with anything conspiracy-related. It is solely about AP, and while anyone can believe what they want here, spreading conspiracy will typically get you banned (after an initial warning). This has pretty much made that question, even if asked innocently for an honest answer, off-limits

Q| I'm a skeptic/don't believe in [insert aspect of AP here], can I still come here, post, and be a part of the community?

A| Absolutely. There's nothing in the rules stating you can't have a certain belief, but it is implied that you can't force it upon others. This has opened up an entire can of worms in the form of debates. Debates are allowable here, but to a certain extent. If you are just outright attacking someone's beliefs, that will warrant a warning and then ban if there's noncompliance. That goes for anyone of any belief. Logical, empirical debate is allowed and even encouraged, but infighting in the community is not. The reason I said 'can of worms' earlier is because I have to interpret what is logical debate and what is an attack, and then take the flak for it when someone thinks I didn't do my job right. Part of being a mod I guess :P

Q| If this is a mostly spiritual subreddit, is mainstream science disallowed here?

A| Actually, I myself am a subscriber to mainstream science. Though I have been quite spiritual in my life, I consider cold-hard logical science to be my first passion. I try to balance the two, but I don't typically like pseudoscience (which makes me hypocritical because I tend to use it when explaining things on here) but I do think that a portion of science is fundamentally wrong and we have obviously yet to discover even a percent of all there is to discover. Still, mainstream science has 100% of the empirical evidence when it comes to explaining the universe. Therefor it is treated by me as the most valid explanation of, well, anything there is to explain. But all that means is it's not to be written off. You don't have to *believe* mainstream science, but it's perfectly welcome here and you can't just attack it. Though if you try to debate someone who is using cold-hard science, and you lose, that is not an attack. That's just the result of a debate

Q| I can't project, am I doing it wrong? 

A| Probably just not being patient enough and doubting yourself, but in all truth I have no idea. The only one who could have any possible idea is you, because it's your experience. The experience of astral projection, and indeed anything spiritual, is extremely subjective by nature. It differs from person to person, based on and influenced by their specific neurochemistry, beliefs, experiences, memories, etc... It's so different from person to person that I've seen beginners get it on their first try, even people doing it without knowing what AP was, and I've seen people go for years and years before projecting. But I've never seen anyone fail if they don't give up. It took me around a month for my first projection, but that was likely helped by me not caring if I would even project in the first place. I just enjoyed trying, it was extremely relaxing and I always looked forward to it even if I didn't project. Just let go and go with the experience next time, Hakuna Matata, let go of any worries or doubts or fears or expectations and just let it happen (hope it works for you!)

**Quick Beginner Guide to AP**

First off, let me tell you this; If you're a beginner, you will probably not be projecting tonight. Maybe not this week, or month. Maybe you'll get it the second you lay down and close your eyes. It's different from person to person, and it is really up to you to look through and try as many methods as you can, even make your own, until you find the best one for you and perfect it for yourself. Everybody has their own trigger to project, they just have to find it

Now, beforehand it is good to have some experience with meditation. No, you don't have to meditate regularly to project but it helps. It's never too late to start, my favorite basic meditation is mindfulness in lotus-style position. Since this is about the projection methods and not meditations, I will leave that up to you to google it if you don't know what mindfulness meditation is

As for the projection methods, I will actually be discussing two different methods of getting to the trance-state needed, and then many different separation methods once you're there (No, vibrations aren't necessary to project. They're very common, but don't panic if you don't feel them)

The method I use starts from a completely awake and conscious state. From this completely alert state, you lay down somewhere comfortable. The way in which you lay actually matters way less than most make it sound, but still you may find legs crossing or laying on your side to be distracting so typically people lay flat on their backs with their arms to, but not touching, their sides and their legs not touching each other. I've heard some say propping your head up on a pillow at a slight incline helps, but all my projections have been flat on my back. Again, I don't think it matters all that much

Once you're laying in a comfortable position like that, close your eyes and let your consciousness drop. Not fall asleep, but drop to resting and even meditative levels. To project, the most important thing is to be in a trance-state

Normally, when people do this, their bodies start to feel heavy and tingle/buzz. If this 'buzz' feels like intense but painless electricity flowing through you (feels great to me tbh, just sounds scary from the description), then you're likely entering sleep paralysis and feeling 'the vibrations'. Most people call this the vibrational stage. A lot of people try to exit their body when they notice they feel the intense vibrations

I don't, I keep going further. I relax more, I care less, I have no doubts or fears, and I just 'let go', not even caring what happens and surrendering to the experience (feels great if you can bring yourself to actually 'let go', it's the singlemost freeing experience you'll ever have)

Usually, I separate when it gets beyond intense (it really can be very intense, and some even say it's uncomfortable. I've only seen people have negative experiences when they are prone to panic attacks though)

But some people have to do a separation technique at this point. While still in the trance state and feeling intense vibrations, visualize yourself pulling yourself up out of your body by a rope, hand over hand. A ladder works for this, even an elevator or a hammock swinging you out. For me, if I ever need a separation technique, I just imagine myself floating up in the opposite corner of my room, looking down at my body unconscious in my bed, and I'm projecting. But whatever works for you, there are many techniques

There is another method of getting to the trance-state though that many say is much easier to project from. It requires you to be asleep beforehand, wake up, and then immediately lay back down (you don't even have to get up really) and try to project, usually using the above method. This seems to greatly increase the odds of having a successful projection, although I did it the harder way up top, without sleeping first

During the depths of a dream, I'm with a group of friends hanging out in a jazz bar. It's a low-key small room with many friendly, relaxed people enjoying music from an improvisation band. I go to the bar and buy some deliciously sliced wagyu beef, served on a paper plate with a toothpick to eat the meat. We all leave the jazz bar, and I follow behind while enjoying the food.

This dream is nothing out of the ordinary, but what happens next is one of the most dramatic "shifts" from a lower dimension to a higher dimension that I've ever had.

As I'm walking on the city streets, I lose sight of my friends, and I look for them down dark alleys. The roads seem to become eerier and desolate. The feeling of fear jolted me into lucidity - this often happens when I feel fear in dreams like my subconscious suddenly switches into high alert and swiftly turns on my waking consciousness to defend itself. Immediately upon realising it's a dream, I become hyper-aware. Not wanting to be in this dream anymore, I intend to stop the dream and enter the astral. However, instead of expecting the dream to collapse and enter a normal Earth-like realm in the astral, I involuntarily enter into the lower regions of the astral world.

Instead of being in dark city streets of black and grey like my dream was, I was now in a crumbling post-apocalyptic city of smoky black and red. There was a prominent presence of hostility and insidiousness. I walked down a street, not impressed at all by what I was seeing. Every block of cement had some sort of damage, and the sky was pitch black with streamy dark grey clouds across its expanse. As I walked around a corner, I saw a big open courtyard, with diseased-looking people everywhere walking slowly and creepily, clearly with no clue as to where they were going. I thought to myself that I always thought typical Hollywood films of "zombies" were just an exaggerated reflection of the lower worlds, yet here I was watching something that could easily be on the set of the Walking Dead.

To my surprise I didn't feel much fear, I've met evil lower beings before who have been more threatening, and these "zombies" appeared so feeble-minded that they didn't seem like much of a threat. I even considered if I could help these people who were unquestionably lost souls. I watched them for a few moments, looking for any sign of intelligence when one noticed me. His face, arms, hands and legs had blood, rashes and scars all over them, and his skin had a tint of grey as if he was ill to the bone. His clothes were ragged, dirty and shredded. As I looked into his eyes, I saw barely any glimpse of life, perhaps deep inside, I saw fear, but there was a strong feeling of anger and malice on the surface. He looked at me for a few moments, and I considered whether I would be able to talk to him, he took a few steps towards me and then suddenly began running at me with a treacherous growl. As he got within an inch of me, without any thought, I cast a force of light at him, which threw him backwards and into the air. I'd never done this before; it was instinctive. I watched him fall and get back up. Realising that there wasn't much I could do here, I intended to leave this place, and I felt myself travelling downwards underground, I began to hear a demonic voice and realised I was going in the wrong direction! With pure willpower, I forcefully flew upwards and chanted the mantra "OM", and I flew back up through the surface, leaving the crowd of diseased humans beneath me. The fear of going even lower than that dimension and hearing that evil voice frightened me and in turn, must have given me such a powerful surge of energy because the next part blew my mind.

As I chanted "OM" and flew upwards ascending through dimensions, I didn't just stop and arrive somewhere normal as I usually do. Instead, I accelerated, and I felt myself enter through what I can only describe as penetrating a celestial atmosphere. If the Earth's atmosphere is the Earth's head; I felt my head and mind expand as if my consciousness was merging into space. I felt myself lose my usual form and became only awareness. I enjoyed this expanding feeling so much that I willed myself to go faster, and I soon seemed to be travelling through a wormhole. I intended to go far into space and beyond the stars as I possibly could. I began to see stars, planets, meteors and space clouds go past me; I knew that in a sense I was flying past them at an extremely fast speed, but in another sense, it also felt like the objects were going past me, rather than me just travelling past them. Wormhole travel must genuinely be to do with bending the laws of space, time and distance to get somewhere faster instead of just travelling in the physical sense of "A to B".

As if by magic, I eventually found myself inside the room of a tall building filled with bright light, I looked at my hands; I was back in my usual form. The room I was in gave the impression of a hotel, it was immaculate, and all the furniture was pure white. I was standing in front of a tall and wide floor-length window looking out at the most majestic vastness of crystal clear ocean I'd ever seen. There was pure golden light on the sky's horizon, and the atmosphere dispersed upwards to the top of the sky into a glowing neon blue gradient. There was an island in the middle of the ocean with colourful tropical-like vegetation that was not familiar to me. What caught my attention next was looking below the sea; there were giant sea creatures the size of whales swimming in groups, they looked like a mixture between a whale, goldfish and koi at the same time. There were people on the water, or humanoids for a better word, not exactly human, but they had the same structure as humans, except they looked larger, more flexible and less hairy, and they were clearly good swimmers. I considered whether this was some form of "oceanic humanoid species" on a planet unknown to humanity. I've had no prior knowledge about such a species, nor any interest in such things, yet here I was, why did my consciousness bring me here?

I was trying to discern them, but the problem was I was so high up in the building so I couldn't distinguish them clearly. I felt that I was so far from Earth that I was the one who felt like an alien, and I felt like I had to conceal myself; I felt reluctant to get closer in fear of drawing attention to myself. On the other hand, these people looked incredibly joyous and friendly. Some of them were riding on boat-like vehicles. Most of them were swimming or standing on platforms. Even though I could barely see them, I could see they were enjoying themselves profusely, jumping in and out of the sea, riding in boats with their arms in the air and swimming with the sea creatures. I could hear their cheering and laughter. I couldn't help but smile in awe of them. They enjoyed swimming with the animals, and they unquestionably had a close bond with them. The joy they were radiating was immense and infectious; I felt so ecstatic that I wanted to fly and join them. I watched the giant fish swimming under the water and jumping into the air and playing with the people. They were all care-free and happy; it was a stark contrast to where I had just been.

The fact that I was in a hotel-like building with people having all sorts of water-based fun made me feel like I was on a planet where happiness and leisure were a usual way of life, it felt remarkably light compared to our dense world on Earth. I looked around my bare white room. I saw a screen on a wall, which had my location on a map, I didn't recognise the landscape; most of it was water, which made me consider it was probably mostly a water-based planet.

The feeling of being on another planet became even stronger when I saw their moon in the sky - it was no regular moon; it was bigger and shining powerfully, as bright as a star! It looked as if it had solar rays beaming from its sides. I was baffled, and as I stared into the moon, trying to figure out how it was so bright, I started to feel off-balance. At this point, there was someone in the room with me; I heard a female voice tell me about the place. I couldn't make out her appearance; I told the woman I had to go as I felt myself losing energy. Even though I couldn't see her, I could feel her smiling at me; I felt love.

I let myself go. My awareness gracefully glided back to my body, and I felt my physical presence again, I didn't move or open my eyes and recollected the entire experience, all the way from when I was in a dream in the jazz bar. Whilst recalling, I had a deep sense that I had been to that planet before, I *knew* the woman in the room with me, perhaps I had a past life there, I'm not sure. Maybe that's the reason I went there out of anywhere else; after feeling a jolt of fear in the lower regions of the astral, perhaps a deeper part of me I wanted to go somewhere familiar, somewhere happy.

One thing that confused me the most was the moon shining like a star. It made me consider whether I was in the third-dimensional world or not. I'm not sure whether it's scientifically possible for a moon to shine so bright. Maybe their star was very close, and the moon reflected more powerful than usual, or perhaps I was in a much higher dimensional plane than I thought, where such things are possible. It also reminded me about occult texts I've read that point towards both moons and water being representations of emotion. On top of that, the species I saw were highly and positively emotional spirits.

If you have any insights on the moon or know about "oceanic humanoids", please feel free to share in the comments below, and as always if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for reading!

Check out my new YouTube channel:  

https://youtube.com/channel/UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lwAfter 6 YEARS (yes years) of research and on and off attempts (I’ll admit to not being very diligent with attempts but I must’ve tried maybe 60-70 times) I finally had my first AP of more than 5 seconds. I tried a new method I found on here called the vigil technique and it actually worked. I realized that all the other times I’d try to project I paid too much attention to my body (breathing, heart rate, trying not to move) and that was holding me into my physical body. I focused on the blackness behind my eyelids and repeated the mantra “don’t focus on the 5 senses, they’re unimportant right now” and I felt the familiar buzzing but then for the first time actually felt the separation happen. It was like when you go cross eyed and see double- I felt myself vibrate out of phase with my physical body and hover maybe 3-4 inches above where I was. I focused on sitting up which was super hard cause every time I’d try to move I’d become aware of my sleep paralysis. Eventually I managed to sit up in and grab the bottom of my bed for stability. My whole body had the same buzzing sensation as when your foot falls asleep. I tried to look back and see myself sleeping but everything was pitch black, even though I knew it was morning and there was plenty of light in my room. I kept trying to will myself the ability to see by focusing on the thought “let me see! I want to see!” But I was pulled back into my body. I tried to re exit but miscalculated the timing and ended up actually sitting up in bed and opening my physical eyes. 

TL;DR after an insanely long journey I was finally able to AP pretty painlessly (no weird auditory hallucinations or any of that supposedly scary stuff) with the “vigil” method. I’ll post the YouTube link below:

https://youtu.be/Moil3DPAZkcI was doing a meditation and feeling all of my energy and relaxing my body.  I imagined white light shinning into my forehead.  I then saw myself outside myself for a brief period before I decided to follow the light above me.

I went into a place of white light and met a feminine energy.  She put her forehead to mine and started to send light into my head.  She told what I’m doing is correct by expanding light energy.  Spreading light energy.  The purpose is really to disperse light energy.  To maximize the number of unique forms.Saved allll the pdf files that came with the course, a 6-week workshop, with numerous resources, guided audio files, and even Q/As from William himself! would like to share them with this community! Let me know how I could just share them with you guys and I will. Cheers. 

———EDIT———

Google docs link is up! the file is a little heavy, so if it's a problem for some let me know and ill try to lessen it up a bit. try zip.extractor, heard it helps.

Safe travels and stay safe.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vQnzwBomxuNnWLOaVCFfHRh8x2eiJzsz/view?usp=sharingHello everyone, this is my first time posting here. Also, English isn't my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes if there are any.

So today I read a few reddit posts on how to start astral projecting, one of them suggested to lay flat on the bed and concentrate on my third eye, so after I was done with my online lectures I did exactly that. It wasn't my first try to AP though. Till now the furthest I've got to were vibrations (about 2 or more years ago). But today I did it. I was focusing on my third eye as much as I could, cleared my mind... Some time has passed and I felt the vibrations, stronger than ever before and after a few seconds (or at least that's how much it felt) I could actually FEEL my astral body detach from my physical body but I knew I was still in it. When I astral projected I "saw" or visioned something like a grainy black space, it's hard to explain. What was cool is that I kept completely calm (and a bit focused I guess). Within that vision, I heard a strange alien language, It was a voice of a man, he was talking gibberish I couldn't understand, I felt that he wasn't talking to me, but I don't know who he was talking to. but I heard it as if he was talking through a radio (like the radio in police cars). I felt energetically weird, to say the least, I didn't feel like I was in danger, but also I didn't quite feel that I was welcomed. I tried to get out of my physical body (stand up and roll), but I felt stuck in it as if someone didn't let me get out, then I got frustrated and woke up. After that, I got up and went for a little walk to the living room, I felt really weird energetically, like I was disturbed or like I disturbed something. A really strange feeling. I just know this wasn't a dream. I've had many real-looking lucid dreams, but this was really different.

Anyway, I have a feeling that before doing it again, I should work on my aura or focus on shielding myself.I AP'd last night and met a guy that looked like the mayor from The Powerpuff Girls?? He was short, bald, had a monocle, and told me "I've been watching you all your life. Come with me."

This was too much for me to handle and I returned to my body immediately after. I don't know if I imagined that, or if I could trust this powerpuff mayor resembling being. 

Anyone ever experience something weird like this?Posting to get some new perspective on dream theory on astral projection, the metaphysical, and hyper-lucid dreaming. For some background, I (30’s F) have always experienced intensely real lucid dreams. Sometimes to the point it is hard coming back from them. During the dreamspace, I have a distinct feeling of leaving my physical body behind. My inner self is the one “experiencing” as I normally would, and projecting a physical form to inhabit depending on what dream I am in. When I “come back” from the dream, it often takes about an hour to regain familiarity of my physical body. I am not much of a spiritual person per say, but it has gotten to the point where I feel like I am living two separate lives: My waking life, and dream life.

Normally my dreams center around the following themes: Visiting people and places from my past, an augmented reality that I don’t fully understand, or places that seem futuristic/otherworldly. I regularly visit the same places over and over in my dreams that I enjoy visiting, albeit having visited them or not in my waking life. This has been happening my entire life, and I feel like I am slowly traveling further and further away and “losing the cord” back to reality. 

One of my most vivid experiences was visiting an alien world where myself and several other humans were being pursued by alien creatures. At one point, one of the people fell to the ground, and started slapping himself repeatedly. He screamed “wake up! Wake up” over and over again, and he scrunched his eyes up as he cried out. All the sudden - *poof* he vanished into thin air. 

At this point, I am starting to believe I am going beyond our physical dimensional plane - and somehow these places in my dreams are real. I would never tell anyone this, because to my scientific/rational side - It seems crazy. Does anyone else have similar experiences or theories they can share? I am not sure what I am experiencing is “Astral Projection” as I am not too well versed on the topic. Multiple internet searches seeking answers have led me here.I can’t ap as of now but when I get it down. Epstein island is one of the places I want to see. I’ve heard too many stories of that place and I want verify some stuff.During an AP my spirit guide gave me a message to pass on:

"There are no useless attempts."

She explained it like this: Every attempt at AP you do- with desired results or otherwise- has progressed you in some way. There are no "failed" or "successful" attempts; only results. Stop classifying attempts as "successes" when they give you the results you want, and "failures" when they don't. Instead approach AP with an open mind, and use belief rather than expectation. Remember the message whenever you start to doubt. Banish all negativity. Never give up. You've got this.Okay so recently I spent a week in the icebox. The center wasn’t too shabby compared to what it’s like in county. Hella time isolated from everyone, nobody to really talk to but guards( only when spoken to). I spent whatever time I had sitting in my cott, living in my head, analyzing & organizing my thoughts. A day or so before I left I had an overwhelming wave of energy drown me in the most calming way. I had no idea what prompted the feelings exactly, but all I wanted to do after it, was lay on the grass in the yard to breathe in the sun. When the time came to go out, I spent my entire hour watching clouds, feeling so connected to things outside the jail. Outside myself. I closed my eyes & really tried to meditate & take myself to my happy place. I counted my breaths & slowly felt like I was fading into sleep. But my brain was still in my daydreams. The more I deepened my breathing the lighter I felt. Almost weightless. I felt what I thought was my hand wipe the sweat from my forehead, but I realized it wasn’t me physically who felt the touch. My body was so serene, motionless. I felt the grass on my legs as if I was kneeling, instead of laying on my back, as I was. It took me to a place I knew so well, my moms grave. I watched myself lay there on top of her, crying a bit & apologizing. I saw myself sit up to say goodbye, & touch her name on the headstone one last time, & right next to her name was mine. My birthday etched in, my date of death a blur but not far from that day. I was hovering to the side of  my body watching it collapsing on the stone. I felt like I reached down to touch my shoulder & before my hand fully lowered, the yard alarm rang & my eyes crept open to the guard shouting my name. I couldn’t decipher if I had just had a gnarly cat nap day dream or if it had thing to do with the tsunami of energy I felt earlier. 
Before bed, I laid eyes open wide staring at the ceiling, replaying it all like a movie. Some part of my brain starting drifting to my happiest of thoughts & I instantly felt in my bones, holy shit did I just project. What the heck did I experience & was it the cosmos speaking to me, or did I just will that into happening? 
The past few months I have been amending many legal matters, that I ran from for years. It‘s been an avalanche of consistent stress, court appearances, financial dues & craziness for weeks to say the least. But every time the past came to mind, I looked back at how dark & heavy my soul felt. How lost I was in myself for so long. &  all the ways my soul feels intact now. I’m slowly changing & the burnt bridges I’m rebuilding, they freed me. I freed me. My heart feels like it levitates between my physical body & my spiritual body , every time I move. I’ve opened myself & soul to phases of life, I’m so proud to be at. The more I find myself letting go of all the meanings & experiences in my past that I chose to be blind to , the more I open my eyes & see all the life around me to presently live in.Im sure some of you have heard of the Fermi Paradox. Basically it says that if there is so much alien life, why havent they visited? Well maybe life in the universe eventually becomes evolved enough to just exist in both the astral and physical plane at the same time and they dont have to start APing, they can just do it all the time, even while physically moving and working. And so maybe rather than traveling in space ships, they can just find the coordinates of earth (based on which neutron stars our solar system is next to) and can just astral projecd here. Maybe thats why they are working with the CIA. Hell, maybe they are actually the ones guarding the military bases, not the military. Maybe they are trying to obtain secrets from our military and dont want our military or anyone else snooping on their opperation and stopping them. 

But anyway. Thats just a theory. Am astral theory.I can say 100% that this is a real occurrence. I was skeptical, even called people liars for attention at times, but when it happens, you dont really expect it. This seems almost too good to be true when described in mere words but no words can go in depth to truly show you how real this place is.

As a former atheist, I can now sleep peacefully and be positive in life thanks to my projection experiences. I didn't even know what this was when it happened to me, I thought I had died from an overdose but I then awoke back into the "real" world. Nothing prepared me and i wasn't even into this , like no former research before hand.

My ultimate point is that this MAY seem fantasy, but I was proven wrong in a kind of terrifying way. Death was knocking at the door, but I kinda see death as some illusion now. In death, I fear I will be nothing but "lights out", nothing. The end. But the human consciousness is so much more powerful than we even really can comprehend. We can escape our bodies, recreating life that is unimaginably awesome.

I was never a spiritual person but I begged "God" for answers. Some shred of evidence that something was there after our life in this meat suit is over. Well, I was shown the truth. It may be "God" or it may be something else. Either way, the end is never. Existence is eternal.I was talking to my mom about astral projection, about entities and such. She then told me I had a guardian angel I could see as a child, at age 2/3, called "Big Aaron"(my name is Aaron). 

She said that she once told me as a child to "be careful going down the stairs" and I said "I won't fall big Aaron takes care of me"

She used to think I was talking about my brother's friend Aaron, she thought I randomly looked up to him as a role model, but then after the stairs thing she said "Aaron, Mikalis friend, isn't here though?" and then I replied " Oh, not that Aaron! The one that is always here"

As soon as I heard my mom say "Big Aaron" some memory or emotion came flooding back to me and I desperately tried to remember the details but I could only feel the essence of the memory.

I decided to stop trying to astral project about 8 months ago but I shall start to try again. This conversation with my mom today, along with a fascinating experience I had meditating last month, where an entity contacted me, feels like a sign to project. 

I will write up the experience I had meditating later on tonight, thanks for reading.I’ve always wondered this.If so could you share your experience and what you may have encountered?If this is true, it would make things alot more interisting. Like imagine your astral projecting and you see your neighbor whose also in the astral realm hunting someone.[honorable mentions] : "can someone AP to ___?" 

First of all, nobody cares if you think if ap is a dream or not even real. Stop asking questions and go see for yourself. 

Second of all, these posts (which i see 5+ of everyday) fuck the sub up! 

Sure every now and then we can have a debate based on actual experiences but just a plain ass post asking "is this real?" doesn't help anybody!

If you have questions about it being real, you can search the sub for information and check the FAQ! 

And if you're posting on here, make it worth something.

Bottom line is the mods have to make some changes.I hope there's no karma requirement, because I'm new here...

Sometimes I get dreams that feel "different", that feel like I'm at an actual, real place with other consciousnesses. I don't know if this falls under astral travel, because it's not like I induce these deliberately, but they do have that same "quality" as the astral experiences that I did induce deliberately.

Anyway, last night I had one of those dreams again and this one was particularly strange. I was watching (along with many others) some kind of "astral media broadcast". Like the equivalent of the news in the astral. The presenter seemed distraught, but in the dream I did not really understand the full scope of what he said (kind of like I was a child trying to comprehend adult-stuff). He talked about how a large number of conscious "units" was just sacrificed inside a simulation in order to contain some kind of virus, or something that was trying to escape. It was squashing these units but after billions of them, they managed to stop the evil thing. I was confused at why he seemed so upset, because it was "just a simulation" after all...

So i was just curious, did anyone experience something similar?

And a related question; is there a place for recording and sharing these kinds of experiences of which one suspects others might have had as well? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea behind astral travel is that one actually travels a dimension of existence that is not just limited to one's own consciousness, right? Yet, most discussion I see here (after lurking for a while) are about exchanging tips and experiences, but rarely try to find similarities or actual shared events night-by-night in the astral. Is there a place for that?

Disclaimer: yes I realize this might be all imagination after all, especially with the C19 events seeping in the subconscious the last 2 years... I'm just curious.Mainly I want to know how AP and the study released by the CIA has changed your view on religion. Many things I read directly correlates with teachings from Mormonism, which I was born into but left as a teenager. When you speak about people in the afterlife living on different planes, some lesser than others. That’s Mormonism. Different degrees of glory and you get placed appropriately according to how you’re judged. Hell in Mormonism is “outer darkness” and with you describing planes with low frequencies causing things like fear and sadness, that sounds like mormon hell. When you talk about the absolute being a consciousness that exists throughout all layers that sounds like god to me. So are the Mormons fucking right after all this time? I’m desperate to change my life. I’ve been contemplating suicide for like two or three months now. My own energy is so negative I can’t stand it. I’m looking for almost anything to change me so I can be happy. Freaking out about religion isn’t helping. So tell me how meditation and AP has changed your life, and if you can answer any of my religious questions based off your experiences during AP, please do.I feel like this would be the ultimate test. I'm sure this would have been attempted but i want to know if you more experienced projecters have been successful?In July of this year (2020) I had what I originally dismissed as the worst nightmare I have ever had. I was having overwhelming anxiety and was unable to sleep but kept forcing myself to try. Eventually after what seemed like hours of keeping my eyes closed I opened my eyes and looked at my clock next to my bed. Immediately I noticed my vision was blurry and the colors in my room felt “off”. I thought this would be fixed once my eyes readjusted.

Then upon getting a better look at my clock I noticed the numbers were changing constantly, the numbers were going up. (12:00 am, 1:00 am, 2:00 am, etc.) I attempted to grab my clock and examine what may be causing this to happen.

Upon reaching out for my clock I noticed my movement was VERY off and I somehow managed to end up on the floor next to my bed. I looked around somewhat confused and noticed my physical body on the bed and asleep. When I recognized myself I 2 thoughts, “Am I dead?” And “FUCK YES A REALISTIC LUCID DREAM TIME TO DO WHATEVER I WANT!!”

To put my death fears to rest I examined my body and noticed I was breathing. I also noticed the Sun outside my window was coming up, then coming down, then coming up, and so on. I decided this was probably apart of my “dream world” and rolled with it. I then went on to live out my lucid dream fantasy.

These fantasies are well, just that, there is some really attractive ladies at my work and heck, I wanted to try to have a lucid and wet dream. I’m so ashamed to admit this but I was able to Fly/Teleport to my place of work and try to “hook up” with any or all of them in my dream. This is where things started going bad.

Instead of my co-workers who I was attracted to being there, I arrived in my managers office and overheard all the assistant managers talking about how unfortunate it is to let so many go and if I should be let go as well. This is when I saw MYSELF again, awake and alive, walking into my managers office.

I then started to see this scene through the POV of my physical body. Most of what I heard was gibberish, but I remember one of my managers saying “This company will work just fine with less people, only the managers will have hours now and you and the other associates will be dropped to 0, unfortunately you aren’t allowed to apply for unemployment, we will call when we have hours for you” rage exploded in me.

Upon arguing I called every single manager out on their bullshit. This confrontation turned physical and I hit 2 managers with a desktop and knocked them out. I then tried fleeing the scene only to notice... It’s night time and I am once again seeing my OWN body doing my closing procedures. (Counting the safe, collecting documents)

Time then sped up very quickly. My physical body left, came back, left. Almost like i was witnessing myself speed through full 8 hour shifts in just a few seconds. I looked at a computer in my workplace and saw the date as 11/21/20. This would be about 4 months from when I originally was trying to fall asleep.

I also noticed my physical body wearing La laker and Dodger 2020 champs Hats/Masks when I would show up and enter my work. I heard music in the background that sounded like one of my favorite rap groups, Shoreline Mafia, but none of these songs I recognized. (They ended up dropping a new album later in July)

After putting a bunch of this together I came to the conclusion the hey, maybe im TIME TRAVELING, or something like it. So like any jerk I had the thought of finding winning lottery ticket numbers to strike it rich.

Before I could act though. A very intimidating CEO looking grey haired lady grabbed ASTRAL me and strapped me to a hospital gurney. She had these big muscular shadow people with her that seemed to be her minions or body guards. They started injecting me with a bunch of needles and yelling gibberish. The only words I could make out were “Nice” “Good” “Leave” and “death”.

This lady and shadow people pushed the gurney around while my consciousness was begging them to stop. They took me so many places, its honestly tough to remember. Eventually I just screamed “LIFES A GIFT PLEASE LET ME BE HAPPY” and poof. They vanished. I noticed i was still on a gurney, but in a hospital.

I looked around and once again saw the physical me getting stitches on his face in the ER.

Then I was awoken by my alarm, and all of this came to a STOP. And it was still July. WHAT A WEIRD SCARY NIGHTMARE I THOUGHT.

Fast forward to now. A lot has come true off this experience. Dodgers and Lakers are 2020 champs, everyone got laid off at my work, and I got mugged while out on a jog and had to get stitches on my lip. Everything that happened after July felt like deja vu.

A lot didn’t come true as well though, I never hit my managers with a desktop, the statements they made never happened as well, In fact my managers actually helped me get a new job at a different company in town.

I still am very confuse and curious about this experience. Doing some research into spirituality and AP, i cant help but to feel like this experience would have been very different if I didn’t let my Lust,Anger, and Greed takeover.


What the hell happened?

*NOTE: I am a a drug user, I have used many different substances. I am high functioning and limit my intake, I also test everything. Maybe this contributed as well??

TLDR: I think i may have AP into the future, things I saw happen ended up happening in real life (with some exemptions ), my experience doesn’t seem to far off from other stories posted, but I’m still very confused and curious to what happened and the meaning behind it. 

I’m writing this to aid others to reach the same level of attunement to the higher consciousness state that I have achieved over the past few months. 

You will start the path of connecting to the true timeline and will be able to hear yourself and others amongst the static if you practice patience, honesty, mindfulness and love. I have found that this ties in perfectly with having successful OBEs as well once you adopt these principles in with your pre-sleep meditation. If this piece touches you in some way or if you have questions I'm happy to try my best to answer! :)

 

Your higher self is always there with you, they are your best friend, only you know how you think and feel things with absolute certainty, so CHANNEL that. You are there with yourself in that room, and so is the love that you have for those around you.

 

**Adopt the belief that you are the main character in your story. Act like it. Narrate the scenes.**

 

From what I have concluded in my own meditations, every person you engage with is on this highest frequency. Whether or not you can tune into their higher selves is put down to how much they engage with you in the present reality. You meet so many people throughout life, so it is important to only keep those who serve your heart and mind rather than bring toxicity to you as an energy. As you continue to practice **MINDFULLNESS** you will be able to introduce more people into your circle.

 

In saying this, the phrase **keep your friends close and enemies closer** rings true in the sense that, there **WILL** be those that wish harm upon you, you will be able to tune into them as well as they have acted towards you dishonestly. Keeping your tribe close knit will serve your higher self and make it easier to commune.

 

As cheese as it sounds, self-love is the hardest step to actualize because of the way we’ve been conditioned by society to compare ourselves to others.  We are made to engage in this capitalist system in which we struggle to actually fulfil this higher self.

 

**Imagination is key.**

 

Imagine your frame of vision as a VR movie scene.

Your present moment thoughts are the soundtrack to this scene.

When you use these guiding principles to “imagine” you can tune into the highest frequency. Your mind will naturally fill in the rhythmic pattern, and will assign a voice to the frequencies/voices you will hear.

 

When you listen to music, assign the feeling you have with the song to a person/event that you can imagine that track as being a soundtrack to the scene. You will still be able to hear through that soundtrack and voices singing/speaking/dancing, like audio tracks being layered on to the scene.

** **

**Guiding Principles**

** **

**LOVE**: Love without the expectation of a return, to truly give completely and utterly. You know how those you love act/speak/would react to things intuitively through your interactions with them in the present reality. Love is stronger than any other sensation, physical substance or otherwise, so this is the most important principle to follow. It is not to be confused for lust.

** **

**HONESTY**: within yourself and all the actions you have taken, that means acknowledging the parts of yourself you keep in the shadow. The frequency is clearest when you can personify that honesty. This requires all of your ability to accept, acknowledge and forgive yourself for mistakes you have made towards yourself and others.

 

**CLEAR YOUR MIND**: Listen with intent to the white noise, the static. What I mean by this is there is frequency that is emitted by all beings in this universe that we are able to harmonize with. Conditioning by collective society has cause this ability to be dulled drastically.

** **

**Shadow Principles**

**DISHONESTY**: Not being truthful within your own thoughts and actions confuses and misdirects your higher self. In order to walk the _true_ path you must not be dishonest with your actions and thoughts.

** **

**FEAR**:Thoughts and actions you fill with hateful, fearful intent harm your higher self and those around you. Hatred only lasts as long as you allow it to, just as love is instantaneous hatred only perpetuates itself as long as you give it the power to.

** **

**ANXIETY/OVERTHOUGHT**:The creation of scenarios that cause anxiety happen entirely within your own consciousness, so being able to let go/confront those thoughts will help clear the veil between you and your higher self.

** **

You must learn to **differentiate** what is a fake thought scenario, and what has actually happened. This is where being honest with yourself is most important.

** **

**Time**

From what I have gathered from my meditations, time is a **construct **constrained by the language we use**.** We do not have many appropriate words for time and how it interacts with the physical world. This is a constraint set by the system in which we are living in physically.

The voices/scenarios you will experience “in your head” are on a higher timeline, but that doesn’t mean they have been actualized.

 

Consider that the speed of thought is truly the fastest. A feeling is instantaneous. Love doesn’t take time to travel to reach someone’s heart, it is felt instantly. Your vibe doesn’t take time, it just IS in the now. Consider the power of what NOW actually is. Our brains have the ability to construct every possible scenario instantaneously, but if we did that it would overload your mind. Think of the brain as a computer/receiver.

 

**Trauma**

Trauma (from the small to the reality shattering) you have undergone veils the visual layer of the highest frequency, but not the audio. Your brain forgets the imagery of trauma in order for you to heal, but you do not forget how it made you feel/the sounds associated with that trauma. Confronting your traumas takes a lot of mental energy so practice this slowly.

 

Social media somewhat distorts the ability we have to imagine how people are, so instead of imagining how someone would text you, imagine how they would speak/think/act physically in the moment.

 

The most important step is to imagine communing with YOURSELF FIRST, that is to say if you were there with yourself how you’d talk to yourself. This is the first layer of vibration. Catch your own voice on the static. This is because you have had the most experience in life knowing how you speak/act/think.Lol let's all collectively master astral projection and get off this earth!! Lmao. Who's with me. This world is so corrupted. I am so disappointed in so many things lately. Let's go!! Lol. Wouldn't that be something. Just playing of course. I have astral projected a few times. Twice seeing my body above me and leaving my house. And other times it was more like lucid dreaming.Like I said I have been able to astral project since I was 5 I have tons of experience, insight and story's. Ask me anything and I'll try the answer any questionsI’ve known/read about astral projection for over 10 years, and every few months I’d try to do it myself. Every single time I felt like I was getting close but it just wasn’t happening for me. I tried every technique that I could think of from the books I’ve read. Eventually I gave up. 

During this quarantine I started trying again and I kept running into the same obstacles. Today, I was curled up in my bed, trying to take a nap, and I felt something grab onto my hand and try to pull me off the bed. That part gave me sleep paralysis vibes (I do get sleep paralysis pretty often). But THEN!!!! The vibrations!!! Nothing like the tingling I’ve ever felt before!!! And then the whining in my ear! You guys! Holy shit! And then it felt like I was falling off the bed but somehow I KNEW BETTER? And right when I slid off the bed I began FLOATING UPWARD! 

It was SO WILD! I opened my eyes and there I was in my apartment! It felt like i was looking through a translucent Saran Wrap but THERE I FUCKIN WAS!!! 

and then astral me tried to play some music on my phone but it didn’t really work out, and I went to a different corner of my bed, and then I woke up. 

SO IT HAPPENED! Very unconventionally, but it happened. 

Now I’m trying to get it to happen again. Do you guys recommend that I do the same exact position I was doing before? Also, I think the reason I snapped back into myself was because I got way too excited, any way to prevent that? 

Sorry if this post sounds like I’m rambling, I’m just ridiculously excited and I have no one to really talk about this with

-
EDIT:

Howdy friends. I got so much beautiful feedback and advice (and an award flair thingy?! Thanks for popping that cherry!) and unfortunately as much as I tried I couldn’t get back into that headspace last night. I think it’s because I caught some type of stomach bug? It’s been pretty hard to do anything besides sleep or like...puke. 

BUT! Once I become an actual person, ill post an update on my astral shenanigans! 

Thank you again for all the kind words :’) I really didn’t expect much posting in this group besides one lil casual “congrats” or a couple upvotes. You guys are the bomb.Alright, so a couple nights ago I realized that I can achieve sleep paralysis on my own accord. Of course I have to be significantly drowsy, then I place something weighted on my chest, (ie: a heavy pillow, or weighted blanket) I relax all my face muscles, don't touch or move any part of my body even if it itches or feels uncomfortable, then after about 3-5 minutes in, all the muscles in my body begin to seize up and vibrate heavily. At this point I'm in a state of paralysis, I can look around with only my eyes but can't turn my head or move any limbs. This is about as far as I've gotten, I feel like this is a step closer to achieving astral projection. I just need the next step, do I just have to concentrate on pulling myself out of my own body? (I haven't tried this method yet but the next time I do this, I'll give it a go) Any advice on what I should do from then on would be greatly appreciated.Full disclosure: I have interacted with the Gray Aliens 4 times while astral projecting. Twice on a large cloaked ship in high orbit around Earth, and two other times in their moon base on the far side of that body. I do NOT vouch for any of the information below because I have found the grays to be very “fluid” with the truth. Each time I have asked them questions I’ve gotten different answers than the last time. However, I sense there is truth below if you can ferret it out successfully!

Q: Why can’t humans detect your ship in orbit?
A: It’s cloaked. The system uses magnetic waves and special alloys not found on your planet. It is somewhat like your stealth shielding, but much more advanced.

Q: Where is your home world? What is it like there?
A: it is located on a world in the constellation you call Pleiades. (Another time they told me Sirius). It is located in a binary system. Our scientists told us over 10,000 of your years ago that one of our suns was getting hotter, and that it would make our planet unlivable eventually. Today many of our people live in underground cities. Only the hardiest still live on the surface. It was this news that prompted our people to explore this section of the galaxy.

The grays can see in both the physical and astral planes without difficulty. Every time I have traveled to their ship or base they have noticed me immediately. They have shown a lot of curiosity about how I manage to travel to them so easily. One time I was asked for my home coordinates so they could come “visit me” in the physical! I thanked them for the offer, but politely declined. They seemed disappointed, in their own inscrutable way.

On their ship in their examination room I found a human once on one of their tables that seemed to grow out of the floor. His astral form was bobbing immediately above near the ceiling, obvious fright on his features. I went over and tried to calm him, but he was mad with animal fear. I asked the grays to stop examining him and release him back where they found him, but all they would tell me was ,”it’s ok. He’s fine.” Nothing I said would change their infuriating response!

I have asked representatives of the grays the following important question on all four separate occasions.. Each time I got a different answer! Maybe you can guess why I don’t trust these guys...

Why doesn’t your race announce yourselves to humanity?

Survey says:

1. The first time they looked at me like they couldn’t understand the question. Imagine if you asked this question of a lion researcher in Africa who was “abducting, examining, and releasing” lions. How would he react? Yeah, that was exactly their reaction! 

You don’t announce your arrival and intention to examine dumb animals to the dumb animals! As a representative of proud humanity, I can tell you their reaction brought me down a peg or two on this occasion!

2. We have contacted your governments. They’ve asked us not to announce ourselves for fear of destroying your societies.

3. We have a non interference “Star Trek” directive.

4. What do you mean? We’re talking to a human right now!


I’ve started up a new Channel on YouTube, Astral Club https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE

I’ll be discussing astral projection topics, answering questions, talking about my experiences in Time & Space, and helping people to join the astral projection club!I didn't wand to label this as negative because I don't know that I would consider any experience as negative -  or at least I haven't gotten there yet.  But...I did get threatened today. After a little while being flown around who knows where - like some weird cosmic warehouse - with a woman's voice in my ear that sounded like it was a radio transmitter in my head that had some kind of prerecorded guided tour made especially for me and was spouting off information and instructions that I did not understand at a rate I couldn't keep up with - a man finally interjected and threatened me that I needed to go back. He said that if I didn't, we'd be going to a place (I understood as hell) that I would never be able to return from.  
Up until this point, I've been going into these experiences with the utmost confidence that I will be safe and will always be able to return. I really wanted to keep going, so when he said that, I paused and then said, "Liar." (And it felt so real I wondered if my physical body said it too). 
I immediately started dropping far and fast and the energy started getting a little dark and creepy. I got a little nervous and thought you know what...this has been my longest one yet, it was already a lot to take, better not chance it. This was the first time I had to intentionally return. I started wiggling my fingers until I started merging, but when I felt awake and conscious in my body, I was still seeing some images from the AP and they had transitioned to this weird, old timey looking kind of cartooney images. That image just started jiggling and gradually fading away. As it did, I felt this huge pressure behind my eye. As the image jiggled, the pressure vibrated. As the image faded, the vibrating pressure traveled from behind my eye and diagonally up the top of my nose until it reached the middle of my forehead and dissipated. 
For sure the most bizarre one I've had so far.If you want to know how the physical world was created and how it's really just a super dense programmed astral world read this.  It should answer a lot of questions.

Reality  is a dreamworld.  There is no real world.  The physical world isn't  real but it is designed to convince you that it is.  When you leave this  insane world you can create your own matrix that is very similar to the  physical world.  But first here are some basics about the nature of  reality.

Reality is a dreamworld.   There is no real world.  The physical world isn't real but it is designed to convince you that it is.  The only difference between a dreamworld you go to when you fall asleep and the physical world is that the physical world is much more dense and has layers of programming to  try to prevent you from seeing that it is a dreamworld.  So reality is  just a construct created by the mind.

So  what is reality programming?  In less dense worlds that people go to  during dreams and OBEs and after death reality is far more malleable.   You can take a motorcycle and turn it into a horse.  You can manifest a  sun or a black hole in your hand.  You can manifest people and  environments.  The people are just programmed constructs but if you  didn't know that you would think they were real people.  So you can do  anything you can imagine.

So  reality programming is programming energy and reality itself to do what  you want it to do using intention.  So in less dense worlds you can do  some crazy reality programming.  Let's say you manifest a house and you  don't want negative entities coming near it.  You can use your intention  to imprint a program in the reality so that if they do come near  zombies jump up out of the ground and any nearby statues become animated  and go after them.  Then once they are gone the zombies go away and the  statues become statues again.  That is reality programming.  If you  haven't had out of body experiences it sounds far fetched.  But it is  how reality works.

So how do you  create a matrix similar to the physical world.  That's a lot more  difficult then a simple reality program like the one I described.  And  there are various methods.  First you would have to create a world.  It  would have to be nice at first and a world that people would like.  Then  after things have been going well for some time you suggest that we  make it interesting.  And that people who come to your world get memory  wiped.  And you get some people to go along with it.  Once you've memory  wiped a bunch of them you've got them.  They will be easy to control.

You  can memory wipe them and put them in storage containers with a memory  wipe energy field.  I've done memory wipes during OBEs.  It's just  energy programmed to have a memory wipe effect.  Once you've got a bunch  of people memory wiped you can start to reprogram the reality that you  created.  For one thing your going to have to make it a lot more dense.   The more dense a reality is the more difficult it is to change.  You  are also gong to have to program the reality so that the avatars of the  people there are very weak and limited.  This is done by mental  programming also.  Get them to agree that their avatars are fragile and  weak, and age way too fast.  Collective agreement shapes consensus  realities.  So if you can get them to agree to it and they believe it  then that will determined their reality.

Also  your going to have to get them to agree that they can't just easily  step out of their avatar.  Brainwashing them into believing they will  die or run into demons or be judged by an angry god if they step out of  their avatars is one way to accomplish this.  Energetic programming of  the avatars themselves would also contribute to this.  You can't stop  them from just stepping out of their avatar if they are determined to do  so but you can make it really difficult for them.  Also you would have  to get them to agree that when they leave their avatar when it's asleep  that they black out.  And if they remember anything it's just a dream.

So  you've got these people memory wiped and brainwashed into thinking that  they can't leave their avatar when they can.  And you've got them to  come to your dense programmed dream world.  And because it's so dense  it's very difficult for them to change it.  But if they figure out what  is going on and decide to work together they could override the  programming, make the reality less, dense and change it to how they want  it to be.  So you have to reinforce the programming and keep them  divided against each other.

So you  probably want to split them up into countries that speak different  languages.  And of course program their avatar to prevent telepathy.   You can create governments and use your middle men to control them and  play them off against each other.  Or you can incarnate part of yourself  but with full awareness and control them directly.  So you could be the  king or emperor, or president of every major country at the same time.   That makes implement your agenda for control a lot easier.

Aside  from wars you also want to keep them indoctrinated.  So you could  create an education system to brainwash them.  And depending on how high  tech your world is brainwash them through newspaper or electronic  media.  But you probably want to make it low tech so that it isn't as  easy for them to figure out the truth.

Even  more importantly you want to shape their beliefs about what happens  after death.  Religion is a good way to do this.  Indoctrinate them into  believing a religion.  And create different religions for the added  benefit of crusades and holy wars.  And for those who don't buy religion  give them a materialist scientific belief system.  Tell them that  reality is just a cosmic accident even though you know dam well it's  not.

Then what you need to do is  worry about what you are going to do when their avatar dies.  At that  point they are out of your little prison dream world.  They could choose  to go anywhere they want to.  If they knew how.  So you are going to  have to have teams of your people who's job it is to go around and fool  the recently deceased.  They will pretend to be whatever god or  religious figure they worship.  If they are an atheist go with whatever  religion they are most familiar with.  Or just create a hell world with  lots of fire and brimstone to scare the hell out of them.  That usually  does the trick.

Then show them a  review of their recent life (memory transfer is easy enough).  Tell them  that they did bad things and that they should reincarnate to make up  for it.  Most of them will probably fall for it. The ones that aren't  stupid will tell you where you can shove it.  Then if they are dumb they  reincarnate.  And when they drop dead again just tell them the same  bullshit story you told them last time.  So there you go you've got your  slaves brainwashed into thinking they should reincarnate.

Another  thing you probably want to do is use negative events to spark lots of  negative emotions.  You can set up a grid system just outside of their  visible spectrum to harvest the energy of their negative emotions.   Energy that is beyond their programmed visible spectrum.  The more  negative events the more negative energy you can harvest.  You can feed  off of this negative energy and transmit it through the grid to make the  world more dense and lower the frequency.

You  also will probably want to make a program to limit their awareness as  much as you can.  So blanket the world in an energy field that is  programmed to keep their awareness within the visible light spectrum and  to make it more difficult for them to just step out of their avatar.   You can't stop them from stepping out of their avatar if they are  determined to so but you can make it difficult.

Another  thing you want to do is make it difficult for anyone outside of your  dreamworld to interfere.  So get your slaves to agree that they can't  see outsiders who don't have an avatar in your dreamworld   (ghosts).   The collective agreement and programming will make it very difficult for  outsiders to show themselves.  It will take a lot of energy for them to  override the collective programming.  And even then they will likely  only be able to show themselves for a few seconds.  The more programmed  your slaves are to believe that ghosts don't exists the less likely they  are to see them.

So then you've  got your slave world.  A dense heavily programmed dreamworld.  Where  people are set at war with each other to keep them divided and  distracted.  And fighting over who's religious and political belief  system is right.  While you pull the strings and puppeteer their society  in the direction you want it to go.

This  is a very simplified overview of reality programming and how to create a  matrix.  The physical world matrix is way more sophisticated and there  are layers and layers of programming.  Even so it doesn't stop people  like me from having out of body experiences and learning about the  afterlife  And figuring out what is really going on.  So I hope you  learned a lot from this.  Let me know what you think in the comments."Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."

- Beyond The Wall of SleepI’ve been astral projecting for a while but decided to start posting on this subreddit more! A few months ago I exorcised my friend’s ghosts. It all started with an experiment to try to visit the dreams of some of my close friends. When I tried to go to one of my friends, I arrived at her house and noticed a heavy dark energy. The colors also seemed to be this grayish green color. It felt like a ward had been casted over the house but I had got inside. What I saw horrified me. It was this toddler sized entity with the head of an infant and it was like a blackish green aura all around it. It was playing with my friend’s limp body. I panicked as it noticed me and started harassing me and ended astral projection early.

My friend had told me that she felt like she had a ghost a long time ago and how she would experience mischievous acts all around her no matter where she was living at the time. She also could never have dreams which was odd. Even when drinking mugwort. It was clear also that the ghost was siphoning energy from her.

I had made up my mind that I would try to remove the ghost. If I could see it, I felt that I could destroy it. A few weeks later I astral projected again and went to her. This time she was in a different house because she was visiting her mother. It’s important to note that her mother has a protective altar. When I encountered the ghost in their home this time, it was only a wisp with that same blackish green aura. it didn’t take on its full form and I also didn’t see my friend. I believe that the mother’s altar severely weakened the entity. So I projected energy needles out to the wisp and I saw it fall to the floor, “dead.” I then prayed to Archangel Michael while still astral projecting and I literally saw the black hole remove the remains of the entity.

Soon after this occurrence, my friend began experiencing a flood of dreams and had some improvement in mental health. The ghost hasn’t been seen to this day. Just wanted to share this story!I started off by writing down the steps in my dream journal and asking my guides to keep me safe and help me out of my body when the time came. After that i got into bed, layed still on my back eyes closed, one hand placed on my solar plexas (for purpose) and the other on my root chakras(for protection and grounding) while i gave myself reiki and did some meditation and visualization about AP (I kept thinking I AM GETTING OUT OF THIS BODY AND I AM SO GOING TO THAT MIRROR RIGHT OVER THERE!-just like from the video leave your body in 3 days-Gathering all my confidence and suppressing any and ALL doubt!) As i let my body fall asleep.  After i started to feel my body fall asleep (20 minutes? )a new sensation came over me.  I don't know if it was the "vibrations" people talk about but i just knew it was time to start trying to get up! I tried the pushing myself up and the rope pulling myself up but i just felt like something was holding on to me. So instead i pictured a rope zipping by me very fast and as soon as i visualized myself grabbing it POP it pulled me out so fast and i was out! I was like holy shit it works! I forgot all about looking in a mirror and trying to eat something because i knew i was out and i wanted to start exploring!  It is similar to lucid dreaming but at the same time VERY different. Hopefully i can do it again and practice moving about the astral plane (i couldn't figure out how to get to outer space or the future.  Unlike in lucid dreaming you just fly to it or think it and it pops up), getting further away and train my memory to stick better as far as recalling more easily all my experiences! Good luck to you all, I'll send out some positive reiki vibes out to you all who are trying tonight because i think EVERYONE should experience this✌.Trying to get past the “vibration” stage. Thanks to anyone who helps out!Yesterday I had my first successful, positive AP experience and it was down to the wealth of information available on this subreddit. When my friend introduced me to this sometime last year, I never doubted it was real or couldn't be done, but I knew at the time I wasn't going to put any real effort in learning/trying for myself so didn't bother and stayed away. Last month I was ready and I'm so grateful and glad I've started this journey.

Now being that this is my first successful AP I'm clearly no expert, but I do want to offer my advice and help for those who are trying and haven't had any luck as of yet - I've been lurking the sub for a couple months and the amount of posts I see asking the same questions that are answered in the wiki is staggering, I guess that happens in most subs but you really should go there first before anything. With that being said, let me tell you what I've done/been doing that I believe helped me AP:

&#x200B;

\- First thing I did was watch Michael Raduga's *Leave Your Body in 3 Days* Seminar (Part 1). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc)

Yes its over 2hrs, I sighed and went "wtf" too when I was implored to watch it by my friend. But what's 2hrs for a lifetime of otherworldly experiences.

&#x200B;

\- I know some people prefer reading to watching, I did both anyway so I also read his FREE eBook covering the same topic, *The Phase*. 466 pages. You can download it from

[https://obe4u.com/how-to-lucid-dream/](https://obe4u.com/how-to-lucid-dream/)

Don't just read the techniques on the link, scroll to the bottom and actually download the eBook, its MUCH more detailed.

&#x200B;

\- I also read *The Frank Kepple Resource*,

[http://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html](http://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html)

 which for me was a real eye opener and a fantastic read. It just helped solidify my beliefs about Astral Projection and life, I highly recommend.

&#x200B;

\- It wasn't until after I watched and read those resources did I even make my first attempt at trying to AP, not saying anyone else has to do this, but I went in with the thought that the more info I have before trying the better equipped I'll be.

&#x200B;

\- Didn't work the first time lol, but I wasn't disheartened or put off. I 100% had belief that I would be able to down the road, and was happy to be able to even feel new sensations I hadn't ever experienced before just from simply trying.

&#x200B;

\- I downloaded and read Xanth18's free eBook, *My Astral Projection Truth: What is Astral Projection and How to do it!* 60 pages. Had some different methods and techniques I was curious to try

[http://www.unlimitedboundaries.ca/2014/06/27/my-phasing-primer-pdf/](http://www.unlimitedboundaries.ca/2014/06/27/my-phasing-primer-pdf/)

&#x200B;

\- *The Gateway Experience* Hemisync audio exercises from The Monroe Institute - One thing that always bugged me was when you'd be trying to relax, listening to some sort of meditation audio and they say "clear your thoughts/empty your mind" but never really tell you how. Might be easy for some, but for me, all that ever meant was as soon as I think to clear my mind, 2 seconds later I think of the flipping Destruction AllStars theme tune (it is a banger) so my mind is never really clear. These Gateway exercises have really helped make my mind less noisy and me to focus on relaxing, and I felt that after the very first exercise, I highly recommend.

&#x200B;

>**The key to Phasing is to just let the experience flow. You need to allow yourself to become it, as opposed to trying to go to it, or point to it, with some kind of “method”. Just lay back and simply become it. At which point people usually say, "Yeah, but Frank it’s okay for you but when I close my eyes all I see is blackness. “Well, that is all I see at first!”** 

\- A quote from the Frank Kepple Resource that I think is important - you really do need to just feel for the experience as apposed to trying to make it happen. I love everything AP related, and I think I was too eager initially to make things work, even though I wasn't frustrated or annoyed when they didn't. Once I got used to and the hang of actually relaxing and just feeling when to do something instead of overthinking every move and technique, it happened.

&#x200B;

\- Don't get hung up on what's the "best/quickest/easiest" method, no one can answer that for you no matter how many have tried. You have to simply try them for yourself and see what works best for you. I went from Michael Raduga's method to Xanth18's, back to Raduga to focus on the mistakes I was making and with the new knowledge and meditation I had been doing. Don't put any limiting beliefs on yourself because that is what will stop you from being successful no matter how small you think they are.

&#x200B;

Apologies the post is a bit long (my first one here as well) but I hope those of you who are yet to experience it can get something out of this that you may have missed or not thought of that can help - all of the links I've posted are all taken from the wiki, please check it out if you haven't there's so many good resources. Thanks again to this sub, hope to meet some of you out in the astral soon!If y’all watched the new movie there’s a group of hippies that just AP and help around lost souls that are too deep in their vices within the astral realm. I personally loved the movieHello,

I have a 14 month old daughter i have yet to meet. The mother of my daughter ran off shortly after she got pregnant. I recently have moved to the state she is in and opened a court case to see and gain parental right to my daughter.
I have never AP'd but have been very close before. I am wondering if I can visit my baby girl using AP. I havent met her yet and have been heart broken knowing she has been living life without me.
Since Court takes awhile, Can AP help me see her?

I would appreciate your feedback. Blessings :)i meditated untill i astral projected and then calmed my mind whilst projecting (thinking about a safe bubble around me ) once i was in my own bubble i started astral projecting again whilst already projecting and i went from being in my astral body to being a circle orb i was viewing my self in 3rd person like a gta 5 game . i knew i was that orb and the orb knew it was me . after that the orb came through me and woke me up back into my astral body after that i woke my self up again and started writing thisIt was called Red Door Yellow Door. Any Other Color Door. In this game we would sit in the basement. Lights turned off.

I would lay in the center of the room on my back, hands resting on my belly.

My friends would surround me, standing in a circle. When I signaled I was ready to begin, they would start to chant "red door, yellow door, any other color door" 

They would chant this for up to five minutes, as I lay there, trying to find a door. The vision of a door in any color. Eventually, if the traveller is lucky, they see a door appear in their vision, on a void background. That's when the game begins.

Generally, the first door you see is safe to go through, regardless of the color, as the hardest door to manifest is the first, so it should be taken at once or risk losing the chance. But as you delve in, the color of the doors is important.

Through the first door, you enter a place. It's important to speak out loud what you see, so that your friends can advise you and know when they need to pull you out. Because in this game, they will almost always need to pull you out of the place you go to.

The game should never be attempted alone. For one, without the chanting it's very hard to find the door. Much more importantly though, no one will be around to save you when the man looks you in the eye. This is why you need to narrate to those around you as you journey on.

Beyond the first door, you generally see a hallway, or a larger room, with other doors leading out of it. If it's a hallway or a large room, the first door on the left is always an exit. It's the very last exit you will come across that allows you to leave on your own without a force of will. 

Sometimes though, the traveller doesn't see see a hallway or a room with doors. One of my friends who did this, opened the door onto a large meadow with a sunny, cloudless sky. There were a couple of trees dotting the plain with doors growing from them. 

In general, the game is an interesting one. Not too dangerous but there are some doors that need to be avoided. White doors should never be entered under any circumstances. Despite our warnings, my friend once entered into one such door and there he found a spotless, shiny morgue, filled with the dead. As my friend looked around the dead stood up from where they had been lying, lively as a sleeping man startled into action. Then they just stared at him. With their now open eye sockets showing black emptiness. My friend began to scream after telling us this and we had to shake him to get him out of the trance. When asked about it, he claimed not to remember the room or the screaming at all.

The only other doors that should be avoided are any doors with chipped paint, broken glass, or rusty metal. These doors are said to be decay, and give off a feeling of dread. I've never played with anyone dumb enough to go through them and I certainly wouldn't do it myself.

Besides the doors, there is one other major thing to watch out for. The Man.

There are other people who you will see as you traverse the different world. But The Man is separate from them. Despite what online guides I see about the game say, these other people are not evil and do not try to trick you. I find they are either passive towards you, or benevolent. The Man is separate from them. You will never see The Man in a room with others, for all inhabitants of this world flee from his presence. He is only ever seen alone.

The Man, whenever me and my friends have seen him, wears a dress suit. Although the colors and style will vary from encounter to encounter. The Man is also always tall, although his build will vary. The other thing that stays the same about him, is his expression. It will always be blank, unless he looks you in the eye. Then he will smile to display stark white teeth. When you see him, you will feel uneasy. Uneasy for no apparent reason. And that feeling is the best way for a traveller to identify The Man. 

 The whole domain is the Man's. When someone intrudes, he will begin to search for them. He does not like interlopers.

No one can stay in his domain forever, as he will find you. Sometimes, he will simply force you back to your world with his power. Other times if The Man is less charitable...

You never know what will happen in encounters with the man, that is why when you see him you must leave that plain immediately. Sometimes you can leave with your own power, if The Man allows it. Like pushing through your unconsciousness to force yourself awake from a nightmare. Other times your friends will have to shake you to get you back into your reality. Before it is too late.

Besides these dangers, the game is a lot of fun. It is said that some of the things you see in this world are reflections of your own reality, and there are secrets to be found and truths to be revealed. By playing the game, depending on what you see, you can get a much better understanding of what your world is and who you are.(So I wanted to first say that this was technically not my first because I did have an accidental one when I was a little kid, probably around 10 years ago that lasted for about 3 seconds. Also I typed this out on mobile, so I apologize for formatting.)

Last night I finally had a successful AP! I’d guess that it probably lasted around 7-10 minutes. Usually when I’d attempt, I’d just barely get to the vibrational stage in sleep paralysis and then get too scared and it’d end. What I did differently this time is that I stayed up really late at night after a hard day of work. (I did take a small nap immediately after work, though). Normally, I’d do it early at night, but I read something on here about trying it when you’re staying up late after a busy day. I achieved it while laying on my back. Once I got into bed, I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing while making sure to keep my mind awake. I quickly slipped into sleep paralysis and started to hear loud static and had some hallucinations which normally would’ve scared me into stopping, but this time I kept going. Once it got to a certain point with the vibrations, I for some reason just knew it was the right time to get up. I can’t explain it. I lifted my head and upper body up and saw my room and legs. I then got sucked back in and was back into heavy vibrations. My vision when my head was out was kind of dim, but I could still see fairly well. I waited for a second of vibrations and tried to sit up when it felt right again and I sat right up. I climbed off of my bed and was about ready to pass through my window when I decided to turn around and look at my body. I saw myself laying in bed right next to my girlfriend. It was weird. My astral body felt lighter and I noticed I had no more back pain (which was great). I climbed out of my window and was in my back yard. I climbed my fence and ran to the road and had some thoughts like “What if I’ve just lost my mind and am actually running to the road looking like a lunatic?” So I started floating up (which was proof enough for me) and heading towards town, but it was slightly different and my vision also started to clear up. When I got there, I saw some people, but they looked a little off. Just a little different proportional-wise. When I got there, I talked to a few of them and they were pretty normal. I asked if they were astral projecting too and they said yes. One of them took me into his house and some of the people followed us in there. I started to get some slightly bad vibes from the guy, but ignored it and stayed anyway. The guy was introducing me to everyone and then took me to this one room to show me one more person. He went in and opened a closet door to a girl sitting in there smiling. I felt bad vibes from her, but it was sort of playfully bad vibes in a way. She stared for a second and I stared back, then she lunged at me and jabbed me in the leg with something. The jab felt weird, like it didn’t quite hurt but it definitely didn’t feel good. I asked her what the heck she was doing and she seemed sorry and didn’t expect me to be upset. I feel like it was supposed to just be a joke, but it was my first time really astral projecting, so little jokes like that can make me really uncomfortable. I then walked out of the house and got pulled back into my bodyTLDR; I set aside an entire day to mediate and AP in various states of sobriety and opened my third eye, now I can use it to induce a seizure

About 2 weeks ago I had an experience with AP before I knew it existed. I was in bed, going to sleep during an LSD afterglow when my whole body started to vibrate, my pineal gland was pulsating violently, my eyes were shaking, it felt as if my body was spinning horizontally at exceptional speed and I had closed eye visuals, similar to that of a psychedelic, when my head popped! It felt like a nerve had snapped! My head/visuals were filled with so much colour, I had never experienced anything like it and so naturally, was very confused and scared, what had just happened to me? I was unsure until I noticed that I wasn't in my body, I'm not too sure where I was as my vision wasn't great but I could see a figure stood in of me. Safe to say when I saw them, i shat myself and was immediately pulled back into my body and woke up...

I spent some time trying to figure out what had happened and to relax myself again ready for bed. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed that my forehead (just above the centre of my brow) was throbbing! I had a headache and constantly felt overwhelmed, as if all my senses were heightened. The lights were so bright, I was hearing instruments in songs that I hadn't ever noticed before, I could see all the individual leaves on trees from miles away! Everything felt so clear but also like I wasn't completely with it. I had a hard time believing that it wasn't just all in my head until I was at a pub quiz. My intuition was through the roof. If I knew an answer then I knew it immediately, if I didn't then i just had a feeling, it was safe to say that my team won with flying colours, but at the same time I was really spooked by this, as if my idea of reality had been turned upside down.

Being an analytical person I decided to set aside an entire day for "spirituality", something I haven't really ever dabbled in, I mean i had never even meditated before this. Heres what happened:

For the first couple hours I was completely sober, I meditated, learnt a few techniques from headspace and simply enjoyed my time. I felt clear, nothing too out of the ordinary apart from the fact I noticed I could tense my pineal gland, as if i was opening one of my eyes, strange but it has been throbbing since my first experience. 
I got no fully body vibrations and no out of body experiences.

After tackling this sober, I decided it was time to try it on again on LSD (acid), so I took 2 tabs at 10am and relaxed for the next hour and half until I was at the peak of my trip. I began to try meditate again with an astral projection guided meditation and had a really hard time with it due to the closed eye visuals. In fact I got myself caught in a loop for a good 30 minutes while inside my own head. So I stood up, tried breathing techniques to centre myself, had a tea and came back to it. This time, when I started meditating again, I felt "streamlined", the visuals and my imagination were so easy to observe without getting lost in it. I noticed "discs" throughout the centre of my body started to spin, the sound from the guide I was listening to started to form all around me, I could feel the voice vibrate through my pillow! My visuals were getting so much more intense and colourful, my pineal gland was again pulsating and vibrating until I lifted out of my body. Again I couldn't see all too well but the same person was sat in front of me, at the time it felt obvious - "he's waiting for me", I thought. I wasn't able to maintain this state for long and snapped back into my body.

After this experience I noticed that while walking or moving around, my "soul"/"presence" was warping in and out of body. It was as if I could move my hands without moving my physical hands. I felt as if I couldn't waste this and so kept going back into meditation where I essentially repeated the same experience over and over. My body vibrates, I can push my head outside of my physical skull and parts of my vision were black, whereas other parts were the room around me. Each time, I snapped back into my body and sat up. In between the meditation, while my eyes were open, I noticed half of my right eye could see my arm through the quilt and as I moved the arms of my "astral body" I was able to witness this.

As the acid wore off and my visuals lessened I decided test what would happen if weed were mixed into this experiment and so took a hit from a bong. As I peaked again and the acid visuals came back, I gained full control of my pineal gland. By this I mean that I could be stood/sat/lying down and able to simply open it, immediately putting my body into a state of vibration. So I went back to the guided meditation and started again. It was just easy, I could be lying down and go to my window and watch who was walking by. At one point, I could vividly see a middle aged woman walking passed on the street below and could hear her from my physical body behind me. The voice matched her perfectly as she moved her mouth. And I was convinced, astral projection, remote viewings, it's very much real... so what now?

I enjoyed the rest of my weed/acid trip and decided I'd try again sober tomorrow.

The next day came around and I tried again. I was only able to to get the vibrational stage but I had a new ability. I could tense my pineal gland and my eyes would immediately start shaking, almost as if I was having a seizure. I've been practising using the gland now for 5 days and it just keeps getting stronger, to the point where I feel as if I can use it to half leave my body regardless of the current activity or position I'm in.

Does anybody else have any experience with being able to use the Pineal Gland in such a way? Could you share any advice on how best to use it to help with projection?

The person waiting for me, who could that be? And why would they be waiting?

Im now aiming to explore OBEs and AP and have been reading countless experiences on this reddit. It only felt right to include my own as I'm eager to hear what others think about this, was it all just a drug fuelled trip? Or could it be very much real? Tonight lay in bed.. count your breaths like this.  
Inhale : Count 1  
Exhale   
Inhale : Count 2  
Exhale  
Repeat...  
Remember that with each exhale you relax more and more. You can start from your head to your toes or jus your whole body at once making it more and more like a limp noodle...  
When you lose count ... start over...  
When you are so bombarded with thoughts (hypnagogic imagery) that you can hardly keep count anymore.  Begin your chosen OBE technique for the night.  (Rope method , phase out , point shift , go find some and have a list of techniques ready to try) 

This breathing exercise helps you get close to the mind awake / body asleep state by the counting. When you can hardly keep count , your brain is most likely hitting you with sleep imagery and thus it's a good time to begin doing your technique.I have helped many people have their first successful astral projections with this method. And then continue to have successful astral projections on a fairly consistent basis long after. It is worth the read! It will help you. 

Don’t be overwhelmed by the info contained here. Take it slow, be patient. You must learn to walk before you can tackle running. It will help you all the more. 

So to start I advise you take up a few simple practices which I believe are very important if not essential for successfully projecting and as a bonus will help with your mental and or spiritual growth. I will begin by discussing and explaining them. 

First: 

— Keeping a dream journal or an audio recording discussing what dreams you had when you wake in the morning. 

I believe this is very helpful because it trains your mind to remember what happens in the night. It tells your subconscious “Hey! This stuff is important and I want to remember it!” 

**I believe this helps with remembering your projections once you begin to successfully project. (Especially longer projections where you tend to forget the majority of what you did). Thus it’s an important habit to get into even before you begin to project. And after you begin to have projections write those down in your dream journal too. Or a separate journal if you so choose. 

A dream journal will also help with your dream recall which is always fun and can lead to lucid dreams. If your in a lucid dream you can transition it to an astral projection very easily. (There are various videos on YouTube which explain how to do this) 

Second: 

— Take up a constant sleep schedule. 

This will get your body and mind into a routine. I believe this is important to achieving successful projections on a CONSISTENT basis. After you actually project for the first time I’m sure you will want to continue projecting on a consistent basis. A consistent sleep schedule allows for better quality sleep and is great for your health! 

Third: 

— Pay attention to the phases of the moon. 

I have noticed that I have more frequent astral projections and lucid dreams when the moon is full or close to full. 

Fourth:

— Meditation 

I am sure this is something some of you don’t care to hear, but it will help sharpen your focus and help you gain more control over your mind as to not allow it to drift to other places when your trying to focus on a specific task. This helps tremendously when attempting to exit the body as well as once you are in the astral and navigating it. Please trust me on this. 

I try to meditate at least twice a day. Once in the morning about an hour after waking up and once in the evening right before bed. 

— Meditation should be fun! It’s not a activity that you should dread doing. Though I must admit I find myself dreading it occasionally for various reasons. In those cases I simply skip it for that day. Give myself a break. Remember, there is no rush! You got plenty of time. 

When I meditate, I focus on two different things all depending on what I feel like focusing on during that session. 

First meditation method: 

— (Closed eyes) I will focus on the blackness I see and in a sense allow it to consume my awareness

This requires a lot of energy cause your staying present in the moment and you will find that it’s difficult and tiring, I look at the blackness and I try to keep that as all I am aware of. My thoughts will drift and I will begin to daydream... I am no longer aware of the blackness. 
I catch myself and I don’t get upset cause that is a success when you catch yourself, not a failure that you drifted off. I return my gaze and my awareness to the blackness. 

— This helps you to exercise your ability to stay focused on a single task without allowing your mind to drift elsewhere which will benefit you tremendously in attempting to exit the body and once your in the astral. Keeping yourself focused on what your doing. 

** Remember this is the same as exercising your body in a gym. But it’s exercising your mind. Don’t in a sense try to do too much weight in the beginning. That will come later. Don’t do it too often because you will become exhausted and over worked. Take it nice and easy, 5 minutes of meditation every Saturday and Sunday. Remember! You have plenty of time! You don’t have to do a bunch of meditating right away, you may develop a disliking towards it if you overdo it. Just take it nice and easy, there is no rush whatsoever. 

— A helpful way to think about it is 5 minutes of relaxed meditation once every two days is:

1). Easier to dedicate to and keep up with 

2). Is actually MORE beneficial in the long run then 30 min of forced meditation every day that you will give up on in a week cause it’s too much stress and change all at once. 

Take it nice and easy, baby steps. Once again you have plenty of time. 

Second meditation method: 

— (Closed eyes) I simply listen/watch. Connect with the present moment you are living in

Listen to everything you hear outside as well as inside. Be aware of everything you hear. Exist in the moment you are living in. Listen to your thoughts, hear your breath. What does it feel like? Listen to anything and everything. Try your best not to think about it or comment to yourself on it. Just simply experience it. 

*** A hold up you may encounter is you will think “This is boring! I am bored by listening to everything around and outside me and the thoughts inside” 

Now wait a minute, watch that too! What does it feel like this feeling of boredom? Where do you feel it? Is it in your chest? In your hands? The tips of your toes? Where is it? What does it feel like? 

This method is best explained by Alan Watts. Though the video has been deleted off YouTube and I have been unsuccessful in finding another where he explains it. So my explanation should be sufficient. 

———————————————————————

Now onto the astral projection method! 

I must first explain a few things that I believe are essential to a successful projection. 

Something I have noticed on this sub is that it isn’t made totally clear that you have to be somewhat drowsy or sleepy if your gonna have any sort of success in projecting. 

** I believe that it is very necessary to be at least a little bit sleepy and if your pretty much wide awake and your laying there on your bed and trying not to move and hoping for something to happen you are 100% wasting your time. 
Your body must be very relaxed. Your body must be comfortable. You must be able to easily fall asleep if you allow yourself to do so. 

So my method: 

I wake up naturally at least once every night to use the restroom. If you do too, take advantage of that in this method. 

If you dont wake up naturally and tend to sleep all night then:

~ Set an alarm for at least 4 hours after you fall asleep 

-or-

~ Drink a few gulps of water before bed so you wake up naturally without an alarm. (I suggest this method) 

— The importance of using the restroom! 

There are two reasons that this is vital to a successful projection. 

First reason why this is vital: 

— Your body and subconscious mind are used to waking up, using the restroom real quick, then back to sleep. It knows that we are just up for a few min to relieve a bodily function then we are gonna go back to sleep, its not actually time to start the day. You can use this to your advantage because your body is ready to fall back asleep once you use the bathroom and you don’t have to force it. 

I don’t like an alarm because you use an alarm to wake you in in the morning to let you know it’s time to start the day. School or work or something. Thus your body and subconscious mind are already programmed to when you hear that alarm on your phone, more then likely it’s time to get up and start the day so your subconscious starts flipping switches and waking you and your body up. Your subconscious mind don’t know this is an alarm just to wake you up real quick and that it’s not actually time to start the day. 

Thus why I believe it’s better to drink water before bed so your body will wake up naturally. 

Second reason why this is vital: 

— Getting up, using the restroom and then going back to bed wakes your mind up just enough to put you in a perfect state to project. The goal is to get into that awake but sleepy state which is absolutely vital. But you don’t want to be too awake. 

— Once back in bed

So after you have used the restroom and gone back to bed, lay on your back and begin to seriously meditate. By seriously I mean set your intention on meditating (very important that you set your intention to meditate otherwise your subconscious won’t actively snap you back after drifting off). Your not focused on anything else with any other goal in mind but to lay there and meditate. 

Since you are sleepy and because your meditating you will naturally begin to drift off as usual. But since you have been practicing meditation during the day for some time now you have programmed your subconscious to understand what your doing and to bring you back to the present moment after you have drifted off. 

— Drifting off is very good! But don’t make it a goal. 

View drifting off as a shortcut to projecting. Every time I drift off (because I have been practicing meditation for a while) my subconscious brings me back. So every time I am brought back I am closer and closer to separation. 

— The amount of time you stay up is important 

** Let’s say that it’s a three minute process to get up, use the restroom, and then be back in bed. So after a few days of doing this, you notice that your too sleepy once your back in bed and you just fall asleep almost instantly instead of being able to meditate. Ok, add 3 minutes to this process. Make it 6 minutes your up until your back in bed. Thus to let your mind wake up just a little bit more before you lay back down in bed and begin to meditate. 

Remember you want to stimulate your body as little as possible in the time your up before going back to bed. Don’t do push-ups or some body exercise to wake yourself up. 

I suggest if you need to stay up longer, sit in an upright comfortable position and write in your dream journal. Or write down what you plan to do during your projection. This will stimulate your mind and not your body which is what you want. 

— Find the amount of time that works best for you to be up before you go back to bed and begin to meditate. Everyone is different. For me getting up, using the restroom and back to bed is the perfect amount of time. Sometimes I have to add a few minutes here and there usually depending on how active I was the day before. 

I work a physically and mentally demanding job so my body and mind are very tired at the end of the day. This would mean I would have to stay up a few minutes after using the bathroom to compensate. 

But if it’s the weekend I can just go right back to bed after using the bathroom cause I’m not so exhausted. 

Try to stay away from your phone as much as possible during this time between getting up and back to bed. 

My example: 

I return to bed after using the bathroom. I lay down and begin to meditate, after a few minutes I drift off not asleep but in a sort of daydream, but at night lol. I don’t know how long it’s been after I drifted off but I snap back and suddenly, my body is vibrating or I feel some sort of silly feeling. Remember! I’m meditating and I’m not focused on all that silly tingling or vibrating or whatever I may be feeling. I continue to meditate and I drift off again. After some time I snap back and new sensations are here. Remember! I’m not focused on any of that. I’m meditating. 

So this happens maybe three or four times for me then suddenly I snap back and what’s this? I’m in sleep paralysis and I simply think about rolling out of my body and without me doing anything more I feel myself rolling and then I land on the floor. I’m astral projecting! 

If you are scared of sleep paralysis, learn about it and understand it. Watch non fear based videos about it. You will realize your experience of sleep paralysis is entirely what you make it. And it’s as simple as that. 

I have also noticed that shungite is helpful for having vivid dreams and has improved the quality of my astral projections tremendously. I am also going to be purchasing orgone in the future which I suspect will help as well. 

I really hope this method helps you to achieve your goal of projecting! Remember to be patient, don’t rush or force anything. You have plenty of time! Not all of this needs to be applied all at once. Don’t be overwhelmed. Take it nice and slow and you will get it! I believe in you. 

Safe travels everyone 🤗😊For those of you who arent familiar with the term "melding", it's basically sex with another spirit on the astral plane.  Now the sex that im referring to isnt at all the same as what you experience here on the physical plane.There is no sexual penetration of body parts, however it is when two souls join together and become one.  
         
The first time i heard of this was in a book i was reading about astral traveling.  However, it wasnt until last week that i actually experienced such a thing.  I remember trying to meld with someone a few times prior and  I found myself unsuccessful  due to the fact that their are so many energy vampires that actually wanted to drain my energy.  It's easy to be fooled.  so the orgasmic look on her face was actually her draining  my energy.  I found myself back in my physical body fast, drained like a victim of a vampire bite. The intent on both sides has to be mutual.

 However, last week it finally happened!  I found this beautiful girl in a random community on the astral plane.  I was at her house, and it was weird, It was like I already and known this girl for a long time. Immediately after i seperated from my body and found myself in this realm, i was in her house talking to her.  She showed me around her house and in her back yard. Her backyard was beautiful. We were at the top of this cliff, no fences looking down on a huge city, of weirdly structured high rises, and other beautifully decorated houses.  She kept turning herself into different girls to mess with me as a joke, and kept saying that she went somewhere else, and told me that i could do the same. i remember looking down at myself and found myself to be naked so i put on some clothes just by thinking of it. 

 I then tried to show off by manifesting a car.   we both jumped in the car together, only it was weird, beat down, futuristic car with no wheels like a mini jet that hovered.  to accelerate there wasnt a pedal, it was a throttle to the right of me, and to my left  was the steering wheel.  As we were driving together down the streets we kept crashing into things so i got out of the car and tried to manifest my own car, something I could drive properly. Then it was better.       
           
After we were done cruising up and down the roads of this astral city,  we ended up back at her house again.  I remembered what I read before about melding previously in that book, and figured this was my time. I talked to her about it, and she explained to me what its like and her experiences.   We went back to her house and she went straight to her room. I went in the bathroom located right beside her to look in the mirror and gather myself lol  I remember everything so vividly.  The feeling of water hitting my face, looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, and going into her room. If I had randomly found myself in that same moment in the bathroom I wouldn't of guessed I was actually in an astral realm, that's how similar everything was to the physical. as I entered the room She was laying on the bed.  She got up and walked right up close to me. 
            We both were so attracted to each other.  I started to kiss her, but i couldnt feel the sensation of our lips touching like i could on the physical.  But then, as i got even closer, there was a huge yellow flash that caught me off guard and swarmed over my whole body.  The feeling was so overwhelming that even if you thought you were prepared for it because you read about it in a book, it would catch you off guard.  Everything in my vision became flashes of golden yellow, the image of her and her entire being joined with mine. Imagine an orgasm bigger than a mans and a womens combined. The intimacy was unreal and really hard to describe. Our souls became one. It would of lasted longer if I didn't have a physical body.   But it was so shocking that i ended up back in my physical body.  I must of laid there on my bed for 20 minutes in awe and shock, swarmed with a feeling I hadn't felt before. I kept thinking over what had happened As i layed there in my bed.  
        I felt as if I had just felt a new kind of feeling nobody else had before.  I felt special, not many people on this earth can say that they have had such an experience.  Afterwards, you would think that after having had experienced something like that with someone, that i would be hung up on this girl.  But not at all.  We had an experience, and that was it.  Its really hard to describe such a feeling, but i felt like i had to share, thanks for readingEX: the women in my mom’s family all have “gifts”, but we keep it hidden. I remember going into the basement to “play cards” when I was 2… but really we were reading tea leaves, and tarot cards, and discussing astral projection. While the men watched football upstairs. (This is my earliest memory with spiritual significance) It was “normal” to me. But I don’t open up to people about it. My mom and I can AP, but my dad believes that we just have premonitions. (How he believes in premonitions and not AP I don’t know?) I remember the first time I was exposed to AP I was about 4 or 5 and my mom was talking to my great aunt about it. My brother is disabled and when my mom would sleep if she sensed something was wrong she would AP to check on him because then it wouldn’t wake him (potentially). That’s when I realized I wasn’t crazy. I would wake up so confused because I felt like “wait I was just at my grandmas house how am I not there now?” I spoke up and told them immediately and that’s when I started being “taught” how to channel certain things. I don’t know why I’m rambling right now, but as I’m 27 now it’s hard to find people that believe me or understand. How do others deal with this? I never deny who I am, but it’s frustrating when people think you’re crazy.I was watching a show last night where a medium explained to a woman why she was being haunted by ghosts that have followed her all her life. She explained that since the woman was somewhat psychic and perceptive that the ghosts were attracted to her because she could sense them enough to potentially help them cross over. I have experienced spirits following me all my life as well, getting my attention in weird ways. Last night I told the spirits in my mind that if they are well intentioned, I give them permission to pull me into the astral plane so I can see and speak to them easier, and see if I can help them. While I was falling asleep I slipped into the ear ringing, body tingling vibrational state. I felt someone, or something, grab my hands and pull me out of my body as if someone were helping me get up off the floor. I was completely out of my body for maybe the third time in my entire life. I stepped about 4 feet away from my body and looked around. However it was pretty dark, and I didn’t see anyone else in the room. I snapped back shortly after that. I’m going to keep trying this as I have never been able to get this far before. If anyone has any friendly spirits hanging around I highly recommend this! Maybe even loved ones on the other side. But make sure you know who you’re asking for help from and be very clear with your intentions.I regularly will lay on my back and try to meditate myself out of my body until I notice "Oh crap I haven't breathed in a while" and that thought and sudden intake of air (necessary though it may be) kind of jolts me back to reality and out of my meditative mindset.I started meditating and dipped my toe into the gateway process but don't use the tapes now.  week into using them and I was woken up in the middle of the night (3 months ago) to pounding on my forehead. I felt energy and saw lights so bright my eyes watered. I started seeing things little movie like scenes in random places in my room + floating people and objects coming at me. 

before this I hadn't seen images really in my head, but now they are nonstop. every time I shut my eyes I see black then white particles floating then a tunnel forms from top of my head and is pulling me in. When I go through the tunnel I am in the school/church I grew up going to. I basically spin and fly around this church/school I see figures but everything is moving so much so fast I cant really focus on anything.

I feel a little psychic and was able to pass a math quiz 9/13 right without reading the questions. 

I can see with my eyes closed. basically I close my physical eyes and another set outside my body almost open and I can view things around me while eyes shut. 

If I open my physical eyes the hallucinations continue even with eyes open. I'll see things coming out of the walls and random "stones" in the air float and crash into me.

About me: raised extreme religious (got Holy Ghost at 9 years old) now I am atheist. I am legally blind and have had 3 near death experiences (drowned, suffocated in trunk, cracked head open all before age 12). I only include this because the tunnel experience is commonly linked to NDE. 

AM I GOING CRAZY OR IS THIS A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING???? please help!!!! I can give more info if needed don't want to make this too long :)Ok.....lucid dreaming is NOT the same as astral projection!

I had my doubts, considering most of the descriptions here, but last night I got it working kind of by accident and the difference is very noticeable.

For those asking "something happened but I'm not sure", when it happens you will be sure. But if you are still unsure, it's easy! While projecting you are perfectly conscious  when it starts and how it starts, instead on lucid dreaming you are just there, you just notice you are dreaming but no clear idea of how you got there.

When projecting things have "substance", I didn't expect that!

Well, I hope it happens again, it was very interesting.

For those interested on how it went, I was half awake and the ceiling become transparent, I could see the stars like bright white dots over a dark canvas.

Things generally go to shit really fast when I'm dreaming and this happens, if I focus too much on the sky, "they" notice that I'm there, crescent moon ships made of golden light start searching for me and it is very much like when Frodo wheres the one ring.....it sucks!

But this time was different, I could feel it, so I fought the need to hide and focused my mind! A little push from the bed and there I was out of my body next to the bed.

And that was cool and all but when I tried to start exploring, something pulled me back, my waist was hooked by a leash and on the other side there was an old man poppet, like the old guys on the Muppet show, very kind and not threatening at all.

I approached him and he become a real person, tall skinny old man, he dressed in white shirt and black social pants, like italians in old movies. I asked who he was, he made sounds I could not understand, my brain registered it as "Nonno" (grandpa in italian) and that he was waiting for me, he had a message!

After he gave me the message, by whispering in my ear, I could not keep my focus anymore and my body pulled me back.

I don't think it is my place to spread the message, but I have the feeling I'm not the only one. If you know what the message is, just PM me and we can chat about it.

Edit: wow the down voters are raging! Would someone care to explain why I caused so much consternation?When I say pretty sure I'm at almost a 98 % chance it was an Astral projection, I'm a lucid dreamer so I can take control over  my dreams as I please, been doing it since I was a child since it was my escape from a brutal childhood, but as soon as this woman came in, I couldn't control the dream, I could still control myself, but no longer was able to change anything, I could sense this person had feelings for me and wanted to have some type of close relationship, but as I said, I control myself, so I kept close to her but I never initiated anything, then I woke up, don't know why, probably a noise from the dogs I have, but I nearly immediately fell back asleep and she was still there, then she just ran away, and now I'm awake, typing all this out thinking I'm going a little crazy.I have been trying for years, but was always held back by fear. This time it was different though. I often wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep, so instead of staring at my phone for a few hours, I decided it was the perfect time to try to AP. I got to the point I usually do where I’m almost there, but still in my body. But instead of trying to exit into the room and get pulled back by that “falling” feeling, I remembered a thread I read on here recently about how a lot of you blast off into space and go from there. I saw a red portal? Line? Idk exactly what to call it, but there was a red, gaseous, irregular blob-shaped thing near my ceiling. At that moment, I knew it was my exit, but was scared that I would be pulled back like before. The other key component to this was the fact that I was able to reconnect a bit with my spiritual side the other day, and was confident that no matter what happened, I wasn’t in any danger. So I looked at the blob and mentally said “yes.” The instant I said it, I found myself catapulting out into space. At first it just looked black, then I could see stars forming. The moon went by so fast I barely knew what it was until it was gone. I was a little scared to be so far from home, but excited because I knew I’d finally done it. Right before I was pulled back, I saw the image of a man sleeping. I didn’t recognize him at the time, but I’m guessing it was probably my boyfriend. This is definitely going to be my go-to activity when I wake up in the night from now on!This short post pretends to clarify all the misconceptions about the vibrational stage (which seems to be a big troublemaker), and how to proceed when it shows up. If you find yourself getting stuck because of this, please read the following instructions:

First off, the vibrational state is just ONE astral projection signal. There is no such thing as “the signal”, and so you might experience vibrations or not. It depends on the individual, but if you don’t experience it, then it’s fine. The vibrational state is not what triggers OBEs, it just reveals that you might be approaching one. So please, stop worrying about not feeling the vibrations: try instead to pay attention to those signals you DO experience (e.g., a ringing noise in your ears, the ears plugging all of a sudden, an intense heat in your muscles before you lose awareness of them, or even slight trance-like states).

On the second place, if you DO experience vibrations, stop trying to control them. Don’t try to intensify them or similar stuff. This will only banish them! The idea that you have to control the vibrations is just a counter-productive advice in most cases. Since they show up off their own accord, allow them to keep moving on their own. Rather than trying to control the vibrations, allow them to do whatever they want: you will find that the less you act, the more intense they will become by its own mean. Conscious efforts to control or intensify the vibrations will only make them dissipate. And this applies to any other AP signal: if it pops up, just be aware of it, effortlessly.

In addition, vibrations (or any other signal) may just lead to a false projection. Which means that they show up, but then eventually leave without leading you to an Out of Body Experience. That’s okay, it sometimes happens. It just reveals that the astral body is ready to go, but your physical body isn’t still fully asleep to release its subtle counterpart. Not always the AP signals go hand in hand with the optimal physical conditions. For instance, don’t rush nor become too excited when the AP signals manifest, as they might not lead you to an OBE yet. Be patient, and develop the flexibility to keep practicing even if the signals go away. They will eventually return, and they will indicate that a genuine OBE is about to come, so yeah, be patient.

Last but not least, please don’t try to move or force your way out of body when the vibrations, the buzzing or whatever signal becomes intense and expands. You never know the exact moment when separation takes place, and when you arrive at that point, chances are you don’t need to “get out”, as you will find yourself leaving your body naturally. The astral body moves away from the physical when the latter falls asleep, so don’t worry about that. Trying to get out will only lead to a strong resistance, keeping you caged in your physical vessel.

To sum up, the vibrational state is not necessary for an OBE to occur. It just indicates, along with other signals, that an AP might be nearby, and if you allow it to expand/intensify off its own accord, it can get you out of body. But if it doesn’t, it probably means you experienced a fake projection, and so you simply have to wait for the genuine OBE to show up.In my experience, the out of body experience is an absolutely unmistakable other state, accessed through steps that involve literally climbing/floating out of your sleeping body in a new non-physical body--you are left in no doubt about what happened.

There seems to be information out there that suggests that the out of body experience is actually a sort of woolly imagination quest or a weird type of dream. It isn't! (I'll die on that particular hill.)

Now maybe I've just been lucky with how I came to this practice and my experiences. But I think it would be worth coming up with a little checklist of signposts along the way that you will run into if you are having an OoBE.

I'm happy to start!

- Did you intend to have an OoBE? Did you set time aside and lay down with that intent, or was it a spontaneous thing? Both are valid.
- Did you experience sleep paralysis, before and/or after?
- Did you experience the vibrations? There's no mistaking them, they don't feel like anything else in human experience. They can vary from a low bodily thrumming like a well-tuned engine to a whole ocean of static electricity crashing over your body and head. They do not require imagination but they *do* respond to focused intent (getting louder, or higher in pitch). They are not merely pins and needles, or mild numbness/tingling in the extremities--you'll know the difference.
- Did you experience sudden weightlessness and a floating sensation?
- Did you have to pull yourself out with a struggle? Did you experience the apparently strong magnetic pull of your physical body pulling you back?
- Did your whole body separate, or just part? If your head/upper body separate and swing into a new orientation, there's no mistaking it. If just an arm or leg seems to float upwards, it might just be one of the early numbness/weightlessness sensations that comes from relaxation.
- If your experience began with a dream, did you experience the dream environment seeming to 'melt away' or otherwise be replaced with a new environment? Did the sensations of dreaming change *significantly*? (It's possible to simply dream of having an OoBE if you are immersed in the subject, just like you might dream of driving a car when you are learning to drive.)
- Were you apparently pulled out of your body by another being?
- Your environment: what did your surroundings look like? It could be anything from a well-lit day to a sort of moonlit darkness with forms outlined in faint, electric blue (might not actually be blue). It might also be a sluggish, dark environment that is hard to move around in, where you might notice the very faint glow of electric devices and lightbulbs just barely penetrating the dark if you look closely enough.
- You may have been blind during your OoBE. This is common. Did you try to force your physical eyes open in response? This is possible and disorienting.
- Did you float around seemingly out of control? Did you find yourself on the ceiling?
- Did you try pushing your hand though something solid, or passing through something solid like a wall or window entirely?
- Were your immediate surroundings like your bedroom/place you are laying down, or was it somewhere different? (Both may be valid--immediate surroundings more common)
- Did you happen to check your (non-physical) body? What did your hands or feet look like? Could be anything from solid forms to an outline in that same electric blue that only manifests when you concentrate.
- Did you feel a pull from your physical body, which becomes less powerful with distance?
- Did you experience a strong wind that seemed to pick you up and blow you somewhere, out of control?
- Beings: did you encounter any seemingly intelligent beings? What was the nature of the interaction? (Encountering no beings at all is entirely common.)
- Did you encounter any beings that seemed like hollow/non sentient thought forms?
- Did you encounter any beings that seemed like nasty little buggers apparently out to scare you?
- What forms of communication, if any, did you try?
- Returning to your body: did you experience returning to your body, or did you just wake up mid-experience as you would from a dream?
- Did you feel like you were pulled back in from afar?
- Did you wake instantly upon returning to your body, or did you find yourself still in an altered state in bed/wherever you are?
- Were you able to have more than one OoBE?
- Waking: how did you feel when you woke? What bodily sensations do you notice?
- Do you have a fast heartbeat?
- Do you have a light head and body? Does it feel unpleasant or good?
- Are you left with a feeling of 'dread', perhaps in your belly or lower back? Was this after an encounter with something unpleasant?
- How long did these sensations last?

If you did have an OoBE/AP experience where you were at least somewhat aware, or you had continuous awareness from start to finish, you should be able to answer most of those questions. (In fact you probably don't need these questions to tell you what happened.) Otherwise you might well have had an OoBE, or it might have simply been a dream, or a low-awareness flash that is so poorly remembered to be indistinguishable from a dream (and thus maybe just a sign that you are on your way, but not there yet). **An active will and clear, keen awareness are part of the experience.** If it was all just a sequence of hard-to-interpret feelings and images...it might well be of interest to your spiritual development, you might have reached a milestone along the way that should be carefully studied and considered, but it probably can't be classed as an OoBE in the traditional sense.

Please add any questions you can think of. And happy travels.There was a honey comb like security grid that you have to get through to get in

I ended up getting interrogated by security forces and they grilled me pretty hard With physical torture devices and I lost connection and woke up back in my body

I still have no idea what’s going on there lolBasically, I had a set of cards and after thoroughly shuffling them, I picked 6 random cards and placed them face out on a window. When I aped, I immediately proceeded to check the cards and when I did, I cleared my mind to prevent any thoughts from altering the cards. I also made the command that I demand to see the cards exactly how they are like in the physical plane and all of a sudden, the cards began to change. After memorizing the sequence and waking up, to my shock, I managed to get each of the 6 cards right and in the exact order to. I did wake up with a mild headache and a bit of drowsiness so I think I was drained from the intense ap. Let me know what you think cause I now believe ap is something more than just your mind.I’m going through so much. I can easily go into your dream/ get you to the astral plane. I just need a friend right now. Please only nice people with good intentions.I am not new to the concept of Astral Projection - I have been doing research on it for a long couple of years now and I have not tried to Astral Project at all since 2018 or 2019 because my personal life is going straight to hell but more on that later.

I was wonder if there was more to this life than just - this - getting jobs, getting relationships that most of the time never work out, being stressed out - just about doing anything NOT - fun, exciting, or in the very least interesting... and of course awaiting sweet - death - not of the mind but of the body and the physical consciousness we have.

I feel so empty right now and even though people have told me to be grateful due to all the bad things in my life it is hard to do that - when I know every single day I wake up to the same job increasingly making me dislike it the more off-time is not being put directly onto my shitty and borderline unethical no-break days - and the worse part is my older, egotistical and judgmental - older - ( by age, maybe but mentally not so much ) brother and his girlfriend ( she is alright, some things she does pisses me off though but both of them seem ignorant when they do things that piss other people off or just generally do not care at all - and even blame other people for what happened which is it what is - their life choices, not mines - but anyways... ) I am living with want me to get my own apartment by the third week and I have to work 10-12 hour shifts - and I have no internet besides the hotspot I use on my phone to play the internet on all my devices ( which is just a shitty Chromebook and a really outdated PS4 ) to chill out for the night - and this all started over me wanting to get the internet back on because my Tourettes were acting up and making night-time a living hell for me because I had nothing to do - but they and other people - seem not to understand that so their solution is to subtly kick me out of their house and get my own place.

Cool, cool. 

But that is not the problem - I have seen other realms before in my dreams, beautiful and ethereal realms of shimmering colors of blues and other colors within the same world we live in but in the astral planes - different beings and life-forms living different lives and ways of living off and on other planets, other nightmarish planets and realities that give me anxiety. 

I have even seen other theoretical and maybe even past lives of me living on other planets off Earth and sometimes even being a person living on a planet not of Earth doing some sometimes very questionable, very safe and legal, or other grey area things on those other planets - or even in a different reality on this planet were everything feels the same like this reality but vastly different like a veil has been uncloaked and I can see "everything" behind the curtains to see if that makes sense - like lifting the curtains back and seeing all the other realities that were hidden and have now come into the light. 

Some days I have found myself sad and depressed for no reason and have found myself contemplating what my life has become and why everything is the way it is now - and I think I should get back into Astral Projection even if my heart is telling me that is not a good idea, because if I spend the rest of my life in a unaware, fast asleep, and slowly dying society that is scared of anything not related to God - then I do not want to be a part of that at all - I would rather be extremely unhappy but continue working on myself in the Astral Planes and just hope and know all my angels, beings, and other non-hostile and protective beings are helping me.

Did anybody else experience this before their Astral Body activation? I understand there will be many who say things like "but you should be grateful because not everybody has these things like you do." and as true as that may always be - that does not mean that all of this will be taken away from me either at any given time unexpectedly so I do not want to hear that either. 

In fact I HAVE already lost many things both big and small in my life at the moment that has made feeling happy far harder than what it should be - and knowing I am stuck on this planet, in the middle of this prison of a cosmic wasteland with nothing but seemingly dead planets - and with nothing but toxic and vile human beings - not all are obviously, but the majority are do not see it - and I just cannot go back home because I strongly feel the Astral Plane is my actual and true home but I feel like I am just stuck down here while I look up at the skies and feel sadder and sadder knowing that I may not see my beautiful home ever again - to the point I have no idea what it looks like anymore - except in very rare and off-chance dreams but that is not enough. 

I am trying hard using subliminals for scripting right now in order to make some things happen in my life right now and I understand it may take time for that to happen ( if anybody has seen Solar Subs little, cute, perspective in the grand scheme of themes of reality shifting and she thinks she knows everything there is to know about reality shifting and desired realities, ironically all of that is her belief as well and even with so-called "scientific evidence" it is not actually documented proof, simply esoteric and quantum theories- so it is not universally agreed upon so anybody can easily disprove it if they are willing and dedicated enough, but whatever - the subliminal community is contaminated with nothing but edgy, teenage boys and girls at this point. Also another reason why I stopped going to places like Amino - too toxic. ) 

My question is simply this - is there more to life than simply - this - ? 

I am tired of living life a never-ending, boring and bullish loop with no rest respite and living on a planet with nothing but boring people, with boring and over-used concepts, and over-stereotyped mainstream media - and just in general this planet and that is also why I was going to go off the grid and just live by myself for a long while seeing how most people either disagree with my views which is fine. 

I know many people have traveled forwards and even to the theoretical future, have shifted to their desired realities or waiting rooms, and or sometimes do it at will just to have fun in the Astral Planes at will and though they will take a long period of practice - there IS so much more to do in the Astral Planes than here and seeing as how I am waiting for my scripts to manifest I may as well get back into Astral Projecting.

And yes, my personal life is still not doing well.

I barely have enough time to have time to myself let alone the job sucking out a large majority of my life now just to get a place that will costs seven something a month to live there and be stuck at another job that I KNOW I will not like - and being in the same situation all over again but completely by myself which would be MUCH better than this but not much better than that. 

I have problems with my mental and physical health due to certain conditions that I will not share here but it is very problematic and causes me additional mental and emotional anguish on top of not being able to Astral Project to new and exciting realms - and it REALLY brings down my life value at times.

I hope this made sense - I have to go to work soon in the next couple of hours ( 3 - 4 ) so hopefully somebody or EVERYBODY will see this and give some solid, sound and perspective advice and tips from their own experiences - because this is not about me - but I want to hear about the views of other people and see what works for me. 

I am going to go off this site now and hopefully everybody is safe and happy!

Have a good day!I feel absolutely nuts right now. First AP wit. lots of experiences in what seemed about 30 minutes. about 7am, after the last AP, I decided to snap out of it and start writing it down so I wouldn't forget. here is the scrambled stream of consciousness I just finished writing:

So much just happened. I tried to visit Echo Arena in the future. I saw different kinds of discs. the most popular was supposed to be more geometrically simple, grey. I was with these guys on a ship floating through space, and they saw this president dude and he came up and was like you boys staying outta trouble? and they had this whole way of going back and forth. all the places! all the beautiful creations. I saw earth. briefly. but I willed to see it, and it came into view. just the glowing edges at first. it truly caught my breath. my body felt. I could feel my body, but I couldn't touch it. that was absolutely profound. it kept going and going. and I kept coming back to my body, and leaving again. got arms out, then rope method. my physical body feels like junk compared to the astral, that feels so perfect and free. the feeling of floating is really nice. and spinning and doing tricks. that was freakin awesome. that was my first big boy AP. I kept going up and up after exiting, hoping to get some vision and pretty much it worked every time. I was confronted by some law enforcement one point, I was just denying all their questions and then took off. they said something like "did he have a creator device?" as I was flying away. the things in space, I told one thing to fuck off and it did. it was a geometric thing kinda like knack and it just went about its way. I used the "Clarity Now!" trick when my vision kept going out and the first time, things got so bright and vivid instantly. I was very clumsy. I was almost manic, trying to do all the things I've been wanting to do. I played video games twice. the fist one was a quick little arcade style game, and this other one was a cute zelda type game. I wish I could remember everything better. there was sooo much music. and I sang in this floating performance room in space that was made to look like a junked out punk rock lair. I'm a musician in real life, and I sing and jam all the time. I sang into the mic and I remember the PA sounded amazing but my voice was really croaky... don't know why. I sang "I wanna be your lonely dog. I wanna be your dog." the time travel thing was interesting. I'm not positive I actually time traveled but that was the idea. In real life I play a VR game called echo arena, an esport multiplayer online zero G ultimate frisbee kinda game based off Ender's Game. I wanted to see what that game would be like in the future... I had a specific amount of time into the future I wanted to go, forgot how long. also I wanted to extend the AP so that was an incentive too. I tried to "charge up" like Rick talks about, and blast off, which when I was charging it felt like the vibrations. then when I blast off everything went dead like I was seeing a blank computer screen. then when it came back I was in the game, and I saw my robot body, but instead of robot heads, our faces were dynamically superimposed on the head, like in the helmet, in real time. that was the only super interesting thing with that. the levels were different, the disc was different. smoother, simpler.

flying around is hard. I remember I was walking a lot. but I'd remember to float and fly. I probably APd at least 4 or 5 times and kept getting vibrations, get my arms out, which at several points could see my astral arms partially separated, a bluish milky hazy translucent arm that honestly looked like a ghost arm. then I started pulling on an imaginary rope hand over hand until I sorta pull-jump out. I did hear some whispering and static right after exit before I could see. Twice during this AP I was struck with profound happiness and astonishment. like, I'm just so awestruck. one of the times was when the earth came into view with a ring of gold because the sun was behind it. I was terrified by the beauty and immensity. I saw the sun too. but I was mostly trying to see the earth. I floated around it a little bit, I couldn't recognize the continents or anything going on on the surface. it seemed off somehow. did I mention my vision kept going out? the second awestruck moment was when I willed to have sex. a beautiful perfect androgynous human thing came to me and looked at me with this pure adoration, and I just kinda cuddled it, floating there grabbing its butt.

this shit is a trip, for real. I think I found a method that works for me. wake up at 4am. drink some chocolate milk, stay up for 30 minutes to an hour. back to sleep. well actually just lay there and try to will the vibrations. once the vibrations are nice and strong, start trying to move the arms out.

edit: I want to add that I was on the edge of this big urban city at night when the cops flew over to talk to me. I felt very small compared to that bustling busy, heavily populated place. lights, buildings, flying cars lined up going into and from town. This was an extremely weird and unsettling feeling fot my first time actually astral projecting. The vibrations were so powerful until they just stopped and I was starting to float up above my body in my room. I got too scared tho and woke up right away, but Ill work on cqlming my nerves.
 

If you havent had your first experience, keep trying. It'll eventually come with practice. Im going to try and get back to where and was and lose the fear. I just wanted to post this while it is still so vivid in my head.

I hope everybody has a positive day today and stays safe and healthy. Much love to everybody hear as this is such a great community!To start off, I do suspect that I have been visited by aliens that may indeed exist on the physical. I have some sort of instinct for these things in terms of distinguishing energies that lurk on the astral and physical plane, then again, maybe I'm wrong. But all I do know is that these alien beings were of a much higher more evolved conscious.

This whole experience just started out with me getting to the vibration stage and leaving my body as usual. Unlike my other experiences, as soon as I left my body, I froze, I felt like there was some sort of energy just restraining my astral body. I then remember seeing three aliens manifest themselves in front of me. I speculate that if they were physical beings, they may have somehow cloaked their presence and revealed themselves to me which meant they may have been there earlier. It was pretty dark in my room so I couldn't get any detailed facial features but the thing that struck me the most was how small they were. They had these round bodies and proportionately smaller faces with smaller eyes and no nose. At best, they had bodies that were small and shaped like a doll with alien features. I couldn't really tell whether their skin color was dark blue or a darker shade of grey due to it being so dark.

Rather than introducing myself, I jumped right to the point and asked why they had come here and what they wanted. The first being said that us humans were the most interesting species to observe. I then remember simply asking what was so interesting. The other being told me that the evolution of our conscious just interested him (something along those lines). At this point, I was very uncomfortable as all three of the beings just standing on my bed and I remember them making these gradual advances towards me. It then continued to tell me that they needed me and I would be perfect for examination (whatever that means). I had no ideas what their intentions were, and even now, I'm still trying to understand what I have to do with human consciousness or evolution. Why did they choose specifically me, what made me the perfect candidate for whatever they had planned?

I quickly told them to leave and I could immediately feel the energy shift from neutral towards anger and annoyance. I could tell they were running out of patience and getting more irritated. I think they may have tried to project their energy onto my astral body as a way to manipulate it which is incredible if they even were physical beings. I felt like my astral body was moving on its own towards them as if it had its own free will. At this point, I was instinctively scared and could tell that they realized this. I was blinded by this flash of light and lost awareness without actually waking up. I later woke up somewhere around 3 in the morning and like a crazy maniac, checked my bed for any imprints for those so called alien beings. Of course, their were none, but my gut was telling me that they were indeed physical, a 4th kind encounter. At this point, I just have so many questions, maybe they somehow wiped their every trace of existence from the physical since they were intelligent and highly advanced. Maybe I am wrong and they merely existed in another plane. I unfortunately couldn't figure out what their intentions were with using me and hope I never encounter them again in any of my future AP's.

I’ve astral projected my whole life since childhood. In that time I’ve had thousands of experiences including travels into the past, possible futures, and outer space. 

Note: Parts 1 and 2 have has earned over 1100 thumbs up with close to 2500 questions and comments from you Reddit maniacs! I have written a number of other articles detailing my Astral time/space travels as well as “how to” information here on Reddit as well that you can read https://www.reddit.com/u/Morgoth37/

If anyone has any further questions about Astral Projection or out-of-the-body travel, I’d be glad to do my best to answer them. My purpose in posting this information is to get more conscious AP’ers on the Astral Plane. I see this goal as my core life’s mission.

Check out my Astral Club YouTube Channel if interested! https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZEI put this together based on this pretty common question I'm asked, also revealing the technique I generally use. Astral projection has allowed me, among other things, to continue relationships with several deceased family members, pets, etc, and even visit realms that are totally outside this worldly experience. So I really decided to dedicate much of my life to this.

MAIN POINTS:

Step 1: Understand What You Are Trying To Do

Step 2: Disrupt Your Sleep Pattern

Step 3: Set an Intention

Step 4: Lie down like you are going to sleep, but keep the intention in your mind.

Step 5: Allow yourself to begin to fall asleep like this, and see what happens.

Step 6: Make your intention strong enough to override a dreaming state

Process explained at my video:  [https://youtu.be/ZYgKmIskXXM](https://youtu.be/ZYgKmIskXXM)TL/DR; time travel experience led by some kind of temporary guide, with a solid date provided, and a pretty solid event witnessed that then occurred when the time came.

Hey folks, I can't believe I've been on Reddit all these years and never thought to join /r/AstralProjection. I first got into AP in my late teens, managed to do it after about a year of trying, had many experiences over the years to follow, and now I'm in my late thirties. Oh the stories I have to share...!

I wonder if it's the case for other APers that despite many out of body experiences you eventually have *one* experience that brings home the reality of it all--which has the effect of completely derailing your progress, because it's suddenly not just some fascinating mental phenomenon you're tinkering with, it's some *real thing* that might have real consequences?

Well this was mine--my time travel experience. I will recount it as accurately as possible. See if you experienced some of the same things.

It begins on the evening of Friday the 19th of December, 2003. I laid down and left my body in the usual manner (sort of crawling out then standing up and having a look around my room). I left my room by pushing myself through the wall and window into the back yard, when I noticed I was being watched by a man who was perched on a nearby fence. He wore a neat suit, a dark red color. His limbs were thin but not unnaturally so. I recall a sort of bird's nest of black hair on his head. I don't recall any specifics of his face.

"Follow me," he said. "I have something to show you." 

This was very exciting for me as I could count on one hand the number of seemingly intelligent beings I'd ever actually met on my outings, despite having had maybe 30+ self-induced OBEs. So of course I followed.

Now the odd thing is, I didn't have amazing flight control at the time (or even now)--basically I would leap around and get blown around by winds. But when this person flew directly upwards into the air, I was able to follow just by willing myself to do so.

We ended up high above my city in the dark of night. I still remember the dark shape of the river below surrounded on both sides by streetlights.

Then he said again: "follow me." And I followed.

But this time he didn't go in a direction as such. Instead we were pushing through successive layers of something that felt like invisible mattresses full of jelly. Each one was harder to push through than the one before. Finally we stopped, and were in the same place above the city. Except this time, I had something new in my visual field: something I've never seen before or since.

It was 3D lettering. White letters projected on top of my visual field. A date. It said: Tuesday 23rd December 2003.

Now I know that's unusual. I've never heard anyone else report anything of the sort.

The man said again: "follow me." So I followed. This time he sort of blinked to a new location. I was far above a town that had experienced devastation. We swooped down to get a closer look. Based on the desert surroundings and the shape of the roadsigns it looked like a US town to me (I'm in the UK). I could see emergency vehicles parked across the road, a lot of rubble, and at least one building with a large rectangular flat roof that had collapsed and partially blocked the road.

I think I tried to ask "where is this? What are you showing me?" but at this point my temporary guide just left without another word, his job apparently done. I tried to take in as much as possible but soon felt my body tugging me back, and whoom--I was back in my room.

At this point I jumped up and wrote everything down. I described seeing the aftermath of a disaster on the 23rd of December. But I ended up discounting it--because I thought the 23rd was a Monday, and the Tuesday was a mistake, some sort of dreamy nonsense. Nope--the 23rd actually *was* a Tuesday, I'd miscalculated.

So I sent this log to my brother and a couple of friends who knew about my activities, and they probably all thought I was just little bit of a kook and finally going over the edge. I get it. But I wanted evidence. If something did happen in the US late on the Monday evening or Tuesday morning, I wanted somebody to have an email with my description of it ahead of time.

So when Tuesday morning came round, I was up at 7am and flicking through the news stations, when there it was--[an earthquake on the west coast of the US, with a couple of fatalities](http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/West/12/22/ca.earthquake/index.html). [A second article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3342185.stm). This wasn't just some little quake, this was big enough to make the news in the UK, and the location was right. At the time provided in the AP experience--assuming it was local time for me--rescuers would still have been sifting through rubble in the US.

As far as I can tell, I was taken to see this town, saw the damage, and came back to describe it three days ahead of time. I had no idea it was an earthquake that would do the damage, BTW--for some reason I hadn't put that together.

This sent my heart racing for the rest of that day--I was buzzing, despite the unfortunate fact that a couple of people were dead--and I was entirely unable to follow up with more OBEs for literal months. It felt like there was a sort of energetic blanket over me any time I tried, weighing me down. I interpret that as a kind of fear or resistance now that I had been handed proof (good enough for me, at least) that the places I was going and things I was doing were somehow actually real, and might have actual consequences.

Anyhow I'd love to hear from anyone who had similar experiences. For example:

- Encountering someone who seems to know you are interested in proof
- Guided flight where you were suddenly competent
- Guided time travel
- The sensation of time travel, like pushing through layers of something that gives way to pressure
- Actual visualization of text in your field of view, possibly created by guide
- Witnessing something verifiable

I still think about that 'guide' (no better word for it--he was literally a guide.) Who was he? Had he (or someone who sent him) somehow noticed my amateurish poking around the local astral plane in the couple of years beforehand? At some point a decision had been made to *show me something specific and verifiable*. Which implies a decision-maker beyond myself. Unless I conjured him up, and ultimately guided *myself* to that point in time and space...but that seems like even more of a stretch.

As I say, I had maybe four or five encounters with what seemed like independent, self-aware intelligences up to that point. There definitely seemed to be more than one being willing to give me advice and help me out, including a grinning Asian man who was there to greet me on my first proper OBE ("there's no need to rush!" he shouted, as I sprang down the driveway in great leaps). But this was a whole other level.Okay so I’m staying at my girlfriends house I take two melatonins and knock out. She has a service dog because my girlfriend has seizures once in a blue moon. 
     Okay y’all this is where it gets crazy!!!!
I’m having trouble trying to sleep so I take a melatonin and knock out. About 15 mins ago I wake up in sleep paralysis. Now I’m sure everyone on here is the same way. I’m a usual in astral projection. 
I tend to find a certain peaceful meditation zone while I’m in sleep paralysis so I usually just lay there and think about stuff. But THIS time was different. There was this super bright light that kept blinding me so I opened my eyes to find a door way. 
    Now I’m sure y’all know rules to astral projecting never go into doorways you don’t know. Well I decided you know what since I’m bored ima go check it out. So I get up and I start hearing slow calm string orchestra playing as I walk closer. I then feel her dog jump in our bed and start hitting me with his head
   Now I’m a regular in astral projecting so hitting me awake isn’t going to work until I want to wake up myself. Anyways so I’m walking in to the door and the music gets louder and louder. Beautiful beautiful soft string orchestra nun like you’ve ever heard.  He’s hitting me and hitting me so my girlfriend hits me and I think to myself yeah let’s not be stupid tonight and do something we would regret; so I slowly make my way back to the bed and hop in my body. 
Guys the dog knew I was astral projecting!!!! This just proves every single theory I have!!!. So then I thought about it for little bit………what if…….. what if I was walking into my own death.. what if that’s how people die in there sleep but the music is so beautiful they don’t turn back around because they don’t know the rules of astral projecting……………….. let me know your thoughts below…….This is my childhood method I used as a kid to get non-physical experiences on demand, it's for direct entry, with it I had an experience almost every day, It's very simple and straightforward, if you practice it daily, it can become your best tool for transitioning into non-physical. If done right it works really fast, sometimes it takes me under a minute to shift my focus into non-physical, which sometimes leaves me dumbfounded, how I was just laying on the bed and in the next moment I was somewhere else. It can be used anywhere anytime, it depends only on how fast you are relaxing your body and mind, it doesn't require sleep paralysis or vibrational state to work. I just recommend you not to use it unless you are sitting comfortably or laying down on a bed, because of risk of falling injury. This method depends greatly not on visualization but on memory recalling your best route from the location you are to your front/back door, you must choose it beforehand, you don't need to brink too much details from your memories.

Now the method itself:

1)Lay down or sit down and relax your mind and body as maximum as you can.

2)Now the more crucial part, imagine from first person view that you are standing up and start walking the route you have chosen, if there is a door or two, open them and keep moving(experiment on your speed) to your stairs(I live in apartment)/front yard/back yard until the imagination becomes reality while keeping your awareness of course, because it can turn into unconscious dream. The shift is very swift, usually when I reach one floor up or down I'm already into non-physical.

If it didn't work on the first try, you can try it several times, but don't force it too much, because if you are doing it before sleep it can lead to some sleeping problems.

Good Luck!What would happen to people who commit suicide. Would they be stuck in the astral? How does the death system work anyway, are there rules or is there karma or something?

Edit: dang I didn't expect so many people to respond, thankyou all for the insight.My partner is currently visiting family in another state. I got home from work and took a nap. While I was waking up I felt the vibrations start so I left my body. I flew into the living room, where my partner was sitting on the couch talking on the telephone. I flew all around him and tried to navigate my astral body a bit (I’m still not great at that). Then I ended up back in my body. When I finally got out of the bed (for real) I called my partner and told him I had just seen him on the phone while I was APing. He said “Really?? I was on the phone while you were napping.” I couldn’t remember what the conversation was about but I could tell it was serious. In real life he was having a very philosophical conversation with someone over the phone. So wild!!This was EXTRAORDINARY... At around 4:30am this morning, my consciousness traveled to a parallel universe where I saw something that simply defied the laws physics. For those of you who’ve read my previous posts, or visited my youtube channel, The Astral Plane and Beyond, you know that I’ve developed an ability in the last few years to travel to parallel universes. Many of the places I’ve visited are quite similar to this Universe. I’ve seen shopping centers, restaurants, and department stores in these Universes, and there wasn’t anything particularly exciting about them. But this morning, I visited what appeared to be a movie theater, and I saw a rectangular screen of water suspended in midair. For those who may have been to Disneyland and seen the water show Fantasmic, you’ll remember that water is sprayed into the air and images are projected on to it as if it were a screen. This was NOT what I saw. There was no machine or mechanism that I could see doing this. It was a screen of water that extended from one end of the theater to the other, and when I put my hand through it, it was warm. On the other side of this screen of water, which was clear, I could see people casually dining at tables. I wonder what they must of thought as I just continued to stare at this… marvel. I kept wondering, how was this possible… I’ve known since I began traveling to these universes that the laws of physics can differ, but seeing this… the water was so calm. It shimmered as I put my hand through it. I’ll leave a link to the full episode here, if you’d like to listen:

[https://youtu.be/bcJYTMK-Eg8](https://youtu.be/bcJYTMK-Eg8)

Normally, I would simply post this to my channel, but I needed to share this experience with you. I guess I just needed to let you know that there are no limits.Additionally, please share your journey so far, to provide context. Also, sharing resources would be greatly appreciated.Anyone interested in hearing about it?When I will myself to go to places I don't get there right away.
My vision blurs out and next thing I know I'm  floating in this objectless environment. 

Sometimes I see rows of diamonds spinning, sometimes its empty grey space. 

Then after awhile I appear to the place I willed to. 

It's like a loading screen for the conscious mind, which I think is pretty cool.This isn’t just about the astral world but what the spirit world really is as it talks about the different entities people encounter on psychedelic drugs. 

https://youtu.be/tETZpw7sX98There have been several articles written here by other people when they had an astral projection experience and they were seen by animals. It has been theorised that animals are able to see into the astral world, such as spirits, etc. It is well known that the ancient Egyptians considered cats a spiritual animal. Anyway this is my experience when I was seen by a real wolf during my astral projection experience.

As a background, several years ago I used to live in a rural area in the mountains. It was a foresty area, and the forest started in my backyard. I didn't keep the property clean at the time. My neighbor had a real wolf as a pet, whom he found as a puppy in the forest long time ago, and he brought him back to his house, and raised him like a dog. This wolf dog, although he was used to cars and people, was very different from other dogs. He never barked without reason, and he was always silent. His eyes had a very deep and thoughtful gaze, more than most dogs, and more than even some people. When I first met him it was clear to me that this was a sentient soul. My property had no fence around it at that time, so the wolf would run in my property during the night, and he would also run in the forest.

Anyway, back to my astral projection exerience. I couldn't sleep one night. I had been in bed for multiple hours, and then I decided to do astral projection. I lay flat on my back, completely relaxed. I imagine a warmth starting at the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. I imagine that I am warming my hands over a fire. After some amount of time this imagination becomes a real sensation that cannot be dismissed. I actually feel the heat being generated on my hands and feet. It feels like a pulsating or a vibration. Whenever I do this I ask my dad to feel my hand and he says that it is actually hot to the touch, so I'm not making this up. I just think about it, and I feel this heat or energy or vibration spreading throughout the body, first starting from the extremities, then going up and up until the entire limb feels pulsating with heat. It's more like a vibration at this point. So by now my legs are vibrating like a tuning fork. Then the vibration goes up and up until it reaches the back of my head. I try to cover the whole entire body with this heat vibration sensation. Eventualy I reach a point when I no longer feel the body there any more, it's just my "self" and the vibrations. I no longer feel the bed, and it's like I'm floating in space, and I feel myself rather "small". After that I do not remember what happened, it's as if I fell asleep.

The next thing I remember, is I get out of my body, and immediately I float up, and I get out of the house phasing through the closed glass window. The first thing that I noticed was that it was already day outside, not night. The Sun had already gone up apparently. I could see the environment exactly as it was in the physical, and I was flying over my property. It wasn't a grey color, or a blue color, as other people have reported. No, it was exactly the same colors as in the waking reality, and in my yard every object was in it's place that I had left it the previous day. I could see all the plants, trees, and bushes that were growing on my property. It is interesting that some people have said that the astral plane is not looking the same as  the physical, but as I saw it, was an exact version. There was no distinction absolutely.

I levitated myself up above the ground, and I saw the roof of my house, and the neighbor's house as well, and the surounding mountains. I flew up over the bushes, going higher and higher up to the tops of the redwood trees. And then when I had reached close to the edge of my property, I saw the neighbor's wolf running around. He looked up and saw me, with an expression of shock, like he didn't expect to see me flying so high over the trees, like he was caught being naughty. And he immediately took off runing out of my property, along the road, and to my neighbor's. I attempted to follow, I flew over the neghbor's property as well, but I had barely gone 1/10th of the way into his property, and the experience ended right then and there.

I woke up, and it was like 11 AM, very late. So it confirms that I had been astral projecting during the morning hours. I think that I had been stopped from astral trespassing, because the experience ended as soon as I went over my neighbor's property. Does anyone know why that is? Need less to say, I have never seen the wolf on my property even agan. I think that we both have learned to respect the boundary.At random times throughout the day, I like to sporadically turn and point to a random part of my room and say "HAH I CAN SEE YOU".

I like to think that there's a .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%

chance there was actually a mfer there, and I scared the shit out of them.

Even funnier, is if they were in a different part of the room, so I'm pointing like 5ft to the side of them.

They'd be like TF?

anybody else do this and giggle to themselves alone after...Let me start this off by saying I used to have severe nightmares when I was a kid, so a therapist taught me how to lucid dream to change my dreams as needed. This worked fabulously and I’ve been able to lucid dream since I was about...8. That being said, this experience was not a lucid dream in my opinion. I couldn’t alter anything or really even control anything even though I was trying to. 

Well I took up this interest in astral projecting. I did a lot of research and meditated every single night, except I wasn’t able to quite get it and I would just end up lucid dreaming. 

WELL. This one day I slept at my boyfriends house and I “got up” in the middle of the night to go to my house. I don’t remember really how I got to my house but eventually I did and I was just in my room. Well for some odd reason I started looking at myself in the mirror (it’s pretty big). At this point I realized I didn’t get up at all and I realized that while I was in my room I could simultaneously see MYSELF SLEEPING IN MY BOYFRIENDS BED. This was the moment that I was like “okay fuck, I didn’t mean to do this. I want to go back”, and I just kept trying to plop back into my body but I couldn’t. So back to the mirror. After I realized I couldn’t re-enter my body something started calling me into the mirror and I basically followed the sound and walked into it. The moment I did I woke up in a severe panic, sweating, in my boyfriends bed. 

Now I’m seeing a ton of shit about how it’s bad to go into mirrors and I even had to take my mirror out of my room. 



So...my question is, do I have anything to be worried about? How do I return if I astral project in the future? Comments? :/So I just wanted to post this I thought people might find this interesting I'm very new to the astral projection I can't progress at all because everytime I try get into very deep meditative State just is your supposed to and then I get interrupted by a phone call from my pretrial services asking if I'm tampering with my ankle bracelet this is happed twice I've only tried it happened both times I actually had to go in to Concord and get this thing checked out I'm assuming it's because of some sort of electrical field

Oh and ankle bracelet thing I have to go to trial to go prove my innocence do to a terrible divorce so unfortunately I got the really short end of the stick of courseThanks for all the wonderful info, I'm just really hoping I am diligent about carving out the time to practice.I had a pretty long astral experience today.  It seemed like hours.  I practiced teleportation.  But I also practiced using doors as portals and got pretty good at it.  Find a door, close it.  Use the intention of where you want it to open to and open it and there you go you can turn a door into a portal.  You can also just open a portal.  So that was pretty interesting.Slowly exhale and hold.

You now feel like you are holding your breath, but you aren't. Relax. Practice this every night. Hone in on the sensation around you - the vibrations. They should be raising as you do this. Inhale. Exhale. Hold. Keep your eyes closed. Your heart is beating like a drum. Hold. 

You should be trying to sleep. You should be walking the line between now and wherever you want. But, don't fall asleep yet.
Relax. Do the breathing exercise.
Now picture the Astral Well. 
Walk towards it. 
Jump when you are ready. 
Picture nothing below.
You are nosediving to your death.
You've stuck the bottom.
FAREWELL. 

Your mind is now awake, while your body sleeps.

It should feel as if you're trapped inside yourself right now, but you must stand up. Get on with it. You have things to do. 

You are now free to do as you please. Any place, any time, any alternate paths, and even alternate yous.


You are a time traveling phantom.

You are capable of piloting anyone and anything. 

Experience as much as you can. 

And come back home.The Dimensions.[https://thespiritualtoolbox.com/blogs/magick-metaphysics/55515-monroe-institute-declassified-cia-documents](https://thespiritualtoolbox.com/blogs/magick-metaphysics/55515-monroe-institute-declassified-cia-documents)

the article discusses a code of 55515 which repeating gets rid of pain by focusing on the area of pain and repeating 55515

its part of the Monroe CIA documents

&#x200B;

what's interesting is that the bodies gene for pain perception in humans is numbered "55515"

this makes me further wonder, could we use this with other genes by finding out their number and what they do

&#x200B;

this is the Monroe CIA document that the article references: [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210023-7](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00788r001700210023-7)

&#x200B;

edit: its page 14 for the CIA docI know it was successful because I saw 3 separate entities who were autonomous from me. I've been trying for months but usually get too excited or i'm too anxious.
So I literally rolled out of my body and felt myself hit the floor. I thought it was my physical body but when i got up i just knew I had successfully left it. Then I go down my hallway to see what my roommate is up to and she's giggling talking to somebody on the phone, and has this golden light aura around her. Does anyone know what that means for her?
Since the door to outside was right there I go down the stairs and to the front door, and that's when I noticed I was about as tall as a toddler and was as tall as the doorknob. Anyway I opened the door and I didn't really remember this until I woke up, but there was a woman who was almost invisible with black and white flecks barely defining her form, sitting in front of our building minding her business just observing everything. My street can be busy sometimes and she seemed to be just watching. Maybe she hid herself when I approached. 
I also checked behind myself and there was a silver chain with white light coming out of my tailbone. It went up the stairs presumably to my physical body. I tugged on it too and it seemed very sturdy but I didn't want to test it lol. 
So i live right under a train station and saw the trains approaching, so i floated above the station and saw the tops of the trains. I have never seen the tops of the trains in my waking life and that was fun. They were a burnt orange color. I then go behind my house and there was river and I begin to fly across it, speeding up. 
Suddenly I see a floating person in the distance, another projector I assumed. I am just minding my business fixated on getting to this white building I saw across the river when the person makes a beeline towards me. Getting closer I saw they had the head of a deer with huge antlers. I was sligtly afraid and remembered I had no protection around myself so I said eff it and returned to my body instantly right as they were about to approach me. I woke up to see if my roommate was actually talking on the phone to someone but she wasn't. 
Interesting first experience!So I want to start this out with a disclaimer that I have nothing against astral projection and actually find it really cool. I haven't found a way to do it myself but I have a bit of a more pressing situation.
My ex is very skilled at it and I knew he was capable of it but today he projected himself into my car. He's not a good person and the relationship was very toxic. I do not want to talk to him or see him but I could feel his energy in my car and so could my girlfriend. Is there any way I can stop this from happening? The only thing that worked tonight was playing the music that he dislikes. 
Thank you all for your spoons here and I appreciate anyone who reads this or gives me advice 💜 Because modern culture doesn’t have a role for the shamanic archetype, many people who grow up outside indigenous villages are shamans — healers who have access to the spirit world — and don’t know it.  
Many naturally wind up in overtly healing professions, such as medicine, psychology, or life coaching. They’ll take part in various forms of sacred activism and spend their lives healing the planet, for example, rather than healing people. But some wind up in professions where they may feel like they don’t fit in at all.  


I wrote this article to honor the shamanic tradition, not to violate it in any way.  


Even those who enter the healing professions may feel out of place because the systems of Western medicine and psychology leave little room for a shaman to practice his or her natural healing art, which may include such unconventional practices as intuitive medicine, ritual, and communication with spirits.  


Are you a shaman and you don’t know it?  


Here are some telltale signs that you might fit the shamanic archetype.  


**1. YOU SENSE THAT YOU’RE MEANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL SHIFT IN CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY**.

&#x200B;

We can all feel it, this impending shift that New Agers have talked about for decades. But those with the shamanic archetype don’t just feel it. They feel it pulling them, like a magnet, towards leadership positions that help facilitate,[read more...](https://www.psychicloki.com/2020/05/10-signs-youre-shaman-dont-know-it.html)I have unintentional astral projections since i was a teen. I actually still have issues with controlling my astral body when they happen but what i found out all these years is that astral projecting is not just about training.
There is some predestination to it and if you are not spiritually prepared, you wont have much luck at astral projecting no matter how hard you train. At least this is my experience. Any thoughts?There seem to be some misconceptions about some of the AP techniques out there. They do work very well and everything you learn is correct. However, it's all about how you interpret it.

What seems to be the most common problem is that, focusing on laying down, breathing, visualizing... all these things you hear or read in tutorials can actually makes you focus on your physical self, which is the exact opposite of what you want to do!

It's in the **MIND** and **CONSCIOUSNESS**. Not in your eyes, your lungs or your muscles.

Forget about your eyes, you will see things.

Forget about your lungs, you will breath so much deeper.

Forget about your muscles, you will feel weightless.

When you read in tutorial to focus on your breathing pattern, it means to **FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING**. Not on the air entering your lungs, your nose and exiting through your mouth, wich is again, focusing on your physical self.

Focus on your **SIGHT**! Not on your eyes.

Focus on your **BREATHING**! Not on your lungs, nose or mouth.

Focus on **SINKING** on each exhales! Not on laying still and not moving muscles.

**FOCUS** your mind/consciousness but **DO NOT FORCE IT**. Let, Allow and Surrender your consciousness to Astral Projection but don't try to force your way out! This is a mistake I've made myself in the begining. One thing that can help you if you can't focus your mind correctly during meditation is to get into the mindset of **ALLOW** your mind and **SURRENDER** your body to Astral Projection/Meditation. Just keep repeating ''I allow my mind to Astral Project \*inhale\* and I Surrender my body to it \*exhale\*''. You have to realize that our minds have been locked for hundreds, if not, thounsands of years. For you to be able to unlock in within just a few weeks or even a year proves just how strong our link with the Astrals is.

Also, learn everything there is to possibly know about Astral Projections, Guides, Planes, Entities, Meditation, Chakra, Experiences. Watch youtube channels like Astral Club, Ryan Cropper, **GIGI YOUNG** is a must.

**LEARN ASTRAL DEFENSE** on the Reddit Wiki. This is such a great guide and not only it removes a lot of fear, it also let you imagine, vizualize and feel what you could do on the Astral. It's easier to imagine yourself creating a sword than yourself flying over the sun.

The separation techniques such as the rope, rollout, lifting or locations are great but should only be used once you reach the proper stage/state of consciousness. You don't cross a lake if the bridge is not completed! You will fall onto the water and.. it will either drown you (sleep) or wake you up.

You have to try to go as deep as possible first, experiment this in meditation. Learn how to construct the bridge first (reaching very deep states)! Trust me, you will know when you hit solid land and all you have to do is step right on the other side (Separation techniques).

Lastly, do not forget that Astral Projection is not a skill you learn as it is already within you. You just need to go back to it and unlock it.

Safe travel :)I've never astral projected but I'm curious if anyone has seen into the afterlife. If so, what's it like?I did it !!! For the first time I exited out the top of my head this morning!! I’ve been trying for the last few days. What’s strange is the first time I tried it hurt a little. But after that my next few attempts didn’t hurt. I wonder if you gotta break through something first time  ? 
      Anyway, So I had to push myself out and really work my way out through this exit. I didn’t hear any scary voice this time but I was prepared to face that fear! Once I was fully out I looked around my room in amazement at how super clear it was !! Never have I seen so clear in an obe. I couldn’t believe it. I set intentions to visit my Dad. (For those of you who don’t know my dad is sick with cancer, very sick, he can’t move the chemo has made him so weak and sick. I visited him once before and I posted about that experience. ) so I went to my Dad to try to help heal him. I saw him laying there. He looked awful 😞 I knelt down next to him in his bed. I put my hand together to pray. I asked for healing light. Then green light shot down from the sky into the top of my head. It filled my body, I pointed my hands to my Dad, the green light shot out of my hands into my dads body. I scanned his whole body a few times with the light. I watched the green light go up and down his body. I thanked God & I said I was ready to go back now & I opened my eyes in bed. Whole body tingling, like way more intense than usual. I laid there feeling it, saying thank you 🙏🏼 
       I decided to try again. I exited out the top of my head again. I now know how to push up to exit that way. Once again I had to really push myself out. Especially the end of me. It’s almost like I’m pushing myself out of a tiny space. Once I was fully out I was amazed at how clear it was again. I floated through a house near by. There were kids in the living room, they said there she goes again! Lol I floated through their door. I started visualizing grandmas face. (My mom wanted me to ask her a question ) also for those of you who don’t know my grandma passed away March 10th of this year & my first visit with her was 3 weeks after she passed…. 
I wasn’t going to her at first. So then while visualizing her I felt the love I have for her to see if that would help. Next thing I knew I was right in front of her. She was sitting outside in a rocking chair. She was so clear I could see the wrinkles in her face. She was wearing her moo moo like she always loved to wear lol it was silky w purple and pink flowers. Which was her favorite colors. I knelt down in front of her. I said grandma mom wanted me to ask you if you were happy she got to visit you? (My mom had her first out of body experience recently and she got to see grandma. She hasn’t had an obe since I was a child, but after talking with me and hearing my experiences she decided to try again & it worked ! She had a long talk with grandma ) so I asked grandma if that made her happy, she smiled and said “well, yes” like of course I was happy ! lol I said grandma a couple years ago Sabrina (my cousin who passed in 2007) told me I have angel wings , can you see them grandma ? Because I can’t see them? I watched her face and her eyes looked behind me she looked way up and all around me (looking at my wings) then she looked at my face and said “those look pretty heavy” lol I said “I can’t feel them grandma, but I want to see them.” She told me in time I will. I then said “grandma last time I saw you I asked you if you would be there for waiting for me when I pass away, you said no, then you were ready to tell me something else & I got pulled back?” She told me now that she knows I want her there waiting for me she said she will be there. Then she mentioned that we will be going through something similar to world war 2, she also mentioned Rome. Idk why. She didn’t give me a timeline. Not sure why she said that. I felt the pull to come back & grandmas face started fading. I wasn’t ready to go so I said “I want to stay out longer!” It didn’t work, the pull kept happening. So I said it two more times and grandmas face cleared right up and the pull stopped ! It worked !!! I held grandmas hands and hugged her so tightly told her I love her. I told her I’m worried I’ll forget what she told me so I guess I better go.. I said “I will remember this!” “I will remember all of this!” As I floated up & off I said grandma help me remember lol then I waved bye to her and opened my eyes in bed. I laid there thinking about all she told me & then wrote it in my phones notes. 
       I couldn’t believe how crystal clear she was this time. How clear my room was. I saw myself laying there down below when I first got out. Usually when I first get out I can’t see till I get away from my body. But this time I could ! I never had to ask for clarity once on this trip. Ugh mom is gonna be so happy when I tell her!!! I also hope my Dad wakes up feeling better today. He’s so sick from the chemo. 🙏🏼🥺 I hope I helped !!almost every night, i project, whether intentionally or not. the other night, however, i had just finished some manifestations, and was focusing on detaching myself &amp; projecting. i didn’t have any weird feelings or uncomfortable sensations, but as i was almost completely detached from my vessel i heard a very raspy, very feeble “don’t leave your body.” i paused and stopped myself from going further, processing what i just heard, when again i hear it. this time it was either “please don’t leave your body tonight” or “just don’t leave your body tonight” and it was a little bit more firm, like some volume and tone put into it, but it sounded fearful. i decided it was better for me to stay, i can pass on whatever i would have experienced that night because i was obviously being warned for a reason. i didn’t feel any malevolent presence, and it wasn’t a familiar voice. 

*has anyone else had an experience like this? what do you think it is, and if there’s anything else, what should i take from this?*

note: i am a woman, just to clarify. the voice also didn’t feel like me, but i’m not ruling out the fact that it wasn’t me. thank you all for the input! i have 2 very different, but equally possible solutions in mind. i’m sorry i can’t respond to everyone!Can we make it against the rules to ask, “Is AP even real?” 

Every single day somebody has this same question with absolutely zero research on their own, and when directed to the CIA docs they seem to be like, “Well have YOU ever done an experiment?” as if anecdote is more valid than the CIA.

It’s okay to wonder, especially being rather new myself, but damn I hate seeing the same question over and over when it’s already laid out for everyoneFor a while I'd been trying to AP but about a month ago I gave up putting in effort towards it. I thought that I couldn't get relaxed enough for it to happen.

But this morning, I was in a state drifting between sleep and waking, sometimes having little dreams. I had meditated a couple hours ago, but I kept getting distracted and decided to just go back to sleep. 

Right when I was about to slip back into sleep, I recall thinking something along the lines of "get me out" or "let me out" or "I want out", and that was the only thought in my head.

And then I pressed my hands into the mattress and pushed myself out on my hands and knees. I could see my body below me, in the exact same position I'd been lying in and in the same clothes I'd been wearing. 

I got off my bed and began walking around my room. The one thing odd to me is that I felt much shorter than I actually am while I was walking around, maybe a foot shorter. But I could feel the weight of my hair on my head and its texture especially.

I only got to about halfway to my closet when I "woke up". Maybe I got excited when I realized what was happening and snapped out of it. This whole experience lasted maybe no more than 30 seconds, but I loved it.

Funny because I'd been trying to make AP happen for so long (binaural beats and all) and I just really had to get in the right state of mind the whole time.Hi Everyone, 

I just wanted to say how impressed & happy with this sub as of late. A year+ ago this sub, in my opinion, was going downhill with the lack of moderation and staying on point but lately I've been seeing a lot more relevant posts / comments and wanted to say that I'm happy with the direction this sub is going.

That's all :)1. Lay down
2. Calm mind with breathing 
3. Slowly Relax body from feet up to head. Bottom to top. Nasal breathing into each body part.
4. With every exhale you relax deeper and deeper 
5. Once body is super relaxed and you have reached the head
6. Bring to your awareness that you are a spirit/soul/consciousness inside of a physical body
7. Once your perspective shifts and you feel the shift.
8. Set the intention for each inhale you pull in golden light and as you exhale your body fills up with this light 
9. See your body as an empty lake, the golden light is the water that fills up this lake.
10. Continue to fill up your lake (body) with this light until you naturally fall asleep or leave the body.

- If you try out this technique and are successful, feel free to share below your experience! :)


❗️Edited with an EXAMPLE Try this: ❗️
Key points:
- on 10th inhale hold for 10 seconds then slowly decompress and deeply let go relax the body.
- on each exhale let go more and more.
- nasal breathing only fully in fully out 

Only focus on 1 step at a time!

10 breaths into both feet as same time

10 breaths into both ankles

10 breaths into both knees

10 breaths into the tailbone

10 breaths into the belly button/stomach

10 breaths into the heart 

10 breaths into both arms

10 breaths into the throat

10 breaths into the centre of the brain

Remember! on 10th inhale for each body part hold the inhale for 10 seconds then slowly decompress and deeply let go relax the body.


Then you simply let go of all expectations, nothing should be forced, simply allow. Then set the intention that you will be conscious when leaving the body. Start visualisation of your body filling up with light and you will enter a trance like state, the body will fall asleep very fast and the mind will be awake. You will then get the hypnogogic visuals. 

Think about this where your attention/focus goes energy flows and where energy flows it grows. You are moving your focus from feet to head like dragging a computer mouse. Simple and easy. Only focus on 1 step at a time!This post is just a light topic which I thought was funny. My ignorant self, thinking I know everything, started telling myself, "you don't HAVE to get out of bed to drink water or pee or read a book. If you wake up, you're awake, so just then focus on meditating or something at that time". So fast forward to 3am, I wake up, shut off the alarm, lay down to meditate and the conversation in my head went, "ok just focus on-" PASSED THE FCK OUT 🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅 woke up again at 630am like woooooooow, way to go genius 🤣🤣🤣🤣 anyone else go thru this as well? LolMy brother showed me this [video](https://youtu.be/AIWKHxxivag) a while back of a man being hypnotized to see his past lives. At around 1:06:22 he starts talking about Egypt and how he was a human/canine hybrid that built the pyramids with his mind. Has anyone traveled to when the pyramids were being built and seen anything like this? It seems crazy, but also plausible considering all the crazy things I've read and heard about in this  sub.So a few days ago, I had posted asking some advice on how to switch from Lucid Dreaming into AP. u/starrygalactic gave me advice to look for a portal or a door of some sort when in the dream. 
Last night I was fully lucid, flying around, casting spells, shooting guns, just some fun shit, and remembered what she had told me. 
I began to search around for some sort of door, and in the middle of the space behind me, a circular, white, bright spot appeared; floating at about chest height and about 2.5’ in diameter. I immediately tried to dive into it. I felt myself return to my body and immediately was in the “vibration” stage. I thought I had reached this stage before, but now I truly understand why it is called the vibrations. I felt as if every atom in my body was positively charged, ready to shock someone if they touched me. 
I began to separate from my physical, and drifted toward the ceiling, I could feel the ceiling fan passing through me, the only thing I could compare it to was that it felt as if someone was rubbing ice from my armpit to my waist, where the blades were passing through me. It was not painful, and it was not unpleasant, it was just different. 
At this point I began to have a million different thoughts and ideas of where I wanted to go, somewhere to try to verify my experience; the book shelf in the office upstairs, a friends house, my parents attic. Perhaps I got a little too excited, because the next thing I was sucked back onto my bed and sat up with the driest mouth I’ve had in ages. 
After lucid dreaming actively for the last 10 years, I’m so pumped to have been able to venture into a different experience. 
What this sub says is true, you have to do research, and you have to be patient. 
Thank you u/starrygalactic for your excellent advice!This morning I had my second sleep paralysis ever and I was able to detach from my body! This didn't happen though falling asleep into SP (with vibrations) but rather waking up and being paralyzed. I opened my eyes this morning and went to look at the time on my phone and realized I couldn't move my hand. I am normally quite anxious when I'm awake but even though I was paralyzed, I immediately went to work getting out of my body. It was very hard to get even an arm out. I've heard of trying to float out or roll onto the floor but for some reason didn't try either of those methods. I had the idea to close my eyes and then feel myself get up and walk to the door. (Please let me know if this technique is old news lol) When I opened my eyes I was out of my body and at my bedroom door! I then walked though my front door and out to beautiful green rolling hills. I felt so in control! Like, I knew what was going to be outside because I was so aware. My thoughts felt so clear! I then played around and did fun dream stuff like flying. An absolutely surreal and amazing experience! I feel more confident to brave sleep paralysis in order to experience this again! Please try out the method I used if you haven't already and are struggling with getting out of your body!My road here has been seemingly random and accidental. I wasn’t raised overly spiritual or religious with some formal church attendance over my childhood.  My mom always felt I had an insight into spiritual things and she always felt some vague sense of connection to something more than this physical world. She would have dreams or “feelings” that often panned out but there was no clear path or spirituality for her, or if there was, she never vocalized it. 

I think it started for me about 5 or 6 years ago, when I was reading of a mass shooting event that just didn’t make sense. Like it physically would’ve been impossible to happen as they said. The details of that aren’t important but I just innately felt that everything I’d been told could be untrue. I began exploring slowly, peeling back the layers of the onion one by one. 

I read on one of the subs once that most organized religions were close to the truth but it had been watered down and lost over time. That Jesus was not saying he was the literal son of God but that God, or the Source, was inside all of us. That we are ALL part of “God.” That just really made so much sense to me.

Once I came across the CIA project stargate docs, it clicked for me. We ARE more than our physical selves. That’s where this sub came in and my study of AP started. I’m working on the Robert Monroe tapes and learning to meditate and connect to what I feel is the truth. 

Last night I began to go deeper into the rabbit hole after reading a post here about a soul resetting facility that multiple people claim to know of or have seen. I know it sounds loony to some but it resonated with me. And after digging into it I feel like I now understand now. Whether we believe in aliens/archons/demons/etc is essentially irrelevant because there are very important people out there who allegedly do. It is hard to just dismiss offhand all of the reports of “satan” worshipping elites who do horrific things in the name of money and power. Even if most people choose to not believe those “conspiracies” one has to start to ask themselves if there is so much more to “reality” than we’ve been led to believe. 

I’ve always thought that whether we live in a matrix or not is irrelevant. We need to live our lives either way. Love our families, go to our jobs etc. But after thinking this over for years now I think we have an opportunity to break free from the entities who seek to use us for whatever purpose. Long before I started down this path I felt an inherent knowledge that “energy” plays an important role in whatever the truth is. I now think this is what it’s all about. We exist on one vibrational wavelength and just because we can’t all raise our vibrational state at will to see other entities that may exist alongside us does not mean they aren’t there. I guess I liken it to someone who is colorblind. Just because someone is unable to see the color green does not negate the fact that that tree’s leaves are truly green. It just means he cannot see what is truly in front of him. Could we be the same? Could there be entities that exist to drain us of our energies? I don’t know but I do feel that there is truth to this. 

Anyway, onto the crux of this. I have two young children and a husband I adore. My husband is fully willing to believe a lot of “conspiracies” and that there is a lot to our world (especially in politics) that is deeper than we are told. But he doesn’t really think or go further than that. Like vibrational states and entities enslaving humanity is totally out there to him. To be fair to him, it’s pretty out there for most people. 

I tried to talk to my husband about my thoughts on some of this and the idea that the truth of the universe is so much more than we’ve been led to believe, but I feel like I sound whacko when trying to verbalize all that I’ve come to feel is Truth. I am a successful 38 year old woman who has a great job, makes great money, is totally sane etc. How can I start to discuss this in an easily digestible way? I feel like it’s just so hard to put into words. I don’t seek to change his mind at all but merely to start him thinking that we may be so much more than just our physical bodies. 

On that note... we have two young kids and I would love to just expose them to the ideas that they hold their own power inside of them. How do I naturally expose them to any of these ideas as they grow up without coming across as totally crazy and trying to brainwash them. We aren’t a member of any churches yet but I wouldn’t be opposed to that as I think religion can offer a lot as far as morals and such. I just want them to think critically and never just accept anything someone says or does as the ultimate truth. 

If this doesn’t belong here please let me know. I guess I just really had an “ah ha!” Moment last night and I feel the weight of that today. I’m trying to work my way through this all while being careful to keep myself grounded and not get too ahead of myself. I think a lot of “conspiracy theorists” or “new age thinkers” can lose themselves in it all and I have no desire to go down that road.The only times I ever felt anything like “vibrations” or numbness is when I smoke weed and relax... but it’s not even AP vibrations.

Even if I completely relax, for over an hour, I still just feel very relaxed (to the point where it feels like there’s lead in my blood), but no vibrations. Sometimes I can even start to see hallucinations, but no vibrations. Even when i’m in this state and try an exit technique, I get nothing. 

SOMETIMES i’ll start feeling euphoric numbness in my legs, but it will just intensify until my legs kinda twitch/spasm and make me move.

I eat healthy, drink only water, daily mindfulness meditation and/or yogic practices, and completely believe the process... Still no results, and far from them.This is going to sound really stupid... But I was trying to astral project tonight and a voice told me: hey, just try Ctrl + shift + left + right.... And it fucking worked!!
I was astral projecting....

Anyone with a story similar to mine?My sister is 8 years old. I asked her “do you ever go out of your body when your sleeping” she said yes and explained the whole process like she’s one in the sub. Astral projection is real people.I was AP'ing using the lucid dream entrance techique and walking around a town in the astral plane, spent a good 5 minutes just relaxing on benches and looking around, it was hyper real 4k vision. and then I remembered I wanted to see the akashic records to see a memory I forgotten about, no bad intentions etc... just wanted to see something from the past again. So I said "Show me the akashic records please" like 3 times and at first it didnt work. Then after like 15 seconds I looked to my left and there was a middle aged lady sitting on the bench next to me reading a book. The book looked like a really cool hardcover book with various patterns on it, like an ancient tome. I quickly grabbed it and flipped through the pages but they were all covered by something that was cut out and glued over the pages. There was a little note in the middle but I didnt have time to read it.

The lady then says "We don't show these to random people anymore". Then she walked off and I shouted "Wait is there anything I should know?" and then she said something very private about a family member and basicly told me to help him. As she was walking off I shouted "I love you!!!" and she said something like "Well you didn't before..." and then I woke up.

Did anyone ever manage to view the akashic records? not sure why I was forbidden. My intentions weren't bad or anything, maybe I didn't 100% explain my intent in the moment, I just wanted to view a single memory not show me future events etc.This is incredible! People usually ignore me when I'm in the astral, but this one, a young Indian-looking girl, dressed in a black leather trench coat, walked directly towards me and handed me a sealed, green paper bag. It was closed tightly with duct tape. I knew right away it was meant for me, as I had spent most of my day trying to summon a spirit guide, and here I was with a gift from one of them. My heart raced through my chest, what if I was about to wake up and never found out the contents of the bag? I ripped it open as fast as I could, tearing on the duct tape. Inside was a post-it note with "5 kr." written on it (Kr. being the currency in Denmark where I live), a massive receipt for a bunch of household items like toilet paper, and finally, a smaller, white plastic bag, sealed with duct tape too, containing about 15 types of white crackers, like biscuits.

WTF? I immediately started looking for the girl to ask her what this was about, but she'd vanished. I didn't think to summon her again and instead ran around like a moron looking for her until i finally woke up. EXCITING TIMES! Thanks for reading!Serious question, what do you believe would happen if one  APed and during those moments your physical body died? When you develop your psychic abilities you learn some interesting  things.  What I've figured out is that the physical body is a walking  faraday cage.  Most people aren't aware enough to detect it but there is  an energy field around the physical body.  It runs through it and  surrounds it.  If you can feel it there is an insane amount of energy in  this energy field.  I can feel it around other people and when they are  depressed the energy they put out is like psychic waste.  And is  usually fed off of by negative entities.  So from what I can tell this  energy field is meant to connect people to their physical body and make  it difficult for them to leave.  Although I leave anyway during OBEs.   And when the physical dies this energy field stops function and the  person leaves.  So we have been had people.  We have been caged so we  can be fed off of by negative entities that feed off of the energy of  our negative emotions.  We should learn to manipulate this energy that  way everyone can have OBEs easier and see the truth.The idea of space and the ocean are crazy to me. I couldn’t imagine the vastness of them both. I think I would have a massive freak out. I would just love to hear some stories if anyone is up for sharing.Wow, there’s a lot to unpack here. Did anyone notice the metaphysical themes, including astral projection in the film? I thought it was really creative and powerful the way they intertwined meditation, OOB and near-death experiences into relevant life situations. I picked up on some use of quantum immortality theory and simulation theory as well. The teachings of Abraham Hicks were echoing in my mind throughout most of the film. 

Let’s start by discussing the main underlying premise, which is that our souls are separate from our living bodies. To me this is a relatively new theme in family animation. Even in Coco, when the main character goes to the underworld his physical body goes as well (which is why he has to disguise). This is the first time I’ve seen the disconnection between our two selves represented in a children’s movie. 

They very clearly wanted to show that we are more than our physical bodies, and that we are “spiritual beings having a human experience”. This is where I pick up on a lot of AH teachings. AH also talks a lot about our souls coming here with a promise aka “your soul knew what it signed up for when it came here”. The film hit on this quite a bit. 

The main character is in a coma, and his soul (consciousness) is fighting death, and doesn’t want to move into the next stage. He’s not ready for his physical experience to stop. He essentially “piggy backs” on a new soul who has yet to have a human experience so that he can come back to his human body and finish his life’s work. 

I thought the “new soul” theme was interesting as well. I personally picked up on some simulation theory intertwined here in the way that the souls were “programmed” with specific personality traits, then sent to earth to fulfill their life’s purpose. 

In one part of the film they discussed the character’s soul being “untethered” as compared to souls that were just in a trance. This was the most glaring representation of astral projection in the film. They used examples of shamans, monks and possibly schizophrenics (in a comedic way of course) to alliterate the concept. They also alluded to the fact that untethered souls don’t really exist in the same plane as tethered do. I personally have never been able to have an astral experience with a deceased family member, so this stuck out at me. 

One of the things that was a running theme was the overall balance of energy. The souls had a clear innate electricity about them and even sparked when they went into the great beyond. 

The Great Beyond was a really big indication that they were drawing from metaphysical concepts about life and death as opposed to traditional western, or even eastern ones. It alludes to the fact that we are all drawn from the same energy, expanding into different experiences. When souls cross into TGB, they spark and fizzle and are absorbed into the “light”. What does this represent to you?

It was interesting to me that even the color of the souls were the soft electric blue that many of us have seen represented in our “cords”, and especially when the “blue people” appear. My last projection was terrifying because I got caught in paralysis and had a blue being sitting in my chest, literally sucking the energy from my body. It was the exact color of the souls in the movie and I don’t think that was a coincidence.

I thought it was really interesting that “heaven” and “hell” were only mentioned once, and were almost dismissed as being completely irrelevant.  There was a very scientific and mathematical element to the film. The idea that there is an energetic balance to the world, and that we are all one source. I’ve heard this idea expressed from people who have performed transcendental meditation. That they see the universe as a whole, not an individual experiences. 

In the end we find that the “meaning of life” isn’t about your human experience, it’s about having a human experience at all, and the pure enjoyment of that. If I’m being honest, it was actually a pretty powerful movie and I really enjoyed it. 

There’s a lot more I’m leaving out, and I’m sure I’m not articulating this as well as I could. Just thought it would be a fun discussion to start since I was pretty blown away by the nature of the film. Eager to hear any other thoughts as well. Thanks for reading! 

Forget about meditation to get you there , not going to happen.

Your not a YOGI and you do not have that kind of time to devote.

Very best way to start is so simple and that is you just set your alarm clock to go off every hour after you fall asleep.

When the alarm goes off you reach over turn it off and go back to sleep, this is the single best method to get started no stress .

What you are looking for is when you close your eyes again after waking that you start to feel like you are going to float not dream.

This feeling of floating is the first gate and its difficult and it may take time and you may get tired of the process , if so change it to 3 hours .

None the less that is the very best way to get started.

Remember the difference between a dream and a projection once is all sub conscious and the other is the thin line between both sub and conscious as you are looking to trick the body into thinking that it is dead and to ride with the soul that is going to take you out of your body and its going to want to take you up and into space,

That is the second gate way that is hard to get past as your fear and emotional response will wake you time and time again every time you start to float.

Once you do float and you know its possible than its easier to put up with the constant process of starting the float .

Let me know when you get your first float.

Its very exciting no matter how fast its over.

Try to think of it this way, that the moment your soul hears you talking to your sub conscious its going to know you are not dead and slam you back into your body hard but that is a good sign that you projected.Why you can't stop thinking, The true nature of thoughts, Stay as your God-self which is the awareness in which and by which the thinking is perceived

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why do I exist? I am suffering. I am so depressed."

Yes, but who are you referring to as "I"? You are the universe. You are life itself. You are not separate from life.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why do my thought seem so different then everyone I surround myself with why do I think that I’m going to be something yet I haven’t progressed in life at all why can’t I stop thinking about death and how we ignore it all the time what if everything I been through was to show me that I am something or why don’t I follow people why do I want to be with a leader there’s so many things this universe is doing that I wish I knew the answers to I just wish life could help me out and help me feel at peace."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thoughts are not something we generate. Thoughts are something that appear in the awareness that we are. You currently identify your self as thoughts. Any thought you perceive, you say "That is my thought. This is me. I am thinking this. This is what I want. The content in this thought is what I believe." This is false. You are not the source of these thoughts, they are the result of conditioning. they appear in nothingness, and they disappear into nothingness, you are not the thinker of thoughts. You are the awareness of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thoughts only appear to have power, and to be real, that they are holding you back. Only if you first believe that they are. Without your belief, thoughts are just thoughts. They come and going, completely irrelevant to you. They are nothing at all ultimately. You just believe this nothing to be something. You take the thoughts personally. You believe they are you. That is false and simply a result of lack of knowledge of what you truly are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You say "Why can't I stop thinking about death", well, first of all, it is not you thinking these thoughts. You are only perceiving them. If you are the one perceiving the thoughts, how can you be the one creating them? It is impossible. You are not the thoughts nor the thinker of them, you are merely perceiving them. Do not take these thoughts to be you. It is simply not true.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You are not thinking about death, but when a thought comes and its content is about death, you believe this thought to be you, you identify your self as this thought, and then you continue interacting with this thought. There is a stream of thoughts, and instead of being aware of your self, as the perceiver of the thoughts, you believe you are making these thoughts. Because of this belief, the thoughts never stop. Instead of being conscious, instead of existing and being aware of your self, you are instead feeding all your attention to the thought-stream created by the egoic-mind.

You can easily stop thinking just by being aware of the energy that is being emitted from your hands for example. You see that thoughts do not stop? No problem. Shift attention to your hands. You will start feeling a slight tingling or energy that is perceived through the hands. Stay with that, Boom, you are already not thinking anything at all. The truth is you are not meant to focus on thoughts and believe them to have any importance, it is just what you have been conditioned to do. Everyone believes they are their thoughts, it is natural, it is a habit for you to also believe that. But do not continue to believe the false when you KNOW it is not you. That is foolishness. Let clouds come and go in the presence of the awareness that you are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The same about every other thought you have, none of them have anything to do with you. Drop them. Focus on reality. Actual reality, not the reality imagined by your thoughts. That is distorted reality. You couldn't even say it is reality at all. It is merely an illusion created by your mind and you believe it to be true. Just stop. It is simple. Next time you notice you are thinking too much, realize there is an awareness of the thoughts, otherwise you wouldn't know you are thinking. You would just be the thinking. Because thinking is tormenting you, you obviously are aware of these thoughts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, you know you are aware of these thoughts. The only thing left to do is to simply be aware of being aware. That is the ultimate meditation, that is the ultimate state of being, that is your natural state. If you rest in that, you are enlightened. Enlightened beings are simply aware of awareness. That is all. Nothing complicated about it. You can do it too. Anyone can do it. Most simply are not aware of how to be enlightened. They THINK, again, it is their mind, not true, that enlightenment is something to be achieved after hard work. That is false. It is only a thought preventing you from being enlightened. Your true self is already that enlightened awareness but you must direct the attention towards that which you are instead of indulging the attention in that which you are not.

\- Sebastian KeyMy last (second) AP was early Sunday morning around 4am, but while I could fly inside my house, the rain outside kept me from going outside for some reason. It was also dark so I couldn't see much in my house (including my arms as they were very dark and hard to see). Early this morning around 3AM I managed to AP again, thinking about "love and light" while overcoming the vibrations and reaching for a rope, but managed to roll out instead, and remembering those obstacles from last time I had awareness this time to immediately find a light switch once I pulled myself out of my body. I looked at my arms and they had this vibrancy to them, like my normal arms but a light of very slightly blueish tint emanating from them. As others have said in the past, they totally looked like my arms but in super bad-ass HD, haha. I then butted up next to my wall and forced myself through the wall, because screw using doors like a normal earthbound being, and it didn't hold me back this time. I got outside and this time it wasn't raining. I tried flying which I had no problems last time doing on command, but this time I did, however I remembered someone on reddit mentioning they were able to breathe in in order to fly. Breathe, and fly I did, flying up up and away from earth seeing all of its vibrant blue and green colors...until I could not see earth anymore. Well crap, this isn't what I wanted I told myself (I am not ready to explore the cosmos yet and it seemed so empty and lonely out there), so I zoomed back into earth and ended up in front of my parents' house. I was walking around the house looking at random items, and then had the random thought of "hmmm, I wonder if I can make a beautiful naked woman appear" and in the hallway before my eyes a beautiful naked woman materialized out of thin air piece by piece (think of like a 3D puzzle of a woman being formed quickly using puzzle pieces about the size of your hand). She walked into a room and that's when I thought, "hmm, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using this to my advantage and be creating women out of thin air", even as much as *Weird Science* has had me wanting to do all these years, and then I thought to myself, "okay, I've had a good solid AP experience" and I woke up, ran into my office, and wrote everything down on my whiteboard while it was fresh. I was concerned negative entities would be upset with my decision on choosing to want to see a naked woman so that's basically what put an end to my journey. Guys will always be guys, what can I say. I still have not looked back to see my body, I keep forgetting to do that, and to look at myself in a mirror, but baby steps.

AP is basically how I've always imagined how things should be if I had complete control of my mind, being able to walk through walls that only exist because I've been told they exist. Being unable to fly because I've been told I can't fly. Thank you AP community (reddit, youtube, websites) for all the helpful tips and sharing your stories for inspiration, it's very liberating. Now it is my time to pay it forward.I've been trying to astral project that past month and a bit, no method has work for me, so I've been trying to come up with one that works for me. 

I would lie in bed (on my back with arms on my sides) and focus on the little noise in my head(the ringing tones and the static sound behind it) and I would try to increase the sound and trying to make patterns with the sound. (If that makes sense)

At the same time I would try to visualize an astral body in me that everytime I breathe out, my astral body leave my body from my side and comes back in when Inhale. I would try this method before sleep and after I wake up. 

I finally astral projected, while I was visualizing my astral body in me going out with my exhale and coming back in with my inhale.

 I started seeing my room blurry while my eyes were still closed and remembered people on here saying I should say "clear vision", which I did and it worked everything got really clear. 

I tried floating through the ceiling but could only get half my head through, so I said fuck it and just walked through my room door. Everything had a tint of grey, every corner I turned I kept having the feeling someone is going to be right in front of me.

I make it to the front door and look back into the living room and see a very fluffy cat eating, i thought it was odd but continued out side and sat on my front stairs. I looked back and I see the cat staring at me and a feeling of "this is my cat" came over me. 

So I waved over the cat and she came running to me and i played and petted her. Afterwards I said this enough and went back in and started floating through the floor back into my room and woke up.Sometimes, the simplest experiences are the most profound... 

For those of you who have visited my channel and watched my videos, you know that I experience something I call "beyond body." I came up with the name because the sensations don't feel the same as astral projection. When I go beyond body, there is no feeling of separation from the physical. There is only the sense that my entire body is in motion. Sometimes, I can feel my body accelerating forward at incredible speeds. Other times, I can feel myself turn in different directions, as if some invisible force was guiding me. Once I arrive at my destination, the darkness lifts and my consciousness ends up in a different world or parallel reality. 

My latest experience happened in the middle of night, after asking my guides in thought about the nature and meaning of eternity. After shutting my eyes, I arrived in a house, or perhaps an apartment... I'm uncertain because I was focused on what appeared to be a stuffed toy dog. It was small and had brown curly hair (I'm uncertain about the breed). It was adorable, and the second I approached it, this inanimate object came to life. When I first attempted to pick it up, it passed straight through my hands as if it were a spirit being, but when I tried it again, I was able to hold it. I played with the dog, who seemed to really be enjoying him/herself. As we played, it became more and more real, until it was fully flesh and blood. It was truly astonishing. 

If you're interested, this is the video I created right after the experience:

I hope you enjoy it.I was reading the wiki, and it kept talking about how you could ask your deities for help, how you had protectors (spirit guides and high self), and how there were "evil entities" that were around.

It also talked about how you could piss important dudes off, whether they are advanced astral projectors or just powerful beings in the plane.

So my question is, what are the power dynamics of the astral plane? 

Who's at the top? 

Are there things like "gangs" where weaker entities report to a higher power?

And most importantly, who should I try my best not to piss off?people on here have first hand experience of ap being real, but i’ve seen people say how it absolutely is not. i understand difference of opinions, but how can someone be so sure with no knowledge? i, myself, without even aping have felt so much different/better about life and death in such a short period of time.I see a lot of people in this subreddit asking about how to overcome fear, how to do this and do that... like, please DM me and let me help you astral project! Asking the same question on Reddit all the time will not help you. You’ll only get 2047394 different answers and every single one of them will have a different impact on you.

EDIT: Oh my lord. there's a huge amount of people messaging me, sorry if I take some time before answering, i'll make sure I will answer everybody! Just taking the right time with every single individualI was waking up from sleep paralysis and it was dark in my room, not fully dark and I'm laying on my bed, I look at my door and there's a fucking tesseract warping and moving literally at my door. It was grey and rotating and it literally looked so real, then I just watched it fade and disappear.

&#x200B;

I WAS WIDE AWAKE, not a dream! Did I have a dimensional shift? Like I literally saw a 8 Dimensional shape hovering in front of my door.

It looked like that without the golden edges and it was warping in and out of its self and rotatingI either had a false awaking or AP where I woke up, got dress(I sleep naked) went to the kitchen, took my cup out of the cupboard , put instant coffee in and wanted to put the kettle on but I started hearing these whispers-like hundred people whispering in the background so I was like wtf is that because I knew I was awake. Well I thought I was. Then I experienced this “whoosh” sound /sensation circling around my body and then BAM! And I woke up-I thought whoa! , that was real as fuck ( I AP too time to time and I think I actually might have been out of my body considering the whispers and the whooosh sensation etc) but the weirdest thing is-when I got up second time irl and went to the kitchen - there was the cup with the coffee that I had left there in my “dream” / astral realm !
I could never figure this out and baffled me ever since.

Just a little add on - it’s scientifically proven that you cannot sleepwalk during REM phase when you dream as you are actually paralysed during that time.
People sleepwalk during a very deep sleep also called N3 phase and sleepwalkers don’t know they are sleepwalking so there’s no chance I was sleepwalking as I was fully aware or if I was Astral projecting which is more likely- how did I manipulate the physical realm? (The coffee)Some may not believe me while others just might, but at this point you guys are my only way back to my reality. 

Ive been in the wrong reality for about a week now and I don’t know how to get back. My friends aren’t my friends, well they are but we don’t have the same memories that we had back in my reality. This all started when I was trying to Astral Project for the first time after hearing stories about my grandpas astral travels. I remember “waking up” and seeing my body lying dead fully ( I know thats not a word but you get what I meant ) asleep. I remember getting so excited that I popped back into my body. Waking up the next morning my dog was barking at me as if I was a stranger. I would like to say that me and my dog have a connection, a string bond, she knows when im about to cry or even stressed, she’s like a mom form in a dog breed. Ever since my mom died its like my mom is living through our dog. So waking up that morning with a german Shepard looking like she’s a out to eat me freaked me out. My dad had to come in the room and kick her out. In this reality my mom is alive. ALIVE. I guess that’s part of the reason ive been “here” so long. I could’ve posted my story days ago for help. Everytime I talk to my mom or his mom she tells me that something doesn’t seem right about me.

That’s just incident number 1. Another incident is in school. Back in my reality I had a scholarship waiting for me to go to Florida State University, and in this reality im flunking classes. I would never flunk a class because I don’t know about you guys but I get in trouble if there’s even a C on my report card. And my friends we don’t even know who eachother are anymore. My friend Alexis is the only one who believes me because the guy in this reality is gay and I don’t have a problem with the LGBT its just not something that I am. I have a girlfriend back in my reality. Alexis is honestly the one who convinced me to finally come on here and tell my story hoping someone could help me. 

And what clarified that im in the wrong reality is me having a younger sister. My mom died before her and my dad could even try for another baby and you know whats funny. This reality her name is lily and in my reality my dad always said that when my mom was alive she wanted to have a little girl named lily because the name stood for (Louis, I, Love, You: Lily) Louis is my dads name.

I don’t know how long I can keep this up of acting like I belong here, But i think its time for me to go back to my own life. Should I try Astral Projecting and seeing if that works?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQGwV868jns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQGwV868jns)

Astral projections aren't something new for me, i dont want to sound egocentric but i've had maybie about 20 fully conscious projections to this date. But sometimes i feel stucked in the transition phase when your body is fully vibrating and getting uncomfortably numb and it just feels so much unpleasant that i need to give up. But this audio track helped me get through this phase i swear it, you just need to focus on the sounds and the pain in the physical body and uncomfotrtableness (sry if thats not a word) will just fade away while your energetic body is seperating from the physical one. Here is my technique:  


 1. You need to be laying straight on your back, for some reason this is the hardest position to fall asleep and its the most comfortable one for the seperation of energetic body

2. The goal is to stay awake while your body falls asleep (you probably know this already sorry)

3. You need to be maximum comfortable and dont move your body but literally no movements when you once get the perfect position, you can make really tiny movements and adjustments from time to time but the goal is not to move at all

4. It will take some time, after about 20-30 minutes of laying, your body will start to tingle and vibrate, your whole body will vibrate very intense, the audio track needs to be played at very low volume just to keep you awake

6. Unfortunately it will start to feel uncomfortable at some point, i dont understand why it has to be that way but it has to be for some reason You must not move or you will disrupt the process 

8. You need to be looking in front of your closed eyes, you will see some dark-blue shapes floating through the darkness, you need to follow them and just go with the flow, they will also help you stay awake, i think this blue shapes are actually ether or the "air" of astral, call it whatever, for some reason all of my friends and people i talked to also see this blue shapes/clouds

9. Your room needs to be in complete darkness, thats one of the most important things, you can wear a sleep mask if you can 

10. You will literally feel that your spiritual body is seperating from your physical body, your heart will start to beat very fast and you may start to become scared of the unknown, this is the most tricky part 

11. In this part i am visualizing a rope hanging from my ceiling, and you need to visualize yourself climbing up that rope and include all senses and feelings as much as you can and use your arms and everything 

12. In one moment you will just appear in your room, you will see yourself/your body sleeping, or you maybie spawn in some random location, you can fuckin fly bro, flying in astral is the most amazing feeling, its like floating in some huge ocean, all sensations in astral are boosted by +3000% , you feel everything more intense

sorry for the long post but the audio really played a big role since i haven't had a successful projection for a while, haven't had willpower to go through the uncomfortable sensations of transitionTurned out I was on the Adultery subreddit where 'AP' means 'Adultery Partner.' I knew spirit nookie was rarer than that.Update 1 month later: still sane, no crazy hallucinations like this have happened since(though I tried to do a past life regression I can more easily write off as a dream). Literally back to normal with no more explanation of what happened.



I debated writing about this for over a week, maybe two now. It is really long. I have a whole ass backstory about my own history describing how out of character this is, I think I'll post in a comment to separate this OBE.

**TL;DR: I was sucked into an OBE while I was wide awake and was confronted with a strange, geometric diety of some kind. I asked if it was god, it said it wasn't. has anyone else had geometric figures show up??** 

**No, I am not schizophrenic and have a very involved psych who has tried to convince me I might not even be ADHD but just completely normal with a lot of anxiety(thanks US mental health care system). No Drugs. No Hallucinogens. Nothing like it has happened since or before, and I was not half asleep. I was awake. This was two weeks ago, I found out the night of a massive sunburst thing happened around the same time . IDK if it's relevant or not I don't know just coincidental thought I should mention.**

So it's the middle of the night, idk the time but maybe 12? 11?, I had a *creepy creepy* dream. someone or thing showed up in the middle of a really happy dreamland where I was just chillin out on a yacht sipping mimosa's and watching dolphins walk on the water on their fins, & dancing at a cool house party and flirting with some cute boys while people juggled babies and tried to get in my space. Dumb shit. With my attitude, I just went back to bed and wrote it off as a nightmare. what ever. about two hours later or three hours, I wake up AGAIN to the same thing appearing in a typical dream. Think cartoony fish flying in the sky and just weird ass fluffy dream stuff and then turning around and coming face to face with the grudge. It's enough that I sat up straight in bed and decided ok. Don't be dumb this is not part of my dream, just do some of that light protective stuff you learned. Recited some mantras, invoked the usual things to protect me etc etc.. I can share what exactly I did if you're interested. I think this is what triggered my OBE

... its 200ish AM at this point. Sat in bed for a full two hours after that dream on tiktok looking at puppy videos.

Side note. My sleep is fucking important. I NEVER have this kind of issue sleeping anymore, no nightmares in years. I've worked hard with my ADHD and anxiety to keep a tight sleep schedule. No caffiene past noon, no eating past 8pm and no screen time past 830 and usually asleep by 9pm(Says my smart watch that tracks my sleep). I turn all electronics off and have no television in my room. Seriously. Important.

Now it's 4am. I decided to set my phone down laid my head on my pillow and looked up at the ceiling just debating if I should go down stairs and get coffee and then it happened. Remember it's 4am, I looked at my phone and even with a yellow filter the light keeps me awake for *at least* 30 more minutes, I'm super sensitive to it. I'm convinced it's not because of this entity but because of the mantra and protective light stuff that what happened next happened.

 immediately I'm no longer in my room. I'm in a layer on top of it. My body is firmly anchored to my bed and I recognize the feeling of OBE. Around me are this gigantic pillars, but they're alive. They're surrounding me, like in a protective way, in the shape of a square room, one in each corner two against each 'wall.' and I think to my self, this is weird. Kind of intimidating and scary. One of them actually turned to look at me but had no face, and then turned back around. Literally, these gigantic white pillars, some how just... alive. glowing. Never before even tried to imagine it. In my mantra's I asked angels to stand by me and protect me but I mean, I figure typical angels with wings. Were these the actual angels???? What the hell. I'm getting a vibe and I want to know who they are but I know I shouldn't even try to ask or approach. Im like cool good lets wake the fuck up now so I don't have to deal with this.

In the middle of this gigantic room that feels Infinite yet very distinctly formed and limited there is a shape, its alive too. I don't know how to describe but it's very far away and close up. It's hard to see? Make out? Percieve? Feel? I try to will my self closer and find myself sitting in front of it. At this point I really want to go back to my bed because I'm internally freaking out like I really want to not be here but I can feel my body and I'm not able to return some how. I can look back or down and see a white wispy connection but I can't pull myself back and I've been able to just go back to my body when I wanted even if I accidentally APd, I'd just nope right back. Since at least I was 17, or 18 years old and Im 30 now.

So I am sitting in front of this weird mass I can't quite make out. and It's got like 5 spirits on one side of it, 5 spirits on the other side. This mass in the middle I can't make out but the 10 spirits I can see them as people. Distinctly blueish white energy, with the shape of a human. They're each bowing their heads to this shape thing. And the shape thing is acknowledging them individually. It reaches out a hand, limb?? from right to left, as if it's touching them each individually and then they rise up and vanish one at a time. I feel like I should be doing the same?? So I kind of try and as I do it speaks.

"It's time you came." Is what it feels like it's saying. and I'm thoroughly like what the fuck is happening. I'm thinking ok, sure what is going on. and it keeps talking to me. It's telling me how I've ignored this and put it off too long. That it's been waking up and watching the world and watched me idle by or something. It's like actually speaking to me. Usually I just get intentions or feelings, and try to sort it out later. I understand it very... very easily.

 and I'm like sure sure... I mean. can I argue? I been ignoring shit for years lol. Life is rough out in capitalist America. This thing is dense and terrifying and I don't know how to respond. as I am sitting there all the ghosts disappear (My ancestors, helper spirits? I have no idea) and the figure focuses on me and I'm realizing it is these endless geometric patterns and shapes, not like 3d but 4d, going inside and out, it's almost mesmerizing and I'm not able to really define or focus on what it is. and it keeps talking to me. it's voice(?? Energy????) rises up louder, but its not a sound its just... *big.* and I am like shit did I piss you off, and it's saying no, I feel like it's amused and it can hear every thought I have. but it Is trying to keep itself small because it says if I saw how massive it was I wouldn't understand anyway, I'd be like I'm talking to the sky. It continues to say that if it breathed, mountains would crumble. if it cried, rivers would flood. 

and Im like... OOKAAaay(woo woo insert emoji of snarky disbelief). So you're God? and it says no. The white light, the source of everything is beyond the idea of God. It says that The sun is *it's* mind, the earth is it's heart and the farthest planets in our system are *it's toes*. as it's talking it's putting images in my head, showing me a helix of several moving parts, not unlike DNA, taking the form of some figure beyond my comprehension. and To be quite frank, I never even considered anything to be alive beyond biological science definitions. like bacteria, and crap like that they teach at school. I felt like it was telling me that *math* was alive, solid objects, like metals and literal space dust and it felt like... I don't want to say dumb. just. not ever something I'd think on my own.

ANYWAY What is the point in telling me this(If its true and you're not like some sort of freaking demonic spirit)? Why now? Why?? Because to be quite honest I think I am having a mental break at this point. Today, NOW, After weeks of sitting on this I have a million theories. The sun is alive, the universe is alive, and none of my prior atheist system of thinking makes any sense any more, let alone any religion.

It says Because I need to know, and I need to somehow guide others. I am very much not some cult leader, I ask how the hell am I supposed to do that, like are you asking me to be a Jesus/lol/ or something because I can't even manage my own shit on a daily basis and I don't have money to sponsor a religious cult and it gets LOUDER. Bigger. It expands. I don't know if it's laughing at me but I really thought I'd piss the bed. And then it shrinks back down. It says I simply need to understand. That's it. But I am apparently a baby just trying to roll over or open its eyes. 

Im like fair enough. I definitely feel like it at this point. But now Im like shit if I'm really losing it I might as well be here for a minute, let's just say its all real right. and I say, can I try to see you then, if you're real, then let's go. It should have like an actual form beyond.. like, whatever plane I am on, so let's drink some of my insanity and give it a shot, why not?? AT WORST this turns into an acid trip of a dream. so it kind of gives me the go ahead and I try to look at it. I try to look at the whole thing, but it's too big and I try to shrink back and see it from a distance and it's too small. I'm trying to cut out my understandings of what I think I know, what I have seen, and just try to see this without any other assumptions, or filters, without seeing the shapes as shapes. Im trying not to say pine trees, if I'm looking at something I've never seen before like a palm tree kind of thing. maybe its not even a tree.

and then it happens. Quite suddenly, I felt my soul being sucked away. My physical body became a black hole and disappeared. The space around me disappeared and went dark. I became very aware of the fact I was going to literally Ghandi myself into some other dimension and I was about to die. I felt the most panic I have ever felt in my life in terms of spiritual stuff. Spooky paranormal shit doesn't come close, demons, wandigos, any of it. This was some 5th or 6th or 10th dimension level shit that all the woo-woos talk about, A'LA 'the earth is ascending human conciousness is reaching another level we should all prepare the age of Aquarius is here wooo', but seriously. If anyone felt what I felt, they would not be so hippy dippy happy about it.  Then the being snatched me up, like picking up a fucking dragonfly by the wing, finger and thumb and set me back down and said *enough.*

Que the existential crisis. Ok, so I have questions. What the fuck, what is the universe, what is the earth, why are humans like.... obviously not what ever the fuck that was. What the hell is manifestation or law of attraction, how does it all connect, and what about the people with illnesses and diseases and what is death if there is this shit, I am having a mental break down. I'm thinking I have to call my psych, I've gone full mental. Maybe I need to check into a ward. but there is no history in my family, no indicators at all that I would have a mental break but it happens to people right? People have shit happen all the time mid life, where there was no problem before and then suddenly bam, they take off  on a manic episode and die on the side of the road, like holy shit this is my life now.

And it's like, this huge presence shuts me up immediately. Just silences me with a heavy, dense, light. What we call manifestation is the bridge to the feeling I just had. It's all the same, in the same space and time and existing on top of each other simultaneously. Manifestation was just this... reality. Not a thing or a place or something to be controlled or called upon or summoned like magic. It's a literal bridge, a literal, actual, physical thing we can't yet see or define that connects all things to each other and then all things back to the source of whatever creation is. Even though we're here, on earth, doing all the things that we do. We're no different than any other place or dimension. 

Im sitting here like why in the actual hell tell me this and dump this on me. I have no influence or power, I don't believe in a GOD or a spiritual practice of any kind, I really just float through life, Hell, I'm not even trying to make waves. I'm trying to live my life so what is the POINT. I'm not about to make any massive difference in anything at all.

and it was like to share the knowledge. the understanding and just like that, It said we're done. The conversation is finished. and I'm like *NO we are not*. I just literally felt myself almost die, I saw something I can't explain, some crazy geometric god diety thing told me that basically, the *elemental table* is a living, breathing thing with thoughts of its own. I can't just be done. But it just said no, we're done.  and then kind of kicked me back into my body. I tried to hang on because I really needed to know more. You can't just.. do that to a person you know. Obviously that didn't work. I snapped into my body in and instant and shot out of bed in a cold sweat and scrambled for my phone and it's just 5 minutes later. 4 am still, 4:05. I sat there for a minute. I tried to go back to bed. And then I tried to verbalize it in a video to a friend of mine, but kind of just cried through it when I started remembering that feeling of nearing dieing. For five years I have had nothing to do with the spiritual world. Im not Wiccan, christian, catholic, whatever. I don't go out of my way to hunt ghosts or use ouji boards. I have tarot decks, but as a cool and spooky trick that turns into some accurate scary stuff, just for some skeptical fun. but for five years I been putting my spirituality on a back burner. I've tried some manifestation stuff in the past with mixed results, some of it concrete some of it ambiguous and I don't try to connect the dots. This year, it seems to be a little more immediate or solid, but I chalk it up to positive thinking creates positive results. 

So. Yea. Im a nutcase. I don't even believe myself. This is a long post so Im gonna stop here. comments welcome. I know already what people will say though; is it possible you were just in that weird space between waking and sleeping and had a hallucination lol. Maybe??? But never, ever have I had something so vivid, felt so real, within seconds of laying down with my eyes open. and my eyes did shut as soon as I felt being in some other place, It helps me see better. but I honestly, honestly felt 100% awake. No way to prove it.

Ive also talked to my psych and I didn't tell her about my dream, I just kind of... low key.. hey.. what is the symptoms of schizophrenia... she was like are you paranoid?? seeing stuff??? hearing stuff??? And I'm like no. Since that weird... vision happened nothing has really happened since. I feel more sensitive, more perceptive of things, peoples thoughts. but I'm sleeping through the nights. Honestly, I don't want it to happen again. I'd be very chill never having it ever happen again my whole life. Very nervous to post this, but I have no one else to tell.



Edit:
So someone else messaged me I figured I should put it here too. But it really crossed my mind what if this entity is evil but, those spirits really did feel like my elders. I never tried to envision what they looked like or anything, they were just the feelings and guidance , like the higher self everyone talks about. I felt they were familiar.


And they were tough on me. And kind of difficult for me to work with, me being the obviously strong headed one. But here they are showing deep respect and gratitude to this entity. A few people have mentioned he is evil because he dragged you into something you didn't ask for and I'm like I want to agree. But it could have literally gobbled me up, taken my body for a stroll if it wanted so why didn't it?? I asked to try to look at it properly, and it didn't force me to try conceptualizing it, and of course it had to save me from myself.


The whole time I was in that place I felt calm. Weirded out, yes. Like this is fucking weird, I'm kinda curious, but also I want to go back.... but I cant... might as well ask some questions. Seeing those pillars protecting me and seeing my elders made me realize how far I was able to come because this geometry man is one of trillions of other star systems (if what he said is true), of other entities. Like actual demons that are beyond ghosts. And then regular folks just throwing berries and herbs and incense at them is a joke to me now.


 Standing in front of that thing was entirely humbling. Imagining a priest walk into a house with a Bible and holy water to drive out a low level evil demon thing makes me nervously laugh after this whole thing.. I was working with truly powerful spirit guardians and I had no clue -what- I was asking for help.. or how powerful that help was. until I was very face to face with Ra himself. When I got back to my body and in control is when the water works happened lol.It's called (The Four Portals )

Imagine this for just a moment, you find yourself so aware that you are aware within a space where you are usually unaware, and standing before you are these 4 magical portals. Where would you be going?

1 - A new year's party on the moon year, 2300.  

2 -  Heaven. 

3 -  Relive your favorite memory.  

4 - The Lost City Of Atlantis, " before it was lost " 

Please note that this is not likely to come easily, but with, time, patience, discipline, trial and error, combined with intention, belief in yourself, and confidence in what you are doing, it's more than possible!

Because the all is mind! and within it, or... Mabey without it, ALL is possible.

https://youtu.be/sOaG7w9Uz9UIn 2002, I had a dream that I could control. I knew I was dreaming and I could do whatever I wanted.  The first thing I did was fly (I’d never flown in a dream before this). 

I believe that this experience was significant for two reasons:

1 - it was awesome
2 - it is an experience that I don’t hear people discuss daily. 

And this makes me wonder why?

After researching this area to some extent, I found that people have discussed this concept of leaving one’s own body for thousands of years.  Terms for this include astral projection, lucid dreaming, remote viewing, out-of-body-experiences, and others. 

The interesting thing was that this concept became the basis of a soul and arguably provided a foundation for religion. 

But yet, I still don’t hear amazing stories from people about what they accomplished in their “dreams”.  Instead, I might occasionally hear someone say, “I had the weirdest dream.” They will of course then dismiss any significance beyond this. 

In 2019 I began writing a novel about a guy who makes a similar discovery. The book is fiction and goes far beyond this concept and moves more into the realm of technothriller (a genre I learned about yesterday). But, I believe it offers a glimpse into what a world could be like if technology focused, just a little, on what our mind’s are already capable of. 

So yes, this is a post about a book I’ve written, but it would be especially cool if it led to interesting conversations about existence, the purpose of humanity, or other similar conversations about “why”. 

Perhaps if everyone could live their imagination, people would be more content, and more willing to focus on the why. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094HM8NXW/ref=nodl_I used to admin and moderate Astral Projection forums back in the day and wrote an essay detailing how to experience nonphysical exploration. It was written 10 years ago and I thought I’d copy and paste it here for your consideration. All information I give is what I have personally researched and learned and when I say ‘this is how it is’ it is my own personal opinion based upon experience and in no way is the absolute for other people. 



“Failure to actually have an Out-Of-Body Experience seems to be the most common ‘experience’ among the massive group of people who wish to have one. This frustrates me as much as those who fail because of the wall I run into when trying to teach them. There are many reasons why people are unsuccessful at achieving the state.

One main reason is down to the ‘wealth’ of information one can pick up online and the paragraphs of most OOBE related books in general. I see many posts on sites that say something along the lines of ‘I’ve been researching Astral Projection for ages and now I’m ready to learn how to have one’. This is like saying ‘I have been researching UFOs for ages and now I’m ready to see one’. While they had their best interest at heart because to be fair it is a great idea to research a subject before heading into it head first, this isn’t sky diving. Also, if you wish to research sky diving because you have an interest in doing it, there aren’t many sources available that would falsely profess to know about it and print blatant fabricated facts. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for OOBEs.

A common mistake that people make is a preconceived idea of what OOBES are because of the misinformation that is widely available. For instance they may have read that when they enter the Vibrational State (VS) they must call upon their spirit guide to help pull them out or protect them from danger. This may fit in with their spiritual beliefs and so if they reach the VS and call upon their  guide he/she/it may not appear… which will then have a negative effect on their sense of success.

The majority of the ‘wealth’ of knowledge that one may have aquired by trawling through the pile of information at hand, is as useful as a chocolate fireguard and should be cast off so that one can start afresh and learn from a first hand perspective. I had the advantage of self learning without any outside influences such as the internet and only a few books at hand that I mainly used as a checklist of affirmation that I wasn’t weird.

Unlearn what you think you have learned.

So let’s get rid of a few misconceptions about OOBEs that often arise through New-age belief-centricity and blatant un-truths that get thrown about due to the writings of popular so-called AP gurus.

*you need to learn how to achieve transcendental meditation and control the energy flow of your chakras.

Not true. You just need to keep your mind passively active while your body relaxes into the sleep slate or be able to slip from a lucid dream into the trance state. Chakras are an eastern philosophy that were origionally intended for use during wake induced meditation and have nothing to do with OOBEs until they were pounced upon by the New-age movement during the early part of the 1900s by the Theosophical Society and integrated into ‘astral projection’. Involving chakra opening, long meditation practice is basically a waste of precious time. If you feel better practicing these semi-religious activities in order to success then go for it… the same can be said for taking your lucky teddy-bear into exams; if it makes you feel that it will make you perform better there’s no harm… but in the grand scheme of things there’s also no point.

Transcendental Meditation is a very good method for achieving nonphysical exploration but takes patience and practice. TM can always be employed later.

*you need to learn protection so that you’re not attacked by lower astral negative entities and demons.

Rubbish. There are no lower entities or monsters waiting to attack you while you ‘leave your body’. I can attest to this because I’ve had over three thousand OOBEs over a 25 year period and I have never been attacked or harmed or indeed possessed by anyone or anything. When you enter the State you are merely consciously aware of an otherwise unconscious process you have gone through every night you’ve entered sleep since you were born.

*Your bed or body has to be facing a certain way/position.

No harm can be done by lying a certain way… if you think it will work then do it. Sleep on the floor… in the kitchen… on the sofa… with a pillow or without… on your back, front, side or head… if it’s the way you normally sleep… do it.

*You need to breath a certain way… in through the nose out through the mouth etc.

Not so… just breath as you normally do. Your breathing self regulates once you enter the state. Don’t pay any attention to your breathing.

There are three main ways to enter the ‘State’; before sleep, during REM dream sleep and upon waking from a nights sleep.

*Before sleep state induction. this requires a set up ‘pre-sleep’ that primes you biochemically and physiologically to enter the state.

*REM dream sleep induction requires a grasp of Lucid Dreaming and is a bit hit and miss for the newbie.

*Waking state induction requires the ability to recognize that you have woken up and at that very moment remembering not to move, roll over, scratch an itch or open the eyes… or even to start listening to the noises around you. It takes a bit of practice but it is a very successful way of entering the State.

There are two very different types of OOBE (and many in between) that are paradoxically the same thing. They are more focus levels than types.

* Astral Projection. This is a whole body projection into an environment that is commonly referred to in new-age writings as the Astral Realm. A strange word to use because it conjures up pre-conceived images of a starry mythical realm filled with beings of astral energy etc. However upon entering it, it’s soon realized that it is more familiar as the landscape or world you encounter when dreaming. But you have entered through the back door, and can objectively investigate and explore it without suffering from the sub-conscious imagery you are normally blinded by or the story-line you are normally wrapped up in when dreaming. Within the ‘Astral’… not even the sky is the limit. This environment, however real it seems may be considered a virtual world that is created by the projector or an actual authentic realm. Upon experiencing it, believing that it is real or fabricated matters not because it is indistinguishable from reality… even surpassing normal reality in quality and ‘reality’.

* 1st Phase OOBE. This is seemingly a projection into this reality, often referred to in new-age philosophy as an ‘ethereal projection’. It is much more difficult to achieve because of the way it is entered; during Sleep Paralysis. Apart from the fact that it takes place in this time and reality, the main difference from AP is that instead of experiencing it in body, you are seemingly a free floating point of conscious awareness. This phase can lead on to 2nd Phase which is again experienced as a free floating consciousness but is not in this reality.

Both of these different OOBEs are experienced by entering the state in varied degrees of deepness.

PRE-SLEEP INDUCTION

This method is the main one I personally use. I have used the other methods but this one when done correctly does make for a strong experience. It’s also the one I predominantly teach or rather explain. The main key to achieving it is the pre-sleep or nap. I previously posted this method but soon realized that it was too specific about hours spent in the nap and between the nap and going to to bed to enter the state. And it needed more explanation and a detailed phenomenological breakdown.

The basic goal is to prime yourself by having an hour or an hour and a half of non-dream sleep in the evening. This nap can be taken at any time after 6pm providing that you are actually tired and that you attempt to induce the state within four hours at the most after waking.

For example:

if you decide to take an hour nap at 8pm and wake at 9pm make sure you attempt induction after 10 and before 1am.
however, if you wait till after midnight then it is possible to have an hour nap, wake up for about half an hour then attempt induction. I have used this many times when it’s been impossible to get a good nap during the evening.

All you have to remember is that you nap solidly and do not under any circumstances drift back off to sleep upon waking from it, otherwise you will dream and ruin your chance for state inducement.

There is a certain way of feeling between the nap and state inducement that indicates that you are primed… the physical symptoms that indicate that you are primed for the state are among other things; itchy eyed, borderline tired and alert, slightly hypertensive or having the mild sensation that you may be coming down with a cold and a slow steady heart rate.

Two things to note:

* the nap or a non-dream pre-sleep is very important and could be considered the ‘key’ to the whole experience.

* Do not force the nap. You need to be sleepy for it to work.

The only real way to make sure you are correctly primed is to induce the state and there are many effective ways to do this.

First of all you have to lay down on a comfortable surface; a bed, a couch, a hammock, the back seat of a car, whatever you find comfortable. Any position will work. I personally lie on my back or side. It doesn’t matter whether you use a pillow or not. You can have bed covers on or not. Just make sure you are comfortable.
Close your eyes… this sounds obvious, but some people actually ask ‘do I close my eyes?’
Let your mind do its own thing for a couple of minutes… then try to quieten your mind. Don’t worry too much about this. The main thing is to lie as still as possible.

A couple of things you should not pay any attention to because they are simply a waste of thought;

*any limb or body twitches

*the phosphorescent light show your eyes give off such as blobs of light etc

*subtle localized buzzing in your muscles or fingertips

*breathing

*the position of your head

All you need to think about at this point is to become calm and stay passively conscious. To let your body relax. This should take no more than 5 to 10 minutes.

It’s at this point that you can use different methods to bring on the state.

This is the one method I have used for 25 years and really can’t comment on others. I’m sure you may have one that you usually try inducing with… but for the sake of this guide try this one.

When you feel relaxed start to think of a sound, word, song or name… think of it as though you are expecting to here it. Roll it around in your head. Imagine it in your head clearly. Alternatively you can simply imagine a voice rambling, or talking, as though talking to you. This imagined sound will start to take on a life of it’s own and may amplify.

If you are trying to do this for more than ten minutes and nothing interesting happens, you probably aren’t primed for the occasion. I only say this because the state shift is quite rapid if the pre-sleep was done correctly. I will mention that ten minutes of just simply lying still can feel like a long time.

If you are primed, when the sound increases you may feel a rush of alert relaxation washing over your body coupled with a distinct shift in conscious awareness. It’s a very difficult feeling to describe other than it is a ‘switch over’. You should feel like your awareness has took on a new spatiality. It almost feels like your head clears, like a bunged up nostril does when it clears after being blocked during a cold. You should also instinctively feel that you are in the state either because you have felt this before or that it is something new. At this point you must try to stay passive, calm and try to not get excited. A sound like you have your ears to a conch-shell should be heard. you may experience little intermittent bursts of rumbling – like the rumbling you hear when you strain your inner ear muscles when you yawn. Your limbs will feel like they have been anesthetized by Nitrous Oxide…

Here’s a quick checklist of symptoms indicating successful entrance into the state:

* a sudden rush of relaxation

* a very distinct flip/shift/switch to a spatially different state of conscious awareness.

* instinctive knowing that you are in the state.

* auditory sensations like hissing, the sound of listening to a conch-shell and intermittent bursts of rumbling.

* a tingling numbed anesthetized sensation, most noticeably in the limbs.

At the point you realize you are in the state it is time to act quickly to enter an Astral Projection. Waiting for, or encouraging full vibrational sleep paralysis will make it possible to enter a 1st phase. For now we will walk before we can run and learn how to Astrally Project.

Astral Projection

Upon instant identification of entry into the state it is necessary to employ a swift separation technique to avoid becoming embroiled in full sleep paralysis. There are a multitude of separation methods such as, rolling out, dropping through the body, imagining a magnet pulling you out, imagining you are a balloon, picking a point in space to reach, imagining being propelled out like a rocket… and many many more. The one that is most effective for the purposes of this guide and because it is my most used method so far, is the ‘climbing the rope’ technique.

You may want to place a pillow or cushion across your lower abdomen or lay with your hands on top of the bed covers before you start to relax. This ensures a soft surface so as to ease the transition of losing sensation in them. It’s up to you.

Once you feel that you have shifted into the state you will have lost the tactile sensation of your hands but still retained the sensation of their relative position.. i.e. you will still know and feel that you have hands.

What you need to do at this point is to actually reach up and grab a rope. Don’t visualize the rope… expect it to be there. Don’t worry about how it should feel just do it. I can’t stress this enough.

* Do not ‘imagine’ yourself doing it.

* Just do it.

* Don’t think about it.

* just do it.

* The movement of your phantom limbs is instinctual.

There will be a rope there… not necessarily an actual rope, made of fibers or hemp… it is simply a leverage point for you to grasp. Give no time to thinking about the rope, what it is, why it is there, how it is there or how you should move to grab it.

JUST GRAB THE ROPE BECAUSE IT IS THERE ABOVE YOU READY TO BE GRABBED.

The instant you have it pull yourself up… hand over hand… like you would if you were pulling yourself up a rope. Do it with deliberation… do it aggressively, steadily and fast. Pull yourself up the rope. Don’t even consider that you may be pulling yourself out of your physical or because of how real it seems that you must be doing it physically. Don’t pay attention to any of the sensations. If there is resistance, put some struggle into it… pull hard. Eventually and quickly you should suddenly be ‘Free’.

Failure usually takes place because of thinking too much or over analyzing what is happening. Also paying too much heed to sensations leads to considerable failure to stay in the state and out of body. These analytical thoughts should be reserved for after the experience and marked down in your journal. When you are in the state everything should be done on impulse and with deliberate action.

failure to stay within the state will transpire if:

* Too much thought is given trying to visualize the rope or analyzing what is happening.

* Thinking about how the sensations feel.

* pausing or remaining still too long – this can be as less as 5 seconds.

* Believing that this can’t be happening or the disbelief that the rope is there.

* Merely imagining movement.

Success at staying within the state will transpire if:

* you instantly acknowledge that the rope is there.

* you get on with it.

* You keep moving.

* You take it for granted that you are doing it.

Staying still and waiting for something to happen after the state shift, is the most common mistake beginners make; to no fault of their own. It is after all an amazing experience that feels more real than reality yet something they may never have experienced before. The secret is to be actively engaged yet flippant and passive throughout the experience. You may say that’s two opposites, but keep in mind that you do this when playing a video game or when engaged in sport…. you don’t think about what you are doing but you are totally absorbed in the activity. This is part of the mindset of the state.
I chose the ‘climbing the rope’ technique because it consists of one very important thing… that of ‘action’ and vigorous ‘movement’, probably the most important aspect of staying within the state and Out of Body. Constant movement and observation is the key to ‘anchoring’ yourself in the ‘Astral’… any extended lapse in movement or doubt – which normally takes the form of thoughts of your actual physical body – will cause re-physicality and an end to the experience. You can however ‘rescue’ the experience by instantly realizing you are returning to the physical by anchoring yourself in the ‘Astral’ body and Environment.When I was small (about four/five)  I went on a journey with Mum; right up until fifteen years later, I merely thought it was just a lucid dream until my Mum and I were talking about different things and she happened to mention the time when she "accidentally" took me astral travelling with her.


It's a family talent that I discovered later several of my Mums siblings can also do; in fact, on many occasions before this particular time, Mum (who was twenty-three at the time) used to go astral travelling with my nineteen-year-old Uncle P) who was, in his youth very well practised in the craft of our ancestors, and taught me a fair bit about "nature magic" as he used to call it, and the positive magnetic energy of the planet.


On this night, P was with his girlfriend and so Mum was initially alone: She told me that she felt herself slipping away from her natural state as usual, but remembered that I was laying in the bed beside her, so not wanting to leave me alone, unattended, she linked our psyches before transcending to her other state of being and it was there what I took to be a dream continued.


The first thing I noticed was the sound, it was a low toned buzzing I could not relate to, or recognise:

The nearest thing I can liken it to now (ànd even still won't be able to accurately describe it), is radio static.


I was also aware of all the colours, they were all very muted, pastels, lilacs, purples, blues and pinks, all looking not quite real, dreamy. the light around and in the colours simmered and pulled gently. 


I felt the wind, a constant chilly silent wind, which slightly made my cheeks numb and fingers tingle.


I remember Mum holding me tightly around my waist, it actually felt as if we were flying (that doesn't explain the sensations at all well though) as there were several other feelings also. 


I don't have much recollection of anything else, just waking up the next morning beside Mum and remembering the really vivid, happy dream. Geniuine question. I've seen people mentioning that you can "meet others", but... I haven't seen a story of anyone doing so. Have you had such an experience?

Edit: Thank you all for your answers. It certainly nudged me in the direction of believing that AP is more than the product of the brain. Gonna start a dream journal now lmao.\*edit, I appreciate everyone's interest. I did not expect such a massive response. Theres WAY more people interested in this stuff then I expected.

You you are reading this and are familiar with gateway, have done the whole series 1-6 and are comfortable with them, DM me and I will send you 7.  I support what TMI does, they do amazing work. They dont want this out there too much. So I'll respectfully keep it limited.

&#x200B;Hello,

This is my first post here and today something strange happened, I will get back to this later. I must warn you this is going to be a long read. It involves Astral, lucid dreaming, loss of the best friend, and the end of the cycle. I've never told these things to anyone except my wife.

&#x200B;

**My background - this should help to understand the story better**

I'm a 27 years old guy, and during my lifetime I've seen weird things. The first time I saw a ghost I was about 8 years old. I understand that this might sound strange, and this might not be the place to talk about such things, but it's part of the story.

When I was 8 years old I woke up in the middle of the night, and at the end of my bed, I saw a little girl standing. She was like a glowing figure dressed in a white dress, maybe 5-7 years old. I didn't feel any fear instead I felt very calm. I got closer to her, I just wanted to see how she looks. She had ginger hair and freckles on her face.

The next day I told this story to everyone in the house. My parents thought I'm making this up, but my grandmother seemed to be interested in what I had to say. She started asking questions - "How old was she?" I said that she was about 5-7 years old. And later she asked me if this girl had freckles on her face. I replied to her that yes, she had freckles and ginger hair. My grandmother was amazed and told me that it's Lina (girl's name). I didn't know who she was but my grandmother explained to me everything. 

It turns out I had an aunt, she died when she was 5 years old. Basically there was an accident where she got burnt very badly and passed away. 

This is only one story I have more of them. This should give you an idea that I've seen some weird stuff.   


**The friendship ended but left a strong bond**

This the part where everything starts, this is the reason why I'm writing this post. You see in 3 months it's going to be 10 years anniversary when my best friend/cousin/soul mate committed suicide. I believe we had a strong bond. I didn't see this coming but who can see it?

We had interests in similar things. I don't remember who first discovered Astral if it was me or him, but it seemed fascinating to both of us. I was maybe 16, he was older than me probably 18-19. We both tried it, but eventually, I gave up, I just couldn't do it. As I understand he didn't give up on it, in fact, he successfully managed to experience it. He never told me this, but I never asked about it either.

Even in his death letter, he mentioned that it's not "the flyers" fault. I'm still not sure what he meant by that, but it was probably addressed to his younger brother. And his brother knew about his interest in Astral, it was a kinda huge thing to both of them.  


**The first time he visited me** 

I'm a lucid dreamer and I have dreamt a lot of weird things. For example where somebody is trying to catch me because I'm bedding reality, and that entity can not be stopped by me even though I'm lucid dreaming.   


This was one of those lucid dreams. It was maybe 3 years after my friend died and I met him in my dream. I was quite surprised because I knew this is a dream and he is dead. I was amazed that I see my friend again. Even in that dream, I was thinking that my subconsciousness is playing tricks on me.   


I clearly remember what we talked about, it was a very short chat but it felt real. I was surprised that he looked so good and fresh. **This is the dialog we had:**

We are at this place and I hear stairs squeaking, somebody is coming from downstairs. Doors open up and I see it's him with a smile on his face. I just can't believe, I'm like what is going on?  


***"Hey, what's up man. How are you?"*** he said this just like the old days.   
***"Not much. How about you?"*** I replied. I was confused, I still couldn't believe that it's him.

***"I'm dead, man,"*** He said with a smile on his face.

***"Ohh"*** I didn't know what to say. I was like yeah man sorry.  
***"Nah man, all good I'm just kidding"*** He laughed, and let me know I shouldn't be so serious.

At that moment I started laughing too. It was a silly joke, just like he would say.

***"You look good, man,"*** I told him.  
***"You know, it's not often when you can show up to others. You have to look good."*** He replied to me.  
***"Yeah, interesting"*** I was still surprised that I'm seeing him.  


***"Look, man, I understand that you have to wake up early,"*** He told me this looking at me.  
***"Hm?"*** I didn't know what to say.

***"We will meet again, but not soon. Bye,"*** This was his last words.

Next thing I know I wake up 1 minute before my alarm clock starts to ring. I was surprised that this happened. I was happy that I had a chance to talk to him. It really felt like him.

**The second time he visited me (Today)**

So basically this why I'm writing this post today. I had a very similar lucid dream this night. But it had a different vibe. In this dream, I had some childhood memories at his place with other cousins, but he wasn't there with us. Until I was alone in a room and I realized that it's a dream. And then I can see him sitting on the sofa. Looking at me with his friendly look. This is how it went.  


***"Hey,"*** I said.

***"Hey"*** He nodded back.  


Since I'm lucid dreaming I start questioning myself, maybe it's my mind playing tricks on me. And I decided to ask him one question. I thought if I'll hear the right answer it might be him and not just my mind.  


***"How are you, man?"*** I asked him. I want to know his answer, I want to be sure if it's not my mind.  


He looked at me with a grin on his face. It seems like he knew what I wanted to hear. We were looking at each other and we knew what's up.  


***"I'm dead, man,"*** He answered with a grin. It's like you knew that this will be my answer.  
***"It's you I guess"*** I replied to him. I felt happy to see him again.  


***"Things are changing,"*** he told me.

***"What do you mean?"*** I asked him. Or maybe I just looked at him looking for an answer.

***"This might be the last time I'm showing up"*** He replied to me confused. It seemed like something is not right.  


And this dream started to fall apart. I was trying to hold on to it. It's like somebody was trying to interference with the whole dream. I heard my cousin saying the name in the background "Romas Kalanta". I felt very strange, I thought this is the guy who is trying to mess up our meeting. I was shouting leave me, leave us. I felt like I was fighting, and then I woke up.  


When this dream started to blur it felt like when you're listening to the radio and suddenly you start to lose radio channel, frequencies. It was very weird.   


**Deaths and other weird details.**  


My cousin committed suicide by drowning himself. he attached to himself some barbell plates, some dumbells and he jumped into the lake. It seems like a very horrible way to go...  


I don't understand why I heard him saying "[Romas Kalanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romas_Kalanta)" This guy is a very well known guy, where I'm from. In 1972 he committed suicide, he burned himself alive. He poured on gasoline and set himself on fire. it was like his protest against the USSR regime. He committed this act in Kaunas - the second-largest city in Lithuania.  


I and my cousin were from a small town. I moved to Kaunas to start my studies. And there is one very strange detail. I lived for about 2 years in Kaunas center with my cousin (brother of that cousin who committed suicide) this was about 5 years ago. This is the place where we lived.

Basically we lived right in front of that place where Romas Kalanta committed his suicide. We could see that spot from our window.  


I don't know what it has to do with my cousin, and why the last dream ended so strangely. What are your thoughts? I'm even thinking about trying Astral once more. I need some answers.Hey yall I learned a new AP technique and put a twist on it I think would help you guys. Visualize yourself in first person within a space in your mind. Manifest a door that will take you to a close friend (a specific friend). Near that friend is another door that leads to the astral. Just trust your senses. Once you're in the astral, I found it helpful to do a front flip. It really helps you focus on your astral body. Whenever I start to destabilize I do a front flip bc it engages all my senses. This technique is called bilocation bc you're in two places at once. I dont take credit for the technique itself, but the front flip is all me baby!Lot's of people have been asking me question about how to astral project, if it's safe, how it feels, so on and so forth. so i wanted to make this post to answer all the questions. I love talking about this stuff so feel free to ask anything. I've done just about everything in the astral...except died...haven't tried that yet. I'll get back to you on that lol.

Edit: since there are lots of questions about the easiest method to astral project, I've created a video that goes into great detail on how to do just that. Hopefully that helps everyone. Glad to be of service. Keep the questions coming!! 😉

AP'ing since I was 6yo

Edit: I never expected such a feedback! I'll take my time to answer all of youFor example, if the DNA of someone is modified, then they might have a new personality. If we all have souls, why does DNA determine us, since souls are who we are?I've been interested in this subject for around 8-9 years now (23m), and I've finally had my first out-of-body experience. Short, but sweet!

I tried WBTB at around 3:30am this morning, laid still on my back, and tried to project. Ended up getting a bit uncomfortable, repositioned myself, and realized my AirPods were dead that I planned to use for a guided meditation. Said whatever and I look at the clock and it is 4:40am so guess I’ll go to sleep.

Here I am laying down sideways, thinking I should get some sleep before work this morning. All of a sudden I feel a *falling* sensation as I was laying there and knew this was time. The sensation felt like I was just falling through my bed at an angled rate endlessly.

So as I was *falling,* I was starting to see some things...typical hallucinations during that hypogenic state. I’ll elaborate a little, shadow people, figurines, and things of that nature (specifically remember a hound-type shape with red eyes). Now, you must know that you can literally make them disappear with the simple intention of 'I have no fear'. Next thing you know, it’s gone.

Then I, what it felt like, physically sat up in my bed, looked at my hands/arms and I knew it was my astral body because I felt like a feather and I could see right through them. Since I was originally laying sideways with my body asleep, I knew my astral body was in a sitting up straight in the upright position. Mind you, it was still a bit dark and a little blurry as my vision isn’t as clear being one of my first times.

So to test it out I jumped and floated around and my immediate thought was “ok let’s go up!” I pass right through my bedroom wall right next to my mirror(yes my room layout was exactly the same). So I phase right through it into the bathroom. As I phased through the wall, the excitement was growing drastically. Now I'm thinking "okay let’s go up out of the house and into the sky". As I ascend further up, I get into the attic area, and as I’m getting towards the roof I feel the tug of getting pulled back towards my resting body. Time on the clock: 4:53am.

But to describe the feeling, this is 100% **NOT** a dream. After that falling sensation, I let everything happen naturally. I remember the exact feeling of looking at my hands/arms along with sensation of freely flying/floating was wild...even if it was for this short amount of time. Of course being my first memorable & successful time, I felt a little off balance trying to move/float. But nonetheless, body is vibrating & almost in shock as I typed this.

Notes for next time: “Clarity Now” for clear astral vision & of course I want to reach outside of my house. I think I got too excited of it actually happening as I went further from my body. Also, I will never forget that falling sensation, which was my trigger. Hands down the greatest feeling I have ever had, almost as if I was completely free & unbound.

Sat back after I wrote this for a few minutes & just cried tears of joy. The feeling of accomplishment & overwhelming sensory feelings that were coming to me were surreal. We are all capable of anything we set our minds to.I notice that as we get older society conditions us to believe only in the physical world so our imagination dulls over time. But you notice children can still remember their past lives, they project almost every night (i used to project into the etheric a lot as a child) have imaginary friends who some parents have found out were actually ghosts. I believe that if someone can return to this childlike state without going insane then it would be almost easy to project whenever you wanted because our minds would be like receivers without the blocks society has put in place, picking up things that are unseen.I’ve had a few AP experiences, one using hemi sync many years ago, the vibrations were so intense I thought I was seizing and it frightened me from trying hemi sync again and I took a break from it completely for years. I recently stopped smoking weed and have been having many lucid dreams, false awakenings, and sleep paralysis. I decided to start researching AP again and have learned so much more this time around thanks to you redditors, the astral club on YouTube and Michael Raduga’s videos. 
Yesterday, I introduced my husband to Astral club on YouTube and we spent the entire evening listening.
We went to bed and I set an alarm for 6 hours. I woke up, walked around for a few minutes then lied back down with strong intentions to AP. I kept telling myself not to overthink it and instead visualized it. 


My experience: 
I was dreaming that I was lying in bed watching some skateboarders on tv. I was thinking hmm wonder if you could skateboard around the astral (lol). I was like “well I could be dreaming so I guess I should try to roll out of my body” as soon as I thought it, I was rolling out to my left. It was such a funny sensation of not actually thudding on the floor, like I stopped and hovered above the floor. I couldn’t feel my body and I was like hell yeah I did it! I thought of Rick, in one of his videos he suggested rolling out and getting the hell out. I couldn’t figure out how to stand up so I started army crawling, somehow I crawled/floated over my toddler and my body (I was sleeping with him in his bed). I tried not to look at our bodies too much in fear it would cut my experience short. I continued to army crawl down my hallway, giggling, thinking I can’t believe this is happening, I can’t wait to tell Ryan (my husband). I noticed that the further I made it and the more joy I felt, the more it appeared as the sun was coming up and things started getting really vivid. I turned right into my living room and noticed the stroller sitting where it was in the physical. I got to the door and told myself, okay allie, time to stand up. As I stood, I simultaneously went out the door. I was on my front porch, still giggling and I thought, okay time to fly. I did this weird bouncing and then slowly began levitating but stopped to observe a tree that I know isn’t there in the physical. I know the astral isn’t a one to one so I took the time to take in the detail of the leaves. Still giggling I thought “hmm i wonder if since I’m giggling so much on the astral, if my physical body is giggling right now too.” Damnit though, that single thought took me back to my body, I could feel it again immediately. I woke up with so much energy when normally I am not a morning person. I’m so excited and I really hope I can do that again soon because it was incredible, even if it was mostly me army crawling through my house, haha. Yay!So a few days ago I did about 2gs of shrooms and hung out with my ex gf for the first time since we broke up. Well me and her were sitting there and catching up and right around peak trip we decided to start talking about the actual incident of our breakup. Everything was feeling chaotic and my husband and his brother came into the room in the middle of that awkward conversation and while they were moving around me and her made solid eye contact and I literally just astral projected. I looked down and saw my body and the table it was at and then I just sort of floated above myself. When it started I had been leaning back in a chair and i watched myself fall over and watched everyone rush to check on me and help me up and then i went back to my body and got up. It was an odd and short unintentional journey but still super confusing and disorienting for me      Meditation and spirituality have been a big part of my year. I began picking up meditation again and I try to meditate every day if I can. Saturday, I had become interested in astral projection and I had delved into this subreddit trying to learn more. Last night I had my first astral projection and I would like to share more about it. 
     
      On Saturday, I had begun deep meditation in hopes of achieving this state. I started attempting it at work in my free time. I would sit in my office and meditate in 50 minute intervals without moving my body at all, hoping to induce a body paralysis. It was incredibly relaxing and my body felt very fuzzy about 30 minutes in. At that point though I started to nod off and phase in and out of sleep for the rest of it. I felt very different and at peace but I didn’t seem too close to projecting. 

      Sunday, I attempted this three different time all in 50 minute intervals. When I would start to feel the vibrations, I would try to visualize a rope that I could grab and pull myself up on. It didn’t work for me. On my third attempt, I added 3 sets of Wim Hof breathing before I started and it helped me get into the vibrational state much faster. It felt very powerful and I felt like I was getting close! Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to project myself out of my body. I went home, played some video games and went to bed.

    I woke up at 7:30 a.m. because my dog, Zephyr wanted to go outside and eat. I let him outside and returned to my bed. I had read it was easier to induce astral projection after a dream state. I stayed up for 30 minutes scrolling through Twitter trying to keep my brain awake, but I kept my body relaxed in bed. After that I attempted again, however I did not do Wim Hof breathing this time. After about 40 minutes of staying completely still and ignoring my urges to move and itch, I started to have a dream. It wasn’t a very long dream, I’d say about 5 minutes and it was a very normal dream. I snapped myself out of it, but kept my body completely still. Almost instantly, I felt incredibly intense vibrations. They felt very uncomfortable and I felt them the most in my chest. I knew that this must be it. I tried to visualize the rope but it just wasn’t working. I peeked my eyes open and looked at my room and saw that I wasn’t dreaming. At that moment, I decided to give something else a shot. I started to try to lift my astral arms up and I could feel them moving, and I peeked my eyes open again and my body was completely still. I then tried to roll myself to the side onto the floor, and it started working! I could see that my body was completely still but I saw that I was slowly moving out of it. I rolled to the floor and quickly stood up and looked around and my heart started racing. I decided to take a look around my house.

      I ran to the other bedroom where I keep my instruments and it was very dark but most everything looked normal, except a few minor differences in object placement. I was so excited that I quickly ran downstairs to see more. I looked at my windows and they had tiny cracks and fractures throughout them, which was unsettling, but amazing regardless. I ran to the backdoor and stood in my yard. I saw the sky and it was purple, almost as if it was a strange version of dusk. I decided I wanted to try to fly, so I jumped and I took off into the air. I looked around my neighborhood and I was awestruck at what I was seeing. I had never even had a lucid dream before so I was so ecstatic that I was able to fly! I started to float down so I could look around and explore, but suddenly my girlfriend, who was in bed with me shifted in her sleep, instantly sending me back to my body. 

     I only got to experience what felt like a couple of minutes in this state but it was the most amazing experience I have ever had. I was shocked that I was able to pull this off after such a short amount of attempts, but I am starting to think the three hours of deep, still meditation the day prior had helped me warm up to inducing this state. I’d like to hear your comments and similar experiences with astral projection! I plan to attempt this again tomorrow morning and hopefully if I pull it off, I want to explore the astral realm a lot more! 

    Thank you for reading, I appreciate any feedback. Have a great day, and good luck with your travels! :)Has anyone met someone in the astral and then in real life?So the next time I astral project my mission is to go to the hole in Antarctica and fly straight down into the earth and see what's down there and see if there's actually a hidden world down there if anyone is interested to be updated in this journey please comment and give me your thoughts🙌I'm posting this because I see a lot of people using the CIA documents as "proof" that OBE is real, and I wanted to clear some things up.

Now don't get me wrong, OBE is real, VERY real. I have no doubt of that. But the CIA and Army never fully integrated OBE as a form of intelligence gathering into Stargate/Grillflame/Sunstreak. Joe McMoneagle speaks about exactly why in the video below.

The CIA/Army used remote viewing because they thought it was fundamentally a much better means of gathering information on a target or subject. This also goes into rumors that the military and CIA uses "astral guards" to guard Area-51, the White House, and so on. They dont do that. They don't need to because the OBE state isn't a good means of gathering information from the physical world in the first place. That doesn't mean you CANT gather real-world information from an OBE state. It just means there are other altered states of conscious that are much more efficient at gathering information. OBE is much harder to gather information than you would think. And I'm sure anyone here who can AP understands this. You can do evidential things in an OBE state, even a lucid dream state, it's just much harder than people who are inexperienced with OBE think.

The video should be timestamped at 1:06:30 where he talks about this. But I would HIGHLY recommend watching this whole video on the history of remote viewing, Stargate, how the CIA looked into lucid dreaming to gather intelligence, the existence of aliens and the reasons they obverse humans. One of my favorite interviews ever.

[https://youtu.be/s4Hw6NmxceQ?t=3990](https://youtu.be/s4Hw6NmxceQ?t=3990)I’ve been practicing the gateway experience for about a year now and have gotten to the point where I can get into focus 10 fairly easily, and have been practicing going deeper. 

Well, I think I finally managed to go deeper. While meditating my vision was completely black, and a surprisingly bright light appeared in the right periphery of my vision. I was a little startled. This was accompanied by a buzzing sound in my ear. I decided to turn my head to face the light and the buzzing turned into a voice. It was a friendly, pleasant female voice that clearly said “follow me.” I thought I had maybe lost my mind for a minute, this was absolutely a separate voice from my usual internal monologue, I had no control over it. Then the light buzzed to my left periphery and I turned my head to follow. The light then laughed and brought me upward very very quickly. Suddenly I was in a room. I could very clearly see all four walls, it was a long rectangular shaped room, the walls were kind of this translucent deep purple, and the light was there. 

As crazy as this sounds, I had a full conversation with the light. I asked if it was an angel, and it said “I guess you can call me that.” I asked its name and it laughed and said “just call me M for now.”

I asked what this place is and M said “when you know how, we can meet here anytime.” I gathered this was some sort of in-between space. 

I figured since I was talking to an angel I should ask about God, and the angel said even they don’t know much about God, but they know that they are here to guide us toward God, and that each of us has access to one of them, if we can listen. 

This is where it got a little weird and kind of scary. I asked if I could see their face and they said that I wouldn’t want to see it yet. Then I asked about the nature of reality and they said I’m far away from being able to understand even if they told me. I asked again and the angel turned my head downward and I felt like a snake was wrapping around my vision. The scales of the snake formed a grid, and the grid projected the room that I was laying in, but my eyes were still closed. I was very confused and the angel brought me back and just said I’m not ready. Then I slid back to my body and opened my eyes. 

This all felt as real as anything else I’ve ever experienced. It felt truly profound. I don’t know how you guys feel about “channeling,” but before this experience I couldn’t really understand it. Now I see how it could be possible. 

Still wrapping my head around this. Not sure if this was a full AP or not, but it feels like I must be getting very close.

Edit to add: I’ve been interested in UFOs for a long time so I thought this would be the ideal time to ask about that, so I asked M if they are real, and M said “there are many meeting rooms.” Which baffled me, and made me think maybe what we see as paranormal stuff is actually a place where different dimensions sort of collide.Hello AP’ers! 

I’ve been reading about the Munroe institute as of late and they make some pretty large claims, like the possibility of visiting the afterlife and more. I wanted to know, have any of you guys gone and what do you think? 

Is what they say true?

To be honest, if it was all 100% true, I kinda would have expected them to be more popular - but I’m not going to doubt :)

Anyways, thanks
NoahDoes smoking weed interfere with the ability to astral project?I have been trying to find a good way to astral project and when I finally did, I succeeded in the first try. I don't think I've ever done this in my entire life until now, and I was very fascinated that it worked when it happened. This is going to be kind of a small step-by-step guide on what I did to achieve this. (PS: This wasn't luck)

First, I started off by trying to find a good book to read because I never read from Reddit or watched YouTube videos because they've brought me nowhere so far. I stumbled upon a book called "The Phase." I didn't quite like the book at first, because it was simply a dry manual and I understood nothing. So, while I was still gathering knowledge, a month later YouTube became a savior and recommended me a video titled "Leave Your Body In 3 Days - Michael Raduga." There were three videos titled that way and they all lasted 2 hours each, so it was about 6 hours in total, so they had to split them in three. Suddenly, as I was watching, this guy started talking about The Phase, and then I realized this was the same guy who wrote The Phase book. Therefore, I realized the book must have been used as an instruction manual for the seminar, not a guide for astral projection, so this wasn't a regular book.

I watched the entire first video that lasted 2 hours, and Michael Raduga explained clearly and concise what you have to do. He said that it's not about how much time you try to AP, but rather, how successfully you perform it. Everything he said sounded so beautiful because he explained it so well.

**THIS IS THE VIDEO I WATCHED:**

Leave Your Body in 3 Days (1/3) - A Michael Raduga Seminar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc) 

&#x200B;

After that, I went to sleep and listened to what he said. I used the indirect method to perform AP.

&#x200B;

**Success rate of The Phase:**

 For 1-5 attempts (1-3 days) - 50% 

For 6-10 attempts (2-7 days) - 80% 

For 11-20 attempts (3-14 days) - 90% 

&#x200B;

It's already too long to read for some of you (although you came here for a reason as well) so I won't be discussing the exact method I used because this seminar will already explain it to you twenty times better than me, because as I said, this guy's concise and detailed words really explained so well.

What I recommend you to do is watch the first seminar video, and then if you don't understand something you can go ahead and check some of the first pages of The Phase and catch up with something you missed.

**Here is everything you need:**

The Phase - A Practical Guidebook:  [https://obe4u.com/files/the\_phase.pdf](https://obe4u.com/files/the_phase.pdf)I’ve been having dreams where I become aware that I’m dreaming and realize I can control my dream....so when I became aware I was dreaming I saw my brother and I was freaking out with excitement because I met my brother in my dream. He was also in shock that we were both in the same dream... him and I used to talk about astral projection because it happened to him a lot when he was in basic training for the Air Force. It started happened to me shortly after he told me about his experiences... anyways, we decided to try flying together , so I told him to hold my hand... when we locked hands we both looked at eachother in awe because of how real things felt. We began to fly; I kind of use my brain power to make myself levitate off the ground. It feels more like I’m floating than flying. Before I realized I could control my dreams I had a repeating dream where I’m in a car and hit a bump in the road... I end up airborne and instead of gravity pulling me back down I keep floating up. I used to get scared because I would get so high in the air that the houses and trees were tiny. I would eventually start coming back down and be so scared to hit the ground because I thought I would die. Now, everytime I have that dream I just try to control it instead by flying... it works for a short period of time and then I wake up. I’m so amazed by this stuff... would like to understand it moreI had a vision, or a waking dream, where I awoke in my bed, but I was not awake, my body was sleeping, and I could see a thread of light coming from my chest.

I felt fear, but chose to disband it, and love and understand it, and instead of believing I was stuck here on this planet by anything, even gravity, I used my will power to disband all thoughts, believing in myself, and allowing my heart to find the way.

Then, I flew away from the Earth, high into the heavens, breaking through the blue sky, until only stars and space were all around me. I kept following my light stream, until I was moving as fast as light itself.

There were no longer any thoughts anymore...I just was. I was living in the moment, flying through the cosmos.

Stars raced past me as I soared through the light and dark on a mission, heading toward something, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for, and that's when the fear started setting in.

My body and mind were not used to this experience, and I was confused about what was happening because I wasn't reaching anything, or any destination, I was just flying through space.

Then, after a few moments of fear and uncertainty, I realized someone was speaking to me.

At that moment, my consciousness split from my original form, and I began watching myself fly at light speed through space. That's when I saw a figure floating beside my other self. They were wearing a long white robe, and had shoulder length flowing golden hair, and they felt like a feminine energy.

Her voice was very soothing, and she told me I forgot my goal or mission when I came here to this planet, and my calling was to help people become self-sufficient, and to reconnect with nature again, to find happiness and freedom from tyranny.

That’s when I started asking questions about what was happening, and it caused me to begin losing the vision even more because I wasn't just feeling the experience anymore, and living in the present moment.

The fear and uncertainty were starting to take over, destabilizing the vision, and this is when the feminine figure turned to look at me observing, because she was realizing I was going to lose the vision, and wake up.

As I was drifting back to full consciousness, because of the fear and uncertainty, I made the conscious decision that I wanted to stay, and used my willpower again to let go of all my uncertainty and fear, which allowed me to visualize both of the pieces of myself back together as one, allowing me to stay in the vision.

When I felt my consciousness snap back together, merging the two pieces, I came upon an enormous sphere of darkness with a halo of light surrounding its form.

It was beautiful, and I could feel a deep love coming from it. A deeper love than anything I've ever felt before.

A loving presence that said through feeling, “I love you no matter what you've done in your life up to this point. I'm filled with so much love for you, so please let go of the past, and live in the present. I love you so very much, and want to see you unfold your consciousness to its limitless potential. All you have to do is believe in yourself, and let go of your fear.”

After feeling this love, and peace, and tranquility, and after hearing and feeling this message, I was blasted out of the vision with a massive gust of wind, and when I awoke, there was no pause between that moment, and the moment when I vaulted out of my bed with maximum intensity. I leapt from my bed with an energy I have never before.

My body was vibrating, and tingling, and invigorated, and I felt amazing, but not just my body, but my heart. It was as if all of my burdens were lifted, and I could see the light, and had hope for my future again.

This is my only AP Experience.. Thanks for reading!

(I have posted this once before, so if you have already read it, I do apologize. Have a wonderful day!)Tl;dr: Someone materialized into my room and took me on a carefree exploration adventure in two vivid scenes that felt astonishingly real, maybe even more so than the physical. Any thoughts on who or what that might have been? Any experiences with such friendly and divine visitors?


Eve of November 6th, 2021. I put on a guided meditation video before bed without any expectations except to wind down, as I tend to do lately, and for the first time I managed to reach a very deep state of relaxation. Then, like never before, I fell asleep (that never happened before during meditation and generally I have a hard time falling asleep). I woke up later to put the phone away and go back to sleep. I think I was having some abstract dream about a black hole that I only vaguely remember.

Soon after that, I felt something like a presence attempting to materialize next to me, possibly trying to take my hand. It was glitchy and didn't quite get through fully, as if it was trying to get through an imperceptible wall. At this point I started to scream my astral lungs out because it scared the living hell out of me. After I laid there terrified and in disbelief for a few moments, I somehow managed to fall back asleep.

Later, I felt the same presence try to materialize elsewhere in my room and I suspected it may have been the same one as before. I tried to get up and I believe I got a little help from this being, who at first seemed more like an outline, but I could feel a light physical touch as well, when offering me a helping hand. Once I was up and about, everything became clear and I saw a young looking man with short dark hair. I felt a gentle loving vibe from this being and like I knew him somehow, which made me feel instantly at ease. I think I asked if this is how he really looked like and when I got no reply, I said, "regardless, you're pretty" lol. Then he said he liked how my hair looked or something like that.

I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a mirror somewhere and it looked a lot like me, maybe with some distortions. I think we were still in my room, but it didn't look entirely like it anymore. I asked if it was him earlier when I got terrified, and he said he had a hard time getting past Jupiter or something like that? We were communicating telepathically the whole time. Next I asked if we could change the scene and he said, "certainly" or simply gave an affirmative nod. And immediately the scene did change. I was really impressed by how quickly and effortlessly that happened.

I don't recall all of the details here, but I do know it looked and felt so real, it was truly like stepping into another world in the blink of an eye. I actually had to hold back some of the excitement I felt, for fear of waking up. It was something of a spacious hall, filled with people, stalls with sweets and all kinds of things, so we went to explore the place. I suppose it was a bit like an immense indoor playground or amusement park. There was a colorful seesaw like thing, which was meant to be spinning instead of the usual up and down motion, and we decided to definitely hop in. I however may have gotten distracted by sweets. There was lots of icecream in many colors and flavors and I think I tried something pink/purple. I remember I enjoyed the taste.

Then I went and tried to pick up something else to taste, but I saw someone who was walking directly towards me and I thought they would demand I pay for the stuff. What do you pay with in the astral though? I had nothing. Instead, the person asked, "would you like me to give you a candy?"and I replied, "yes, please", so he dropped a black round candy in my hand. I ate it and could taste a pink sugary filling inside.

Not long after that, I felt everything starting to fade (should I not accept black candy from astral strangers?). I quickly tried to signal that to my companion and said, "I'm slipping." Then I faintly heard him say, like through a thick fog, "stay with me" and took my hand to ground me back into the dream. It worked and I was back, everything looking clear as before. Next, I believe he decided to change the scene again and I telepathically approved.

We promptly found ourselves entering the courtyard of a very fancy mansion, which was filled with lots of hedges and a few people. It was even more impressive and vivid than the previous scene. We looked around for a bit, then somewhere at the edge of the courtyard, there was a passage towards what looked like a very clear, transparent looking river, so we decided it would be fun to go for a swim. There were some ducks or geese on the way there and I wondered how real they are. He mentioned something about this, but I don't recall what.

The river looked cold when we approached it and decided we would fly above it instead. It was a bit challenging for me at first, but with a little concentration and... trust, there I was, beginning to fly and he was too. This is when the scene started to fade away from me again and I unfortunately woke up. It was between 3 and 4 am when I looked at the time. Despite de abrupt awakening just when things were getting really good, the whole experience felt absolutely mindblowing and seemed like it lasted a lot, more than any AP or lucid dream I had until now and clearer than ever before.

So back to the original mystery... who was that? I used to have serious doubts that these are more than in one's head, but there's no way I could've pulled that off by myself. I've had a few attempts, yet I am but a petty dabbler. I rarely ever managed to leave the room, much less alter the environment in such a skillful and effortless manner. 

In any case, whoever that may have been, I'm very grateful for the experience and I'm grateful this being didn't give up on me when that first attempt didn't work out. It made me feel genuinely happy and at ease (despite the initial shock).This world feels so fake. It feels fake because im able to feel and see and taste, hear and smell things, is there a way to make reality feel more real? Its so tiring to feel as if this world is fake, and maybe it is but who am i to say it is fake. I cant prove that its real and i cant prove that its fake either.   


The only way i feel i can prove to myself that its real is to astral project. Am i not centered with myself. This all feels so stressful. Any ideas to make me more focused on reality?Hello, so I recently started to astral project. Last night I was astral projecting, when I left my physical body I had this rope that seemed to be part of my soul and it was connected to my physical body. When I left my physical body I usually turn around and look at my body and look at my sleeping face however when I turned around I saw something there, I never ONCE in my life ever saw anything with me when I astral project. It was big and it looked like it had black sand floating around it and it would morph in weird shapes whenever it moved. It moved towards my rope and cut it. It freaked me the hell out so I ran towards my body and jumped back into it and I woke up. My stomach was hurting badly and that was where the rope was connected. I’m afraid of astral projecting now.... I also had protection like crystals and such. Wtf did I experience?This happened around fifth grade as at that time I was obsessed so much with astral travelling. I would project a few times but not often. When I projected, I went into a world, a mysterious one to say the least. Its sky is grayish blue going to silver, a soil as brown as the desert and a fog that is mostly dirt like the soil. I heard sounds I couldn't explain and I saw a giant rock. I crouched behind it and I saw beings firing from one another with objects similar to guns and the one that comes out of it are blue laser like beams. Call me insane but that's what I saw at that time.

Something from behind pulled me and I remembered this being's appearance. It asked me "How did you come here?". I only replied I don't know and he remarked that he hasn't seen someone like me before. He is between 8-10 feet tall, he is covered with slime, his arms are unnaturally long and his body composition is similar to conjoined algae. I can't explain it. He told me to go home and he lead me to a portal.

I asked what was going on and he replied that this world, the place I'm at currently, is at war. I forgot the other details but it seems they need of a greater power to conquer the place. This being told me he sensed I have immense power in me and when I asked what was it, he told me it was something dangerous and I should leave it. He didn't tell me his name but he promised he would help me if I would accidentally come back to that world again.

He said that if those people (his enemies) catch sight of me, I won't be able to go home and they would use me for nefarious purposes. Before entering the portal, I asked if I would meet him again, only for him to reply he doesn't know but he would help me always. I said goodbye to this being and then I fell. Inside the portal is darkness, I felt being pulled down by an invisible force. And what it seems to be an eternity, I woke up, my heart pounding so fast.

Though his words still echo of the "immense power I have". This sounds like a fiction movie but I swear this is real. And from that moment on, I stopped astral projecting.and I looked cute sleeping there! Wasnt creepy at all.

Highly recommend to everyone 🥰1. Look into a mirror

2. Put your arm through a wall 

3. Flying

4. Meet your spirit guide

5. Visit your dream vacation spotFor reference I’m a 17 year old girl who strongly loves the Universe and science. So like... I think I did it. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. This was my FIRST EVER TRY I kept postponing it because I wanted to get into the right headspace because I’m a bit of a pessimist and I know that other entities exist and I was just kind of fearful that I’d meet some bad ones. So I’ve been working to change that because I know that if you think it it’ll happen. But tonight... I don’t know man. I woke up at around 5:30am to go to the bathroom, then I went back to bed and I couldn’t fall asleep (because I’m facing some jet lag) so I was like you know what lets give it a try, it won’t hurt. So I remembered some of the stuff I read on this subreddit, I basically just closed my eyes, started to focus on where I wanted to go while APing and also just focused on the words Astral Project. I stopped moving in order to get to the sleep paralysis(this part was easy because I’ve tried doing it before in order to go back to the same lucid dream I was having) I feel like it took me less than 5 minutes to be paralyzed AND THEN IT HAPPENED I felt my body begin to vibrate, I’m assuming this was the vibration stage? And it was more like prickles all over my body really really fast and over and over. I also heard this slight shhhing sound over and over it was like someone was shushing me gently in my ear, I barely noticed it was there though. AND THEN I COULD FEEL MY (ASTRAL) BODY BEGIN TO FLOAT UP!!!!!!!! This was so incredible, but I got kind of scared so I just started thinking holy shit holy shit holy shit I’m not read yet lol. I think I said “holy shit” in my head like a hundred times in 1 minute. In conclusion, I’m super surprised that I even got this far so quickly and on my first try. Is this unusual??? I’ve seen a lot of people have trouble even getting to the vibrational stage, how come I was able to get to it so quickly and so easily, it’s odd now that I think about it. 
I’m definitely going to be trying this again(I really thought it was just some mumbo jumbo, but now I know it’s not) I always deeply believed in another dimension or I just always knew that there HAD to be more to this world than what we’re seeing, and I’m one step closer to seeing it for myself! 
I’m also hoping to receive some advice on how I’m supposed to actually fully get my astral body out of my physical body. What am I supposed to do after I reach the vibrational stage??? I didn’t open my eyes because I knew I wasn’t fully there yet and then I panicked so I fell back into my body. So how do I know when I’m fully there? And also once I actually make it to the astral plane what should I do first? Should I ask my guidance angels(what do you call them, sorry haha) to protect me during my stay? And then finally, how do I go to where I want to go, do I just think about the place I want to go and go there? Or do I have to float to like near earth orbit and go to the continent and country and state, because I don’t exactly know where the place is. Thank you everyone!!! This subreddit helped me discover something absolutely amazing. Sorry for the long story.I've got negative entities trying to mess with me in my dreams.  A few of them posing as family members.  So in the dream I went online and asked people what to do about it.  And they told me to project love at the entities.  So I did.  One of the entities was pretending to be my dad who has been dead for years.  So I grabbed him.  I was going to project love at him but I could sense what an evil son of a bitch he was.  I mean we're talking pure evil.  He freaked out and told me to stop.  Then I ran into another negative entity and this time projected love at it and it freaked out.  It reacted like it was being tortured.  The more love I projected to it the more freaked out it was.  So if you run into negative entities project love at them.  To them it's like sunlight to a vampire.Some of us just want to learn. Don't need to be disturbed by y'all's fantasy-making.

This is a non-fiction sub.

Please thumbs up if you're also over it.

Edit: 

1) To clear up any confusion: Title should be "Can we stop with the campfire stories?"

Meant "Ghost stories" as in "campfire stories", not "real accounts concerning what may appear to be ghosts"

I think we can all tell the difference between prose and analysis, hm?

2) Some individuals in this thread have already admitted to thinking AP/OBE fiction and behaving as such within this very sub.

3) If you've ever said, "turn back now" (as stated several times below), you are a gate-keeper, a fear-mongerers and probably a bad writer. Good luck on your sci-fi novel.



Thank you mods for revising the tag.I was very into astral projection in my teen years (not so much now for various reasons but want to get back into it) and had many great experiences with it. I traveled to beaches with rainbow sand, flew over mountains, saw the most beautiful starry night sky, and many more things. It took me about 2 months after learning about it until I had my first one.. And it was hella freaky because you dont expect to just "slip out" of your body. It was also weird in that in my projections it would kind of turn into a lucid dream near the end. 

Anyway, I feel compelled to help those struggling to get far with it. Here is what I recommend:

**Cant get the vibrations?**
---- body has to be asleep while your mind is awake (of course ppl have obe'd from waking state its just this is the most common way to do it. We don't want you to have a near death experience to experience this!) One important thing to note is that sleep paralysis is the precursor to astral projection. The reason why people will claim to suffer from sleep paralysis and night terrors is because they fight the experience too much before they get a chance to experience the magic of leaving the body. An important thing to remember is that we ALL astral project when we fall asleep we just often arent aware of it. Sometimes you will wake up and realize you are already out of your body hovering over yourself and dont have to experience the vibrations. I had this happen to me just once. To get the vibrations I find that you want to go to bed like you normally would and let yourself drift off to sleep just a little bit while still remaining semi conscious. 

**Cant get past the vibrations.**
--- this can get tricky as you may start to fidget and move as the vibrations become intense( from my experience - the chest area). What works for me is pretending to be closer to a sleep state or just totally letting whatever is going on to happen without thinking too much of it. I notice it takes 2-3 minutes before I can fully separate from my body. I will slowly start to rise up automatically. One thing that also worked for me and made it easier to get past the vibrations was if my body was reeeally tired. I parked cars during an event one day and that required a lot of repetitive arm movement my body wasnt used to. It made me super tired at the end of the day and that night I had like 6 astral projections, one after the other, because my body was tired but i was still mentally sort of awake. Passing the vibrations was really easy for me during that time because I was too exhausted to really do much or focus on the experience..

**I hear voices, noises, static, banging, think someone is watching me, something is grabbing me or holding me down during sleep paralysis.**
--- this is very common and you shouldnt worry about it. I dont know WHY we experience these sort of things, but we do. It can feel like your heart is racing super fast and that you are being pinned down. It can be creepy but what helps me is keeping my astral eyes closed until I'm fully out. Once you are fully out of your body those auditory noises and feeling of a presense should pass and then you are free to enjoy the experience.

**Welp...im out ....now what?**
--- you should notice that you feel super light and that you can hover above the ground. Flying is the preferred form of movement for some reason. At first I had zero clue that you could hover above ground...it just happened as I tried to walk. Now you are free to explore the beauty of consciousness. You may find it difficult to go through doors or walls. I find it easiest to just open a door if it is closed.

Well I dont want to make this too long. So message if you have anymore questions on something I didnt cover.Welcome to this session where we activate kundalini and expand consciousness.  

The music is tuned to 963 Hz, which is said to be the gateway to your third eye. It's a great tool if you want to activate your pineal gland and expand your consciousness. There is also some gamma brainwaves in the background that will stimulate the kundalini.  

This blend of frequencies is also a great tool you can use in your astral projection sessions. I've written some details about each frequency used below. 

**GAMMA WAVES (25Hz to 100Hz)**  

Gamma brainwaves are the fastest measurable EEG brainwaves, and have been equated to ‘heightened perception’, or a ‘peak mental state’ when there is simultaneous processing of information from different parts of the brain. 

Gamma brainwaves have been observed to be much stronger and more regularly observed in very long-term meditators including Buddhist Monks.  

Gamma brainwaves are associated with the “feeling of blessings” reported by experienced meditators, such as monks and nuns. Gamma waves are associated with peak concentration and high levels of cognitive functioning. 

**963HZ FREQUENCY**  

The 963 Hz frequency is connected with the Light, and enables direct experience with Spirit, or the non-vibrational energies of the spiritual world.  

It is associated with the Crown Chakra/Sahasrara and recognized as the Pineal Activator or ‘Third Eye’ to higher dimensions.  963Hz has long been identified as one of the ancient healing frequencies of the Solfeggio to help heal body, mind and soul. 

This frequency re-connects you with the Spirit, or the non-vibrational energies of the spiritual world. It will enable you to experience Oneness; our true nature. 

**LINK:**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kge-CvLgr98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kge-CvLgr98)my mom had passed and few years pass i became addicted to drugs.  never believed in god, or anything supernatural or spiritual.  I thought my mom was gone and that was it, mainly because my brothers beliefs influenced me.  One day, that all changed.  I loaned my friend Justin 1000$ to get this car on the road, i had just got my inheritance from my mom and i wasn't the best with money.  Because i didn't want to give it to him directly i gave it to his mom Darlene.  We talked on the phone for a bit, conversation unimportant we landed on talking about her experience with a medium she bumped into.  This medium randomly told her that she had a message for her from her late husband.  After telling me how impressed and life changing talking to her was she asked me if she could give her my number.  As skeptical as i was i agreed, seeing as how into it she was.  20 minutes after the phone call with her go by i get a call from this medium.  She told me about my moms passing and how she was looking down on me. Extremely overwhelmed,  i quickly got off the phone and called Darlene back(friends mom) and asked her if she told the medium (sarah) about my mom, and that it wasn't cool. She insisted she didn't.  I ended up calling sarah back and she told me about my brothers tinnitus, and the ring that was given to my brother after her passing which i had no idea about.  There wasn't anything she was wrong about. keep in mind i had never met her, this was over the phone, all i did was listen.  There was nothing she said that was over the internet, except my moms passing of course.  As soon as i believed, it was like i opened a door.  i started getting signs from my mom, because i was open to accepting them.
1.  listening to the radio in my car on the way to work in the morning my moms favorite song comes on, which is weird in itself because i never have my radio on soft rock. It was elton john- tiny dancer ;  as the chorus came on i heard an angelic voice come over the radio saying that this song was to let me know that the loved ones that have crossed over are letting me know that they are at peace.  i thought that it was just a coincidence or that i was just tired hearing things, but as the chorus was supposed to come on it happened for the second time.  I checked all the versions of that song there was nothing of that matter.  
2nd . The medium sarah told me that my mom was gonna reach out to me somehow through my phone.  She suspected i was going to get a phone call, but that never happened.  what did happen was, while i was playing video games, i had a thought to check my phone, as i did the screen was all weirdly green, the back ground was something i hadn't seen before all the contacts were gone.  2 minutes later it changed to a train crossing, with the big x.  i was curious what that was supposed to mean, as i did work at the railway.  the next day i got laid off.  coincidence?
3rd.  after seeing the medium, she was trying to relay a message from my mom.  she said that she sees a big tall house with black on the side and a long driveway, and to not go there.  At first i didn't realize what was meant, until i got home and as i approached my high rise apartment, i did realize that one side, the side my apartment was on, was black.  It was a in a really bad area, and i felt really bad energy.  she was trying to tell me to get out of there.  as i moved places, i ended up moving in the perfect place, right across the street from a  bike park with trails and a river.
the list goes on.  I told me aunt ( my moms sister ) about what was going on. She told me about this experience she had when she was younger, she was always told what to believe in and she wanted to know the truth for herself.  One night she said out loud that she wanted to know the truth and she was ready. following that a few weeks she had a spontaneous OBE experience.  when she returned she felt like she knew all the answers and her life was changed.
I did the same.  And got the same results.  I think that in a past life i was astral traveling a lot, either that or I'm close to the divine spiritually, and all these events led me to my true being.  Before work i had dozed off and then BOOM, i left my body so fast it felt like I was being sucked up by a mystical force.  Looked like roman candles were going off everywhere around me.  I freaked out and thought about going back to my body, i immediately found myself behind myself laying in my bed going right into my body.  as i went back to my physical body my eyes were opened and fluttering back and forth spontaneously as if i had taken MDMA or something.  that was my first experience.  if you want to know my other experiences, there are so many i will post only about a select few, not this long though.  thanks for readingHey everyone, 

**Edit: I put the drawing on imgur and added a link** 

Edit: not sure what happened with the post but I thank whoever reposted below.

**So I’ve been thinking lately about a projection from last year more and more since I’ve begun my Gateway training, and I thought I’d share. I’m an artist and I prepared a sketch of the beings (gods?) that I saw, but I am apparently unable to add attachments. Anyway, here goes:**

**I was floating in space, but there was no completely black areas. The surrounding space was dense with cosmic fluff, planets, stars, etc. soon two colossal, blue-pink worm-like creatures with the faces of smiling men (genuinely good, “I have good news” faces, not evil or threatening) appeared.**

**They seemed as large if not larger than a planet. They didn’t speak, or if they did I couldn’t hear it, but I could feel them begin to gift me some knowledge or understanding.**

**As soon as I felt like I was beginning to receive something, I was back to my body, wide awake. The return to my body wasn’t jarring, just immediate. I’d like to share the drawing, but am not sure how.**

**The only verbal thing I took from this was the nagging need to tell my wife that “I went and saw the overseers.”**

**Since then, I have tried to go back and have only once succeeded, but they were distant (still smiling) and I only caught a glimpse before waking.**

**If anyone here has seen these beings, I’m open to your interpretations and/or advice.**

Link: [the overseers](https://imgur.com/gallery/NsjKsAZ)Okay this has got to be one of the strangest experiences I've had in quite some time. This morning I woke up in sleep paralysis to this kid walking into my room. I couldn't see him very well but I was able to make out his long hair and a red shirt which had a vinyl picture on it of something I couldn't see very well, he seemed to be around 14 or 15. The reason I couldn't see him very clearly was because he was sort of faded out of reality with a broken mirror sort of effect, so I only got very quick glimpses of him standing at my bed. Anyway, this kid says something to me that felt very loud and clear but it didn't get to me upon waking up. I took it as a spirit messing with me so I asked him who he was but didn't give any response. So I then told him I was gonna send his ass to Hell if he doesn't get the fuck out of my house or tries this shit again.

That's when I woke up in a cold sweat remembering everything instantly. To ease my mind, I grabbed a drink from the fridge and later decided I'd go back to bed. As I lay back down however, I remembered this spirit looked like a kid. So I just took a moment to say that if he had a message, just bring it. Don't be so forceful because that's not gonna get us anywhere.

And so I fell into astral projection. I was on my bed yet again and felt this presence in my room but it wasn't as invasive as it had been before. He was invisible again, sort of phasing in and out of sight and I couldn't see him barley at all. This is when I told him to show himself to me. And that's what he did, he quickly faded into view almost as if walking out of a mirror. This was me but at 13, maybe 14. He still had on a red shirt like the last time but I was able to make out every aspect of what I saw. I in fact remembered this shirt, it's one I hadn't worn in years. And he had swimming shorts on that I also hadn't seen in quite some time.

I sat up perplexed as to what exactly was going on as I asked him why he was here. He just asked me a few weird questions asking me how I was doing which is a very strange question to ask given you're meeting your future self. I just sort of laughed as I asked him when he came from to which he responded to a certain day I went swimming with my cousins. And the crazy part of this is, I remember having this exact experience when I was younger. Then he asks me what's become of my life and I honestly felt horrible, it was as if I had failed him. He saw the expression on my face and just uttered "okay" in a kind of down but accepting attitude.

At this point I faded back into my physical body and woke up again but I knew this experience wasn't over, I had to at least give him advice. So I didn't move and again fell into astral projection but it wasn't as vivid as it was before. That's when I told him to just keep moving forward, I can't guarantee anything good will come out of this but you just have to keep going. I felt that he could hear me, but I knew he wouldn't remember this experience so that's what I told him. I felt him kinda disappointed that he wouldn't remember but that's the way it has to be, until now that is.

That's pretty much all I can remember out of this but it was such a strange experience. I mean I do remember seeing myself as I am now back in the time he mentioned, I remember thinking that I looked pretty cool. Hell I remember the leather jacket I have now. I'm so.. Idk this was really weird.Ive been having this nagging feeling lately that it’s really important that we spread this information about Astral Projection to our friends, family, and strangers. It is a game changer for our world. It would lead to a lot more enlightened beings and world peace. And the knowledge of this opens peoples minds to higher states of consciousness. been feeling this need to spread the idea of AP out to as many people as possible. Please help me out tooMy mom recalls a time where she rolled over in the middle of the night to see my dad’s face, but it was a terrifying “demon” face. He later confirmed that he had astral projected that night or was trying to. She has a religious background, so her fear surrounds the ability for spirits or beings to enter your body when you astral project. She feels that that may have happened, but I had the theory that what she saw was an “empty shell” or my dad’s body minus his consciousness and her brain interpreted her fear/confusion in a way that she is capable of processing. Thoughts? Have you observed a person mid-astral projection?https://youtu.be/AxcNRXiT5-cGood morning everyone, I wanted to share my experience with you. 

I have had sleep paralysis as long as I can remember and in the past 2 years I've been trying to Astral Project when I find myself in that state. Well, last night it happened. 

I fell asleep in my recliner (SP only happens when I sleep on my back). The familiar body buzz came on, which is usually when I wake up. This time I didn't...

It felt like I was spinning in circles in my recliner, then BAM, I'm floating in my living room looking at myself and wife. I knew it was go time, so I floated out the window and up. I wasn't sure where to go, so I was like let's visit a friend in PA....I live in NC. Next thing I know I was in a room and something was showing me a map. They said the Astral World doesn't work like the real world and showed me how it was broken out in sections.

Then I floated back up and it felt like I was running out of energy, which is when I think I merged back with my body. The dream after was incredibly vivid, a group of people where trying to get me back home.

Anyone have a similar experience? Thanks for listening!When we dream, DMT is the active chemical, Ayuhuasca is pure release of DMT, when we die large amounts of DMT is release in our brain. So dying and doing Ayahuasca are portals to the astral life and our dreams are just a glimpse? And does this mean the astral plane is the afterlife or just a stage in between new lives?I had an interesting realization recently.  I've been pondering this for a while but I think I have enough information to speculate about the origin of the physical wold.  I think the physical world is just another afterlife world but it has had it's frequency reduced and is more dense so it's more limited.  In most afterlife worlds we have god like abilities and can manifest anything we want.  However some afterlife worlds are more limited and have different rules.  We can override these rules and manifest things but it's more difficult.  The physical world is just the most extreme of these types of afterlife worlds.  Here overriding the rules is really difficult.  So much so that most people don't try.  But some people do and they have been able to override the rules to some extent.  So how did I come to this conclusion.  I had about seven OBEs in a row a couple days ago.  And I was in some of these more limited afterlife worlds.  Moving around was somewhat difficult and I was still able to manifest things but it was harder.  So the physical world is just a step down from this.  Here manifesting things is much harder and takes longer.  But some people are able to do it.  So this is just yet another simulated afterlife world.  Think I'm crazy?  Think about it.  In the afterlife you can die and leave your astral body.  In the physical world when you die you switch to a less dense astral body.  I had an OBE once where I was impaled by a steel beam and died.  Then I got up out of my astral body like a ghost and walked away.  In the afterlife you can do everything you can here.  You can eat, drink, and have sex.  Not to mention get drunk.  You just don't have to eat and drink if you don't want to.  So the physical world is just a much more dense simulated world.  It's very possible that it started out as a less dense afterlife world.  But it was made more dense and it's frequency lowered to where it became more limited.  I had an OBE once where I did the opposite.  I raised the frequency of an afterlife world.  It started out kind of crappy but became a paradise.  The physical world is just taking it in the other direction.  It's just one step down from the limited afterlife worlds people often find themselves in during OBEs.  So it's just another simulation.  Whether the earth is flat or round is irrelevant.  It's still just a simulation.  During OBEs I've seen planets that were flat and round.  Although they are usually round.  Since it's a simulation it doesn't matter what the shape of the planet is.  You could just as easily have a simulation where the planet is shaped like a pretzel.  I think they want people focused on the shape and size of the simulation instead of realizing it's a simulation.  So some being like us created this place.  And then we came here and got memory wiped and forgot that we or someone like us is who created this world.  Most people call that person god.  But he's no more or less god then the rest of us.  It's like you've got a game developer making a video game and to the people in the game he's god.  No he's just a game developer.  So religions worship the game developer.  An entity that the gnostics called the demiurge.  I'm pretty sure I ran into him once during an OBE.  He's some kind of weird distorted energy.  But he's no more god then anyone else.  So I hope this fills in a lot of the puzzle pieces for you.  If you think I'm crazy let me know.   It's taken me a long time to figure all this out.  But I think I understand it a lot better now.  So let me know what you think.I astral project by accident and only by accident. And the only time it happens is...in the winter! If I lay down and close my eyes when it’s cold enough in my house my body’s natural shivering will get me to the vibrational state. It used to scare the crap out of me but I’m used to it now. Anyone who’s having trouble reaching the vibrational stage: try to take nap with your window open. I know it sounds silly but it started last year and now it’s winter again and sure enough AP’d by accident yesterday when the temperature dropped unexpectedly in my town. The more ya know.Yuhh. Just had my second full successful attempt. This time I tried the Michael Raduga method for the first time and it worked way too well. Check it: 

So I woke up at about 5 AM Est (Its 7:55 now and I got back to my body about 10 min ago) this morning and decided to try to AP again. I've been attempting since myast success with no luck. All I could do was get to the vibration stage, but I thought this was weird cause in my two successful attempts (one semi-successful but I opened my eyes too early) I didn't have to go through the vibration stage. I would just get the zooming/teleporting feeling kind of out of nowhere as I was falling asleep. So before I tried to fall asleep to AP this morning, I decided to check this sub just to get in the mindset. That's when I saw this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/hq9kbk/my_third_ap_due_to_michael_raduga_methods/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I decided to try the Michael Raduga technique. And this is how it happened: 

I decide to just fall back asleep cause it'd been a while since I'd woken up and done this research. So I make it back to sleep and I have like one quick dream, and I wake back up pretty soon. I figure since I just dreamed I'm probably pretty disconnected, so I try again. I don't even open my eyes after waking up lol. I start to "look" at my hands (I don't know if they meant literally do it but I just imagine myself looking at my hands) and I can feel myself disconnecting. After about 10 seconds of "disconnecting" (it feels kind of like slowly living up out of my body) I start ZOOMING again. This is the same Zooming feeling from last two successes. I'm famiar with it now so I just chill till it's over (about 10 sec) and then I'm floating in blackness again. 

I try to get up but it's a little tougher this time so I have to roll out of bed. I "open my eyes" but it happens like really slowly as details are filled in (like pixel by pixel it was really cool). I remember to say "clairty now" and it kind of fills in. Maybe its conciousness just filling in the scene with my memeories + plus extra? I say extra cause I looked back at my body this time and everything was same except my comforter was a different color? 

I go to the bathroom and check myself and it's pretty normal except I look darker in a weird way. Like my skin looks kind of holographic and the shades are uneven. I'll look more next time and maybe splash myself with water and see how that feels. I was just too excited to get outside

I open my door and run upstairs to the front door. I remember I'm supposed to be able to go through doors. I also remember a tip I read, so I just run straight at it, quickly turn my back around, and kind of fall through the door lmao. Turning your back kind of helps with the doubt of moving through a door.

I'm now outside and it's time to fucking fly. I get a running start, jump, and I keep going!!! Crazzzyyy it feels just as freeing as you'd think (the whole world feels pretty freeing honestly though). It only last a few seconds and I do a couple loops before I start sinking I guess? Idk it's like I couldn't keep it up. So I slowly sink to the ground, then I try again. I guess maybe I was doubting too much cause it was harder, but I was able to muster enough to jump onto my roof. I sit on the roof and enjoy the view for a bit. We have some nice trees around. I had some plans I was about to get to but I feel myself returning and I wasnt quick enough to remember the restabilization techniques. The return is again pretty seamless, but you just kind of feel yourself losing control. 

I wake up in my bed and this time I actually feel kinda lethargic. I got up to move around and it goes away quickly though and I feel pretty good now. Exicted to try again tonight. Hopefully doing it earlier in the morning (like 5 before the sun is up) will help give me a longer time.-- EDIT: This A.M.A. is closed. Thanks all for your questions! --

Hello fellow practitioners! As the title says, I have been projecting for years and you can ask me anything, so long as it is related to astral projection and lucid dreaming (off-topic questions won't be answered). 

A bit about myself, for newcomers: I am part of the staff both of this sub and its discord server (Astral Lounge). I am the author of the astral projection book [The Illusion of Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pc3ipt/my_ap_book_the_illusion_of_method_is_available_on/), a book focused on overcoming the need for methods. I also have done other A.M.A.s in the past, being this the third one! Here are the links to  [The first A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/nvs4mh/feel_free_to_ask_me_about_ap/) and the [second A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pnicd8/i_have_been_projecting_for_years_ask_me_anything/), should you want to take a look at them. :)

I will answer questions during the following 48 hours; after that time I will close the comments. But worry not! If you miss the chance to write a question, I plan to do more A.M.A.s in the future!

All that being said, feel free to ask! \^\^I haven't been able to AP for weeks now, but it happened many times before, so I am not that worried. 

For those who don't know, there was a redditor called /u/throawaylien who claimed to be abducted by aliens multiple times. He said that his abductors (possibly The Greys) are leaving Earth and another species from the Galactic Federation will be taking their place and studying us. This was supposed to happen on the 18th of July, and, at least originally, the Aliens were supposed to make an open contact with us (although TAA later said something in these plans changed).

As you can clearly tell, at first glance nothing happened on the 18th, however , to many people some interesting things did in fact happen.

* Just as July 18th started, something massive was detected apparently entering our atmosphere by separate meteor radars. At least three strange readings have been reported, similar to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dQOHJiJztU). Some people explain this as a natural occurence known as Sporadic E, however others notice the strange timing, as well as the fact that it doesn't happen very often, let alone 3 times in a row. It has also never happened again so far after the 18th.

* There have been some weird thunderstorms all around the world. Many people report both thunder and lightning as seemingly unnatural, and making their windows (and sometimes entire buildings) shake. There have been also many reports of strange orbs of lights and other types of ufos accompanying these thunderstorms. 

* There is also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJNjxghLNEA) recording. made from a plane, also on July 18th, supposedly showing 2 large UFOs hiding in the clouds during a thunderstorm.

There has been also a lot of smaller reports.

Some people claim nothing happened, some say it did, and for whatever reason it was hidden from the public. Figured that even if the second possibility is true, even if we have been misled, there is a possibility someone saw something unusual happening in the Astral plane.When i started to read about AP i could find any technique that would work for me. I tried for weeks with no result. (Except Michael Raduga's method) I personally find extremely difficult to AP from meditation or before bed. If you are like me, this may help.

1-You may want to add more magnesium to your diet for me it made more vivid dreams an more general awareness/ better brain functionality (I have ADHD, no meds)

2-Set your alarm a couple of hours before your waking hour.

3-Read something, solve some sudokus, whatever you enjoy.

4-Back to bed.

5-You should be able to get conscious in your dream, once you notice you are in a dream focus on some object, whatever it is until you feel the dream more stable.

6-SCREAM literally, scream in your dream that you want to switch to astral projection.

7-You may feel that you have entered a tunnel and that you have been thrown in your bed.

8-Sit up as fast as possible.

9-Relax, breathe. Try to see (use your will). You may find it difficult to see in your first experiences, but you'll get better.

10-Probably you'll see your room very similar as it is, from this point your journey has started.


Hope this helps, take care 💖[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LVwcHQ-WKDIrl8KTNqrJIs4pbE-kdFeI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LVwcHQ-WKDIrl8KTNqrJIs4pbE-kdFeI)

you guys have helped me so much with astral travel and everything astral i just wanted to say thank you and for anyone new here are all bob monroe tapesWasn’t really sure where to post this .

My mom passed away two years ago and her birthday was on May 16 so I’ve been think about her a lot lately.  The other night, two nights before my sister’s birthday, as I was going to sleep I heard her say ”take my hand and I’ll give you a tour of heaven”.  I felt myself start traveling through a star field and then nothing. I am assuming I fell asleep or don’t remember my tour.  It seemed so real at the time.

The next night I had a very vivid dream that I was in a sort of outdoor Port Authority type place with lots of hustle and bustle and my mom was there and I was walking with her.  I became self aware and gave her a hug and then the dream ended.  

To put things in context, this week there is a lot of birthdays in my family and my daughter is graduating high school and is hitting a lot of milestones.

I’ve been reading this sub a lot as well as the NDE and afterlife ones.  

I’m not saying I astral projected but these experiences felt as real as anything when I am awake.

EDIT*** Thanks for the award and all the upvotes.  I appreciate it!There have been some posts about people encountering black holes, but never what happens when someone travels into one. I can't project (yet), but if you can, I challenge you to try. Tell us what happens!(Hope I'm using the right flair) First off, I had no intention of projecting last night, but here's some stuff that led to it...

Yesterday I was talking to a friend about how I hadn't AP'd or experienced anything paranormal for a while now, and I was getting bored. I also purchased a Bismuth crystal online yesterday (which obviously hasn't arrived yet), and I think those two things led to this happening. I was awake around 3am, and I figured I'd attempt to Lucid Dream as I often do using WBTB. I ended up inducing Sleep Paralysis which I thought, no problem, I'll use it to induce a LD but the next thing I know I'm being pulled out of my body by some unfamiliar entity (this is normal for me when I get SP or successfully AP).

Anyway, it grabs me by the legs and pulls me away from my bed. I get up, look around, realise I'm in the Astral. This has happened so often now that I'm not scared or anything like that, if anything, I was more annoyed because I really wanted to LD about something specific, and had no intentions currently of APing. So I get back on my bed to get away from this thing but it follows me and pins me down.

Now it gets kind of NSFW. I'm pinned by my wrists and I feel a weird electric shock go through my hands, feet and left side of my ribcage (this is something I haven't experienced before). My first reaction was to ask if this thing intended to rape me (it was my first thought because yesterday I'd been browsing reddit and seen a lot of posts for some reason about entities raping people during SP or in the astral. Although I've never experienced it myself).

It shook his head and said "No. Unless you want me to." Its voice was really kind of low and menacing. It had an unusually wide, unnerving grin on its face and red eyes, and the skin on it's hand was kind of grey-ish, but other than that looked pretty much human.

So I replied no, and started chanting to myself "I'm going to lucid dream, I'm in \[place I wanted to dream about\]" and he interrupts me and says "I don't care what your religious beliefs are. I don't care what God you pray to. Your prayers mean nothing to me." So I roll my eyes and tell him "I wasn't praying, I was trying to lucid dream."

He looked furious, I guess because he was trying to scare me and it didn't work. But then it's fist kind of sank into my stomach and caused an agonizing pain and I suddenly snapped back into my body and woke up. The pain disappeared after a few seconds.

Honestly it was more annoying than anything else. I've learned not to be scared of these creatures, because that's what they want. All they want is to feed on your fear. But they can still cause a very real feeling pain if they want to...

FYI: I don't consider myself as belonging to any specific religion and I don't pray, so I don't know why he was telling me that.

TL;DR: Dragged into the astral by an entity that pinned me down and told me it didn't care for my religion, my God or my prayers, and then caused me physical pain.Since they took their own life does that mean they'll be a low vibrational entity or something? Im just curious since in most religions taking your own life will result in horrible consequences. Sorry if this seems like a stupid question ^-^;7 years ago, I AP'ed to this warehouse and met this guy with short, brown hair. He was 15 at the time. He enjoyed talking about the warehouse and the people who would come to visit him at the warehouse. Although this warehouse appears normal on the outside, the inside looks like a pale pink mansion! Connected to the warehouse was a special restaurant where people who eventually found it (there are a lot of stairs and hallways in this warehouse) got to eat and talk with others!

I don't know why I haven't been able to visit him and the warehouse with the restaurant again, but I'm glad I finally reunited with him! His hair looks slightly longer and wavy. Unfortunately, the restaurant recently became closed off to the public due to a recent threat. However, I was still able to go in as well as look around the spectacular warehouse. Right before I had to leave, he said, "Come again soon!" Have you all ever been to this place. If not, I believe you all will love it!Ok, so there’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s start at the beginning: my earliest memories are out of body experiences, a lot of watching myself from far above playing with family and friends. These experiences were random and unpredictable but always enjoyable. 

When I was around 6 or 7 I learned to control them. I would sit on the floor cross legged, in direct sunlight or in light coming through a glass window, and I would just “meditate”, although I didn’t know what meditation was at the time. My eyes would be almost closed/squinting, only letting in enough light to see my surroundings, namely the ground in front of me. I would clear my head almost instantly and feel a rising sensation inside my chest like I was in an elevator going up, and then the ground would appear farther and farther away until I was up at the ceiling looking down at the whole room. The sensation was one of both excited awe and complete serene relaxation. 

I got better and better at it over the next few years. I started doing it outside, and would rise to the tops of trees. If I were to look down and see myself sitting directly below me, I would start falling back into my body. But if I didn’t, I could look around a full 360 degrees, and I could see everything that you could actually see from that height, the roof of our house, neighbors in their backyard, a car passing, etc. all from an aerial view. 

I always felt - or, rather, I KNEW - that I could go further than that. I knew that I could break the “y axis” (for lack of a better word) I always stuck to, and “fly” right, left, even higher into the clouds - but I never did because although it was definitely relaxing, and desirable, it never felt SAFE. I always felt as if I was on the edge of losing connection with my body altogether, and that if I stayed up there too long, I might get stuck up there - and if I broke my tether to the vertical y-axis and went beyond, I would never get back. 

I remember asking my mom about it at one point and she just said something like “kids have a very active imagination - enjoy it while it lasts”. So while I was doing this I knew that it was something no one would believe. I knew that it was impossible, even though it was very real to me, and I worried about people thinking I was crazy, or even worse - that they would make me stop. I recognized it for what it was - a superpower that had to be hidden if I wanted to continue doing it. 

Until it faded. After my 10th birthday, I noticed I couldn’t climb as high, or I couldn’t look around 360 degrees anymore. Pretty soon I could only get to the ceiling of whatever room I was in. The height kept getting shorter, and soon I could barely get a few feet above my head. By the time I was 11 I could only get the “rising elevator” feeling. By 12, it was gone completely. I was devastated. At the time, I felt like I had lost a part of myself, a defining characteristic, my identity. 

I didn’t tell many people about it, just some close friends, maybe a couple girlfriends over the years. I was worried about being called crazy (and not growing up with any religion or spiritual beliefs, i had no way to put my experiences in that context - I only saw it as “magic”). But a few years ago, I told my dad this whole story. 

He told me: he had the EXACT same experience. He had it randomly as a little kid, learned to harness it, control it, same meditation technique, sitting in the sunlight, same limitations in movement, same fear of getting stuck - only his faded when he was 12 or 13. He felt the same way I did - that this superpower, something that was so special to him, was gone. He said he always figured he grew out of it as soon as his body started to go through puberty. 

This is not the purpose of my post, but there is definitely a lot to unpack here, such as: Are astral projection powers genetic? Did my father and I share in the same experience across time and space? Are we currently sharing- or did we once share - the same consciousness? My father is not a very spiritual person, despite his experiences - his attitude is: I don’t know, I’ll probably never know, and that’s okay. 

But I have become more in touch with my spirituality in recent years. My OBE experiences really showed me definitive proof that there is more to reality and life than we really know or understand. I am grateful to have had such an experience. 

But I want to have it again, and I have tried to recreate the experience my whole life. Recently, I’ve gotten really into meditation- I do it every day, which I find very helpful in managing stress - but I can’t even get the rising elevator feeling. When I was younger I experimented a lot with drugs to try and get back there, namely psychedelics. But I’ve done it all (btw - drugs are bad, nearly killed me, I’ve been clean for 7 years), and nothing ever came close to my original experience. 

I guess my questions are: 
Has anyone had a similar experience to the one my father and I had?
Or anyone know of someone who has?
Do other people, as little kids or grownups, control this power as my father and I did, meditating in sunlight?
Are there any tips on how to achieve this “superpower” again? 

I should mention that I have tried several of the methods posted on this sub - and while they have been illuminating in other ways (my mind palace has never been so pristine), I have been unable to reach the OBE state. I should also mention that my childhood experiences NEVER took place while I was in between sleep and waking states, and never lying in bed - it was always during the day, sitting upright, and never following or followed by sleep. 

The thing is, I KNOW what I’m looking for- the feeling of leaving my body, that internal rising elevator feeling - and nothing I have tried gets me to that feeling. I have recreated the exact conditions that used to work, to no avail. I know it is possible and I know that it is real, but it’s been 23 years since my “powers” faded and I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever get them back. 

I’ve tried everything... except asking for help online. So here I am, asking for advice. What do you all think?

Edit: I’m amazed at all the feedback and support! I avoided looking at it for almost a day out of shame I guess. Of course I know it’s nothing to be ashamed of, but there’s this almost innate embarrassment that comes with sharing something that’s always felt like a deeply personal secret. 

I’m making my way through the comments and will start answering as I go. 

Thanks everyoneHello all! I am here to report my progress throughout the year from simply keeping a dream journal. It not only helps with lucid dreaming, but projecting as well, from my experience, as you will see. I recorded the number of lucid dreams and astral projections I had for each month of this year.

2020

January: 1 LD (first ever, at least to be remembered) | 0 AP

February: 0 LD | 0 AP

March: 1 LD | 0 AP

April: 2 LD | 0 AP

May: 2 LD | 0 AP

June: 1 LD | 1 AP

July: 3 LD | 0 AP

August: 4 LD | 0 AP

September: 5 LD | 0 AP

October: 3 LD | 5 AP

November: 5 LD | 1 AP

December: 5 LD | 2 AP

Total: 32 LD | 9 AP  


These numbers are from simply keeping a dream journal. I do meditate (increases ones awareness) but rarely perform reality checks. Remaining consistent in dream journaling keeps the subject in your mind at nearly all hours of the day, boosting your chances of awareness in a dream, which in turn can be turned into a projection. So, if you haven't yet, keep a journal and keep going with other practices, such as reality checks, meditation, and mantras (before falling asleep).   


Happy New Years!I used to have a good friend who claimed he could astral project at will, he later confirmed it to me by showing up in my bathroom and I could feel/see his energy. He looked like a heatwave. It was super weird.
He never needed to get his body into a state of rest, he could just sit in a chair, close his eyes and do it. 

There was even one time where we were out and about during a full moon and he kept saying the full moon always “pulls” his consciousness out of body without his control. 

He said it was something natural to him, but I wanted to know if there’s anyone in this subreddit who knows how to astral project at will and would like to share their experience as well as what tips you have for honing this ability. 

I can already astral project in a deeply relaxed state. It would just be very cool to have more control over it.Hello. So I haved used acid and DXM in excess in the past following years. While also using meth (separately from other drugs, no combos), and battling a meth addiction. But my first AP experience was on meth actually where i guess my body was so tired that it fell asleep and my mind stayed awake thus causing me to fly out of my body. Orginally, I assumed I died of an overdose and I was just dead.

I started to move around my house very quickly. Like super sonic speed and I saw myself laying there on the floor in third person. I didn't have a train of thought. Just a conciousness existing. It was like I didnt have eye balls. I was the universe experiencing itself. Then I realized WE ARE THE UNIVERSE EXPERIENCING ITSELF.  And this blew my fucking mind.

This has happened to me every night sober now, and but whem Im tripping, I enter this new realm of existence. A non human form of existence. Astral projection has lead me to believe there is an after life. But I'm not convinced there is a god. But there is existence after the physical form of who we are perish.

I have no idea if its eternal afterlife, because Ive always been technically alive when I leave my physical form. But to able to leave your brain, or have a sense that you've disconnected with what you once called reality, points toward how powerful we humans really are. 

1000 years from now, we will evolve. And to be able to actually achieve such a unique ability now, convinces me the future holds more than what we could honestly put our imagination too. We are helping create a future for a fellow man.

Existence is not a worthless experience. We have so much to gain from it. To anyone feeling suicidal, just know you are needed very much to achieve such a positive goal by being here with us.

Evolution and genetics are passed down by our life. And that means death is not an end state. Its a beginning state for the next form of existence.This is coming from someone who has lucid dreamed naturally multiple times a week for most of their life. 22m

For the past month or so I’ve consciously begun to put more of an effort into astral projecting. I was sure I was already doing it on some level, and actually still believe that now. Lucid dreaming and ‘regular’ dreaming are different forms of astral travel and that’s something most people don’t say. Accepting that belief helped make it easier to finally astral project. 

I also 100% used to astral project as a young kid and had bad experiences, which in part lead me to stop doing so. 

I’ve always played with the energetic body in that state of being lucid and aware, but not really moving. This time I just told myself, “Ok now is the time, I just need to rise up” or something just like that. Feeling the energetic body, I simply rolled off myself, which I normally don’t do. It also helped that I was on my back when I’m usually on my side or stomach and side. Will continue to experiment. 

It’s pretty insane how easy it was. All I did was get up and out of bed. Took a moment to truly innerstand and observe the experience, and almost forcibly woke myself up, just to experience the waking up process before going out. 

I was surprised at how ‘real’ the energetic body felt once separated from what was the physical. That’s what made everything very clear. I’ve had many similar lucid dreaming experiences without that ‘real ness’ and lightness of the astral, which was the key that made it obvious.After years of dealing with horrific sleep paralysis (5 nights a week) that drove me to drinking myself into a coma every night, I eventually mastered leaving my body.
I've gotten so good at it I can do it every day (I've been doing it on purpose, daily for 5 - 6 years now) 
Yesterday was the first time I almost projected without going to bed or interrupting my sleep cycle. I literally just blinked and felt the vibration of sleep paralysis hit. 
That's when it struck me that I had never checked to see if there was a subreddit. 
I've been all over places that I can't explain. Met people. Formed relationships. Flew. Glided under water. Inspected the most minute details of what I was looking at. 
It still shocks me every morning (typically when I project). 
Can't really tell people about it bc they think I'm a crazy person.We know this question comes up a lot around privacy, "What can they see me doing?"

To put concerns and worry to bed (or to fully wake them up), what is the most personal or private thing you've witnessed someone else doing while you astral projected?

*No fake stories for drama please.*So, I discovered AP about a month ago, it seemed like something very interesting for me but I wasn't 100% sure I wanted to try it,  3 days ago I fully convinced myself that i wanted to do it do I start to do research, I saw the videos of the seminary (learn to leave your body in 3 days) that are in the beginners manifesto of this sub. I need to say it's really effective the first night I tried I just induced myself sleep paralysis, I got scared and stop trying for that night. Second night I got nothing. Third night I was really sure I wanted to do it so I convince myself that I was going to be successful, well, I made it. I reached the vibration stage and then suddenly I was out of my body. 

My recommendations are, I think it works the most if you are really sure that you want to do it not hesitating so much.
Stop asking so much for testimonies and strat trying for yourself, so you can experience it. Watch the videos of the seminary that I mention above. 

Links of the vids of the seminar:

[1](https://youtu.be/YQjAIlFZWWc )
[2](https://youtu.be/9Dj9gTiLHf8)
[3](https://youtu.be/7BMnGi8yxTQ)I just had a very strange experience. So my apartment is very old (built in 1914 or something like that). I’ve noticed ever since I’ve moved here I’ve been having more OBEs than ever before. Last night I had a very strange dream, I won’t go into details because it’s not important,  but anyway when I woke up, I sat up and got out of bed. I didn’t bother turning around and looking at my body because I just assumed I was awake. My 6 month old black cat followed me and I walked down the hall into my living room. The light coming in from the front windows was super bright and I remember my eyes hadn’t adjusted so I was squinting. Then all of a sudden I felt this really ominous feeling behind me, like I was being watched so I turned around and looked down the hall. The door to my bedroom was open and right inside I have this mirror that faces the door way, and I see this shadow figure walk across it. 

At the same time, I hear this fucking weird sound. It almost sounds like a witch cackle but not exactly. I don’t really know how else to describe it. 

Right after that I actually woke up. My cat was laying right next to me and she’s just staring at me. 

Is it possible my cat astral projected with me? I’ve always heard cats are spiritual guardians but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar to this? She was staring at me in a way that kinda said “yeah I knew what just went down”.Much of philosophy boils down to logic and what can be proved. If there is any basis to this, then we can almost instantly disprove reality as we know it.

One question - have you ever been completely convinced that a dream was real while you were dreaming?

If the answer is yes, then how can you definitively say that this waking world is not some other version of reality?

To continue this, if you really want to argue that a dream is "different" and therefore - not real, then this means that our mind has the capability to create entire worlds (our dreams). These worlds can appear full and can include seemingly real people who talk and produce original ideas. So, if our mind is able to generate these incredibly complex computational tasks, then how do you also know that it's not happening at this moment - while awake?

And finally, even if none of this is true, isn't it at least worth a little bit of funding to research? It seems like if we can create amazing technology from better understood forces of nature, then it seems reasonable to believe consciousness could be harnessed in some similar way.

---
I write about consciousness and reality - http://TheDelusionalWriter.com. I also recently published a novel (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094HM8NXW) that's meant to bridge the gap between the ideas above and the way people typically experience life.I spent last 3 months reporting on the CIA's investigation into astral projection. It resulted in [two articles](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9qag/how-to-escape-the-confines-of-time-and-space-according-to-the-cia) and a [work of visual art](https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/07/02/the-gateway-nft-a-story-about-the-cia-astral-projection-and-stepping-into-the-4th-dimension/) that I released today. Thought the community here might find it interesting!I've been seeing a lot of posts on what these whispers are, a lot of misinformed people who have never astral projected before are talking about what these whispers are.

If you don't know, you can sometimes hear whispers just before you start astral projecting.

First of all, I'd like to say that there is a difference between messages in the astral dimension and the hypnogogic/vibrational/paralysis state. I think this is where the misconception and misunderstanding lies.

just before you astral project, you hear whispers, music, chanting, and a whole bunch of other things. I made some sound files of what you may hear [here](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526) if you want to know what you may hear, they're based on my personal experience.

These random sounds that you hear are mostly NOT MYSTICAL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!

I have had these many times, and at one point I decided to see If I could control them, and guess what... I did!

however, once you have astral projected is another story, there you may receive messages through visions, sounds, feelings, etc.

You may think that you have not astral projected yet because you have not gotten up yet, but you actually have! that is where you get these messages, only after the vibrational state.

So long story short, please stop scaring people and telling them that the sounds they hear before astral projecting are messages, they are not messages 99% of time time, and when they are it is because the person has astral projected, but not gotten up.

Anyway, I wish you well on you all well on your journey!I decided to attempt AP again as I was kind of tired and ready for a nap around noon. As I lay down, I got really comfortable, the most comfortable I’ve ever been in a long time, it was weird but nice. After what felt like 10 minutes, boom, my ears start ringing, my face feels like it’s being pulled down, almost like a really tight mask thats being pulled off me. Next thing I know, I  am dropping down out of my body, and I felt like I landed in some water and then I woke up. So i tried again, and literally 5 seconds in, my face felt like it was being pulled down again. Now this time, i open my eyes, and I see part of my physical head next to me!!! just part of it. I woke up 2 more times and the same thing happened. I’m really close to leaving my physical body!


[[EDIT]] TY FOR ALL THE UPVOTES!!!! never thought id get so much for sharing a story lol!Last night my body was falling asleep, but it was the beginning of it, when your brain makes you itchy to see if you're still awake. I felt an itch, just below my right nostril, and it was strong. I thought it was a trick, and my brain was just trying really hard to make me itch, so I did my best to ignore it. 

Yeah it was a spider. I have a bite exactly where the itch was. I'm proud of my discipline since I didn't give in to the itch, but next time I feel one that strong you better believe I'm scratching it.

On the bright side, I've been sleeping better and feeling more calm and grounded since starting to AP again. Still only getting to the hypnagogia/vibration state with a feeling of upwards movement, but hopefully I'll see y'all on the astral plane soon.Lower Astral Dangers & Defense

Without a doubt, the number one question and fear that preys on the mind of potential Astral Projectors is, “What dangers will I encounter on the Lower Astral?” With my 57 years of Astral Projection experience I’ve gained a few insights you might find useful.

I touch on this topic in one of my early videos, but I’ve had requests to discuss this topic more in depth. So, here I go…
Whenever I discuss the Astral I like to use Physical comparisons, because I believe the old occult saying, “As above, so below” is a very true statement. I suspect most Redditors and Astral Club members https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE have visited large cities before like Chicago, LA, London, Paris, Berlin, Shanghai, etc. My personal favorite is New York City due to its amazing museums, shopping, and theater district. 

When touring NYC if you know what’s good for you you’ll try to blend in. You won’t walk around holding a map or staring at you phone’s navigation screen. You won’t dress in a ball cap, Bermuda shorts, and wear an “I Love New York” t-shirt. You won’t laugh or smile excessively, and you’ll wear a slightly annoyed expression while you’re walking around. Why? Because you want to blend in. You don’t want to stand out as an out-of-towner tourist ripe for the picking. If you don’t take this advice, expect to be accosted at best by every corner street vendor selling “real” Nike sneakers and “genuine” multi-thousand dollar handbags for only $40! At worst, you may find your wallet missing, your wife’s purse stolen, or even be accosted in a physical attack. 

Another good strategy for staying safe in the physical world is to avoid bad neighborhoods. Driving around in bad neighborhoods looking for trouble will often net you precisely what you seek – trouble! Folks who cruise high crime areas looking for drugs or women set themselves up as easy targets for unscrupulous denizens of those areas. Even honorable people wishing to help the downtrodden residents may experience attacks by the desperate and violent criminals.

The Lower Astral has much in common with the seedier parts of major cities, albeit in slightly different forms or guises.

Let’s review some of the fauna of the Lower Astral planes:

•	Mindless Ghosts in the Shell (shout out to Japanese manga lovers). 
When the physical body dies the Astral body leaves. However, the Astral body itself begins decaying almost immediately. Advanced souls abandon their Astral forms to proceed to the next major level. Less advanced souls take longer to do the same. This process leaves a vacated Astral shell that may appear animate for some time, though no intelligence remains. I suspect many of the “ghosts” people see going through repetitive tasks over and over are evidence of these discarded Astral forms. Eventually these Astral shadows decay at varying speeds until they finally fully disintegrate.

Bottom Line: They are no danger to the Astral traveler, and will most probably ignore your presence entirely.

•	Imps, Elementals, Nature Spirits

These creatures have evolved on a separate path from humans. They are not hostile or negative in nature. Islamic lore and ancient Classical writing reference these creatures. Imps and nature spirits tend to have low intelligence, but inhabit areas where nature is abundant and thriving. They act as its guardians. 

One time I was walking in the Astral in the wooded area behind my house as a child when an imp just hopped on my shoulder for a ride. It was annoyed and surprised when I brushed it off, as I believe it was used to catching rides from either unaware physical beings or sleepwalking Astral Projectors.

Elementals can be found in forest fires soaking up energy, as wind elementals thriving in the swirling currents of storms, tornados, hurricanes, and the like.

Bottom line: If you don’t mess with them or their home turf, they won’t bother you.


•	Earthbound Human Spirits 

Spirits of very violent, drug, alcohol, and sex-addicted people who died but refused to turn away from the Physical Plane to progress can remain stranded in their own private Hell in the Lower Astral Planes for some time.

My predominant reaction to these types is pity. As a rule they’re angry, depressed, lost, confused, envious, and devastated by their current predicament. They want to fight, but their blows don’t bother their physical enemies. They want to get drunk, high, or have sex with their physical acquaintances, but everyone they knew now ignores them and their favorite poisons of choice are beyond their reach. Some may be unaware that they’ve even passed on.

Many times they will ignore your presence as they might guiding entities offering them assistance. Other times they may attack as a way to express their anger and frustration at their present predicament.

Bottom Line: They may launch an attack if you’re in the sphere they consider their own (bars, corner hang-outs, sex clubs, their home, etc.). Normally, they won’t leave their comfort zones. If they were the curious, wondering type, they probably wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place.

•	Shadows, Demons, Astral Parasites

These entities are relatively rare on the Lower Astral. They are inhuman intelligences who thrive on negative energies of fear and hate. They are repelled by love, joy, and positive emotions. If you wonder about the Lower Astral long enough in a state of fear, depression, hate or envy and you may eventually pull these entities towards you like flies to…sugar!

Bottom Line: May attack or leech energy from vulnerable Astral Projectors.



•	Astral Projection Threat Mitigation Strategies

1.	Avoid
2.	Evade
3.	Retreat
4.	Fight / Call 911

During my military survival training the above strategies were stressed to deal with enemy threats when shot down or stranded in hostile territory. They work well when dealing with Astral threats as well.

1.	Avoid
Until a recent adventure in Eastern State Prison that I described on my Astral Club Youtube Channel https://youtu.be/mQ8xczNyDMg , in many hundreds of AP’s I hadn’t encountered any Lower Astral threats in a very long time! Why? Because the second I leave my house I think loving, joyous thoughts to raise my vibratory level, pick a spot in the sky, and WILL myself there. Once flying at this higher Astral vibratory level I am beyond the reach of the vast majority of Lower Astral threats. Easy peazy!

2.	Evade
If you attract unwanted Astral attention you can quite often get away by fleeing elsewhere. Launch yourself into the sky or WILL yourself to another time or plane. I’ve used this strategy several times to shake pursuers. Robert Monroe in his series of Astral Projection books mentions a game of follow the leader played by advanced entities where the leader shifts in time/space/dimension and you must follow his energy signature to keep up.  

3.	Retreat
If you’re reading this article you have a physical body and an Astral Cord connected to your Astral form. If you feel threatened on the Astral just wish to return to your physical body and you’ll find yourself safely ensconced a second later.

4.	Fight / Call 911
Civilians always think fighting is the first strategy employed by the military when confronted with an enemy. However, any military vet will tell you that unless you’re secure in the superiority of your forces over the known assets of the enemy, the above three strategies are always better courses of action. I believe this philosophy is doubly accurate on the Astral Plane!
Let’s assume for a moment, however, that all else has failed and you need to fight off any attacking Astral threat. What can you do?

A.	Quell your fear. Only a bold, fearless attitude will do now. Concentrate on extending rays of light from your body with whatever loving feeling you can generate in this situation. Most attackers will recoil from this assault. Note: Some imaginative folks dress themselves in Astral armor and use very elaborate means of attack and defense. While these can be very entertaining to read, they aren’t strictly necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Perhaps I’m just a minimalist, though!

B.	Religion. If you have religious beliefs, prayers (like the Lord’s Prayer for Christians) can also be effective.

C.	Call for help. Requesting the aid of your guides or ascended/higher entities (angels in Abrahamic religions). As a child I had a shadow entity that stuck to me like gum on a hot summer sidewalk. He didn’t attack, just followed me around. Eventually, as I was raised in the Christian religion, I called upon the Archangel Michael to chase him away. Michael appeared, and my “Shadow Friend” disappeared – never to reappear.


Conclusion: Just as in the Physical Plane, there are threats on the Astral Plane. However, most people do not lock themselves in their homes, never venturing outside for fear of a possible attack. The many amazing experiences available in the Astral can be safely experienced by the Astral projector as long as he is armed with the knowledge and common sense necessary to navigate those planes of existence.The twisted rabbit hole ive been down since discovering all this wacky shit cannot be described, but i digress. I got pretty lit up on some jim beam last night (not my best work) and was sleeping off a doozie of a hangover. I woke up threw on my headphones with a rudolf stiener lecture and covered my eyes. After some grounding i slipped into vibes and separated very easily (also i heard that robotic voice people have been hearing lately couldn't make out what it was saying though). This suprised me as i have been having problems with parasites and other negative entities either keeping me in or attacking me the second im out. Anyway i didn't have an actual plan for what to do after a little dickin around i wanted to play with some energy so i kind of charged up, and right on fuckin cue here comes one of the hottest girls you can imagine. Ive fell into this trap before they get you into an embrace and fuckin drain you for what feels like hours. I call it out and tell it to fuck off it drops the charade and i see this gnarly looking scaled idk guy. He came at me and i held him back , this part has never happened before usually they take me down pretty quickly. Anyway i conjure a spike of green energy (mine always looks green unless i focus and specifically change it) and drive it right through his head we were equally surprised at this. I tried blasting energy at him only to realize i was feeding him he started to drain me it literally hurt, out of nowhere I got this burst of confidence/fuckin rage i can only describe as going super saiyan it was incredible. I grabbed him by his throat and punched him like 6 times and then his head fucking exploded. Next thing i knew i was back in body feeling like i lost a million pounds.  Idk if hes all the way dead i doubt thats how this works but i had to tell somebody who wouldn't throw me in the bug house. 
Ps-sorry for the novel but this was a game changer for me.Don’t know what it is about today, but my senses are heightened, I feel an electricity between my eyes, and I feel more appreciative about my food and everything I hear and see. 

I know this has nothing to do with astral projection, but I’ve heard people talk about your vibrational state affecting how easy you can project, so there’s that. 

Just thought I’d share.I've been experiencing astral projection since I was about 12 or 13 years old. It first happened as a result of bad sleeping habits and sleep paralysis, and holy fuck was it a mind blowing experience. Im sure you all know what i mean when talking about the first time it happens. After my first experience i decided to look into it, did a bunch of research, used guided meditation to make it happen, it sorta helped. But I came to realize that when it comes to that moment, when its about to happen, to not give in to the fear (for me it was scary as fuck silhouettes charging at me and charging through my chest, or, what I always considered worse, is the cacophony of terror when youre about to break through. Hearing voices just straight up creeps me out.)  then finally separate.  From that moment I became obsessed. It changed my perspective on a lot of things. Made me realize that there's more out there than what we physically perceive.  Like, I separated my spirit from my body dude,then  looked at myself laying there...and before that happened I felt like I was being hung by puppeteer strings over my bed. Fuckin nuts. AND, I tried the deck of cards thing where you flip over the top card and then see if its the same when you flip it when you're awake...IT WAS THE SAME! Coincidence?! I think not! Haha.. It actually freaked me out. I have ONE friend who knows all about this shit. When I told him about it  he acted like he wasn't surprised at all, he then proceeded to tell me a story of how he astral projected to his girlfriends house and would like creep on her or cuddle her n shit. The first time he did that she called him the next day and said "out of nowhere I felt like you were with me, I turned around to talk to you and realized you weren't actually there" 
It was after he told me that I felt more grounded and stopped thinking I was going nuts...
its a beautiful and captivating experience that I hope everyone can eventually go through. 

Anyways, I'm new to this forum and im lookin forward to reading about all your experiences. 
Cheers.Avalon — Worlds, Chapter 1

The edges of the book were worn, but it stayed together in his hands. He knew immediately that it would need to be hidden. Without ever really planning to disobey, his life had led to this moment. He looked around, careful to avoid attention. He’d just happened to notice it’s one corner blowing with the wind. He tried to move quickly, but couldn’t help but take a moment to notice that there was no cover. Its pages were covered by a thin layer of dirt and gravel. After pulling it from its dusty grave, he slid it into his waistband and used his shirt to cover it. This had all taken a matter of seconds, but time had slowed to match his increasing anxiety.

The dull shuffling of feet all around him remained unchanged. He lifted his head, just a little, and saw there was no change in the slow march forward. He resisted, but had to know. Quickly, he spun backwards and made an effort to feign tripping. All he needed was a glimpse, and then quickly returned to his slow and steady steps.

Silence remained — there was no alarm. But he waited, knowing what what coming. But after another minute, his shoulder’s relaxed.

— — — — — 

Hours later, at peak rest time, he crawled on the floor and into his closet. It had no doors, but he’d grown confident that there were no cameras within it. He found his shirt, and the book he’d wrapped carefully inside. He brought his light with him, found the corner, and pulled his legs in close.

The pages cracked quietly after obviously being wet many times. He let the accumulated dirt slide off and onto the ground — he could clean the floor later. He was surprised to see that the words inside were mostly legible. With the cover missing, he was left wondering what it was about. Some pages were worse than others, but he found a single line on the first page he turned too.

*The world of technology leads to a belief that we must do, always and forever, more than we are capable of.*

His experience with books extended to system manuals, technical documentation, and children’s books. It was common knowledge that books were not allowed past the age of six.

He heard the floorboards creak and knew his father was getting up to use the bathroom. He held his breath, his heart beat faster, and he pulled the book closer to his chest. He understood little of what he was reading, but its words created an image in his head of something different. Did others imagine a day that wasn’t the same as the one before?

Space agencies could send people to other planets using OBE's to search for suitable landing spots or for research, cutting the cost significantly.

Militaries could gather intel using OBE's.

Police chases and investigations could be partially done using OBE's.

Meetings could be done in the Astral realm, especially incredibly important and classified meetings.

Astral Projection would be taught in school and in cases of emergency, like if you're being abused or lost and cannot call for help, you could go to the Astral realm and talk to the police in there.

I really want to know why OBE's aren't used for serious reasons. It seems like a very useful tool that people could use in their daily lives. I don't know everything about OBE's and maybe an Astral Police Station wouldn't be possible but what about the others?Here's an excerpt from the [Samaññaphala Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sama%C3%B1%C3%B1aphala_Sutta) that I think you might like as I believe it bears relation to non-physical bodies:  
 "With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers...He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds."Hi,
Last night I had an astral experience.

It began as a normal dream in which I was driving a car back to home. Suddenly in front of me, out of nowhere a giant mirror like portal appeared and I drove through him. It transferred me at other planet, real or astral, but I believe it was a astral one. Everything around me was like a dead wasteland and wad filled with hundreds of man like creatures, which had grey skin and red eyes. They were roaming like zombies with no direction or orientation and they acted like they can't notice me. They were looking kind intimidating and scary, so my first thought that came to me was they are going to attack me and the moment that happen they start attacking me for real, from all over directions, I tried to run down them with my car, but they were too many, my car couldn't start anymore, they broke my glasses with the intention to reach me, they were howling at me. I got out from the glass rooftop and start kicking and punching them out of the car rooftop in win or lose situation. An idea suddenly came to me that maybe they are sensing my fear and attack, and with nothing else to do I follow the idea and stopped all of my emotions, suddenly all creatures stopped at their tracks and were moving aimlessly again like they couldn't sense me, I immediately thought so everything of this was just a test and used my blank state of mind or like some call it, the zen state. I closed my eyes and just let go of everything and began to fall backwards. The moment I hit the floor, the entire planet surface folded into fours, like made from paper, then I saw the entire planet did the same from orbit, then saw the entire galaxy fold in four all around me and just like that I open my eyes sitting on a chair.

The chair was made from strange material and was oval in nature like an egg. I was in completely empty room with strange symbol's all over the walls, which I couldn't read. Starting from the chair they were a path with glowing symbols that were changing constantly like a countdown to something, at the end of that path of symbols, on the wall there was doorlike portal. I got to it and touch it, a sensation hit my mind, it was a Doorway to the fifth dimension, the entities were giving me a choice to abandon my physical body and to join them in fifth dimension and there was a countdown to my response. The test I passed served as a sign that I was ready to join their ranks. I moved my hand through the portal, but couldn't do it, I still have things to accomplish on this side, I conveyed my answer to them through my thoughts and sat back on the chair. The chair began to move and little before I leave this space a entity appeared next to the portal, which bowed his head a little and waved his hand for goodbye and gone through the portal. When I left this space I immediately woke up in my bed.DreamJournal
I time traveled last night
25 years into the future.
First I ended up a Japanese virtual reality facility. They were able to track my location to San Antonio Texas.
Then I ended up in a closet somewhere. I saw someone exit the closet and enter the bedroom so I followed behind her.
Turns out it was me, and I knew it immediately. 
She told me everything.
She told me that we discover that…nothing really matters.
She showed me what happens to Texas.
It’s almost as if we got the technology to live away from earth. 
She showed me what it looks like outside.
You could clearly see what I assumed was space but it almost looked gel like, and you could see the constellations clearly. I was the center…of everything. I asked where the star was… where is the light we keep seeing from earth.
It was something different from what reality was.
We truly are in a matrix on earth.
We MAKE these worlds in order to learn something. We are all connected. The real people anyways. 
Speaking of real people, *** is not what I am. 
I looked sad after I asked that. Every time I asked for a memory she showed me.
Since we are able to access our consciousness I could view anything at anytime.
I saw myself being delivered from my mom.
I asked where did the Trauma begin for me, it happened at birth.
There is a possibility of me having a twin. 
I saw a category called Gay, it took me down to every experience of something gay happening.
It literally shows me that every time something traumatic happened my brain turned it into a movie so it wouldn’t affect me as bad. Watching a man get brutally raped by other men turned into a Spartan type movie where he’s an enemy being put to death. 
I wouldn’t say what happened to daughter
Or anyone else for that matter.
It was almost like I was alone in the universe. 
It sucked. But it put me at peace in a way.
It kinda made it seem like life is literally for experiencing things. Probably to reach a high state of consciousness. 
Everything is essentially made up
None of this matters 
Once I learn the rules of the game play by the rules so I can learn and then move on.
Attachment will keep me grounded and eternally sad.
The biggest shift happens soon, the world “ends” as we know it.
Every time something bad happens like that I’m able to shift my consciousness to not experience physical pain.
What does it all mean?After reading many posts here regarding encounters with negative entities, I have to say that I was rather uncomfortable with the idea of your fears manifesting in front of you; especially as someone who scares quite easily and is generally anxious. This morning however, it finally happened to me.

As usual, I would think about a person or place I'd like to visit, and I'd feel myself being taken somewhere, but this time, I opened my eyes to see the legs of a strange humanoid being while feeling as if I am being held fairly tight around my waist.

Having realised I was being held by this creature, it lifted me up in the air to show me its face and it looked like some kind of alien cyborg with its brain partially protruding out of its head. It held me there for a few seconds as if it were expecting me to panic, but I just looked at it, scrutinising its appearence.

In this moment, I realised I had likely come in contact with a negative entity, and contrary to how I expected myself to react, there was something about the dream-like quality of the experience that allowed me to distance myself from what I was observing in that moment, as if I knew that no matter what happened, I'd be ok.

Suddenly I somehow broke free of its grip and I was able to put a bit of distance between myself and the entity. I notice that we are in a fairly small room in a house somewhere.

The entity started cycling through a series of techniques in an attempt to scare me, all while becoming increasingly frustrated when I didn't react in the way it wanted. One of these was to block my path and grab me which it attempted multiple times. In response, I kept rapidly dodging it by flying around and I turned away from it as to not give it too much attention.

As a last resort, it grabbed some objects off a nearby shelf and started throwing them at me in what seemed like a fit of rage, and I used my right arm to block the incoming items flying in my direction.

At this point I'd been struggling with the entity in this small room for what felt like 1 or 2 minutes. I look away once more, and when I looked back, it had gone. I was half expecting it to jumpscare me from behind, but no, it did not return. Spent the next few seconds looking around, then I was sucked back into my body.

So as much as people say that these can be very scary experiences, it was quite an interesting one for me (and admittedly quite underwhelming compared to how bad I thought it'd be). The acceptance that I would be ok was the key to remaining calm, and meeting the situation with curiosity instead of fear alongside distancing myself from what I was observing seems to have helped quite a bit. More than anything, these occurances are a nuisance, and negative entities are fairly easy to defeat once you've got a handle on them; that's even if you encouter one.

I've learned a lot from this experience, but hopefully this post goes some way to helping others who may be concerned.I don’t know how but I found myself in a dream plot and said “you’re sleeping, it’s time to astral project” and everything started fading and getting fuzzy - then I saw black and felt my body sleeping in bed and it felt REAL. (This ended up being my childhood home and bed that I projected from...) I knew I just had to get up and do it so I physically got up and fell off the bed - surprised by how real it felt. I then started crawling and feeling my hands on the floor, vision still black. I started getting vision and it was extremely glitchy I was seeing my hands and random bursts of light and they were glitching very much. Then I kept crawling and saw myself in a mirror and again i was flickering in and out of appearance, seeing  a projection of my physical body but then the mirror was transparent and I could not see anything. I kept crawling in darkness until I got into my living room. I lunge toward the window in hopes of jumping and flying out but i get bounced back strongly and can’t go through the window. Okay so I try the front door. Before I leave I see this heaven like dream like vision of the outside/my house and I think I was raising my vibration unintentionally and once I had that good feeling I was able to leave the house. NOW THIS is what got me. I always tell people I swear i have a dream map in my head of real locations I visit in my dreams that feel physical and I visit them throughout the years, it’s like a map pattern. So BOY WAS I shocked to project to the same dreamscape im going around in at night doing stuff with. I was familiar with everything. I walked away from the house and started gaining full vision and confidence. To the point where I got to a park and started flying!!! I was doing weird flips in the air and looked up to the blue sky and thought - maybe space next time haha. At that point I was flying and looking at my hands and I was just in a void where I briefly got the most iridescent colors like the star gate sequence in the movie 2001. After MONTHS I finally had a projection longer than 5 secondsA lot of people reported a scratch and red marks after they wake up from a sleep paralysis or a disturbing dream. They see someone attacking them during the dream/paralysis and then they see the marks after they wake up or they quickly feel the pain. It's kinda beyond our comprehension that with strong intent and experience, you could have an effect in the physical.    
What do you guys think?    
    
edit: The same process can also be used to heal the physical bodyCan someone AP to N Korea and find out if the leader is dead or alive? 

I haven’t APed yet, tho I try and try, going to N Korea would be something I’d like to do if I could API would love to believe full heartedly in AP but there are many on this sub who seem to believe in very wild conspiracies and that fact makes it hard for me to be sure of AP's existance. I am a geologist and very scientifically minded so APers who are the same way please come forward and offer me some kind of assurance that AP is real. I have reached the vibration phase many times but cant pull past.. perhaps an undoubted belief in AP will help me do this?I have been meditating since I was 13 yo so I am very experienced when it comes to enetering the vibration state. Just a couple of months after I started meditating and astral projecting I experienced my first shadow people encounter, it was right after I finished meditating that I opened my eyes and saw a 3 meter tall humanoid dark figure stuck to the wall ceiling. Ever since I have had countless sleep paralysis, it happens to me at least twice a week and about 30% of the times I encounter a shadow person or two until just a couple of days ago...

I am so used to sleep paralysis that I am not even scared of it anymore, the fear of certain death is still there everytime but I am able to break from it just after a couple of seconds and even if not I go back to sleep like a baby right after without fear. This time though it was different. After breaking away from the sleep paralysis I opened my eyes to see 4 or maybe 5 shadow people standing in my room and stuck to the walls, even though I have never seen so many in one go I didn't panic, I rubbed my eyes and sat down since everytime I start moving they disappear almost always but they were still there. I rubbed my eyes again and saw them moving around the room, one was even walking towards me. My heart started pownding faster and I noticed the ringing in my ears was still there even after fully waking up. I turned on the lights as fast as I could and they all dissapeared as soon as I turned the lights on. I still don't know what was that all about.

After long analysis and experiments I have done with my experiences I have come to a theory that may explain what this phenomenon is. Firstly they are fully harmless and cannot harm you. A lot of people and I mean a LOT of people have the idea that harm can come to you in astral projection and sleep paralysis from demons sucking your soul or whatever. This is not true, almost every negative being throughout your travels are made up by your mind, humans by nature are scared animals. Humans throughout millions of years were in the middle of the food chain pyramid, we hunted smaller animals but were also hunted by other bigger animals such as lions. In a spam of just a couple millenia through the discovery of fire we jumped to the top of the food chain disrupting the natural pyramid of prey and predator. If you notice every animals on the top of the food chain such as lions have a big pride and are fearless to almost anything. We humans are afraid of so much stuff because we are on the top of the food chain with the brains of an animal that is in the middle.  

Secondly they are not alive. Our minds ego creates these beings to scare us away from what we sometimes call "englightment", why you ask? Well the ego has a simple pourpes and that is to make us greedy in order for us to survive. Without greed we would've starve to death because we would've gave all our days hunt to some random starving little girl from the tribe. The ego helps us survive because it makes us greedy, makes us want more, makes us want to own and take. When we meditate we become egoless but the ego has its own defence mechanisms that prevents this from happening. It does this by causing fear. And the biggest fear of all is death by nature. And the way your brains translate this feeling is by shadow people. This is why you have the feeling of certain death when having sleep paralysis.

Well this is just my theory and I have other theories as well but this is the one that makes the most sense to me and the most realistic one.

Do you agree with me? Disagree? What are your thoughts on it?

Sorry for my english i am not a native speaker.I don’t think this was an astral projection, but I’m not sure where to post. I know absoloutley nothing about Greek mythology. But today while in a very deep meditation I lost all awareness of my surroundings and found myself in a beautiful meadow. I felt like I’d been there before. It was extremely warm and welcoming and I enjoyed this place a lot. I found myself admiring a massive tree, and on one side of the tree there was a door. I went inside and inside I met a beautiful woman wearing white with brown hair. I asked her questions about a lot of personal things going on in my life atm, and she would respond with words, I asked her if I was in fact the one making the words ( her answers)  up and I am tricking myself into believing that this is some spiritual experience. And she told me that I am the one saying the words, but not the one giving the answers. We then only spoke telepathically.  I asked what her name was and she said Athena. I had 0 prior knowledge of Athena being a Greek godess, but that’s just what she said. She didn’t mention it either. It was my freind who I told the experience to that told me Athena is a Greek goddess. After looking her up some of the pictures looks EXACTLY like the woman I saw. Anybody else have any similar experiences?Not trying to take away from any book author or the like I'm simply sharing this open library of free eBooks to anyone who chooses to embark on their Astral Projection journey and has many questions that are unanswered and is looking for books to read to help them on their journey and answer some of their questions regarding Astral Projection or other subjects relative to AP like spirituality, occultism, etc. I personally have used this library myself because there were a million different books I wanted to read when I first started and I wanted to expand my knowledge on this subject and I couldn't afford to buy all the books I wanted to read and this has helped me answer a lot of the questions I had and also helped me learn new AP techniques I didn't know of before. Anyways, hopes this helps people who need it. Good luck!

Link: [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)Ive been astral projecting purposefully for about 6 years now, this post will be the record of what I’ve come to understand about the astral plane in my extensive time spent studying and traveling the astral plane. 

First we must define astral projection.  And I’ll describe the astral plane.
Astral projection is the casting off of your physical body, it is the exiting your physical body and the traveling to different realms with your astral body. 

The astral plane is place souled shaped by intent and will power, usually I find it a place that stretches on forever with an infinite black void
This void isn’t so all consuming tho because anywhere there is life ( including plant) there is color, so it’s a beautiful mirror of our own world with a pitch black background and vibrant pure reds, and purples,Greens and yellows. And each color represents a different will power  that’s influencing the astral. 

I have found that there is two different types of astral projection and I suspect there is a third as well. 

The first type I like to call partial projection, partial projection is the act of exiting your physical body, but staying in the physical plane  with your astral body, this allows you to see any place in the world or even universe. 

The second type of astral projection is what I like to call Complete Projection. in complete projection you exit your physical body and the physical plane , you send your astral body to the astral plane. This is a lot different from partial projection and where AP’s real power and danger stem from.

I suspect the third type to be perfect projection or total ascension, your physical and astral body or transported to the astral plane permanently

So now that we’ve defined astral projection and it’s stages I’ll get into my experiences. My earliest experiences with AP were when I was quite young 
, 11 or so. it happened after a large altercation with a close friend that ended the friendship. I was sitting down and I was so angry at my friend  I was overcome with anger and then suddenly I was above myself from a top down, third person video game type view. At this point I am strangely filled and void of emotion at the same time. It was a brief instant and I didn’t realize what it was until much later. My second experience was a couple years later when a close family member died, when I found out I felt broken and I was overcome with sadness, the same thing happened third person top down perspective except this time i can see much more, and instead of just seeing it’s as if I am what I’m seeing, I was my entire house and everyone in it. It happened dozens of more time when I was very angry or sad but those were the strongest, I bring this up because I believe that strong emotion can link one to the astral plane accidentally and is a very effective way to AP but also very dangerous, as it’s hard to control and you don’t always know what your capable of in those moments. I believe that in these moments of strong emotion you are embodying that emotion so strongly that it affects the astral.

I didn’t start truly start AP on purpose until I was 17, I realized the connection between emotion and The Astral and I focused intensely on strengthening that, i started “hearing” this ringing in my head and whenever I focused on it it would increase relatively. One day I was meditating and i decided to really focus on the ringing and when I did it helped me AP, the ringing would grow so loud it felt like it was shaking everything, and the ringing was like a knife I used to cut my way into the astral. Once I figured it out I would AP regularly almost everyday. My body was hardly even part of myself anymore, it felt so separated. I stopped simply viewing after a while and I would partially or completely project and change things about the physical plane and try to change the astral. After two years of near constant practice, i was confident and I tried to attempt to make big change in the astral plane and in the physical. I was trying to play with time to put it simply. I was about to complete the process and f with time when I felt myself being ripped away and replaced and I couldn’t go through with it. One time while APing it felt like I had been stolen away from my body and I couldn’t return, it felt like something was operating on my astral body taking off pieces and putting new different ones. Months after that I had grown in “Power” significantly faster than ever before. What once took everything I had and a half hour was now as easy as breathing. then one day in meditation the world and astral faded away and I was everything in the universe , in all dimensions, I was everything and could see and feel everything, I mean everything. After I left the experience and was back in the physical my body was in real physical pain ( as if it couldn’t handle what was being pushed into it) and I had to travel to the astral plane to relieve the pain, a week after that when I was projecting I was “abducted” from my usual business and brought in-front of these two beings that I knew were the wind and air themselves, and they basically warned me to stay away from the astral and to stop what I was doing. I didn’t stop and the next time I Completely projected I was yanked away again and this time it was death and chaos and they told me to stop or die. I didn’t, I continued like usual and wasn’t interrupted ever again, and I continued to grow at an accelerated pace, it was like I couldn’t not influence the astral around me, that was last month. Recently I had a run in with another entity that seemed separate from the astral plane, it promised to help and clean me and I accepted ever since I can’t AP or really use the astral at all, it’s as if I’ve been sealed or banished from the astral plane because I didn’t stop. 

I think that the beings I “Talked” to and encountered were essentially small fragments of divinity, they were pure embodiments of whatever they were. The Spirits of the wind and Air, were not only the wind in our world but in every world and every where that there is wind. The being of destruction I encountered was raw unfettered destruction. And while these smaller beings embodied one thing only, I have encountered a larger stronger being that embodied everything. Because of this I think that just as embodying an emotion can let one touch the astral plane, embodying something more like the wind itself is how you get real 
lasting power in the astral plane and possibly how you achieve perfect projection or ascension. 

Feel free to ask anything I’ll try to answer as best I canFour or five months ago, I APed for the first time. Ever since then, I have been having a lot of dreams while sleeping that end up coming true after I wake up. Have any of you who had the same experience as me?I haven't been able to astral project so far. So do hit me up if you'd like to pull me out of my body. Possibly someone whose already successfully pulled someone out?

Edit: all of you are so helpful. Thankyou so much!Why are these videos not stickied or in the sidebar? This is literally everything that you could possibly need and it has been in existence for 8 months already!!! Wtf! I kept hearing about it more and more so I finally decided to check it out. Worked literally the first night. Maybe it's cheating because I have previous experience but it felt so legit this time, because in the first seminar there's an entire "training" part, where he guides you through everything you'll have to do when you'll be doing it for real.

And that was just the first video. I haven't even watched the other 2. They're all 2 hours long but so fucking worth it. I watched the first one on 3x speed (with a chrome add-on) with subtitles on and I got all the info just fine, if you don't wanna watch the whole hour. But seriously, do the training which starts 1h and 20min in. That will make you succeed so fast, I bet. If not on the first night, then soon as hell as long as you stay determined.

Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc

If you're gonna do it, which you should, then I got another exit technique that he doesn't speak about. I came up with it on the spot last night. The technique where you visualize walking around touching and feeling everything in your room... you can replace that one with stumbling around and absolutely destroying and slamming into every object you can imagine. I find that's easier to visualize, because you're trying to feel stuff with your whole body at once, not just your hands and feet. That's what activated the vibrations for me and got me to project.

- - -

Edit: Jesus Christ, I just woke up from the 2nd night. Literally projected 4 times, no joke. Holy fuck guys, I mean, damn, this is astonishing. I've projected before but THIS is insane just how effective it is. This was 2nd night, 2nd video. I wonder what kind of things will happen after the 3rd one.

Like, I think you could literally project every single night like this, once you have it down. Because you get like 5 - 10 attempts per night, depending on how many times you wake up for a minute.

- - -

Edit 2: Yep, 3rd night projected once or twice. Maybe not as realistic and long as the past couple nights, but it still worked. This is insane. I wonder how long I can keep the streak going for lol.

Also, discovered a new variation for the technique of trying to visualize touching everything around you. The main point is to feel the sensations. The more you feel, the better. So I discovered that visualizing yourself splashing around in a bathtub or any water like a complete maniac works quite well.

- - - 

FINAL EDIT: My streak ended at 4 days. A week later now, haven't been able to do it again. I don't know if I burned myself out or what, but from now on I'll attempt this only 2 - 3 times a week.

- - - 

super final edit: (1.5 more weeks later) Ok so I finally managed to do a legit one again, after a few really short and shitty ones. I discovered a way to instantly get into it with max stability and vividness. Might not work for everyone, as with any technique you read about. Basically you first have to do whatever exit you want. Rotate/levitate/rope out, whatever, as usual. And after you feel that "shift", just snap open your eyes  (if you don't have vision already). Physically. Don't imagine it. Literally do it, and chances are, you'll open your astral eyes instead, and you'll have max realism. I can't believe how well it works. Never failed me yet. There's a chance you'll just open them up for real and be in sleep paralysis but meh, hasn't happened to me yet.

By the way, all these projections happened with a sleep mask on, so I highly recommend it. Got some cheap-ass one off Wish, but it does the job quite well. Fully blocks light.Greetings friends!

So, last night my wife and I decided to try a little bit of meditation while micro microdosing with Psychedelic Chocolate. We talked for a bit about what type of meditation we wanted to do, and we decided on Chakra meditation!

- *This is the guided meditation we used:*

https://youtu.be/NmAHY_tg9Es

It goes through each vibrational tone of each chakra, starting from the Root, all the way up to the Crown, and it helps cleanse and rebalance the chakras, and I've gotta say, I did NOT expect it to be this amazing. 

So first, we each took just 1 square of chocolate, much like a Hershey's bar has 12 squares, so did this. 

We sat for a while and watched tv, waiting for it to "kick in", and once it did, we set up the meditation on our tv, and sat down on the couch, as comfortable as possible, and just let the tones take its course. I had grabbed my bag of crystals that I use for my chakra work, and I held them in my lap, with my palms facing up. 

While I sat there, I felt the tones of the Root Chakra completely fill my entire being, and I could see the vibrational tones of the sacred geometric pattern of the chakra in my minds eye. I held the intention that I wanted to make peaceful contact with any benevolent beings that wished to do the same, and quickly, I started to get a numbing feeling in the base of my spine, and I quickly saw myself as the blossom of a flower connected to the Earth, and I could feel the deep, resonant energy of the Earth, and I could see the rich colors of the Earths energy consume me. 

Soon after, it switched tones to then work on the Sacral Chakra, and as soon as the first tone hit me, that area of my body exploded outwards, and I could feel this deep, rich, loving, energy bleed outwards, flowing like tentacles of light, stretching out to draw in the warmth of the energies around me. Every tone would come with the visuals of their own sacred geometric patterns, and it filled my mind with their infinite ripples. 

- *This entire time, I'm focusing on each breath I take, to exhale at the beginning of each tone, allowing my body to take in as much of their energy as possible. I'm focusing on trying to make contact, building up the energy from each newly balanced chakra, to push up and outwards towards the infinite cosmos, in the hopes of making contact.*

Next, it began the tones of the Solar Plexus chakra, and I was instantly filled with such bright, radiant energy. The sight of their Sacred Geometric patterns filled my mind with the image of a sun, and a flower combined. It blossomed infinitely, and folded back in on itself. This whole time, my spine was forced straight up, like a pillar, unmoving and stable. My back was as straight as it has ever been. My Solar Plexus was forced forwards and up, and I could feel the warmth of every light particle in existence flowing through me, and back outwards, taking away all the darkness and stress within that area of my life. The sense of letting go, and the cleansing of it felt absolutely radiant. 

When the tones of the Heart Chakra began, everything changed. My entire being was filled with this rich, vibrant, Green energy, and the color completely consumed my being, and I was in a feeling of numb bliss. I saw this image of a five pointed star, mixed with a flower, similar to the Solar Plexus pattern, but different. It blossomed and flowed in a completely different way, and it was so mesmerizing to watch. 

- *At this point, I was beginning to feel a presence with me, as I was embracing the loving heart mindset for contact, sending out the message that I am here, and I am peaceful, and I sent out a beacon of light to find me*

As soon as the Throat Chakra tones began, I was able to finally make contact. I was filled with this piercing blue, pink, and lavender swirls of energy, wrapping around my throat, and it sent my head and chin upwards, stretching my neck out as far as possible to where it felt like my neck was a tower. Once this happened, the bridge was made. I saw the Sacred Geometry of the Chakra, but it was accompanied by the full image of this Mantis-like being. All I could see was their head, but I could see the rounded curvature of their triangular head, with their large eyes towards the sides of their head. 

I began the communication with a simple "Hello", and I quickly received a "Hello" in response. This was probably the most calm, professional, and simple line of communication I've ever had. I asked, "Do you want to talk with me?", to which they said, "Yes". 

I asked, "What is your name?" 

They said, "Hailiak". (That's the best way I was made to understand how to spell it)

- *Pronounced: "Hay-Lee-Ack"*

I then told them my own name. 

I then received a very welcoming vibe from them, as if they were pleased to meet with me. 

I tried to mimic that vibe to send to them, but I got excited and lost connection with them. 

That was when the tones of the Third Eye Chakra began, and I was instantly consumed by the deepest expanse of Sacred Geometry I've ever experienced. I saw the image of this bright ball of blue white energy contained within this diamond of crystalline colors, surrounded by a cloud of the most intense energy I've ever felt.. so intense that I had to step back away from it, and recenter my focus back to my breathing. I just let the tones cleanse my Third Eye, and patiently waited for the next tone to begin.

Once it did, my Crown Chakra exploded with the combined energy of all the chakras, and my mind was consumed by Sacred Geometry. I lost all sense of Being, and just let myself go, and explore the infinite ripples of everything.

-

When I was done, it felt like my entire body was as light as a feather, and I felt myself come back down into my body, and I felt completely relaxed, and peaceful. 

I'm so happy I was able to make contact with this being, Hailiak, and I hope to soon make contact with them again, because I feel like we got interrupted, lol. 

I cannot recommend that meditation enough, and if you have any questions, or similar experiences, please let me know ✌

Thanks for reading!Hey there! Sorry if this question is confusing, to be frank I’m not sure how to word this. 

My brother called me and said he’s been having weird dreams/possible paranormal experiences lately where he’ll wake up from a nightmare and feel the presence of someone with him. 

Apparently today, he woke up a little after 5AM (with his eye face mask thing on so he couldn’t see) to his door opening. Like doorknob moving and everything and someone coming into his room. He asked if it was his roommate Johnathon, and nothing. The entity thing just kept walking. Then he asked if it was his friend Kaipo (they’ve been pretty intimate and he said they’re the only two that would just go into his room like that) to which the entity acknowledged that response and then proceeded to walk towards his bathroom. He genuinely thought it was Kaipo so he told “Kaipo” to go and cuddle with him and sure enough, the entity went towards the bed. My brother wasn’t feeling anyone despite the fact that he heard the footsteps walk over to the bed, and when he opened his mask there was nobody. 

He went back to sleep. 

Kaipo calls him later that day to tell him he had the weirdest out of body experience that happened a little after 5AM where he started to astral project and then all of a sudden lost control and for lack of better words blacked out. He doesn’t remember where he went or what he did, but he knew he went somewhere. 

Background (I’m still getting information so when I get more I’ll edit this) my brother told me they both have been having shared strange “paranormal” stuff and dreams happen lately. 

I’m wondering if MAYBE they have some sort of strong spiritual connection and have been visiting each other when they astral project. I just don’t know if that’s even a thing lol I’ve only astral projected once so I’m not at all knowledgeable about this particular subject. 

TL;DR I’m wondering if it’s possible for two ppl to have such a strong spiritual bond that they can astrally project and visit each other in some sort of dreamlike/but also physical realm. Like physical like the realm we all are experiencing right now lolA while ago I ‘woke up’ and the room felt strange looked different and had what I can only describe as a filter on it, like it looked a different tone. 
I could hear hundreds of different whispering voices. 
In the corner of my room stood a dark hooded figure staring at me although I don’t think it had a face. It almost like a grim reaper. 
It told me telepathically to get up and come over to it with like a ‘follow me’ sort of vibe. 
I felt my astral body immediately get up and go over to the entity without hesitation. I looked back and saw my human self sleeping on the bed. 
Then I actually woke up. 
My question is has anyone ever seen an entity like this?I know that this probably isn’t the right place for this observation but I wasn’t really sure where else to take it. Would love to be pointed in the right direction if this isn’t welcome here! 

Lately I’ve felt like the role of humanity is simply to process data for some higher intelligence. We spend all of our time absorbing new information, digesting it, and then “processing” through our dreams or subconscious.

It’s like how in The Matrix humans are farmed as an energy source for machines, but in reality it’s much less physical. They don’t need our bodies as batteries,  our bodies are just the hardware that the data management software is installed on.

I’ve noticed when I’m in the state between waking/dreaming/entering astral I can feel this process happening in my physical and subtle body. 

When we leave our bodies are we escaping our designated purpose and experience a freer existence, one where we have self sovereignty? 

Would love to hear others thoughts on this.I was taking a long nap. Something really weird happened in the dream, so I realized  I was dreaming. I shouted in the lucid dream that I want to astral project. And I got the sickest astral projection ever in my life, I just woke up from it. it felt like it was around 10-15 minutes I'd say.

Suddenly I woke up in a sleep paralysis, I could feel my body slowly lifting, after about 1 minute of trying I was out. For some reason whenever I astral project I can't control my astral body. My body usually goes where it wants, it's like my subconsious decides where I go.  While randomly flying in the air I could hear magical sounds that I had never heard before. Suddenly in the distance I spotted two fairy looking women that was heading towards me. They grabbed me and guided my flying cuz they prolly noticed I was flying uncontrollably. In my mind I thought these have to be my spirit guides, so I asked them If they were, but I don't remember what they said. 

They wanted me to have some fun I sensed. They took me to a different dimension. All the time I was trying to control my body but I find it very hard to stay stable when floating.

The first dimension we were in a world where the government knew about astral projectors, they feared astral projectors a lot. The people had machines that could sense and feel when someone was astral projecting. Everyone started pannicing and running when they sensed us. I don't know what the deal was. Pretty fucked up dimension I'd say.

After a while they took me to this other dimension. I was in some random guy's house. It's like I knew I could enter this guy's body so I did. It's like I possesed this guy's body. He was in his room with his mom. I noticed that his mom was pretty hot so I went to her and carried her on my back for some reason and long story short a fight started in the family. The fairies or whatever they were, asked me why I was doing that. I said "this reality is fake anyways". They said, "this is a dimension within a dimension and it is real just like yours.

When they told me that I felt really bad cause that I ruined that day and made it really akward for that poor guy.

At some point when I was astral projecting I thought "imagine if this is a lucid dream" So I tried to control the enviorment but I couldn't.

I've had about twelve astral projections but this one I'm not sure if it was 100% an astral projection. Especially the part where I possessed a random dude.

I would like to hear from you guys what you think about this. I myself is not sure if this was a astral projection.

\*Side note, I did hear the vibrations in my head and all that before aping so Idk, I was aware the whole time, so it's not a dream. I tried to manipulate the things but couldn't cuz I thought if it was all just a lucid dream.I completely forgot about my original post on this sub which I’ll link here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/jjha2f/my_boyfriend_astral_projects_every_night/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

But I was going through my posts tonight and got to Thai one and re read some of the comments. 

One in particular where someone suggested putting a post it note in my room where my boyfriend “visits” me every night while Astral projecting reminded me of the experiment we did. 

So I did in fact put a post it note in my room with a sentence on it. My boyfriend APed to me a few nights later and said he saw the note but couldn’t read it. But he was able to tell me the color of the post it (pink) and where it was (the inside of my built in book shelves) so there we go 

Sorry this took so long to post the follow up toLast night I woke up around 3am to use the restroom. I was drowsy but not exhausted, so I thought, why not give it a shot?

I got comfortable and just started “letting go” by which I mean giving my spirit permission to leave my body. I prayed, I gave myself permission, trusted all involved, and found myself “asleep”, but I knew my body was asleep, and I was fully aware. Usually this slips into lucid dreaming, but this felt different, free, awake. Instead of trying to peel myself out of my body, I just happily and confidently floated up, got to a standing position, and turned around to check if I could see my body. For the first time ever, I could. It was dark, but I could see myself lying on my side, per usual, sleeping away. 

Then, I thought, where should I go?! For whatever reason, I said “Take me to Mt. Everest!” Literally not even on the list of the places I’ve thought of going (more of a beach girl than a snow bunny), but this was my first instinct for whatever reason. A blurry whoosh, and I was on top of a snowy mountain that I knew to be Everest. The view was magnificent. A partially snowy, jagged mountain range was in front of me. I looked to my left and saw another peak that was not fully covered in snow, sitting lower but not much. It stood out to me and I thought to commit it to memory to check my experience. I haven’t done so yet because I know nothing about the area and it will take some research, but I was in awe. I took in the sights for a few more moments, then got excited and wanted to go to the Maldives. 

Something went wrong and I ended up waking up in my body, but the Everest trip felt so real and so incredible. Maybe the top of the world was a bit ambitious for my first AP trip and drained my capacity for travel? Who knows. But the awe and wonder were incredible. I can’t wait to surrender again tonight. Maybe I’ll finally get to those white sand beaches!

Now a question: has anyone ever made contact with someone they lost in the astral? I found this sub looking for possible Spiritual connections to link to the afterlife, and I want to know if I should continue pursuing that via AP or just explore and grow in other areas via AP? Either way the hope and joy and peace this journey is giving me is amazing and I won’t give up. Just wondering if it’s an AP thing or if I should give that aspect up.*Updated with more things.

#Stress, mental exhaustion

 I've had one of the most stressful weeks of my life, went to sleep with a headache, couldn't sleep for hours. Yet somehow I spontaneously projected, and it was my best projection.


#Melatonin

I've taken melatonin and still projected.


#Being abruptly woken up, causing you anger.
My dad knocked on my door like crazy way too early and woke me up to do some errant, I was very angry. But when I went back to sleep, I still projected.


#Insomnia / Sleep deprivation

I have severe insomnia, I can't keep a regulated schedule, sometimes I go to sleep at 6 AM. Projected.


#Masturbation, porn, feeling disgusting for watching a specific porn

I won't go into details here...



I don't know how much these factors affect AP, nor if it's the same for everyone, since I'm not a scientist and this wasn't scientifically tested. This is what I've learned that applies to myself, it may apply to you as well. Just don't assume these things are your blocks, they don't seem to be for me.

With that said, I'm still learning how to control this, my experiences are rare and don't seem to come at will much. So just because they don't block, doesn't mean they aren't affecting. I'm thinking of making a data study on this someday, since there's so many people here.So my friend killed himself a year ago and today I found him when I astral projected. When I first projected, everything looked weird and I was unbalanced and felt uncomfortable so I got out that room and kept moving through new ones. Finally I saw a window and went through it and I was outside in a field that looked like my old elementary school. My classmates were all kids again playing a game together. Then I saw my friend and walked up to him and gave him a hug but he looked confused. Is this possibly how he's living his afterlife? As a kid again?First off I’ve never actually astral projected but I can easily get in the vibrational state. And secondly I have had sleep paralysis for years naturally up until a few months ago it stopped, but I’m very familiar with shadow people and scary things I’ve seen in sleep paralysis. But this was something different. 
        I was listening to binaural beats and I was in the vibrational state. Since I can really never get past this state, I just decided to give up and open my eyes. I immediately say this immensely tall, thin creature standing a couple feet from the foot of my bed. It looked like it was made of smoke or shadows, but it wasn’t a shadow person. It had faintly red eyes that weren’t glowing but I could definitely see them. It also had a big smile but I couldn’t actually see it smiling because it was too dark, but I could just feel that it was smiling. It didn’t move and it was hunched over because it was so tall the ceiling was too low for it. I could just tell it was genuinely there unlike shadow people in sleep paralysis or anything else I’ve seen because in sleep paralysis I know I’m just dreaming it and it poses no threat to me. I could feel this things malintent to me and I was terrified but I moved and as soon as I did it disappeared. Does anyone know if this is a genuine thing or was I just hallucinating?Has anyone here watched the OA. If so whats your opinion on it?

Edit: is what they do ap?I tried a Astral Projection Video. After 15 Minutes, my Soul left my body and went very fast in Space. I saw our beautiful and round Earth and soon after, like a meteorite i crashed in the Garden. I saw my House and the whole environment! This is absolutely insane!Okay I have a lot to share about this topic but I wont go into everything here or this post would be huge. At times these experiences become so intense and frequent that I literally get afraid to go to sleep. So a little bit of background: I have narcolepsy, can always remember having vivid dreams, lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis and other sleep related phenomena. (I suspect is common with sleep disorders?).

I don't recall how long this had been going on as when I first experienced it I was not intentionally trying to AP. But at some point in the last 5 years or so I started to do this. At first nothing really happened. I would feel a strong vibration in either my spine or my head, and an unbearable and almost painful pressure so I had to force myself out to escape it. I would come out of my body but not really be able to move around well, would kinda just flop onto the bed/floor and struggle to crawl around. 
Gradually over time I would be able to drift around more easily but still I didn't really do much or go very far. 

For a while it stopped happening and I didn't really try to do it. Until I started having this terrifying experience. I would be falling asleep and I would feel the vibration and the pressure in my body. I start seeing a thick black fog moving over me, it engulfs me and literally drags me out of my body and starts thrashing me around the room, attacking me etc. I know it's not a sleep paralysis because I can move, struggle against it and stuff. But obviously this thing was a lot stronger than me. A lot of the time it didn't have a defined form, just an invisible force or a black smog. But one time I saw it as a figure and saw its features clearly. The only way I can describe it was as some humanoid creature with scorpion or spider like features? I'm no arachnophobe but this thing was terrifying. 
This thing continued to attack me. Sometimes multiple times a night for weeks on end. Then I'm not sure whether or not the same being or not (it's been happening over such a long time I forget some details) started to have sex with me as violently as the attacks. It was horrible. Traumatic even, as you probably know, you can feel and experience everything the same as waking life. This continued to happen frequently. It fucked me up. Literally thought I was going fucking insane. 


If I recall correctly it stopped for a little while. Maybe this being got bored of me or drained all my energy or whatever. Eventually I started having encounters with another being. Even though I couldnt see him clearly at first I could just sense that he was an entirely different entity. This one would also have sex with me though was far less violent. Like he would allow me to change positions. This is where shit gets weird for me... eventually I did start to enjoy these encounters (best sex of my life. Cannot ever compare to anything else) And would actually want it to appear to me. I would think about him during the day and moss him when I hadn't seen him in a few days. We carried on our "relationship" for months. He would give me pleasure, I could ask him to assume the form of like some tv show character I was attracted to. Stuff like that. Hey sometimes he would even bring along a friend. I grew fond of him. I kid you not we would even just lie in bed together sometimes and kiss. I'm a little embarrassed to admit but he became a part of my life. I would even casually encounter him in dreams.... So anyway. Here is the last encounter with this being. After not seeing him for about a month or something, one night he came to me. He stepped in through my bedroom window and crawled onto my bed looking over me. This was the clearest look I ever got of him (when he wasn't assuming someone else's form), though be it just some featureless shadow figure. I asked him his name. And this is the ONLY time I ever heard him speak. He told me his name but it was unintelligible. It didn't sound like any language. I doubt it was his real name idk. We had sex like normal. I haven't seen him since... it's been well over 6 months. 

I get the feeling he ain't coming back. 

Sorry this was so long. I doubt anyone will even bother reading. But this is my most outstanding experience with AP. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, any questions or if anyone else has similar experiences. Take care.A little more than a year ago, I had an astral experience with someone in which we met Ed and Lorraine Warren. We met with with them in a living room sort of environment. I recall Lorraine more vivid than Ed, she was actually still alive during the time I had this experience. She looked at me very similar to how a grandparent would look at their grandchild. Lorraine was very sweet in my eyes and was very aware that her time as a psychic worker was at its end. Ed on the other hand seemed to only have one objective in mind, and that was protecting Lorraine who I don't even think knew Ed was present at the moment. The woman I had this experience with actually recalls it just the same as I do, we used to continuously verify one another about things like this. Anyway, after speaking to the Warrens, I recall going into their occult museum. There were entities EVERYWHERE! They covered the walls, the ceiling, they infested the room like parasites. But one stood out, one that the other entities didn't suffocate in their vast numbers. This one was in the shape of a small animal, very similar to a cat or a large squirrel. It was a dark red color with tiny horns. It brushed passed me to climb up on the shelves and finally the Annabelle casing, morphing into a much larger version of itself. When it finally lay on top of the case, it wrapped its tail around it as if it were protecting the doll.

I'm not going to pretend to know how these demonic attachments work, but I could tell it was almost obsessed with the doll. It was there in such a way that made me somewhat think it was trapped in the Warren's occult museum, but only to an extent. It honestly always confuses me every time I think about it, because I've seen it in my house before but only once. It's like the entity is trapped but at the same time can leave at will. I don't know if it's only for a certain amount of time or its ability is diminished away from the doll or what, but somehow it's trapped. I'll be honest, this is one of the most perplexing things I've ran into on the astral realm.

Going ahead with my experience though. I saw this entity in my house many months later upon giving it more attention. I woke up in sleep paralysis to it crawling on my bed in its smaller form. I looked down but only saw it in my mind's eye. I felt it climb up my leg and scratch at my back. I actually got up the same night and found very minor scratches on my back.

I drew the entity around the same time I had my first experience with it, here's my drawing; http://imgur.com/a/WbCI9oC

This experience took place a bit over a year ago. I'm honestly not sure why I didn't post it before as it is pretty significant, but most details I haven't shared are personal. I hope this brings something to the AP community, it was very much a wild experience.The first time I astral projected a centipede crawled across my vision.
Today at work I saw the same centipede but plastic on the ground, picked it up and kept it. If you want a picture let me know

[pic of plastic centipede!](https://imgur.com/gallery/Fhtntmx)I’ve been interested in AP and tried it on and off for over 10 years with not much success. Once about 10 years ago I was laying in bed on my back and felt the lower half of my body raise up into the air. It stayed like that for a few moments; however nothing further happened other than that. It did feel really cool though and was exciting to me nonetheless.

Over the years I would basically only try the rope method which never worked. I don’t know if I wasn’t doing it right, or if I wasn’t ready or was too passive about it.

But then a couple weeks ago, it happened. I was laying on my back, focusing on the fan in my room. I “felt” my astral body about to separate and I heard some buzzing in my ear and knew it was time. My astral body separated from my body below my body. I didn’t last long in the astral and was only moving around my room. I remember wanting to visit a specific person but it wasn’t going to happen so I was back in my body.

Then yesterday, I tried AP at about 7:15 am after being awake for a short time. I plugged in headphones and listened to binaural beats (first time trying with this). I was on my back again and when ready I again sort of pushed myself into my bed and my astral body again slowly separated below my body. The feeling is unlike anything I’ve felt before. This time I was unable to see anything in my room at first, and then all of a sudden it was like glasses or something had lifted off my face and I could see! Colour! Again I was only in my room for a short time and remember just seeing weird objects on my dresser. 

Once back in my body I thought to myself I wonder if I can try again, right away. I again was able to feel that separation feeling, and this time l “stepped out” of my body. Now, I’ve read people describing this before and never knew how that could be accomplished but it happened. This time I was travelling on the sea floor. I remember floating several feet above the floor and I actually saw a rope hanging from me that I was hanging onto loosely (I didn’t realize what this was until I woke up and thought about it lol). Then I was being shown some metal door with symbols on the sea floor. I remember saying “I don’t want to see this”. I’m not sure why I felt that way. But I said it and was then back in my bed and awake. I checked the time and all this happened in about 30-45 minutes. 

Anyways not much to report in comparison to some but I’m just very excited especially after learning how it works specifically for me. I will definitely use binaural beats more often too. 

Hope you all stay safe and have a good weekend!Title is pretty self explanatory. I’m a decently experienced astral traveler, and I have a long, long list of things I wish to eventually accomplish and ask within the realm, but I always meet the strangest roadblock: I nearly always encounter entities that wish to engage in sexual activity, and I always get so distracted because of that!

Does anyone else experience things like this? This weird sexual urge when in the astral? It’s extremely annoying as it distracts from my healing purposes. Any input is greatly appreciated :)

EDIT: wow! Thank you all for your continuing advice!! This has been very eye opening and I had no idea it was such a common occurrence. Very much appreciated! I should also add I have a perfectly good sex life and am naturally not an incredibly horny person. The only reason I asked for advice is because it’s actually incredibly hindering to my travels, as fun as it may sound lolI TIME TRAVELED! ⏰ a little bit... It actually felt more like a lucid dream but it was significant enough for me to write it down in my AP journal. 
BACKSTORY: A client contacted me weeks ago to connect me with her chiropractor because she thought we were so alike that we'd hit it off as great friends. After looking this person's socials I chickened out because the whole setup thing seemed really awkward. 
THE TIME TRAVELING: 3 weeks later/a month ago I dreamed that I was outside the building next door and the guy turns up out of the blue after work and we greet each other like we already know each other. 
OUTCOME: Yesterday I had a friend come over for dinner but instead of driving into the car park of my apartment block she drove into the neighboring apartment's car park which is identical to mine and couldn't get out once she realized her mistake. I went next door to start dialing up the apartments on the security keypad to get someone to let her out when I hear foot steps approaching from behind me. I turn around and it's the guy! He lives in the neighboring apartment! ...And because I'd already dreamed this whole thing I was overly familiar with him but soon realized that I actually had to introduce myself and explained that I needed help to get my friend out of his parking garage and THEN I told him who I was. What a hoot. Anyway I contacted him today to invite him over for a drink next week. I'm quite blown away. 
TLDR: Too chicken to meet a guy, dreamed I met him next door, a month later the dream played out and I met the guy.I want to tell you my story of an astral experience that I had years ago, that I remember very vividly - and to this day I find to this day difficult to put into words how I felt being there. Words don’t do this experience justice.... 

I don’t quite remember how I entered into this dimension, but I found myself in it. And I was very lucid and very aware. In fact, it was the most alive, and vivid I have ever felt. Every fiber of my body felt alive, awake, as if my body was running on pure ecstatic energy. I could breathe their air - it was cool and crisp and refreshing. This didn’t feel like a drug high - this was the more pure and natural feeling I’ve ever felt. 

Let me begin with what I do remember - I wound up on this planet. It looked like night time, I remember seeing the sky, stars, and the sky looked “outer spacey” in a way that I can’t quite articulate. Wasn’t a normal night sky. But at the time, I wasn’t too focused on the sky. I remember seeing solid ground underneath me, almost dirt like or “moon -like” ground. Like dust and rocks. Everyone on it looked like humans. They were dancing and celebrating, and it looked like a concert or a festival. There was a HUGE stage, lights, music, I floated down into the celebration and landed right in the middle of the crowd. No one seem to noticed my arrival or they didn’t care. I remember feeling extremely connected with the crowd as one. I just became one with everyone and I felt like everyone felt the same way. Like I just knew they were. Can’t explain why. Like they were all thinking the same thing. Like everyone was on the same wavelength, ecstatic, happy. It wasn’t that overwhelming feeling you get at a normal concert with drunk and drugged out people all around you. No anxiety, just pure joy. the music in this reality wasn’t just music. This was music that I FELT, I heard, I saw, I experienced it, and felt it through everyone else as they were feeling it. It was like the experience was MEANT to be experienced as a whole, by a crowed as one.

Bear with me because I find it hard to put this feeling into words. It  was if I was experiencing their version of sound. This wasn’t just the sound we hear. I think this was a different type of sound, I experienced the sound in my body, not just to my ears. Yes it was playing really loudly through the speakers - in fact - probably more loudly than I think we would be able to physically sustain with our hearing, but it didn’t feel too loud.  I just knew it was very loud. The music just vibrated through my head, effortlessly. It was like I was drowning in that sound, IMMERSED and feeling and thinking NOTHING else but pure sound and ecstasy. And yet I never felt more sober, wasn’t a drug feeling. I remember seeing vivid colors and visuals of everyone there, the stage, so bright and colorful. And I remember the music being just.. perfect. Eargasms. The kind of music that you get lost in with a good pair of headphones. It’s like my body caught the wavelengths of the music and turned it into butter. Like I said, this is the best way I can explain it. 

But It was odd because I knew that something was “off” about this dimension, not in a bad way. You know in a dream when you’re somewhere and you just feel like something is off, like you’re in a parallel universe but you can’t quite put your finger on how things are different or you’re just not fully aware of “something else”? It was that feeling. I just knew I was a visitor there. When I first floated down, I thought I had just astral projected into a real-time event happening somewhere on earth, like an ultra festival or something. But the more I looked around, the more I realized That something wasn’t “right”. That I wasn’t “home”, I was elsewhere. And the more I had this thought, the more the “people” looked at me and it drew attention to me. Like they felt my realization, and they recognized me as who I really was. Then I saw myself appear to them in a body. They all looked at me. Like, who are you? I immediately became EXTREMELY present there. Going from a dream like state to ACTUALLY being there. I felt like I was actually there in physical form. I was shocked. I think before this point I was actually invisible to them. I experienced this point of EXTREME presence in their dimension - this is what I remember the most. This feeling of  ACTUALLY being there fully vivid for a couple of seconds. 

But When I became visible right then, this guy that looked like a gorgeous male human looked at me, we locked eyes. And then immediately, his eyes turned bright yellow and they glowed when he saw me. I felt this electrifying feeling of being alive and there when his eyes glowed. Like he pierced right through my being. I think this was how they communicate with eachother. It was Like he was reading me, trying to figure me out as soon as he spotted me. I think he was trying to communicate with me because I he knew I wasn’t like them. I felt this immense amount of “connection” to this man, as if I knew him, he made me feel connected to him. Like an “I understand you”or “I see you”. Like he wanted to bring me more into that reality. When he saw me I panicked and disappeared. Immediately after I woke up back in my body. I remember feeling so disappointed that I woke up because I probably would never be able to go back to that place again. And I felt like I made real contact with another being in another dimension, that understood me and felt so similar. I wanted to ask him questions, know him better - and I felt he was wanting to communicate with me also. The whole experience was life changing and I wish I could explain it better.Hi all, long term Meditation lover here!  


I recently created a meditation orientated channel based around Meditation and the sub-categories such as Astral Projection & Lucid dreaming.  


Link: [https://www.youtube.com/c/MedistationHQ/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/MedistationHQ/videos)  


Would love to hear any criticism or changes that someone well versed in the Meditation scene would like to be implemented/changed in our videos.  


Hoping to help all Meditation connoisseurs from intermediate to expert with experiencing Astral Projection with ease.  
Happy Astral Projection!I can’t unfortunately. 59/136

Edit.  As of 24 hours after the post  59 people out of 136 can astral project. I have included projection even if you where a child or lost a the ability too. As you have still experienced it. Thank you for your reply’s. If more people respond I will do another update.I received a message on reddit from an account I don’t recognize. The person claimed I met them in the dream world, lucid, and was quite sad. They said I was crying and looking for someone. Apparently while I was lucid I gave the person my account name so they could find me. They also said I lost lucidity midway though our convo.

They left me with a warning: Don’t go dimension hopping. And a string of numbers. 

Here’s the problem: if I was lucid at all, I would have remembered it. I would’ve thought, “wow, I’m dreaming!”. I would’ve been talking to this person and remembered it. Yet I remember no such thing. 

Is this a fake message trying to play on my beliefs?Hiya! Made an account for this! I'm new to all of this too. I've been attempting for about a week and i've gotten to super heavy vibrations it was great tho! Hitting that stage really made me come to a spiritual understanding that unlocking the potential of the human mind is very reachable!

My interpretation on AP: To me, it's consciously being aware that you are falling asleep and that you will leave your body. ALWAYS BE CONSCIOUS GUYS AND GALS!

ADVICE:

1.) Make sure your mindset is in the right place! This is more important than most people know. It's probably the result of most failures in projecting too. But you really must believe you can do it! Remove the word 'can't' from your brain haha! Even if you have never projected, tell your friends you have, get cocky about it! KNOW you can do it (because we all can)!

2.) It's also important to be comfortable. Like, be in a position where you feel like you could lay in that position for ever and ever. You feel nothing wrong on your physical body, just compleeetely comfortable! This is also a great time to bust some myths! You've probably been concerned about what you do when you need to swallow, itch, etc. For me, when i need to swallow I just let it happen. I don't make a big deal out of it. REMEMBER THIS IS ALL MIND OVER BODY. IF YOU THINK SWALLOWING WILL STOP YOU FROM PROJECTING THEN IT WILL. IF YOU THINK IT WILL NOT STOP YOU THEN IT WILL NOT, I PROMISE. As for itches and such, fight through them! It's signs that your body is about to fall asleep (Good job!)

3.) Once you're completeeeeeely comfortable, focus on your breathing! Inhale 4 seconds, exhale for 2 or 3! DO NOT estimate how long you've been doing it. Just Do It (Nike haha!)! If you get the feeling to need to swallow or whatever during this just remember step 2. Just swallow without making a big deal out of it and move on. You will begin to feel a numbing sensation cover your body during your breathing focus (oooo thrilling!) BUT DON'T GET TOO THRILLED haha. Remember to stay calm and collected throughout all of this. The numbness will gradually cover your whole body and feel like a heavy lead blanket.

4.) During this phase is where you can find yourself drifting in and out of dreams. THIS. IS. THE. MAKE. OR. BREAK. If you get caught in a dream then *insert falling noise* *now insert a splat noise* you'll fall asleep and all is for nothing! You're supposed to be conscious that all of this is happening remember?? So, while this occurs,  snap back into conciousness (but don't like literally get up..lol)

5.) If you're at this step, where you're fallin in and out of dreams, oooo baby, the tingling vibrations are upon you! ***this phase was weird for me when it happened. it just happened out of no where! Any extra detail about it would be nice!*** They'll probably start off small, like as if you were humming and your body was vibrating from that. Then gradually to the feeling of a cell phone vibration on you, and possibly out of nowhere with this HUUGE serge of electricity consuming your body! 

6.) If THIS has happened, congratulations, you've gotten as far as I do. My only advice left would be to not freak out like I did and ruin your chance at the experience of a lifetime :) 

I really hope I was able to help at least 1 person!

If you have any other suggestions, methods, or answer to my question on #5 that'd be greatly appreciated! Happy Projecting!Hi AP Reddit,

I'm Cyrus Kirkpatrick. I have a couple of books out like "Understanding Life After Death" and "The Afterlife and Beyond." I was linked to xetrafear's AMA thread where I encountered this strange, doom and gloom interpretation of astral experiences and I was left in my chair cringing.

As my own list of bullet points to consider:

* Your state of mind can project your outer reality, or determine where you're "bound to" in other realms of existence. If you're nihilistic, unhappy, bored, unsatisfied, not connected to spiritual principles of love and acceptance of others, your astral experiences will be inherently negative. Higher dimensions are a mirror of your psyche. If someone is repeatedly bored, unhappy, depressed about AP, its 100% a reflection of themselves.
* The coolest AP trips have been "boring ones" because the mundane nature reflects the reality of other dimensions. A common place I appear is a house that belongs to members of my family. I may appear there by myself, and literally just hang out on my couch on that side until the experience ends. Turning on the TV is especially interesting because it shows the dynamics of a parallel world / a parallel version of this planet. Yes, there's news stations on "the other side" and it's all extremely normal.
* The PRIMARY reason to AP is to connect with deceased loved ones. I recently lost my mother, my father, AND my brother. All of them have appeared in this aforementioned house. During any holiday or my birthday I'm almost guaranteed to end up appearing in an astral state with them to celebrate. 
* I have a parallel life on that side. Projection is often just the ability to merge my consciousness from here to my consciousness there. i am very often at a beach house in Mexico. Parties are better on that side, and when everyone can fly and teleport around, it's even better. 
* I've verified people's identities by looking them up on Facebook or finding their obituaries. Many on that side are dead people from here, although you'll also meet other people with lives here who are projecting. Dead people can be very frank to explain they lived here, died, went there. In one instance, I connected with a family member of a deceased person I met on that side.
* Is the Light a demiurge? Maybe. A lot of reports about this. Interesting fact, I've never met a dead person living astrally who encountered "The Light", yet near death experiencers here do... Why is it that happy crossed over people don't recollect The Light, but a small minority of NDE subjects do? I'm not sure. To be safe, I'd say it's best to skip on "The Light" at death if you have the option of going into it. Many "Light" experiences seem to involve merging into "God" and disappearing into it, but why do that when there's other realities to explore? Seems suspicious.
* The astral universe is just OUR OWN universe on a higher wavelength. For example, you're still in our solar system. A planet like Venus that's lifeless here is teeming with life there.
* Mediumship is real. Talented mediums have communicated to people I've met astrally, and then I'll meet them astrally and they'll describe having reached out to me via the medium and wondering how it went or if their messages came across accurately. 
* There's higher realms that are extremely sublime and beautiful, but I don't really access them or care to because friends / family are on the astral planetary level. For more on those realms, see the works of Jurgen Ziewe.

&#x200B;So many methods rely on visualization which leaves those of us with aphantasia feeling screwed. With that in mind I thought up this aphantasia-friendly method for AP and have been using it with success. (Not only is it good for AP, but even if you're NOT trying to AP it's still great practice if you wanna learn to visualize.)

Put simply, this method subtly manifests you on the astral, rather than projecting you directly into it from your body. Idk what to call it or if it's already been done by someone else, but it goes like this:

I lay down in darkness+silence, close eyes, don't move for at least 20 minutes so body can fall asleep. Without visualizing I pretend I'm standing in a room- do this by imagining the feeling of standing upright. I always pretend I'm in a room I'm familiar with, like a place from a movie or video game. That way I don't need to see to know my surroundings. (For some reason this method works faster and better with a made-up room than one that exists IRL. Also it's best to pick a place that's very bright.) Then I pretend to do some menial, PHYSICAL task. My go-to task is scrubbing floors. I really immerse myself in it: I imagine the sound the brush makes, the feeling of kneeling on the floor, the smell of the cleaning chemicals, my repetitive muscle movements as I'm doing it. You need to stimulate every sense except sight, and as vividly as you're able. Sight will come on its own.

You need to BE THERE. You need to forget about your physical body+surroundings and pretend they no longer exist; it's just you and this imaginary place. Eventually both you AND the place will manifest on the astral plane. The longer you do this and get closer to success, the gradually your astral sight will come. By the time it's worked you should be fully projected and able to see with your astral eyes.

This method works for me every time. It's best to do it thoughtlessly rather than with focus, so you can practically forget about it while you're doing it. That's why I choose a menial task. While doing it I'll zone out and lose track of time then before I know it I'll look up and realize I can see and I'm now in my astral form in that imaginary place for real. Then from there I can teleport anywhere (my house, friend's house, famous place, etc.) That's pretty much it. I really hope this works for y'all. And if it doesn't, don't get discouraged.

My advice: Don't ever hesitate to modify a method as much as you need. In fact, that should be encouraged. Trying to perfectly replicate someone else's method can actually make it harder, and makes it more frustrating when you do it precisely and it still doesn't work. Get creative. Experiment. Accommodate for yourself. In the end what you do doesn't even matter so long as it works for you.i don't know what to do but im fucking terrified right now and not in the good way that everyone here seems to experience. i did a lot of reading up in this sub last night and decided to just try something very simple my first time to see if i could get out of my body and into the room (just imagined myself getting up out of the recliner i'm in over and over) but i didn't. i'm pretty sure i just fell asleep. but i think whatever i did i must have opened myself up to something because my dream was abruptly interrupted to the sensation of all the vibrations people on here mention. it felt less like i was trying to leave and more like i was being pulled against my will. i heard a raspy voice that started saying things like "i've been looking for you" and "i searched a moon with the face of terra..." and i was trying to tune it out as i was getting scared but it kept going on about me and i remember it saying i "look to be about 31" (i'm not, i'm almost a decade younger, though i have some grey hair and could probably be mistaken for someone older). then the vibrations got much, much more intense and i felt a touch to my neck that was like lips and i heard "can you feel me?". the whole thing could have been very pleasant under different circumstances or tone but this was just downright scary. it felt threatening. i don't know what i did to stop the vibrations but i just kept pushing back against the feeling of being pulled and trying to still the vibrations and i was able to wake up and open my eyes. i had the sense for a moment or two i was still being watched but that could have just been in my head as i was still really scared and didn't want to even move.

honestly i'm begging someone to tell me it was just a dream or sleep paralysis or at least how to prevent that from ever happening again because that was not something i want to experience again. i thought i was going to have a fun and freeing experience, not be assaulted.Hi all, yesterday I had my first astral projection experience after trying to for months. It wasn’t ideal and I think this is a lesson of some sort to work on my inner fears. I went drinking during the day with my aunt, and came home and knocked out. We had sangria but it hit us strongly though not too much either. It was still early, like 7pm so at 11pm I woke up and because I couldn’t go back to bed, I took a melatonin since I knew the alcohol would mess with my circadian rhythm. 

Went back to bed and I really couldn’t sleep though I felt that I really really wanted to. I spent two hours thinking about a recent friendship break up that really hurt. I was angry and prayed that I would heal from it. 

So. Eventually I started thinking of positive things and imagining that I would have new friends. Then I felt myself fall asleep but my mind was still racing so I had really really bad sleep paralysis. It was the worst. I’m pretty sure I was talking asking for help. I could feel my body being held down. 

Then I said it. I was like “astral project” and I did. I sat in my bed, “on top” of my body. But I got terrified I got so scared even though I was excited. I laid back down on top of my body and tried going home. And it’s weird cuz I don’t think I did immediately even though I laid back down on my body. I think I was still out of body. Eventually I was really scared even though I was excited and was in this empty house with walls painted white and hallways though no doors just room after room and these two women were tantalizing me. I told myself that I am protected and they can’t hurt me and that helped. Finally when I was awake, I prayed again before going back to sleep and having another weird dream. It wasnt quite a lucid dream though, though I knew I was having a nightmare. 

I think what happened was I astral projected and eventually fell asleep and just woke up normally. And knew that was the worst nightmare I’ve ever had and felt it was one of the worst moments of my life. That fear. 

I won’t lie, I was a little bit confused about whether astral projection was just envisioning you were somewhere and really believing it which I love to do often through guided meditations. After last night and that out of body experience of just sitting, I know it’s very very real and I’m excited to try it again after a good day when I’m emotionally somewhere better—not from alcohol and melatonin induced sleep paralysis. But wow it felt like my consciousness left my body. And like I was light/vibration. How dope.I think it’s a really interesting subject and as a basis for a novelThe Buddha mastered all meditative states, he called jhanas. Here's a list of his powers, including astral projection, which he calls the mind-made body.

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water — eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread — and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way — with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability — the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.'

The Mind-made Body

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.'

Supranormal Powers

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. Just as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way — with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability — the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers...

Clairaudience

He hears — by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human — both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. Just as if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms.

Mind Reading

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. Just as if a young woman — or man — fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not.

Recollection of Past Lives
-

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details. Just as if a man were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.'

But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.'

The Ending of Mental Fermentations

And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life, higher and more sublime than this, there is none."I need to ask her a question but don’t know how, someone suggested astral projection.This thread is based on the "[the god frequency](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/emgpgt/the_god_frequency/)" thread posted earlier today.

Op talks about listening to a modified version of the Focus 15 tapes from the Monroe Institute that supposedly gives the listener a very intense and clear OBE by listening to the tapes alone. Op also claims that he paid $30k for this tape from someone on the dark web. Op claims that the tape is basically the Focus 15 tape with very intensely increased frequencies. OP has expressed that they have no intention of sharing the tapes with this community.So I thought if it's just a matter of finding the correct frequencies then it is in the realm of possibility for us to find it ourselves so that we may share it with this sub.

\*So what is my goal here?\*My goal is to have any audio aficionado with the relevant technical knowledge and skill help us in modifying and increasing the frequencies on the Focus 15 tape. (So far /u/sethhb99 has volunteered to start with modifying the tape) With the modified tape we as a community can then start listening to it and try to induce ap's from it. We then share and discuss our experiences so that we may learn how far off we are from finding the correct frequencies that OP talks about.

That is if what OP claims is real and does exist. I am skeptical, but still willing to put in the effort to try and see for myself. My goal is to find it! With the help of this lovely community I truly do believe we can succeed!

So for anyone interested in following or helping out with this project I ask that you join the Discord I made for this purpose. All relevant announcements and info will be posted there and discussions can be had. The tapes will also be shared there and any progress we make.

See you on the Discord!

Astral Frequencies Discord link: [https://discord.gg/prqAtrC](https://discord.gg/prqAtrC)Background: I’m a soon to be Ex Jehovah’s Witness. I was raised to be distrustful of things like psychs and occult practices as they come from the devil. I’ve always had a natural curiosity about all this however and seem to be drawn to it. I discovered AP a bit ago and have been doing some research on it. If I’m understanding correctly the predominant belief is that we have eternal souls and we are here on earth for some reason or to learn some lesson (correct me if I’m wrong). The heart of my question is this; if that’s the case then where does that fall with human evolution? Back when their were neanderthals and the like would our eternal spirit still come here for the same reasons? What would is the point of the development of the human species if this is like a training ground? I hope I’m making sense.Hey i wanna hear if some if u fokes could astral travel and maybe seek answers to this question?-- EDIT: This A.M.A. is closed. Thank you guys for your questions! --

Hello there!

I am an experienced projector from the subreddit and a moderator, and in this post you can ask me anything related to astral projection and lucid dreaming. 

A bit of my credentials: I also have done three A.M.A.s in the past; here's the [first ask me anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/nvs4mh/feel_free_to_ask_me_about_ap/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [the second A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pnicd8/i_have_been_projecting_for_years_ask_me_anything/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [the third one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/q8muqi/i_have_been_projecting_for_years_ask_me_anything/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I am also the author of the AP book [The Illusion of Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pc3ipt/my_ap_book_the_illusion_of_method_is_available_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I am here at your disposal to answer your doubts about AP or LD.

Please keep your questions on-topic!There are various ways to awaken energetic systems in our bodies for astral travel. Working with chakras is one of them. At the baseline, chakras are intention-based. The outline gives us a range of affirmations and exercises for projection (that has worked for me!)

Under the chakra system, the crown and 3rd eye practices are most talked about. And that makes sense, as we associate these points to higher planes beyond the physical. However, I felt just how important it is to start with grounding. Our root chakra provides a powerful channel for pulling gaian energy that nourishes and strengthens the rest of our energetic points.

Grounding means to honor our human vessel and connect to the present moment. We can ground ourselves by eating, drinking, dancing, stepping outside with bare feet, and talking to trees, altogether feeling our linkage to Mother Earth. When we immerse ourselves in waking moments, the pursuit transcends to the subconscious. Grounding becomes easier in the astral, resulting in more clarity, longer flights, and sustained experiences we can bring back to our everyday lives.

I’ve always wanted to write this out. Thanks for reading!Ive always wondered about aliens, but then I think people who have astral projected probably have been to other plants so why not ask them.Hi everyone, I just wanted to share something that occured to me tonight that I think may be aiding my AP.

About three weeks ago, my doctor. suggested that I switch to a mostly plant-based diet due to a medical condition.

I have been APing for about a year, but since the time that I cut way down on animal products (haven't gone completely vegetarian), I've started astral projection several times a week, when before it was more like once or twice a month, and I'm now more able to make it happen when I want to rather than just waiting for it to happen sporadically.

It happened really quickly too, just after a few days of eating very little meat or dairy I had a really intense AP, and they've just kept coming. Not all of them have been intense or extremely interesting, but they have been frequent! 

I don't think it's a placebo effect either, because I didn't even put two and two together until today, I was only focusing on improving my health; astral projection was not really on my radar,  but my diet is the only thing that had changed.

It may be a total coincidence, but I just wanted to share.So for about a year I’ve been smoking cannabis - great for my ptsd, but it also really helps me not AP. Its something I’ve done naturally for over 30 years. 

Well throw my theory cannabis prevent AP because I’ve been popping out a lot this week. 

Yesterday I was taking a nap, when I felt and heard the all to familiar buzzing sound. And I see the glimpse of a space craft. So what do I mean by glimpse. Well in my experience there’s this moment - usually during the buzzing - that you’re living in both worlds so to speak. You’re seeing out of your physical eyes and your astral body’s eyes as well. This is when people typically wake up or freak out etc. so you just have to really connect to the AP aspect and ditch trying to control your physical body 

So I see the ship, and I have another story of this ship if anyone is interested, and I’m like ok what do you guys want. But when I’m finally able to project myself there - and this ship is circling earth FYI - it’s a giant craft - red lights inside with red lights on the outside as well. So my thought process changes when I finally get there. I’m like yo stop circling and help us humans this shits getting old and y’all are moving too slow. So I’m walking around the ship trying to find someone to essentially complain to lol just raging like a typical Karen. But I only find other humans. I’m like yo are you human? I am too! Where are they at, they need to help us. I run into three people all who act like they’re in a trance and don’t even realize they’re on a ship. One woman is sitting in a simulated garden - I try to explain she’s on an alien ship - but she doesn’t understand. 

Finally I hear them behind me, but before I can turn and question these guys I hear them discussing things like how did she get here and how they need to put me back down. At this point I can feel I’m losing it. If you have APed before you might experience this where you start to lose consciousness and go back to your body without waking up. Best thing I can do to avoid this is jump up and down and fighting it(works the same in lucid dreaming) but I can’t turn, I know they’re sending me back down and I do actually fully wake up 

It was really fucking odd - the entire thing was different from most experiences I’ve had - and certainly they didn’t want me there, and I’ve been doing all I can to not pop out - so why do I keep going out? When I was younger I had a teacher that I never met train me how to AP - I don’t sense that presence any longer but I do feel like something is influencing this behavior other than myself. 

Thanks for readingaped yesterday and some demon looking skull appeared in front of me and was demented and I laughted and told it to fuck off and it vanished lol just wanna post this here and give myself a pat on the backI was reading a question about use of psychedelic drugs by blind people if they could see, let me to wonder what if blind people when they come out of their body can see. I thought bout questions are SUPER interesting.

Love and Light ❤️Since NASA might've discovered a parallel universe where time runs backwards, I figured it'd be the perfect time to ask you guys if you ever visited any other planets or universes. I've heard other stories about this and it sounded pretty rad.Had my first successful projection today and something strange happened which pretty much confirmed that it's real, at least for me.

This morning I woke up at around 5 A.M. and I had heard that AP is best done in the mornings in a waking state so instead of going straight back to sleep I put on my headphones and listened to a guided Astral projection hypnosis video on YouTube. After about 30 minutes I started to feel an almost euphoric vibration similar to that of sleep paralysis but not quite. I used the rope technique and what do you know I successfully had an OBE. The funny thing is I was actually expecting to fail and did not think much of it and I think this contributed by having me stay calm and still my body completely during the technique. I awoke and I could just tell I was in the Astral plane. But I got too excited and I could feel the world slowly fading away as I woke back up. But here's the strange part, my cat was resting next to my pillow as she usually does and she was staring at me with that wide eyed "wtf" look cats always give. As soon as I woke up I looked at her and her fur was slightly raised and she was giving me that same exact look. This rarely happens as she's never scared of humans. It could be a coincidence but it was all just too perfect, so although I was skeptical before I now believe that your consciousness is actually leaving your body during these OBEs somehow.Wim Hof guided me out of this universe.

I had an amazing experience last night and I want to try to encapsulate it as best I can.

Lately I’ve been experimenting with meditation and different breathing techniques before I go to sleep. Last night I did guided Wim Hof breathing for the first time and it was incredible.

I was in my bed laying on my back in a very comfortable position, with both my dogs on other side of me cuddling me. I closed my eyes, put in airpods, put a colorful led nightlight I have on my chest (solar plexus to be precise) which is an Indian chakra. And listened to Wim Hof and let him lead me to what felt like outside of this physical universe. 

The first sensation was a tingly feeling throughout my entire body. As this tingle persisted, it grew in intensity and I slowly lost the ability to move my physical body. I had experienced this once when I was a kid at a sporting event because I hyperventilated, but this time I knew I was breathing so it didn’t alarm me. I continued to focus on my breath. At this point I had lost complete control over my body. Every square inch of my body was locked and pulsating with this tingly feeling. It was as if a static vibrational wave occupied my body. Then I began to get this strange feeling of everything existing as energy (a very extraordinary feeling that I felt weeks prior on a psilocybin trip). I could feel my entire room, but my eyes were closed. I perceived things not in 3D, not in regular space or time. But in terms of energy. I felt as if I had morphed and became a part of everything I was touching. My dogs, my bed, the blankets on top of me. There realized that energy has no boundaries. EVERYTHING is energy.

This is where it gets really extraordinary. As I’m finishing the third cycle (approx 15 minutes total) and I breath out my last breath you hold without any air and fuck me when I tell you that at this point you seize to exist. I should also point out that Wim Hof holds the world record for many feats of cold endurance and lung capacity that he attributes to achieving this state. This light that was on my chest was displaying a variety of LED lights and when my eyes were closed I was in a reality just as present as the physical reality and it would morph colors as the light changed. 

For a quick second I got scared, I realized that I had no more control over my body and that I was in sleep paralysis, which I had only heard bad things about. For only a few seconds I was terrified, I thought if I opened my eyes there would be a hyper dimensional Demon sitting on my chest about to kill me. I then realized that whatever fundamental being that’s enjoying this human body host, would just return to the universe if this “Demon” were to kill me, I went back to focusing on my breath and entered the most bliss state of consciousness. Nirvana even. I realized that I had nothing in the universe to fear, that we aren’t humans experiencing the universe rather we are the universe having a human experience, that matter is condensed energy held to a vibration, and that energy transcends everything. As profound as this experience is it continues to get more weird. 

In elementary school I joined a program to help the kids at our school with disabilities. I quickly grew close to the one girl in particular (who’s name I’ll keep anon just because). She has severe autism, and suffered from very low social intelligence for that reason. However me and her had a mutual bond, even tho we had never carried a conversation or even made eye contact. We both had a love for cheese it’s, long story short we built a connection even though the odds of that happening weren’t great. She always made this distinct hand shape which is common amongst ppl with autism and would stare at her hands with the upmost fascination and shake them. 

When finished the full Wim Hof cycle I opened my eyes to my surprise I was in that exact position I just described even tho that isn’t the position I went into when I started and didn’t ever move at all. My hands were moving in the most beautifully fractal way. It reminded me of paintings of Indians goddess’ with multiple arms moving symbiotically. I had no control over any of this. After about 10 seconds I regained some control of my body but at this point I was crying because this experience was so amazing. I had a profound thought that people with autism are so smart because their mind sits at a higher level of consciousness (like the one I had achieved through meditation and controlled breathing) but for some reason it negatively impacts social skills and physical ability. Not sure how accurate/far fetched the idea is but I was fully convicted of this at the time. 

I ended up completing two more full Wim Hof cycles that night, each equally as incredible. 

Sorry for the exquisitely long post I just felt I needed to share.

I originally posted this to r/spirituality and it got such an overwhelmingly positive response I decided to share it in here too, I highly recommend this mans technique.

Thank you all for sharing this experience with me.i wanted to try to astral project in the middle of the night since ive been woken up cause i needed to pee. Went back to bed, imaging myself doing a random action repeatedly.

After 2 or 3 mins, i started to shake really hard, it was amazing, never experienced something like that, i had vibration before, but not that powerfull.
I notice that all in my room was shaking, then.... i heard my mother calling me frightened...

I was like: what?!..... i get up and all the room was still shaking... turned out that was an earthquake. lol

I total lucid dreamed then turned into an AP. I am 100% absolutely blown away by this experience and it was easy to incorporate the tricks people say they use to make it happen. 

I had a period on my life where I was dealing with some really nasty sleep paralysis to the point that i got very very good at recognizing when I was in a sleep state/dream state/paralyzed state and someone on here mentioned the buzzing/static TV sound that they associate with it and I remember thinking yea I know that sound just the barest hum of it will snap me into my body bc I refuse to be in sleep paralysis, well anyways they said to swallow the fear it induces and face the sound and try to “mentally increase it” and well - that’s what i’ve been doing and it’s been getting me into more and more lucid dreams and well - finally I was out of body. That was unreal.

I’m blown away that just casual having this sub in my thread was able to create this experience for me! Thank you allSo this happened 4 months ago, I did an LBRP and then decided to try astral projection, I laid down on the floor and just imagined taking flight, and away I went, flying with no control (or need for control) over different landscapes. Wound up in a tropical island, climbed a coconut tree and noticed a 10 year old Mowgli-type kid, then I sat by him and gave him a coconut... The thing that terrified me was that I felt immense sexual attraction to the kid and a strong urge to act on it. So I escaped immediately, found myself in a volcano, toured it for a bit then exited the AP state. Never did it again. 
Clearly this shows some things about me that I have to contend with, please don't judge me, I live by a very strict moral code, and would never do anything to harm anyone (in case you're wondering). 
My question is, how do people deal with encounters with other entities on the astral plane? Is there like a set of guidelines for this stuff? I'd like to AP again but I don't want to go through things I will later regret, so I would appreciate some guidance, thank you!Last night I was meditating and I could feel my body start to vibrate. I have gotten to this stage before in previous attempts but one thing that happened this time was I heard strange sounds. I can’t describe exactly what I heard but I know that it wasn’t usual sounds that I hear at night. It almost sounded like whispers but they were intelligible. Having not heard these sounds before, I momentarily panicked before calming myself down with positive thoughts. Was I close to astral projecting? And if so, how can I better prepare myself so that when I do hear noises I don’t freak out? Thank you :)Today was my 3rd successful AP. Now that I've had some practices under different conditions, different times of day,, and varying states of alertness and focus, I've been able to pick up on some patterns. The things that have been common for me with my successful ones are they they are done in the morning after a full night's sleep and with between 60-90 minutes of meditation followed by "giving up trying" and rolling over on my side as if I'm going to go back to sleep (but without the intention of actually sleeping...more just like rest in bed a while longer. Then I finally do start getting the drifting mind necessary and the before I know it, BAM. And it's almost like I DO actually start drafting off to sleep - like that last little bit at the end of the HG phase-  but then the vibration, ears ringing, whirring noise, and "sucking" sensation pulls just my consciousness back and off I go.
Today when that happened, where my mind had drifted to was me dancing to Britney Spears "Oops I did it again." I was doing the actual music video choreography (I'm a dancer, this isn't unusual 😆) and when I noticed I was about to separate I tried to just go with what I was doing to keep me from getting too excited and coming back and to just flow with what was happening. I stuck with this one move of my arms circling around because it felt like as I moved them around, I was dancing out of my body - just gradually further and further away. I was lying on my side and being rolled backwards out of it before the force picked up, rotated me face up, and then with a massive force pulled me from the chest. The hilarious part was that "Oops I did it again" continued to play in my ear, but now it was like a speaker in my ear accompanying the ride. It reminded me of the rip ride rockit at Universal 😆 For the rest of the time, I just continued flying around. The force would change direction and I continued to be pulled by different parts of my body - head first diving down, going through a floor, Flipping around and then being grabbed by my upper back and pulled back up again... it was actually pretty fun and I had the intention to just relax, explore, and go wherever it took me. (The song did fade out eventually). When I landed back in my body, it was the most obvious return yet. I could feel it landing finishing with my arm that was draped over top of my body almost like it "clicked" back into place. At that moment, I realized I was back and fully conscious but where I was in my head did not match where I knew I was in my bedroom. I knew it would be too jarring to open my eyes too quickly so I just laid there with my eyes closed for a minute trying to reconcile the difference - allowing myself to be completely in this other place in my head before opening my eyes and fully entering this reality. 
I know I'm just getting started here and so excited to see where this journey eventually takes me!Today started off really rough for me. I've been suffering from panic attacks lately and it has me feeling really confused and frustrated especially on a spiritual level where I had been making progress. 

Today I had a panic attack right before an important meeting that I ended up having to skip out on because I couldn't calm down. I felt so low energy and low vibe. When I get low like that, it's like a train of negative thoughts comes plowing through my head.

When I got home, I was exhausted and still shaky and decided to take a nap. I woke up hearing super strange loud sounds. The sounds were a little unsettling and creepy and when I tried to get up I realized I was in sleep paralysis. I instantly thought "Okay I'm not dealing with some low energy bull sh&$5 right now and I don't have the time or energy to be scared" so I decided to try to calm down and amplify my energy to raise my vibrations. I enter the vibrational state (which I have experienced many times before) and with fierce determination I astral projected and clapped my hands together and this brilliant blue light exploded out. As I clapped my hands together in a prayer type position I said to myself "Only my higher self and inner being are allowed to be with me right now". 

I was then almost put back into my body but taken on this insane experience. I could relate it to how people describe the effects of DMT but I wouldn't know personally.

This beautiful violin and piano started playing and I was taken on the visual journey through mountains. The imagery was flashing so fast and at one point I was looking at myself sleeping while simultaneously seeing these beautiful places and hearing this beautiful music. I began crying like balling my eyes out with the amount of love and support I felt...it was so strange at the same time. *As I'm writing this my phone says 4:44* 
Eventually I lose awareness and fall back asleep only to wake up again hearing creepy sounds. And I thought once again "nope, I want to be away from here, from these weird sounds". And I went on another visual journey and unfortunately I only remember 2 images. One was an outline of me as a little girl but I was rapidly changing colors...like all the colors of the rainbow. And another I believe was a clue to something I'll see in the future..it was a cloth with symbols on it...it had names and dates and I tried hard to read them but it's all blurry now. On this second visualize journey there was more music playing but it was in a different language. It sounded a lot like sanskrit. 

Eventually I lost my awareness again and fell back asleep at some point.

I've had AP experiences before but this was by far the most interesting and uplifting and unexpected one I've ever had. It felt like a much needed spiritual hug after having such a bad dayI once had a dream that I was walking around Wal-Mart. I was walking up and down aisles, some customers were around, etc. The dream was so long, and a lot happened during it. Some customers talked for a long time about different things. It must've dragged on 15 minutes, at the minimum.

But when I woke up, I swear only like half a minute on the clock went by. It made zero sense.

I read that when you dream, your subconscious mind is tuned into the astral dimension. No time in the astral realm, according to various psychics, mediums, etc. According to these psychics (like Edgar Cayce), the astral exists at a higher frequency than earth, the subconscious eternally lives there.

Does anyone else notice time feels like it passes faster in dreams?I’ve noticed that there is only a small percentage of people in the world that can astral project. Even on this forum, with over 60,000 subscribers, most are just fascinated with the concept.I don’t understand why this has happened to someone as simple as me. I guess I’m not as simple as I’ve always thought. I wonder why this phenomenon is so hidden from the world. I had never even heard of it before I experienced it. Robert Monroe tried his best to get the word out but so few people actually listened. Most people automatically assume it’s fake and don’t give it a second thought. Why is that though? Why is it that others can actually do it and most won’t even acknowledge the concept?This ability has really changed my life. I never asked for it but yet it came to me and I am forever grateful. I was so scared of death before I experienced this miracle. I want people to know the truth. Astral projection exists and it is proof of afterlife. You don’t have to be scared of dying, I promise. If you are in pain after losing someone close to you, know that they have lived on beyond this physical form.I had my first experience actually getting out of my body after trying many times basically since the summer. I am so excited! I felt at times like it would never happen but I’m so glad I stayed positive and kept trying. Here were some of the highlights:

Looking at myself in my bathroom mirror: I looked like myself but I had patches of pink skin that sort of glowed with lots of little purple/black spots inside of them. 

On my way to the bathroom, I noticed a small preying mantis toy on the ground, as I looked at it it morphed a little bit almost into like a Pokémon type of character and then when I touched it, I immediately sensed that it was actually my cat! I heard and felt it purr loudly and I saw a purple and pink splash of color with the subtle outline of a cat’s face and whiskers and I knew it was my kitty.

When I got out of my house I saw a hooded figure that scared me. When I encounter scary stuff in my body, I imagine a white light surrounding me and protecting me so I did that, but instead manifested a light that shined out from the middle of my palm. I shined it on the being and it’s hood disappeared and it started to run. I manifested a spear and started attacking it (I honestly feel bad about this, I don’t think it was trying to hurt me at all). But when I stabbed it, it just smiled at me and said “you got me!”

Those are the highlights of my first ap experience and I can’t wait to try again!lately I've took a step back to lucid dreaming, find it alot easier to lucid dream now since AP require much more concentration. While I was lucid my dream started to fade away and I felt intense vibrations all over my body. It felt like it I was floating and my feet were on my headboard( which would make no sense because I sleep to my head near my headboard). As I open my eyes still vibrating  a tablet is in front of me with Jack black on the screen . 'You bettteerrr stoooop , the government going to geeettt you they're gonna FINNND YOUU their right outside your window. YOU BEETTERRR STOOOP' it's like he was mocking me lmao. I " woke up"  and I looked it up on reddit and turns out jack black was just an AP troll called AP assarse. Then I woke up fr in real life. lmao my understanding of the astral realm and the places I go is non-existent at this point.I was thinking before I went to sleep, and I realized that this amazing childhood experience I had was 100% astral projection. When I was a kid- I mean, really, really young, maybe 3-5, I cannot remember the exact age- I loved fairies and really wanted wings. I was very fascinated by being able to fly and I would buy these fairy wands. My parents used to tell me that if I was good, I would get fairy wings at night. They told me to wish for fairy wings before I went to sleep and that I would get them in the night. I remember wishing a few times, hoping... then, one night, I had wished for fairy wings and I woke up in the middle of the night. I saw blue energy particles all around my room, like the air was alive and there was just this beautiful light blue glow everywhere.  Then, I realized that I could fly. I flew around my room. It felt so natural, like something I had all along. I had bright blue butterfly wings. The next morning I knew what had happened, but it did not seem like some crazy unexpected event in my mind. I knew with absolute certainty that this had indeed happened, but did not think much of it. As I grew older, I forgot this entirely. I thought it must have just been a dream. Now, I just had the realization that this was actually APing. 

&#x200B;

The power that children have blows my mind. I remember being the same age and being able to visualize certain beautiful places in my mind and being able to go there in my mind, completely putting myself into a trance-like state. It was so natural. As kids, we never questioned things like this. We knew our power and knew what the world was really like. We never asked because we never forgot. I just thought that I would share this really cool experience with you guys. I have known about astral projection for 9 years but only just made the connection between this cool experience and APing!!!Hey! I’ve learned the ability to see stars and fly around the solar system, but this happened when I close my eyes and begin to meditate for a minute. Not sure if i have to be sleeping for this to be considered “astral projection”. I have a write up [here ](https://energywavesymptom.blogspot.com/2020/12/we-are-black-sun.html) for the curious.My soul feels like it’s being pulled out of my body today. I usually don't feel like this, but today it feels like something is trying to pull my body and soul apart. Anyone else feels like this? Got any advice?My novel is almost complete, but as a person who has no connections to publishers/editors/etc, I've decided to begin writing side stories on Medium to potentially drive interest.  

Perhaps others will care - [https://medium.com/@TheDelusionalWriter/worlds-anna-perkins-1051d089d2a1](https://medium.com/@TheDelusionalWriter/worlds-anna-perkins-1051d089d2a1) and I can release some more before my book is finished.  In the same way our dreams may be real, I'm attempting to write a story that could turn out to be a version of the truth in the end.

Thanks for the time.I’ll tell you guys about the first and only time (so far) that I've astral projected.

So I was at the studio with some friends around midnight, and we decided to go take a smoke break.

We hotboxed my buddy’s car, and I got so high to the point that I was uncomfortable. Afterwards, we went back upstairs to finish some of our beats.

I was still feeling out of sorts and decided to go deal with my anxiety in the restroom. My best friend came in with me to help me relax.

It happened while we were in there. We were standing in the middle of the room chatting, and then all of a sudden, I was warped to the middle of space.

I looked around, terrified. I was surrounded by emptiness and darkness, with nothing around me except for stars millions and millions of miles away. My body was gone too. 

I was only there for a couple of seconds- as quickly as I had gone there, I had come back into my body.

The sensation of coming and going to that point in space is hard to describe. It felt as if my mind had accelerated and warped, and then in an instant, I was somewhere new. 

When I was back, my friend said it looked as if I had seen a ghost. What scared me the most was how alone I was in the expanse. It was just me, and nothing in all directions. Above me, below me, around, nothing but space.

I think it freaked me out so much because I wasn’t expecting it. I felt like I didn’t have much say in the matter and just went somewhere else.  

Regardless, the concept of astral projection is really fascinating and incredible. I’m hoping one day I can learn to leave on my own terms, and see some of the amazing places some of you folks have seen.

EDIT: SpellingIts valentines day. You're single. So just meet me for an astral time! Totally unaffiliated, I just got the book yesterday and am blown away by the plethora of knowledge contained here.  As someone with long time interest and little experience, it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for.  

Thanks to u/Morgoth37 for the recommendation on his Astral Club channel.  You rock man, I love the content!  Can’t wait to put it into practice.

Seriously, what are you waiting for?  Go read it now!Edit: shortened post by removing text I found unnecessary, also a very good point in the comments section about dyslexia and ADHD

Edit 2: another great point in comments on the wordiness of the guide. I'm considering compiling a "Super Short Summarized AP Beginners' Guide".

Here are some reasons why you should be doing this:

- you'll find most answers there
- you get answers to questions you haven't even thought of. 
- after sufficient researching, maybe you'll think of a question none of us thought of. 
- ** a lack of these posts will allow genuinely important posts to be seen, for people who genuinely need help. **
- deeper understanding of AP and beyond. 

Sorry for the whole "policing" vibes, I'm not a mod. In any case, there is nothing inherently wrong with what you're doing, but AP is a skill that needs cultivation. Unless you have a serious issue that prevents you from reading the post, you're only doing yourself a favour by going through the guide.For the last six weeks I have been practicing what's I thought to be fake at first, being astral projection, but after a bit of time of practice I was able to almost imagine myself eating a hot dog in front of Home Depot with the deep scent of cherry wood fences in the background. Shit was insane and so surreal it felt I was actually there, then everything snapped back and I was sad for the rest of the day.So...Many people 'visit' the other side on a temporary basis, tethered to their bodies or their consciousness is not 100% there, but what is day to day life like when truly existing there?   
 

I've gathered a lot of information not only from other writers, but in my own experiences I've interviewed roughly two dozen people, usually random people i meet, and I ask specific questions about what their lives are like. Through that, I've compiled a few major points, but there's a lot more to discover, obviously. The full explanations are at my video (see  [https://youtu.be/sPSOVn1q3Tc](https://youtu.be/sPSOVn1q3Tc) ) so these are just the brief versions of the points:   
 

\- Their world is their Earth, etc, they don't see their world as the "astral plane", only we use that terminology.   
 

\- Abilities we'd consider supernatural, from psi to telekinesis, are normal abilities for them that are not unusual whatsoever.   
 

\- Time is reflected differently, with much less scheduling or awareness of days in the week, things tend to happen "right now" or not at all, unlike here where we plan things out for months.   
 

\- Enhanced mental abilities exist that are also just normal. So clarity of thought is expanded, including almost instant 'dreaming' states or veering into other realms just by thinking about it (but to others it can look like someone is snoozing or in a trance)   
 

\- Things go on like here in a strangely familiar way, including politics, government, companies, and so forth.   
 

\- The astral plane is not 100% safe and happy. People who CHOOSE to get involved in wars or conflict or other situations could put their astral bodies in jeopardy of being destroyed, and it's not a good thing to end up in that situation. People even report getting sicknesses from viruses or bacteria operating on that spectrum, but it's rarely worse than cold like symptoms or a nuisance, compared to the devastating effects on this planet.   
 

\- And more (See the video, would take all day to type it all up.) \[https://youtu.be/sPSOVn1q3Tc\](https://youtu.be/sPSOVn1q3Tc)im kinda new to this all but i’m pretty sure you can meet other people while APing, but has anyone intentionally tried to do so with a friend or something? what was it like? could u communicate? seems like a cool thought.For the first time ever, I did it!

Note that at this time, I wasn’t actively trying to AP. I actually forgot that it is one of my goals. Last time I tried to do it manually was months ago, but to no effect.

Okay. So, it was this morning. I woke up a bit early than usual. I ate breakfast and watched a few episodes of this cartoon on Netflix. Then I went to bed again since I still have some time before I get ready for my class.

On my second sleep, it was unusual. I felt like I was so tired. Which was odd since I had enough sleep prior to this second sleep.

Then I felt it. I was having sleep paralysis. I tried to leave my body and felt those weird heavy vibrations on my head. It was hard. I couldn’t leave my body. I think I could only manage to lift my head but my body was still stuck. So I relaxed. And tried it again.

This time, I think I wasn’t exerting effort. I just relaxed and my astral body left by itself. Okay. It was good. But the thing is that I couldn’t control where I was going. I wanted to go forward, but I was moving backwards. Like a car in reverse. I even saw what our house looks like from behind (something that I haven’t seen before).

It was surreal. However, I think I lost control and I fell asleep?

Which makes me wonder if what happened was just Lucid Dreaming or an actual AP.

Either way, it was cool! I hope I can manage to do it willingly next time. And to have more control of where I want to go.Ive always been an astral projector. When I was a child I didn’t understand it, and I used to think I was being abducted by aliens in my sleep. Hah. Im in my 20s now. I have these vivid dreams/projections of being at a school of magic healers.  I have a theory that I’ve discovered a collective astral projection of dreamers who formed a school to help us be better humans. Anyone else been to this school?

Edit: it was a real experience for me, more real than this online form. So, if people are just going to make fun of it, I’m out of here.Lol Quote from The show avatar, legend of Korra😂. Seems powerful, eager to try it when in a deep state see what happens.Seriously I wanna know. 

&#x200B;

Also, this may sound really stupid but can you form contracts with spirits or nah? I may sound like some weeb watching anime trying to do anime shit but that is not the case. I am genuinely curious if you can or not?Turmeric is said to detoxify the pineal gland and help in AP, and i believe that. I been trying to AP for 1.3 years now and never AP and or even had true vibrations, but after making turmeric tea daily and drinking it daily, i experienced it vibrations.

I believe i could AP now, but i am being held back from depersonalization. My heart chakra is probably blocked because of it and when i tried to AP my heart started hurting. Depersonalization either or kundalini process.

So i reccomend consuming turmeric guys! And why not anyways

Edit: I didn't think i'd get this much attention, so i'll explain some more things. The Turmeric i take is raw organic in it's natural grown form. The way i consume it is by making tea after simmering it for around 10 minutes, and i either drink it just like that or with honey. 

And also a little warning, too much turmeric isin't good for your health. I add around half a tea spoon of turmeric or a good pinch of it after grating it each time i make the tea. Good luck everyone!I’ve been astral traveling since I was a kid. I’ve learned a lot along the way as it’s been like 25 years of this and I’m no expert - just wanted to share things I’ve experienced and things I’ve read that help deal with the fear of AP and a few side notes. 

So, my very first time, I will say; was terrifying. It starts out scary but there is a good ending. Anyway, I was lifted out of body into a seated position on my bed (I’m like 12 at the time) and my arms were outstretched. There was nothing I could do. I finally broke out of it, And started to crawl to my moms room. I think walking was too scary? Or I couldn’t? I don’t know. Anyway, I’m in the hallway when this guy comes down the hallway with a flashlight and he shines it in my face. I’m even more terrified because the guy says nothing. So now I’m crawling away from my moms room and away from this guy and finally made it back to my body. 

Flash forward to a few years ago and I read that some shamans, their goal is to retrieve and help people that go too far in the astral plane. Hence the man with the flash light. The same guy has visited me a few times since and always has a flash light, wears the same outfit - a black beanie and a flannel shirt, says nothing, simply guides me back to my body. Anyway, something shamans do to go deep into astral is: first they simply fall asleep with the goal of AP and once they reach it, they intentionally find a place to fall asleep again, and again, and again - this takes you extreeeemely far and NOT to be done by a beginner whatsoever. I’ve realized the only time this guy comes to retrieve me is when I THINK I’ve woken up (because we all know how real it feels in this state sometimes) just to realize whoops, I’m deeper because I fell asleep again. I once went so deep, and my guide wasn’t there, and all I remember is this darkkkk presence, demonic really; and he yells in this voice that nearly echoed: “You’re not supposed to be here” and slams his hand into my face sooo hard that I was shoved back in my body with such force that I nearly felt it when I woke up. 

I’ve seen good entities, bad ones - but it’s just like these spirits are people really, or once were. Hell, even last night I AP’d but I fell asleep holding my husbands hand. So, I was tied down in a way. My body was nearly like a whirlwind around the bed - like I was circling it in midair but couldn’t go any further because I was holding his hand. So, I pictured light and asked for a higher power to wake me up and I woke up. I’ve been to places in the future - natural disasters mainly. Our souls, it seems, has this inclination to go to certain places. My soul likes to help people in distress for some reason. Most recent experience was flooding in West Virginia about 6 months or so ago. I was there, saw mountains and flooding, and I’m guiding people to safety and such. So, I googled it when I awoke and sure enough - major flood in WV. 

There is an amazing book I recommend about a woman saint. St Maria Agresta I believe is her name, it’s a true story of her visiting Native Americans to tell them the British were coming. It’s called The Lady in Blue. There’s such an interesting thing about AP and shamanism. Are we really there? Are we taking on the form of someone else? Are we simply a spirit looking entire when we are there? (Think of the stories of angels helping people out of car accidents and such) are we that inner voice that pops into someone’s head during distress? With St Maria Agresta, she appeared as a spirit but was a real person in Spain in deep meditation and/or dream state actually visiting these people. I had no idea that’s why Catholics (I think used to, I don’t know if they do as much anymore) prayed for so long, Buddhists even, and Shamans. So, my belief is sure there must be ghosts and spirits but we forget to think about people that are astral traveling. However, I don’t always remember my travels - but our higher self has a mission sometimes because I think we are all connected - and will do things that have to be done to help people we love or help humanity. 

You get what you ask for, or pray for, so sometimes before I go to bed I pray that whatever the world needs help with - to take me there. But you WILL wake up exhausted. So don’t do this if you have a big day the next day. Also, Any time I pray to simply remember my dreams - I always do. We forget that the universe gives us what we want - all in due timing. So, be specific. Watch what you say and what you think. Because ultimately, our reality can be fashioned by us just by thinking about what we want. And no, it’s not always pretty, but changing your viewpoint helps. Like when you see an entity in the room - that’s my sign that’s it not safe to travel. The entity may be dark, but maybe it has to be to scare us enough to know it’s not a good time to travel, for whatever reason.Hello, everyone! You're invited to a potluck meetup in the astral plane this weekend, at the beautiful [Thoondu Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoondu) in [Fuvahmulah, Maldives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuvahmulah).

The event happens for about 15 minutes before and after the September Equinox at [7:50AM UTC on 23 September 2019](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20190923T0750&msg=September%20Equinox%202019) (let's say 7:35 to 8:05). As mentioned, attendees will be in the *astral plane parallel* to Thoondu Beach. If you're going to be there in the physical plane, please make sure to say hello.

Directions to the venue (with [map](https://imgur.com/a/ySwHva6)):

1. From space, observe the Earth.
2. Try to get in a position where you can see the night and day side in equal divisions.
3. Look for the point where the equator is closest to the sun.
4. Go there!
5. Find the nearest island. It looks like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuvahmulah#/media/File:Fuvahmulah_Satellite.jpg).
6. Find the northernmost point. It's a lovely white-sand beach with palms.

This should be the closest spot on land to the sun during the equinox.

Please note that this is a *potluck*. Please bring something nice to share with your friends at r/AstralProjection. RSVP with what you're going to bring if you're worried there will be duplicates. Looking forward to seeing you all there!Astral Projection is an open world, action, adventure multiplayer game.

This game does not contain microtransactions nor loot boxes because you can create your weapons, armor and various items with your focus and willpower. The best part is that its completely free! You dont need wifi nor you need to spend any money. You just need to practise every day until you finally log in. The servers are never down so you can play whenever you want.Idk if this is related at all, but I do think it’s happened more since I’ve started pursuing this. Does anyone know what I mean? Sometimes I find glitches that I’m unable to find other people experiencing online. Like yesterday, my headphones were switching back and forth from sound canceling to active transparency mode over and over again. Sometimes it would happen like fifty times in a row and other times just once. Today they work perfectly fine. 

Does anyone else experience anything like this?Okay guys. I need to share this with peeps who would understand. So few of my friends in my circle would be receptive to this, though I have a few (to whom I've introduced binaurals to, and one is actively trying atm).

I have had, to my knowledge, two successful APs in my life. The first was a spontaneous childhood experience (about 3 or 4 years old), the second was when I was about 20 years old (a bit by accident, induced from a lucid dream).

This time, for the last couple months, I've been exploring this phenomenon again and trying to achieve AP actively. Started with meditation, mostly Hemi-Sync Gateway, then noise generators, and finally Tom Campbell's binaural beats (especially the one with what's called "pink" sounds). I'm not sure why suddenly this year I've been keenly interested in attempting to do this, after having had my experiences and being amazed by them, then forgetting their importance to me for so long. Like something in me just told me that it was time to start working on it again. But more focused and controlled.

So I would try, and most often fall asleep to these worbly static sounds.

Yesterday I had a headache all morning, and after fighting it for most of the morning, I decided to try to sleep it off. I even waffled on the idea of trying one of Campbell's binaurals while I napped, but went ahead and set myself up anyway. They are hypnotic and relaxing. I have had migraines and headaches since I was 3 years old, so I've become accustomed to a particular set up to nurse these inconvenient things.

A cold pack on my head, and a heating pad on low around my middle, snuggled up in bed, blinds closed. I set up the track on my phone with ear buds, and let the sounds just relax me to sleep. I had made a note of the time. It was 1:30pm. The track is 54 minutes.

The next one auto played and I woke up to the sound of the spoken introduction. I lay there until the binaural of that track began to play, and decided not to listen to an entire second track. So I woke up enough to have the wherewithal to turn it off, turned on my side, adjusted the cold pack on my head, and fell asleep.

It couldn't have been five minutes later, it happened so incredibly fast, that I was curled up on my side and something told me "now" and "move now". I still had the thought in my head that I could try to slip out of my body, so I started to do this. "Not your legs, not your body. The other thing. *The other thing.*" Oh, right, right. The other thing. Like, I didn't question it. I just felt around my . . . being? . . . for what that "other" thing was and I realized it was - okay, this is hard to describe in words, so I apologize - my . . . air . . . body? Airy self? It was like my own personal "air" that I was supposed to move, that was just conveniently in the "shape" of my body (I guess to make it easier to recognize as "me").

Without thinking too much about it, I started to roll a bit onto my "knees". My physical body had my knees curled up, so I went with the next best position from there, but with the "airy" side of me, and I could *actually feel that part separating!* I stood up, completely lucid and understanding what I was doing, and had to tell myself to calm down enough to let myself see. As soon as that happened, everything washed into a clarity that was absolutely mind-blowing.

As soon as that happened, and I could see that I was in my room and separated, I was unstoppable and insatiably curious. Most of it was me going, "Holy shit. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I did it. Look at everything. Look at everything. Take it in. Oh my god. It's real. Holy shit."

I kept trying to look and focus on things, not really able to logically analyze anything. Just that I was looking at stuff. I was so desperately excited.

Fun fact: I could hear myself, my physical body, hyperventilating. I was flitting around my room, and heard myself breathing so hard, the excitement so intense.

As I was exploring my immediate surroundings without being able to process too much of it in any logical sense, I went to another room that was not a part of my domicile. I was confused by this, and looked around anyway. It looked like an abandoned room with a hard floor and broken boxes or machines around (one of them sounded like it was still running, but I'm not sure if this was something I was hearing in the physical that filtered in). I saw a woman curled up on the floor, in a white dress. I went up to her, initially concerned, and asked if she was alright. She seemed half-catatonic and rather upset, when she said to me, "I think I'm pregnant." Did not know what to do with that information, so I figured I couldn't help her and put her back down on the floor, and went back to just looking at stuff like the ADHD astral kid I was.

Ended up back in my own domicile, looking at my front door. Initially, I thought it *wasn't* my front door because it looked like it had glass in it and I could see the light of day coming through it. My door is solid. Go up to the door and attempt to test myself going through the door. I could not, and figured that I have a lot to learn about walking through walls and doors yet. However, when my "face" hit the door, I realized that it *was* my door, and that I was perceiving the daylight through it. I figured this was because I wasn't looking at anything with my actual eyeballs, and perception is different with your consciousness (like the way people describe having a 360 view of things).

I managed to get through the front door by going through the motions of "opening" said door, and wound up on the balcony outside of my apartment. The next test I gave myself was trying to float, but I couldn't control that very well, and as soon as I realized I had much yet to learn, I decided that was enough for today and woke up.

Or so I thought.

I get "up", not able to see, and feel my way around my bed, the corner of the dresser, the door frame, the hall, and into the bathroom. I needed to go, but I realized . . . I was still bed. Dang it, get *up!*

I tried getting up again, and I'm on the floor. No, no, wake up and get up.

I wake up, and noticed the sleep paralysis still there. Slowly coming to my physical senses, I'm able to move again, stretch, and get up - this time for real.

And holy shit, you guys. I freakin' did it again. I did it, after almost 20 years since the last time, and I could not be happier.

I noted the time. It was 2:40pm. The whole AP lasted about 15-20 minutes. And happened *so fast!*

That feeling of separating is so incredibly far-out and indescribable. But I remember now.

Also, I should probably do something about my excitement level. I was a kid in a candy store with $100 bill. Maybe also should stop trying so hard to control things. Maybe stop for a second and ask for some guidance next time, as well.

Trying to figure out the thing about the room I went into that I didn't recognize. Didn't recognize the lady either. Thought maybe it was a reflection of myself or one of my friends, but I didn't perceive them to be any of those. Alternate dimension? \*shrug\*.

If anyone has any insight on anything I've described here, I would be extremely grateful. Thank you for reading.Hello,

I am a "natural" astral projector, and I have been spontaneously APing for over 10 years now. However, I don't really understand "what" the astral plane is. What "reality" am I experiencing when I AP?

When I exit my body, I always find myself in my bedroom. Everything looks more or less identical to what it looks like in real life. However, there is always something "off" or "different". For example, the colors might look different, or there might be a picture hanging on the wall that doesn't exist in "real" life, or there might be other random objects in the room that aren't there in "real" life. Or it might be snowing outside, even though it is summer.

So, what exactly is the "astral plane"? Is it a separate dimension/reality? Sometimes I see "beings" as well (like spirits/ghost-like entities), so I am not sure what to make of these experiences.

Thank you!I slept in afternoon on and off and had some sleep cycle switcheroo from travel.  What I believe happens is that our physical body has some mechanism which ensures our consciousness transitions from the physical wake state to a sleep dream state, and when we get some sort of sleep cycle disturbance or when we purposely attempt AP, that mechanism is bypassed and we find our self in a state between wakefulness and sleep.  There is a point during the transition of consciousness to actual sleep dream state that one can exploit to actually separate from the physical instead of being taken automatically to the dream sleep state.  

This is the reason most are skeptical of AP and they often think its all in the head of the person, its because most people can't project or don't know how and their consciousness is always taken to the sleep state, the mechanism works perfectly most of the time and a lot of folks who find themselves in scary SP state at night where their mind is awake but their body asleep, those people have had a fault in the mechanism that is supposed to put them into the sleep dream state where their consciousness drifts onto a dream state as their body sleep.  Instead of their consciousness being taken to the sleep state by the mechanism, they instead accidentally broke that mechanism via some frequent awakening throughout the night or through some sleep cycle switcheroo that confused the normal mechanism that allows smooth transition to sleep dream state.

If you want to test it out yourself and get yourself into a body sleep mind awake state where you can potentially further explore for AP or whatever else, just sleep at a time that you normally don't, like in an after noon, and then if you still can't experience that state, just try waking up frequently and going back to sleep because you'll guarantee catch yourself in that state if you keep waking up and going back to sleep at odd times that you normally don't sleep.  If you normally sleep at night then sleeping in afternoon should get you in that mind awake body asleep state.  

For me I know when I am in this state because I start hearing the ringing and vibrations, I hear the famous buzzing sound that AP and SP people hear.  That is the beginning stage.  

Something else noteworthy that I noticed during the vibration stage/hearing frequency stage while body is falling sleep but consciousness is still alert and aware, is that it also has some strange phenomena effect on physical well-being and repair/cell processes work.  In other words every-time I experienced the vibrations and buzzing sound stage, I always noticed better well-being and skin quality/elasticity when I wake up and throughout that day.  So I think it draws some sort of energies to help the physical body further accelerate and repair, this is probably why humans need sleep and scientists still don't understand the purpose of sleep.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/science/sleep-memory-brain-forgetting.htmlI just want to know if anyone has astral projected while on acid. The trip was very chill. It was me, him and like four of our friends. He was feeling like he took to much. Me, my boyfriend and one of our friends had doubled tabbed. So the three of us took 400ug. He felt as if he was going to throw up. But he didn't and after maybe 3 hours in he pasted around the room. An out of the blue he said he felt like killing himself. We were all like um no. He said he wanted to be strapped to the bed. But we told him he didn't need that an we got him to lay down. An we started watching the Simpsons. Then he started to happen. At first we didn't know cause he was walking around the house an asking if it was real. Then after maybe 10 mins I slapped my self an realized he was astral projectioning. One of my friends was pretty much talking to him to keep him grounded. But for some reason I got pulled along with him. I couldn't see what he was seeing but I could feel it all emotionally. My left shoulder felt as if someone was just pulling on it every time he went in. At one point im sure he drowned because I felt just a heavy weight on me as if I was under water. I took a deep breath an it felt as if I had just stopped breathing an water was just coming into my lungs. He kept saying he couldn't see an I would have to tell my friend what to do. Then he would say hit me. An this went on for a while. Like he could still move around an sometimes his body would go limp. I think why he could still move his body is because you can't sleep on acid an my friend put a protection spell on all of us.🧘🏿‍♀️🧘🏿‍♀️🧘🏿‍♀️https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_appI’m hoping I can make sense of all this. All I have felt since I came back to my physical body is pure euphoria.

I felt the vibration and tingling sensations in my hands and feet. I was struggling to move past it for a bit. Eventually I did and I was floating and within a blink of an eye I was like floating in a cosmic space, at least I felt like I was. I saw the most beautiful colors, purples, blues, pinks, all swirling around with stars flecked everywhere. It kind of looked like the Milky Way.

Then I heard this beautiful harmonious sound from in front of me coming from a white light. I felt so drawn to it so I floated towards it. I wish I could replicate it. It sounded like angels in a symphony. There were no words, but I felt like I could understand what this sound was telling me. I felt warm, I felt how a child would feel, being held by their mother. The closer I got to the light, the more intense my feelings became and I was so overcome with this feeling of warmth and love I just cried tears of joy. 

Once I was in this light, I was just floating there, in what felt like a long hug. It was amazing. I had so many questions, I didn’t even open my mouth to ask anything but I felt like my questions of everything was answered. I felt like I saw life and death, why were here, why we are who we are. I can’t explain it, but I felt like I saw god and I’m not even religious.

I wanted to stay longer but I could feel my spirit get pulled back into my body. When I returned I just cried tears of joy. It was so beautiful. I am still in awe. Can someone please tell me what the hell I experienced??Is anyone here in this unique situation where you met someone (whether a spirit or someone who is still incarnate) on the astral realm? I’m in this now and have been with this spirit for over a year and honestly I’m quite happy with this for now. I live a normal life with loving friends and a decent job but just a unique and different love life. It really is true when they say love finds you when you aren’t looking for it and he literally found me 😊🥰 just wondering if anyone else here has a normal life like me but also have an astral love life so to speakI know a lot of people that seem to believe that other people BELIEVE they are astral projecting, but they are actually dreaming (but convincing themselves it's AP). Do you guys think it's possible? Especially since we're all sharing so much, we might dream up what we've read before?Astral Lounge Discord!

https://discord.gg/AstraIProjection 

Did you know there is an Official Astral Lounge Discord? We have many discussions in both text and voice chat throughout the day, so ask as many questions and get answers quickly! There are many astral projectors from just starting to AP Masters to help and assist in any areas needed. Also, there are a variety of voice channels and text channels to answer your questions quickly and efficiently, which will help further your spiritual journey. There are priceless amounts of resources to help u achieve your first AP experience, or to refine your skills if necessary. The goal of the server is to grow yourself and aid others throughout the journey of spiritual progress. We aim to expand awareness and consciousness to use them for their fullest potential. The community is a safe place to talk about your fears, such as sleep paralysis, in a non judge mental environment. Lastly, the server is mainly about astral projection, but we have channels for regular conversations, manifesting, energy work, stories, aura readings, lucid dreaming etc. We treat this server as a community and take any and all input to be voted on. Enjoy the server!many things but here's one. People report on small doses of DMT that if they open their eyes (no on DMT really does) sometimes they see THROUGH things, like walls, trees, etc.  They kinda just turn the opacity down on things during their trip. People on moderate to very high doses of LSD report the same thing. People that astral project have reported the same thing. 

ALSO, there are connections made between psychedelics (especially DMT) about it taking you to the astral realm, or a realm that is beyond our physical existence, same with the dream world. What if, stay with me, psychedelics can open up the brain and mental state to receive information about what is going on on the other side of whatever they are seeing through. I don't know if any of this is making sense. Basically I'm saying psychedelics take you or reveal layers of the same place you go to when you astral project or dream; it's all the same.

Also traces of DMT (N, N Dimethyltriptamine) are found in plants and the human brain. In certain plants like the hostilis mimosa or ayahuasca  it is found to be the strongest and why DMT is extracted from it. It's literally naturally occurring, when we AP or LD we are in a world that DMT takes us as well. 

Idk man, biggest coincidence in the universe that a proper altered state of mind can take you to a place with focus that a substance that's naturally in our brain can take us too as wellAnd didn't know it.

It's happened to me.

I wonder how often this happens.

EDIT:

I'm not saying it's the case everytime. I'm saying it happens, perhaps with more frequency that we'd thinkI’ve felt like I had projected in one of the first few attempts earlier this year, but I never officially considered it an AP because I wasn’t sure.

It was a very short projection, but I remember standing in my room. I wanted to sit on the roof of my house, so I decided to jump straight up to pass through to the roof—I got stuck for a short moment in the ceiling in my room. I sat there on the roof, just sort of taking in the scene from a different view.

The only other thing that I remember is I was floating in some deep blue / navy area, sort of like the night sky before the morning, and I was talking to somebody else. They were translucent, and so was I. I don’t remember the conversation, but I understood that this person was a best friend from another life and I remember making some sort of inside joke with them.

It was odd, especially for a first projection, but what is most interesting is that it happened *before* I started to believe in reincarnation. Odd but interestingLike, if I was APing in my room would it look exactly like my room? All the details?Ok so I'm not a demonic person and fully 100% believe in God. So that said, the other night I tried astral projection using the rope method. Well I finally succeeded after many failed attempts. I shot out of my body with pretty good force kind of like a pop instead of just gently floating out. I looked around my room and saw myself laying on my bed below me. I couldn't believe it, I was thrilled and was so happy and excited that I got it to work. Well I then looked at the corner of my room above my bed and saw a black mass that was giving off a very evil and dark vibe and seemed to be staring at me. I immediately flew back into my body and then woke up and sat up immediately. I ran to the light switch and turned the lights on for about 30 minutes to calm down. 

Now I've read a bit about astral projection and find it really cool and interesting because of my love for phsyicedelics and the different realms they can take you too. But I'm scared to continue to astral project out of fear of the demon I saw above me. 

Is it safe to try again? What can I do to remove this demon from my room? Is the demon a threat to my soul as I'm flying in the astral realm or is it harmless? Does this mean a demon is haunting my life? Or was it even a demon at all? If not a demon then what could this dark mass with evil energy be? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.So I do not AP, but I transcendentally Meditate, which allows me to ascend to the astral plane (where you go when you do DMT) on a much smaller, more manageable and understandable level.

I’ve seen everything from aliens looking back at me to millions of eyes staring from everywhere to the fabric of my reality ripping itself - all stone-cold sober, due to nothing but me meditating to an audio track dedicated to stimulating the 3rd eye/crown chakra...

Now I consider myself a pretty experienced and skilled navigator of this plane in that I can almost “turn on” my 3rd eye at will...

I can almost flex it like a muscle (its similar to how it feels when you flex the muscle that wiggles your ears, for those of you that know what I mean) and I’ll start feeling it gearing up...


Anyway, my GF was literally just diagnosed with schizo affective disorder. She tells me that she used to hear her mom talking to things in her house and she would ask her “what did you say?” And her mom would just be like “nevermind” as a kid... now that she’s an adult, her mom has admitted that she used to talk to demons, as her mother is also schizo/bi-polar...

My GF snapped totally and completely only once - and that was before i met her, about a year and a half ago.

She said that she could feel a demon throw its robe over it’s shoulder and sit next to her. She said that sometimes she hears voices and doesn’t know whether it’s god talking to her, or the demons posing as god...

All this to say? She’s obviously got some dark stuff that runs generationally deep thru her family... without giving too much of her info out, her father was all but a devil of a man, and if demons were to prey on anyone? She would be a prime target for them...

They say the mystic and the schizophrenic reside in the same waters...

A mystic (someone who uses their connection to higher realms/their higher self as a tool for self-exploration and spiritual growth) has spent time and energy developing a way of USING their gift, to swim gracefully and poised through those waters...

The schizophrenic? Flails in that same water the mystic swims in... Always being told their gift was a curse, and never having tried to hone their gift - or maybe their gift was just too much for them to handle..

Anyway.

We passed out with our foreheads touching each other’s (commonly referred to as a “3rd eye kiss”) and as I was drifting off to sleep, I found myself going into a slightly meditative state by habit ...

Out of nowhere I felt a “SHOCK” to my spiritual self... it happened again.... it HURT... 

It felt like something was trying to fuck up my shit... The more it dawned on me that an entity could very well be attacking me? The more I started trying to picture a shield of white/Holy light around both me and my GF to protect us? The more I would suffer these “Shocks”... it was like I was being forced out of my own body by something - painfully, I might add.

Terrible terrible sensation.

And the more i fought it and tried to protect us? I noticed my girl would twitch in her sleep more..

Which is nOt something she does...

Idk, call me crazy if you want, but i REALLLY would like to know if anyone else has any experience with this “Shock” sensation to their third eye? And if so, what caused it?

This was concerning as fuck for me.Don't get me wrong. I love astral projecting.

But I can't help to feel so lonely.

I usually end up on the street where I live, and sometimes I see humans (ghosts?) and they totally ignore me. Can't really go further/ go upwards cause when i do, it goes all black (I only consciously projected about 10 times). I also tried the mirror thing to go some place else and every time I lose my vision, everything becomes black and I wake up. 

When I try to call some guides, nobody answers, nobody comes. 
It's starting to feel a bit repetitive since I can only stay on the same street all the time.

Is it the lack of experience? Do you have any tricks to call your guides/friendly creatures? What would you do? Thanks :)I started by relaxing my body parts and visualizing myself become light energy.  I created light energy in my body and around me.  I felt so amazing and tranquil.  As I was melted as light energy I decided to travel. I decided to travel to the underworld.  In the underworld once again I met kaali.  She is so chaotic and looks very scary.  She showed me people getting there heads chopped off.  I even chopped someone’s head off.  I then remember looking at Kali telling her I’m scared.  She looked at me and wanted to hug me.  I was scared as I could feel all the chaos coming from her.  As I gave her a hug and she wrapped her hands around me. I felt more love than I had ever felt before and wanted to cry in tears.   When I saw the hug it was more like she was wrapped around me as she is a giant spirit and we are floating somewhere in consciousness.  I remember meeting my spirit animal the bear and he told me he will help me. I know that I must help to bring interesting things into this world.  The only way to do that is be myself and not just say things you think your supposed to say.  I have to be my true self and it takes a lot of courage and confidence.  I can’t be scared to cause chaos.  Variety is important for the world and I must not be scared to say weird things and be myself.I had a dream where I was looking in the mirror and there were two of me. My soul came right out of my body. I thought, “did I die?”

But the part of me that I knew was 100% me was a soul. I knew myself to be a soul and no longer physical. I was transparent. I noticed that my body was laying on a bed in a small room. This was not my room. I tried to get back into my body but I couldn’t.

My soul was running trying to find someone to help me. I didn’t see anyone’s face. No one could hear me or see me. I noticed my aunt and who passed away in 2017. I ran right up to her. I knew her to be alive and well in this place. But she passed away years ago. (she was a mom to me when she was alive, I was not scared). 

My aunt noticed me right away. I was surprised that she noticed me and could hear me but no one else could. I asked her for help and she immediately went to my body laying on a bed in this strange room. She touched my body and I was able to get back into my body. 


When I woke up thinking about my dream as a soul, I saw a text message from my accountability partner that said. . “get up and get going you good looking soul.” He has never said anything like that to be before. 

has anyone ever had an experience like this?. . . if you have to ask. People must ask the question 20 times per week here. Believe me, if you actually had done it there would be no doubt about it. It's like being sucked through a tube that carries you across the Earth, solar system, of into another universe. Imagine one minute you're in Chicago and a few seconds later you're standing on a mountain in Antarctica or you're suddenly riding a train in England. I've even gone backward and forward in time. What you need to understand is, this isn't a thing of the mind as though your consciousness is elsewhere. You're in a different body too that feels (and maybe is) just as real as the one you're in now. It is the most jaw dropping thing that will ever happen to you this side of death. It is nothing like a lucid dream, which definitely is a thing of the mind and you can change it around. If you've had astral projection / OBE, you would never feel a need to ask someone if you did. You may as well ask someone if you took a trip to the store today. Would you ask somebody that? Of course not. You know where you went and what you did today. You might not always know where you've projected to, but you'll know you went somewhere and it was the most remarkable trip you ever took and everything was just as real and solid as the world you're reading this from right now. I just hadd'a say it.So learning about ap and having my spiritual awakening this year, I’ve found we have more to life than just being a smart monkey for 70 years then dying. Life expands further beyond this. Multiple dimensions and infinite possibilities. But what created this, what created the astral plane and all over plans of existence, what’s the point of it all? 

What’s beyond the universe, what’s beyond it all. Or has it always been here and always will be?It was 2011. I don’t do drugs anymore but back then I was  primarily into coke. my dealer at the time said try Meth since yay wasn’t available. It’s cheaper and much longer lasting. At first I was like fuck you bro. I had some kind of morality about coke over meth. Anyway.

After about 4 days of being awake, I had an excruciatingly scary experience that I’m still not sure if it was a real paranormal event or just my mind being more powerful than I ever could imagined.

Side note: on some level,  I still maintain that meth and/or sleep deprivation may simply be paths toward a specific brain frequency. A frequency which allow for human beings  to interface with demons.

In other words, If you’re simply not on the right frequency, you won’t see them.  These drugs just put you on that bandwidth.

Here’s what happen.  

Is around midnight. After 8 hours of obsessively peeking thru all my different windows and blinds in the house, repeatedly tip toeing through different rooms around the house, acting like I need to slither under neath my windows, on the floor, and basically sneaking all around my house for reasons...

I came to the conclusion that I was charging up this demonic frequency. The dark energy was being built up by my  repetitive and obsessive and creepy behavior.

Eventually I find myself, Like a psycho, standing in the master bedroom naked with the lights off ... just staring out my window toward the street. Only my front porch lights illuminated the front lawn. Otherwise it was pure blackness beyond that. My Eyes were fixed on the darkness as I stood there  just waiting for something to happen. I can’t explain it but I knew I was summoning something dark and evil with this level of focus and attention. I felt a relationship with the darkness and I was beginning to scare myself but I couldn’t stop.

After staring out the bedroom window for 15 straight minutes, with zero movement from even my eyes... I finally broke my staring contest with the dark, and I looked away.

after a moment - I Looked back out the fucking window again. I can CLEARLY see a man outside dressed like the most cliche home burglar you can imagine.  For a brief second I ponder how it was WAY too coincidental. I’m tripping on meth and there’s about to be a home invasion??? I’m frozen with terror because this is starting to feel too real.

He’s wearing camo pants, black doc martin boots, black ski mask. I sort of begin to realize .... this is literally what  my Childhood archetype of a “bad guy” is supposed to look like. As I’m realizing this. He’s casually sitting in my tree dangling his legs over the thick branch he’s sitting on.  patiently  FACING MY FRONT DOOR. As if he’s calculating what to do. Terror and disbelief send every hair on my body into chills.

I looked away for 1 second to check my car keys were by the night stand Incase I need to bust out the window and escape if he comes toward my house any closer.

When my head swivels back to look out the window once again.... it has now shifted position and form completely.

It isno longer the shape of a human burglar sitting in a tree calculating how to rob me.

Please try to Imagine a black genie with 8-12 arms flapping them all like a humming bird. Vibrating so fast you can barely see the arms. Like a butterfly. Whatever this was, it was telepathically feeding on my terror, paralyzing me.

It said : YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. NOW YOU SEE ME. IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING

The speed of Its flapping arms were congruent with my level of fear. I dont know how I knew this but the more scared I got the faster it fluttered and the more excited it became.

I got the sense that this thing was totally amused by my human fear and it was laughing at me for being so shocked and weak.

It didn’t have a head or body like people do. Imagine a 7 foot tall face with several arms. Pitch black. It had no texture, like a shadow has no texture. At first it had no features either. other than white eyes and flailing arms.

Slowly a mouth began to form on its body and the mouth very slowly and deliberately  opened all the way up and after a couple seconds the mouth took up the entire space of its body. Hard to explain but just reminiscing on this vision gives me chills to this day.I am always hesitant to follow through into a projection when I start getting sleep paralysis in the middle of the night. My projections during the night are quite scary. I'll usually wake up early morning when there's light outside and then project.

Last night around 3:30am, I woke up and then started getting sleep paralysis when trying to go back to sleep. I was feeling risky so I decided to go into a projection. I float upwards and then put myself on the ground in my room like I usually do to gain control of myself so I don't randomly get pulled around.

This is when I noticed something was weird. When I went to the mirror to look at myself in astral form (first thing I always do), I notice that there is movement in the background. My mirror is directly in front of my bed. I can see my body twitching violently which is something I've never seen before. Usually when I look at myself sleeping, I'm 100% still. I didn't like how it looked so I went downstairs and I saw this man just standing at the bottom of the stairs looking at me. And then he started running up the stairs towards me. I got into fly mode and zoomed the fuck out of there.

I was terrified and went through the wall so I could fly around outside. It's the same town that I always seem to project too. I have no idea where it is, but every time I go out the wall, it's that town. Everything looks normal again. The stars are very visible and I'm flying by trees, grabbing the leaves, all that fun stuff.

I land on the ground and I start ripping up some grass with my hands because it felt so real and satisfying. When I look up, I see like 6 different people walking towards me. The reason this was so scary is because evil entities in my projections usually come in weird forms like shadow people and weird looking animals/demons. This is the first time that HUMANS are coming after me in a bad way. I tried to act comfortable and told them that I knew they aren't real and that they could not hurt me in anyway. This seemed to work because they all just stood around me. There was men, women, children.

THAT'S WHEN THE REALLY TERRIFYING THING HAPPENED. I see a copy of myself walk up to me. It's literally me. And then one of the evil men standing there shoves that copy and he falls to the ground. Then he walks up to me and punches me in the chest and I actually felt it. I didn't feel so much like pain, but sort of like an impact. A weird feeling that I've never felt before.

I start panicking and start punching them and screaming at them. I even try to imagine that I had guns but it didn't work. I eventually run away and go into fly mode straight towards the sky. I went over the clouds and I was just aiming for space. I've never been to space before in my projections but I hear a lot of stories about people exploring galaxies so I thought fuck it lets do it now. As soon as I'm about to break what felt like the atmosphere, I feel my ankle get grabbed. It's the same fucking guy from before and he literally drags me all the way down faster than my speed getting up there. It was such an intense drop. Like that feeling you get when you go down a rollercoaster, except 100x worse. It was actually so bad that it woke me out of the projection.

I was glad I got out of it and tried to get some actual sleep. While I was falling asleep, I started getting sleep paralysis and I literally saw the same fucking guy walking towards me in my room. But I wasn't actually projecting at this point so I forced myself to move a toe which broke me out of the sleep paralysis. He got so close that when I got out of the sleep paralysis my first instinct was to throw punches where he was standing.

I don't know if I ever want to project again. I know it doesn't sound as scary as some other experiences people have had with negative entities, but that really scared the fuck out of me in so many different ways.I'm not sure what to call this. I used to be able to willfully go OOB (out of body) when I was younger, and I could do it while awake. I used to do it during recess and it was always a birds eye view because I thought it was cool to be able to see everything going on at the playground. But what's even stranger about it is the fact that I could do it while talking to someone. My voice would sound very distant though, and I would reply to friends without having to think about saying anything. I could see myself talking with my friend while high up in the sky watching the playground, and my voice was distant/murky sort of and replies would come automatically.I am a strong astral projector in the sense of I do it every night, vividly, yet without control or direction. I randomly bump into people I know all the time, and assumed I've been travelling to alternate forms of people in a know in other dimensions. However, I recently discussed moment with a coworker I viewed, who shockingly told me it was also a moment in his past. 
Then my husband and I rewatched Interstellar and a thought occured to me. What if I wasn't travelling to wheres, rather to whens? After many talks with other people in my life, I too had popped into seemingly random events in there life,I had become their "ghost" in a way, where they would always remember some numerical synchronicity appearing at that moment. Thus began my second theory that numerical sychronicities are not the universe, rather they are signs from us, ourselves, people who travel through astral projection and leave a small mark on time, in the form of a synchronicity.

 [Wake Induced Lucid Dream / Astral Projection.]

Firstly proper brain chemistry, do not go fishing without bait! Without proper brain chemistry achieving the State of Consciousness is much more difficult. 

There is one thing in particular that throws our brain chemistry off... mainly our melatonin levels and circadian rythem, This Is L.E.D And other Artificial Light Sources, you may think beaming yourself with your cell phone in your face before bed reading about a lucid dreaming is helping you, it is actually counterproductive, get your phone out of your face get away from the T.v,  get away from the laptop screens, at least 1 hour before bed acclimate yourself to the darkness and this will increase your chances drastically.

During getting acclimated to Darkness take time for meditation. Get your mindset right, think about your goals your intentions, think happy thoughts and positive words, be confident in yourself, No Fear! NO Doubt!

When you hop into bed to fall asleep a lot of the time, I hear people say to think over and over again to yourself I will have a lucid dream tonight or I will become Lucid in my dreams tonight or I will have an astral projection! NO!!!! This dose not do jack shit!
Instead think to yourself, I will recognize when I wake up in the middle of the night after a natural sleep cycle! Begin training yourself to recognize these Natural Wake ups! As well as begin to train yourself that the first thought that comes to your mind after you realize that you have just woken up naturally, IS DONT MOVE.

Usually when we wake up naturally it is a natural instinct like feeling, to rollover scratch an itch re get comfortable and just fall back asleep as quickly as possible! INSTED focus on staying as still as you can bring your attention to your breathing, be calm be relaxed and remember what you are trying to do!

You may begin to feel very strong Sensations to rollover, change position, scratch an itch, clear your throat and so on, this is the brain and body communicating back and forth to test and see is he asleep or awake???? Give in to the sensations and the body will hold off on sleep paralysis... work through the discomfort and remain still exert some discipline and sleep paralysis is very likely to kick on!

You may feel Sensations of vibrating, you may hear humming, see Swirls and colors under your closed eyelids, hear music or voices, a falling sensation may arise, you may feel something touching you, you may see through your closed eyelids! And More Odd sensations.

Keep in mind yes you may feel the sensations but I have exited more times than not where I have not felt any Sensations. what the Sensations are, are reassuring that you are definitely in sleep paralysis but sleep paralysis can still occur without Sensations.

It is very important to gain the right mindset before exiting and even after exiting, our emotions and subconscious mind manifests here and sleep paralysis is naturally kind of fucking scary!!!! Do not let fear take over and spiral out of control. Think to yourself there is nothing to fear but fear itself really focus on balancing your feelings, only feelings of love joy, excitement, and respect for the experience.

NOW Time For Exit technique, i call this R.O.O.B 
Roll Out of bed / body.

Begin to visualize your room around you with as much detail as you possibly can put it together like a puzzle piece in your mind really see it in your mind's eye.
Imagine what it would look like, and try to mimic the sensations of rolling out of bed without actually making the motion. Have a strong belief that you will roll out of your bed. Think roll out now!, Now... Now! 
If nothing happens don't worry... put all of your attention onto the left half of your body mainly shoulder blade area, then swap your attention to the right side of your body shoulder blade area again, keep swapping your attention back and forth back and forth a rocking sensation can arise, if you can get the rocking sensation it makes it easier to complete the rolling out of bed motion when you feel the rocking go to the way you want to roll believe in and  just roll with it! Know it will work, no doubt.

If you cannot visualize your way out or rock your way out... there's something else to try but if your sleep paralysis is not strong enough this may break it and ruin ur chances. You want to actually try to make the physical motion of rolling out of your bed, make sure you don't have anything you could whack your head out in case you do actually roll out LOL, I have done that before! If the paralysis is strong enough you will be stuck like glue and are likely to roll your Consciousness out into the experience that you want to achieve ;)

Every single time you find yourself in the experience it is crucial to stabilize and deepen it! Nine times out of ten for me after I exit the experience is very dark and gloomy, it is only after the following techniques that is full of light and clear like high-definition Vision!

I called the exercise T.S.S.T triple sense stabilizing technique, touch your body touch your floor touch your environment touch everything around you pay attention to the details and textures.

Make a closed fist visualize and believe strongly that you have a candy in your hand open your hand and eat the candy, pay attention to the way it tastes. You know the exercise is working when you can taste something, in my opinion this is sleeping portions of the brain that regularly shut down for sleep coming back on associated with the senses taste, touch, smell and hearing, you can also reach behind your back visualize the stem of a flower in between your fingers, feel the stem of the flower and pull a flower forward smelling the flower. AND YELL OUT Alexa!! PLAY MUSIC! I realize I call it 3 sence when there is 4 , that's cuc I did not use music for longest time, it works tho! Once you have activated your senses in the experience the clarity should be near perfect and then you can begin whatever it is that you want to experience in the state of consciousness.

I hope this helps check out my youtube channel for videos related too the topic ;)

http://www.youtube.com/c/LucidLiving89

P.s! Even though you will look like a nut you can practice going through the motions and rolling out almost like a sort of role play before bed! This has a great influence on the subconscious mind even if you are pretending that you are exiting into the experience and going through the motions, make it easier when you actually do it :-)This is a little experience I had years ago but I wanted to share it.

The experience starts with me hovering in a linear canyon. Below me was dense forest/jungle and I could only see treetops. And to my two sides were mountain slopes with their tops also covered with dense forests. 

I watched straight ahead and could see the remains of a big outpost structure which was marked by decay. It was made of metal but the entire structure turned red from rust and plants that slowly devoured it. It was a huge structure. I could see this from the small bridges with the railings around the external structure.

This world was extremely quiet. It was too quiet you couldn't even hear birds chirping or other animals. 

While watching this red rust structure I suddenly heared from the left side forest of the slope an really fast rustle. Something  makes it's way through the leaves really fast. 

And then I could see a long vine made of leaves shooting out of the forest like a snake and was stopping infront of me. It's movement was really snake like. It stopped infront of my forehead and I could feel that it tried to establish a telepathic connection. I could feel it's curiosity. But sadly before we connected I woke up but it was nonetheless an peaceful experience.Hey guys! Recently i've become increasingly curious about Astral Projection and I'm especially interested in the Astral Plane. What does it look like? Is it the same space of our material world or is it it's own dimension. What kind of creatures live there? I just have so many questions and I hope some of them can be answered.# Accidentally Third Eye Opening / Personal experience

&#x200B;

Hey everyone I am from Germany and want to share my first experience with the Third Eye Chakra and Astral Projection. This is a repost, I posted this experience before in [r/Psychonaut](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/) but never in this sub - but  it definitely belongs in here.

This event happened a few years ago. At this time I didn't know about the existence of the Third Eye or DMT. I was very interested in lucid dreaming at this time after I had an extreme profound and mystic dream which was too vivid and I could never forget. I also posted it on reddit. I will leave a link if anyone is interested in this story.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/eu5lbe/most\_intense\_and\_mystic\_dream\_warning\_long\_as\_hell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/eu5lbe/most_intense_and_mystic_dream_warning_long_as_hell/)

&#x200B;

Back to lucid dreaming, in this evening I wanted to encounter an lucid dream with some binaural beats and isochronic tones from YouTube. So I put some on and went to bed.

I began to listen to the tones and tried to stay conscious - with success.

I had my focus only into the blackness behind my eyes. At some point the darkness behind my closed eyes became a little dirty orange (something you can imagine like having your eyes closed in a lighted room/sun) but nothing else really flashy .

I still recognize the tones and it was really relaxing. Then the orange behind my eyes became brighter. I had the feeling at some point like I was  flying through the darkness. The light became brighter and I saw the source of the light. A small glowing dot far away.

&#x200B;

As I fly closer I see that the small dot was a massive wall pile up in front of me. The wall was made of light and energie all in glowing yellow orange. It glows and was pulsating  from energy and was made circuit board patterns. I was in front of a huge circuit board wall. And I can see everywhere some mechanical structures moving on its own paths doing their work. I can also hear extreme mechanical sounds. I was still conscious at this point  and know that I wanted to encounter a lucid dream so for this reason maybe it dont freaked me out for what I saw. I thought yes maybe it is the hypnagogic state so let it do what it does.

The binaural beats had changed at this time and were unrecognizable. Their sound was now in a really cosmic but also energetic way

So I started to floating towards this energetic circuit wall. As I come closer I see how big this structure really was and how small I am compared.

When you have seen pictures of circuit boards you will always see this fine lines crossing the board and forming patterns. I was floating towards one line and this small fine line became a huge canyon with the same circuit board patterns (Fractals).

[This artwork from Jonathan Solter comes closest to what I have seen. But as I said in my experience everything was in a glowing orange and made of circuit patterns. His artwork reminds more of Bismuthe crystals.](https://preview.redd.it/8ov09os4nae41.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d96b108d7241c2f0071f10975f433d0976d14e0)

Everything was so energetic and I was floating deeper and deeper into this mega structure. I had a feeling that this was like a basic layer of which our universe and reality is projected/rendered as a second layer over it. (made an interesting experience about that theory I share it at the end).

It was a feeling like being  behind the scenes

Behind what we call reality. And the journey goes on deeper and deeper into this megastructure. While I was floating I saw the breathtaking structure of this complex. Everywhere circuit board patterns. It was like an \*\*Mandelbrot Set Zoom (\*\*which I did not even know either at the time, by the way - never heared of the concept of fractals neither)

Looking back, I can simply say that I was in a fractal world or as I think - **Hyperspace**.

I remember like floating down and looking about this smooth plate on the "ground" with this tiny fine circuit lines.

I thought that wold be the ground it looks so smooth. I wondered if it is  made of glass or smooth metal? But it was also made of light energy and I really wanted to touch it when I reach there.

Because I recognised - "Ok I am in this structure but I never came close enough to anything, to touch anything."

But when I thought I reached the ground, I saw again this tiny lines forming another canyons and so on. I was still floating in this circuit board megastructure for maybe hours

I had no concept of time anymore. But there happened not much more I was just always in this fractal circuit world but it was really awesome.

Only years later I dsicovered the existence of DMT, its effects and realationship to the Third Eye and Astral Projection.

I thought how amazing it was to be able to see the fractal nature of the universe itself and be able to travel higher dimensions with your mind. The patterns which form everything. Nature in its purest beauty. After this experience I start to become really curious about DMT.

**BONUS STORY:** So up in my story I said that I made an experience which confirms my theory about that this circuit dimension is the basic layer of our reality. So years after this experience I woke up in the morning but my brain was still in an altered state. I got a huge window in my room which I was looking at. I saw nothing but this circuit patterns again but this time more in green and yellow colours but also glowing and moving in its typical mechanic way. It was very bright and while I was looking at this bright pattern it transforms into my normal window. Like the texture need time to load. That was so fascinating because even though I couldn't take my eyes off -  I also couldn't grasp the transformation from a fractal which created itself into my window. Crazy shit!!

Has anyone of you had similar experiences with higher dimensions while AP'ing? I would really love to hear your stories.I'll try to keep it short: there is a cult leader that systematically harasses me in the subtle sphere with his followers. 

Whenever I try to meditate or journey they come to bother me. 

Any tips on how to counter this or stop it?So I've been having more frequent and longer APs as of late. I've always had a fascination with mirrors and in my last AP I decided to try and phase through the mirror to see if I could go through to the other side. I havent tried phasing through walls in an AP before but during my lucid dreams I usually just put my hands against the wall and imagine my hole body resonating and going through and it works. So i tried the same thing against the mirror but all that happened was that small ripples formed on the mirror where my fingers touched it. I persisted and nothing really happened so i backed up from the wall and decided i would just try running towards and jump into it with complete trust. So I ran straight into the mirror but instead of going through it the mirror opened up like a revolving door and I stumbled on to the other side. I was in my room but everything was mirrored but not just that when I looked around there were countless versions of my room spanning in every direction. I was really fascinated but before I could explore more I felt a really strong presence that was getting closer so I got scared and ran back through the open mirror door. I was still intrigued by what was on the other side so I stuck only my arm out and saw infinite reflections of it in every direction it was mesmerizing. Then I woke up cause I got too excited. Anyone else had any experiences with going through mirrors?I was thinking a dream seems so long is because it takes place in some region in space where time is slower than on earth for example. I had a dream it seemed to last for 4 hours, but it really lasted 30 minutes. I think that space is not only planets and stars, but that's the stuff we can only see when we in our physical bodies.So, I will write down the technique which helped me AP just now. It’s quick and I think it’s new coz I haven’t read about it anywhere. Here we go:-

Choose a time before sleep, or after waking up, or waking up in between when u have to go back to sleep. 

Sleep on ur stomach, with both the hands placed under each thigh, palms facing ur thighs, so that ur body weight is on the palms. 

Try to sleep, or still ur mind. Point is to get into that half drowsy state where u cannot move ur body if u want to, but u can think clearly. 

After some time, ur palms will start tingling (because they are about to “sleep” now due to the weight) and u too are drowsy now. 

Focus on the tinglings. Just feel ur palms and focus on the tinglings. Dont try to move anything. The tinglings will increase and slowly spread to ur entire body. 

Ur ears will start humming and u will feel floaty. 
(My ears hummed, it’s ok if urs don’t). 

Just get out of the bed as u would when u are awake. Think “let me get up now” or “i will stand now”

When i think this, my astral body will rise up in a crawling on all 4s motion. Like ur hands move and lift ur head and the rest of the body, and u crawl out of the bed. Once, i decided to roll out of bed, I said “i know I wouldn’t fall down as it’s my astral body” and i rolled out, fell on the floor but stopped half way in air and stood up. 

That’s it. Try it today/tonight and report back. Good luck 😌

Edit: since some ppl mentioned this in the comments, plz don’t try this if u have a medical condition and should not be sleeping on ur tummy.  Like lungs or heart condition or if u r pregnant.

Edit 2:- since some ppl have concerns about blood circulation, I would like to clarify that it’s not your entire body weight that would be resting in ur palms, it would only be one thigh on each palm. It’s good enough to start the tingles. But then again, if u have doubts or medical condition, don’t do it. I tried AP last night by putting both my palms under my pillow. But the tingles were quite unnoticeable and did not induce vibrations. Then again, if u are trying this, discontinue if it’s too uncomfortable.If even a fraction of this community is able to succesfully project their consciousness outside the limitations of their physical body. Then it stands to reason, that if we were to join together and attempt to do something consciously as one mind, we would get a hell of a lot done.  


As an example, we could pick a date and time for the future, and all collectively make an attempt at extending outwards. We could then point our awareness at a given point, say the amazonian rainforests, and attempt to achieve something meanigful on the conscious energy fields there. Who knows what we could actually accomplish if we set out with a focused collective with the skills to manipulate conscious energy. Any feedback/commentary is appreaciated.Right now I’m in the middle of trying to make a huge change in my life.  Not getting into details because I think it would distract from the point... nearly every time I try to enact a *major* change, almost like switching to a new timeline/life path, everything that can go wrong does. Electronics break, harmless but annoying freak accidents occur, and basically it feels like the universe throws everything at me to try and stop me. I’m not giving up - it’s like some kind of boss battle. But it *really* feels like those time travel stories where the gun misfires every time or something, in order to keep the fabric of reality intact.

I know this is only tangentially related to AP, but I think most of you will understand why I’m asking on this sub.  I’m trying to keep the Gateway “patterning” lessons in mind, and continue to *know* that the reality I’m steering into is real and exists and it’s happening right now.

Have you ever experienced anything like this? Any tips on pushing through it?To begin, I gotta say that AP has been a real difficulty for me. I'm one of the people here who go to this sub to look for some trick/method I hadn't tried yet. I've AP'd in the past, but pretty much all of them were unintentional and didn't last long. One time, my sister told me she had a dream that I was a ghost who was floating around the house lol.

Normally, I wake up around 8AM but it's pretty typical of me to wake up throughout the night or a few hours earlier. In this case, I woke up around 6AM and went to go pee. After, I figured that my alarm won't ring for a couple hours so I have time to try to AP. So I laid down on my back and kept my limbs not crossing each other, while also trying to get comfortable. If you're wondering, I did sleep with a blanket. I told myself to not try to sleep, but to maintain being conscious. I don't know how long it took, but the vibrational stage came. I've been at this stage before but I always failed to leave my body because this fear would come over me. This time however, I was aware of what was going on. I didn't even need to try anything, it literally felt like I was being lifted out of my physical body and I landed on my bedroom floor.

The first thing I noticed was how REAL it felt. I could actually feel my feet make contact with the carpet, which has that distinct carpet feeling. I went over to my bedroom door and "pushed" my way through it and walked down my hallway. I passed by my parent's room and saw their lights were on, which made sense since they would be getting ready for work at around this time. As I went downstairs, I realized I didn't need to walk, I could "float" my way down.

Here's where I felt like my AP was actually happening. Typically, I leave my laptop in my bedroom, but last night I decided to just leave it on the dining room table. Sure enough, as I passed the dining room, my laptop was there with the lid open as I had left it. I then decided to try to go somewhere cool but had no idea how to actually accomplish that lol. I thought to myself, "go to the moon" and nothing happened lol. So, I tried to go explore around the neighborhood. The weird thing was that I found it hard to get through my front door for whatever reason, it felt like I didn't have enough "umph". I should also note that I live extremely close to a government laboratory, but I didn't have any intentions to explore it. At that point, I decided to return to my physical body. One thing I noticed was that once you "decide" to return, it's hard to change your mind and stay in the AP, maybe because I'm still new to it.

But yeah, as someone who almost gave up I finally did it. I hope this provides inspiration to those still trying, thank you for reading.Hey y’all, I finally did it! I left my body for the first time! I didn’t make it outside of my room but I’ve been working so long at this so I’m happy with the achievement. My question/dilemma is this though - I felt like I didn’t have any control over my movement. It almost felt like I was super drunk and wobbly...and my vision was pretty blurred as well. Is this normal? Could I have been almost asleep so that caused the lack of control/clarity? I took some kratom before bed, so perhaps that caused it? 

PS once I made it out of my body I was trying to move around but struggling. I looked out towards my bedroom door and a bright white light was shining outside. Because I wasn’t feeling very in control, and have read so many stories about people encountering beings, I got a little scared and thought “I want to go back to my body.” Next thing I knew, I was back. I’m excited to try again tonight though. The feeling of leaving my body for the first time is even wilder than I could have thought. Thanks for all the guidance everyone has posted here!Oh God, where do I even start.

I just woke up from my 3rd AP and lets just say I got pretty scared towards the end, because I couldn't wake myself up (return from the astral). There were multiple false awakenings and I had little to no visibility - I simply kept forcing my eyelids to open up with my fingers, but that didn't work.

Good thing that I read Astral Projection Guidebook by Erin Pavlina two weeks back, as it had a technique - fall on your back to wake up - that saved me from a very long turmoil. I recommend that book to everyone before they attempt any kind of AP. Maybe other users can suggest other material as well :)

Another thing I learnt from the book was summoning your spirit guide. I did it today by shouting "Spirit Guide" multiple times before a white figure (was it a horse, or a dog) came rushing into the room to rescue me. My God, that was such a great moment!

Now to go into details, today I spent most of my AP with my spirit guide, I was on her back and I told her about a friend that I wanted to meet. She flew me to this building, which was so serene and everyone there was so friendly and pleasant! I saw a father with his 3 year old daughter there and really felt connected to them and the bond they shared.

But then at some point I lost my visibility again, only to find myself in a completely new place, with a black train passing slowly in front of me. I climbed up the moving train. For some reason, I have a rad-body in this dream, I feel my muscles flexing as I climb up. Then I meet a guy there, the one who's driving the train, he's an older nice guy, I figured. After we talked a little, he started pressing my balls, which made me extremely uncomfortable, but he was also making funny sounds like a clown as he did that. For whatever reason I said "what else can you do?" and he just started giving me a BJ. I really hate to admit this, but it felt amazing and otherworldly. I've had so much sex in lucid dreams, but this was something else. My defence kicked in pretty fast (in like 2 seconds) because this was a dude and I'm a straight guy. But thats not the only thing - I was a 100% sure that there was some other weird energy exchange going on there! I read in the book that low vibrational beings suck on your energy by having sex with you etc. And I thought this was one of those instances.

Although he didn't look like one. So how do you really know if you are with a low vibrational being or not? I figure that it would be a lot more scary? I think I got scared here because of my own assumptions. I flicked my finger to be transported into a different room, where I woke up as a false awakening. I did a reality check, my first thought was that I probably slipped into a lucid dream, but I couldn't fly like I generally do in LD. Instead I could only float. And then I lost my visibility again.

I get scared of the slightest things in an AP. I read in the book (and here in the reddit) that emotions are very heightened in the astral, specially for beginners. So I guess this will improve with time. But any suggestions are welcome here as well. How to not get scared of the dumbest things? Last time I told a guy, "Dude, I'm astral projecting right now", he looked at me in a scary way and some spooky background music started playing. Thats how my first AP ended.

Sorry I rambled quite a bit.

TL;DR -

Tips for beginners:

1. Call spirit guide whenever scared
2. Have a sword or a video game like weapon with you, and fight back with all your power!

Tips needed for myself:

1. Why do I lose visibility? It happens all of a sudden, like someone shut down the lights
2. How to be less scared, how to know what's dangerous and whats not?So I have always had this thing my whole life where I can send what I would call an electric pulse across my body. I can do it over my whole body or in an isolated area. I assumed it was useless until I came across AP. I noticed when I hit the “vibration stage” it feels similar to that pulse I can generate. Is the “pulse” a tool or skill set I can use to project or is it something totally different?  I have been out of body one time that I remember. I haven’t been able to use the pulse feeling in meditation to get out. I can def get to the point where I feel myself floating over my physical body and then I try to pulse on the exhale to force myself out. Any suggestions?OH MY GOSH, I just successfully astrally projected for the first time!!!

Please read this whole experience, it would mean a lot to me!

This happened about two hours ago. Here's a short backstory, to help you understand the events leading up to my astral projection:

I've known about lucid dreaming and astral projection since I was about 10 years old. I never practiced AP'ing but I did have a couple successful lucid dreams. I am now 20 years old. It's pretty common for me to have at least a couple random lucid dreams per year. I've started keeping a dream journal again, in the last couple months, and this week I had 2 lucid dreams.

I am very familiar with dreams, and these lucid dreams were like the standard dreams I have, in that they were pretty vague, blurry, and not static (the dream scape and objects would change so quickly).

So anyway, today I was out doing stuff, and I finally arrive back at my house. I'm tired so I lay down on the couch to rest, not fully intending to sleep. I eventually drift into a standard dream. I drift out of the dream a bit, I realize that I'm spending a lot of time on the couch, and I didn't intend to sleep anyway, so I sort of try to get up but realize that I'm slightly paralyzed. I feel like I'm in this extremely sedated state where everything looks distorted and I can't really move.

I decided to just go with this feeling rather than fight it. I realize that maybe I can attempt to astral project. I begin to focus on raising my vibration, and I think happy thoughts, and imagine a bright light. At this point I'm in a dream state and I can see this house. I'm still undergoing the shift, and my body is vibrating and I hear this loud abrasive and grating screeching. I have no fear during this transition. My vision becomes extremely bright, and I can no longer see the house, and I can't see anything at all. I remember reading on this forum that sometimes your astral eyes take a while to adjust. Eventually the brightness dies down, and I can see the house again, and I realize that the transition is complete. It seemed that this transition was a very long process, longer than I expected.

I'm amazed at how vivid the world is. This was completely unlike any dream I've ever had. The world actually felt VERY solid. The color/texture of everything seemed off, and was weird. I walked up a hill and explored around, and even returned to the place I started at, and I realized that my surroundings were actually staying completely static, rather than changing quickly like a dream.

I clap my hands together and I can actually feel the warmth of my skin, and the sweat on my hands (unlike a dream where I can barely feel my hands while clapping). Eventually, I'm inside this house and I walk up to the white wall. Normally in dreams, I have no problem at all moving through objects. I try to put my hand through the wall but I'm unable. I try to just imagine the motion of my hand going straight through the wall with no resistance. I try again, but again, I hit the completely solid wall. I want to go outside, so I decide I will try to run, jump and crash through the window. I am just barely able to fall through, and appear outside again.

I look around at this beautiful world, and see SO many souls just like myself joyfully running around and exploring this world. I believe that I was seeing ACTUAL other souls like myself exploring this astral plane. Imagine a busy city, but like a fairytale world. There were no boring people moping about on their daily grind, it was simply all people like myself running around with joy and doing incredible things, exploring the astral plane. I remember seeing colors around people, like halos/auras around them.

My view is of this amazing world with a road, and possibly a beach on the left side, and the open skies above me. Similar to [this](https://i.imgur.com/Czt1ExL.jpg) picture. I remember one person in particular was driving a black supercar along this road, having a grand time.

I shouted out into the open world "I would like to talk to my higher self, or any spirit guides or angels watching over me!". I repeated this a couple times but nothing happened, and soon after everything faded and I quickly found myself back in my body in real life.

I was actually a bit confused/bewildered when I first woke up, as I almost couldn't believe that incredible thing had just happened. My real life world seemed a bit foreign after being in that other place. The experience faded extremely quickly, but I was so excited that I actually astral projected, that I quickly ran to my room to get my dream journal, and wrote down every detail.

This experience was absolutely unlike any dream I ever had. Everything was so real, solid, static, and actual (unlike the dream world). I think the coolest aspect of this experience is how I saw other people exploring and doing stuff just like me. The entire experience was short, probably much less than 3 minutes, but it's hard to estimate.

That was amazing!!!It’s all Fuzzzzy[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2GRhAFplkI&ab\_channel=amarjit\_yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2GRhAFplkI&ab_channel=amarjit_yoga)

As the title said I went through this guided meditation and remained still after it ended and got to the vibrations about 10 min later. Normally it takes me almost 1.5 hours.

Basically did as the meditation said up until the very end where he tells you to move again, I just stayed still and relaxed and tried to let go. The vibrations came very quickly, but I sat up too quick hoping to AP and instead just sat up in my actual bed.

Maybe this can be helpful for someone. Lots of love.Lately im re-attempting to open my third eye, and ever since I remember myself, my body vibrates and moves everywhere while i meditate, but not physically. Its like my spirit is moving everywhere, and when I tried focusing it on leaving,
My eyes were closed and suddenly the darkness became light, I didnt know if it to open my eyes, but I heard a weird pressure noise in my ears, and i felt... Different.

I got scared and called myself to not push it more than what i did, and go back. I didnt see anything. Could this be an AP?

What can I do in order to make AP work, from where I am right now? Thank you.

Update: thank you everyone for your responses. I will re-attempt my experience, now with my newfound knowledge about the subject. I will keep you guys updated, and im looking forward towards the new experience 💓If not, you should! Mind blowingOne time me and my dad were on the couch talking about my dead grandpa and at the same exact time we both felt a rush of energy through our bodies. And then we both got goosebumps and started crying for no reason. All within secondsI AP'd today and walked around my neighborhood, where there's lots of kids. And I saw one running/playing in the front yard in one of the houses. 

As I was walking past this house down the street he noticed me, and stopped and stared at me briefly as I walked past. He looked kind of like this [Black Mage](https://pm1.narvii.com/7073/e269ecb6b6704e24422b10987980ff1d9d29a158r1-373-459v2_uhq.jpg), but w/out the wizard outfit. More normal kid clothes. And perhaps a bit less caricature-like, don't remember.

I was a bit reluctant to acknowledge, let alone make contact. As I had never seen any beings in the astral before. This is the 3rd time I really get to explore around.

Anyway, I believe this might've been one of the kids in my neighborhood APing and playing outside his house!

Much love to you Rick and thank you so much for all that you've shared with us! It's absolutely priceless and I can't thank you enough.Like theres a lot of stories about astral projection/psychedelics that people see: hindu gods, aztec, mayan, or egyptian symbols, christ/angels, demons and then theres things like aliens(of multiple types), reptillians, machine elves, hat man 

My question is HOW do these things exist at the same time?! How can so many powerful beings be in charge of the universe without conflicting each other??I'm new to this sub so I'm sorry if this is a repost. The movie isn't exactly accurate with astral projections but it's a really good watchIm going to be real honest. I'm a drug addict, I hate myself alot, and I feel worthless alot of the times. (Not asking for sympathy, just explaining the situation as I think feelings play a role). 

But I made several post here asking why this kept happening. I honestly thought it was all bullshit. Is there any sign of why this actually happens to me now even though I never tried? It was pretty scary at first because I didn't know what was going on. I thought I died and overdosed but I was just projecting. It was so weird, being in that realm and not knowing how I got there. 

In a way, I think I'm in mental to shock because I was scared when we die, thats it, lights out. But the astral realm proves otherwise and it's just so much to take in. How the hell can something so fantasy like be real like this? Like, nothing comes close to this. Not one religion can touch this. This is real. And I guess im just having a hard time accepting that we are infinite when I was sure we all die and thats it.So when I was 12 (I’m 17 now)my dad passed away from suicide and I was in the house  and he wasn’t there in the morning, or atleast I thought he wasn’t and I started searching the house and I went downstairs in the basement but I didn’t walk into the area he was in, it’s like something was keeping me from looking. So now that we got that part out of the way I want to tell u guys what my plan is and has been, it’s to go and astral project back to that event and see everything that happened that night, I have a feeling that whatever made me stay from looking that morning was actually me from the future. And if not that then maybe it was my dad? Or maybe it was both of us because when I do astral project to that night I wonder if I’ll see his spirit leave his body so I can question.I’m lying in bed currently. I was thinking about my physical body and how I have health issues. I then said out loud “It’s just my physical body, my astral body is fully intact.” Right after saying this I heard a woman’s voice right next to me say “Yeah”. I’m alone in my room. Kinda creeped out right now.So when you AP you also bring about new powers like increased psychic abilities.  You don't even have to be successful for those attempts to manifest.  They just arrive due to the fact that you attempted AP numerous times.  And it isn't like psychic powers you can use on will, the powers manifest when you least expect, example you want to get that job you desired or you want to win a lottery place and once you totally forget about those desires they will manifest for you and you will end up getting that which you desired.  

Also, I believe the dream world is strongly affected by Astral Projection attempts.  I started having more lucid dreams when I started attempting AP.  Speaking of AP attempts, I forgot ability to AP and now I just can't do it successfully because of some weight gain and also the bed and pillow I have ever since moving into this house.  Usually though if I go for a short quick run during daytime to tire out my body, I can achieve SP or AP easily but lately not AP and just SP.  So I believe AP attempts actually bring our higher self closer to our physical and that is why we start getting lucid dreams.  Dreams are in the Astral most of the time and our brains adds to the content in that astral realm is what I believe.  or Dreams are in a very close area to the Astral itself.  I've had dreams arrive to me of winning lottery and I actually did win it in real life.  So that can't possibly be from the brain, the higher self of ours was most likely sending us the images of us winning directly into our brain memory.  Future events often get seen in Dreams for a reason, because they can be true stuff coming from the future.

Another thing I want to add is that belief and desire to go to afterlife also takes one closer to higher self and enlightenment . I will tell you story of my friend, he dropped out of college in the US and he moved back to his home country because his father said he didn't wanna see him anymore for not finishing college.  I visited him in homeland back in 2014 as I was also visiting Grandma and sister.  He isn't related to me but we knew each other from when he was back in US.  He was doing some graphics desire work and as I hung out with him he often mentioned his desire to go to the afterlife and some suicidal thoughts.  I talked him out of suicide by telling him that his father can still take him back if he does what his father likes to see and attend a university in that country as education is almost free there due to it being more poor.  And then I noticed in the guys face and pictures a certain glow and his eyes appeared more bold or cleaner, like pure looking eyes and all that.  The guy looked like he was enlightened even though he never did look like that in the past and looked average.  

Turns out that the guys desire to go to the afterlife was starting to manifest and he was being enlightened or purified by God and the Angels or something.  I don't know how that process works, but when someone really doesn't want this life anymore and doesn't want to commit physical suicide, someone the higher self takes him out of this world permanently via some death.  In this case right after I flew out and came back to the US, I heard he was killed by a Mosquito so I immediately knew that it was his time and that his desire to leave this earth was granted.  As I looked at his Facebook profile to post on there Rest in Peace brother, he was wearing a Khamis in one of the photos and his eyes were glimmering and skin near glowing in that photo.  It was most likely one of his last photos with friends before the Mosquito killed him.

 He was a young guy too and Mosquitos just don't kill us at our age, so I knew something else was involved to allow him to pass away.

Speaking of passing away, I also believe that a lot of wrong place wrong timing accidental deaths are actually meant to be and it was the persons time.  To us humans it looked accidental and wrong place wrong time, but that person was already pre-destined to die at that exact moment at that time by those circumstances.  We all have our day and a good chunk of us will die that way by walking to our deaths and accident, and many more will die of old age.  Some like Robert Monroe may never come back to their bodies after they project for the last time.I was having a weird vivid dream and suddenly a bunch of entities jumped me and started spraying this spider web memory wipe energy at me.  I manipulated the energy so it didn't touch me.  They were spraying it at me from two sides but it still didn't touch me.  It got really close but it didn't touch me.  Then the spider webs encased me like a statue and I just stood there.  Then I woke up.  So if you run into entities and they try to throw energy at you that you don't like you can manipulate it so that it either doesn't touch you or you can transmute it into something else.  You can also manifest a shield to keep it away from you.  But I can do it without a shield.  And if you want to get rid of them throw love at them.  They hate that.  It sends them fleeing like vampires in sunlight.  So anyway that was interesting.In my time zone (CET) it will be new year in 9 hours and i wanted to take the time to wish all of you a happy new year already!

I am so proud of this community because it really feels like a community. We have done so much improvements this year and the work we are doing is so important from a cosmic point of view.

A heartfelt thank you for the entire community.

Keep spreading the word, keep talking about it, keep teaching it to people who are not yet in the know and take the time to help and introduce the subject to our new members. Even the smallest, most insignificant looking action can have great consequences in the course of time.

Enjoy tonight and stay safe!

\- So that our ripples may become great waves -After a long process of back and forth with the admins of Reddit I am happy to announce this sub got a new moderator!

This sub has not been actively moderated for 10+ months with dilutions in quality, people leaving and separating as a result. and I am happy to announce that is about to change. I believe it is something a lot of community members have been wanting for a while now. I will be actively moderating from this day on and making sure the sub is as informative and helpful as can be to as many people as possible.  The subject of Astral Projection is very dear to me, as it is to many of you, and I will do my best to improve the subs quality as good as I can. Let's do this.

&#x200B;

I updated the flairs and the rules. Please use and follow accordingly. I will state the new rules of the sub in this post that i will stick for a while so everybody can see. I am planning on sticking some old posts that i deem as very helpful or a contribution to the sub.  Please note in the comments what you experience as good/bad/need for improvement/ objections in light of these new changes.  If you don't speak no one will hear you.

The rules as for now:

**Flair your submissions accordingly**

In order to get a clear overview of posts and find what you are looking for it is important to flair your submissions accordingly. Please do so to improve the user experience.

&#x200B;

**Flair yourself accordingly, if you wish.**

Be honest with your flairs for nothing is to be gained by lying to oneself.

&#x200B;

**No excessively promoting YouTube channels.**

Reddit is not an extension for your YouTube channel. Of course you can post a video that you made on this sub, if the subject and content is relevant and if you don't spam your video's. You will be notified if you do.

&#x200B;

**Content needs to be on topic**

This is a subreddit for Astral Projection, not occult practices. If you believe your occult practices help you with your ability to project that's perfectly fine, for you. If you want to discuss/ talk about the occult there is a subreddit for that over at r/occult. The subject of Astral Projection is controversial enough as it is and in order to grow and teach this to as many people as possible, gate keeping is required.

&#x200B;

**Content needs to be on topic**

Post content needs to be on topic and in accordance with the subject of Astral Projection or beneficial to its understanding as a concept.

&#x200B;

**No advertising**

No promoting or advertising services or products. Exceptions could be made if the purpose is to inform in stead of make money, but that has to be reviewed according to the situation, but don't count on it.

Report spam, harassing, advertising and so forth.

Reports will be reviewed and appropriate action will be taken if legitimate.

&#x200B;

**Don't be to extreme on your convictions**

More of a tip then a rule but if you completely burrow yourself in what you believe is true, you will disable the ability to learn. The very nature of this subject is undefinable, keep your mind open to all possibilities and input from others.

If you are to venture deeper into this subject it would be your best tool to achieve what you are looking for

&#x200B;

**Please help the newbies :)**

There is a lot of people who venture into this sub who are fairly new to the subject. Remember where you came from, remember the feeling when you first discovered. You have the ability to help somebody else to do the same and in my eyes that is one of the most rewarding thing we van achieve in life, helping someone discover this truly wonderful experience.

&#x200B;

**For the Love of God, have fun and discover:)**

This is a great community where you can always count on support of the members. Lets keep it a place of learning, a place of growth and experience. lets venture outside what is deemed reality and lets support each other in doing so :)

&#x200B;

Please give your input on the entire matter so we can discuss this and make changes if necessary, nothing is set in stone and if certain desires get enough momentum they will be implemented.

&#x200B;

Edit: I have been looking into the reports that have been made over the last period. I will pick up everything that has been reported up until one month ago. Thanks everyone who has been making reports of all sorts. I will keep this post up for a while before looking into older, but still recent posts in accordance with the new rules. I would like some more feedback from the community first before I act upon the newly stated rules.

&#x200B;

Edit: Community description is also updated.

&#x200B;

Edit: Rule nr 4 ''No occult/magic content'' has been rephrased into : ''Content needs to be on topic'' with a new description. I believe in order to understand and explain Astral Projection the subject needs to be viewed in a broader perspective.Hello, as the title says I astral projected today and was so excited I wanted to make a post here for others to enjoy and hopefully gain insight from it. 

First off, I have known about astral project for over a decade now and am an avid lucid dreamer and have had astral projections occasionally. But I have never successfully done it three times in one day. Also, I want to encourage you, if you haven't to read the pinned post on this subreddit before continuing because it outlines a lot of context I won't go over here but I feel is vital if you want to have successful APs.

Now getting into the technique I used for APing, first I laid on my back with my arms in any position, crossed, folded, or laying at your sides. Relax and as you get more tired try to imagine your arms being up out in front of you without actually moving them. When you eventually fall asleep your astral arms should be out above you. Hence, why I coined this technique arms up. Next, move your astral arms around a bit testing their solidity, clasp your hands together, swing them side to side etc. Next, now do the same with your legs. At this point you should have both your arms and your legs floating. Now, for the most difficult part, getting the rest of your body/torso out. This takes time and you have to be patient. At this time you may experience vibrations and energy pressure at the base of your spine. Remember, never fear anything, it is a slippery slope to failure and possibly trauma. There are many ways to get your torso out, some include rolling, standing up, or floating up. Eventually you will feel your astral body fully realized and you are able to autonomously move it and perceive through it. Always remember, it is called Astral projection, meaning you are projecting your consciousness through a vessel in this case your astral body. It is common to be aware of your sleeping body and still perceiving all your senses through your astral body. Next, you want to get away from your sleeping body. I simply walk out my door but there are other ways. You may be tempted to look at your sleeping body but beware that may lead to awakening. That's it, you should be able to explore the astral plane now. 

Tips: Astral projecting draws a lot of energy you will undoubtedly come across entities looking to feed off your fear. An excellent technique I developed while in sleep paralysis to stave off entities is what i called the seal of protection. You imagine yourself in a sphere of protection and make sure you have it encase the front and back of your body. If the entity persists simply give it love and don't be afraid whatsoever. The entity should disappear if its intention was to scare you.After reading of someone’s experience where archangel Michael showed them some wonders of the universe in the astral, I had a lucid dream where I called for him and he came to me. The pure white light coming off of him was so bright that I couldn’t look directly at him, all I could see was white. I asked him if he could show me some amazing things too, and he responded asking why I wanted him to. I was kind of taken back by this, I hadn’t thought about why I wanted to see some amazing things, I mean doesn’t everyone want to? Anyway, after that he led me across the sky saying something about seeing white comets and as we crossed the sky I saw white asteroids falling into the atmosphere leaving white streaks. After this, I fell into a not-so-lucid state and had some of my usual vivid dreams. I’m grateful to even dream of him, though I hope to see him in the astral one of these days too.Anything you've seen or someone said to you that lead you on thinking how afterlife works? I've read posts on here about animals reincarnating and upgrading to the next level after a number of lives so what is the theory you have?I had just gone to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. spirits were on my mind.  I was thinking of how spirits can see the future, past, and present like humans cannot, without that gift. 
Suddenly, I felt my body violently jerked into the space above a favorite spot in my home town. As I looked down, a voice said to me :
"This is how you see it. THIS is how we see it, as spirits."
Suddenly (this part is very hard to explain) my view went from me just normally looking down at the trees and water, to my vision changing. I was seeing colors I've never seen, my periferals widened as if I didn't even have peripherals, it was a 360° sight. I could see things as if in  another dimension, another plane.. That's the only way I can explain it. It was so crazy bizarre that I don't even have words to describe it. The depth, width, and breadth of everything was astonishing. 
Even my ability to observe this and the way I saw my body was different. I felt as light as the air, I KNEW things,and could see the past of the area. 
Has anyone else had anything happen to them like this, that could maybe explain it better?  Thanks!Writing about an experience I had on September 23, 2019. I've been in this group for a bit, but I'm trying to share my experiences to people and just surround myself with like minded people. I document all my astral experiences and I document my dreams that foreshadow future events that later do happen. A small background about me, I'm a scientist/chemist living in Boston, Ma. I started my spiritual journey back in high school (2013) and since then been searching for answers each day through books and my experiences. I've experienced astral projection, dreams of the future and psychic moments induced through meditation. 

Now onto my short experience. 
September  23, 2019

I woke up at 2am and couldn't fall back asleep until 3:33am. As I was dozing off I felt the vibrations and heard loud buzzing noises; I knew what this was, but I had not experienced it in a while, so I made the sensations stop. I've become pretty good at balancing between in and out of the vibration stage when they occur, I can turn it off and on. I finally decided I wanted to meditate to make the vibrations come back, and it worked. While during the vibration stage I relaxed myself and let the vibrations take over myself. At that moment it went black and I focused on the question "what is my purpose?". Appeared was a blonde woman in her mid 40's, wearing a business suite, sitting behind a news anchor desk and spoke directly to me and said firmly "you are the aid that will help people and guide them, you will bring balance". After that short message I quickly woke up and sat up in bed and wondered what that meant to me. 

I'll be sure to share more of my experiences and learn from you guys, so we all can help out one another. Thanks in advance everyone!the furthest i have ever gotten in astral projection was the tingling sensation and nearly rollig out of my body but being stopped by a force. but i can never visualise my arms or see anything in my room, and I think part of the problem is me trying to “see” how one sees with their eyes. but how do i visualise myself standing up without feeling limited by the concept of gravity in the physical realm while i am lying down?A while ago I was really getting into astral projection and I told myself that I'm going to think of very exciting and happy things while I'm there so my vibration matches my environment and I dont end up in a lower plane.
So one day I got back from school and at that time my vibration was really low i had anxiety,depression,was aggresiv all the time (like you typicall highschool teenager) 
So I went to sleep (on my stomach) and my astral body just popped out of my physical body like it was nothing I looked around and it felt like I'm in a very very dark place everything had a black aura around it the vibe was very depressing so realised I'm in a lower plane and forced myself to get excited and happy and when I did that I slammed right back to my body.
That was the first time I consciously got out and back in my body.
Even tho it was a short experience I still appreciate itWant to experience what we call astral projection? A fancy made up label for consciousness...
Consciousness separate from physical body! Here's how!

First use some freaking discipline and willpower get your cell phones and LED lights away from you 1 hour before bed! They burn your natural melatonin levels and throw off your circadian rhythm making this, like fishing without bait... spend this time focusing your mind, doing a little meditation, keeping the intention to experience this tonight on your mind.

Intention is very important you also want to set a very strong intention that you * Will* ! Recognize when you wake up naturally in the middle of the night. We all wake up every 90 minutes at the end of sleep cycle  You want to begin to train yourself to recognize these short little wake-ups. And don't do what we always do!  Re get comfortable and fall back asleep as quick as possible! NO DONT, instead as soon as you have recognized that you have just woken up have another strong intention that the first thought that comes to your mind will be, DONT MOVE! You will either have or develop a very strong sensation to rollover change position scratch itches, clear throat, and movie in anyway, This is the brain in the body communicating back and forth to test and see if you are awake or not.

Here comes some more willpower and discipline do not give in! This will be uncomfortable but this will not kill you! But itches will build up worse and worse! Don't move!!! As well as begin to do some creative thinking to not let yourself fall back asleep remember your goals your intentions and what you want to experience, keep a rapid pace of thinking at this point, DONT Fall Asleep... the urge to move and scratch itches will vanish.... and at this point you have just trick your body to go to sleep while keeping your mind awake! And you have just entered [sleep paralysis]

O MY o my sleep Paralisis can be a little complicated for beginners because it naturally provokes a fear response... and you may feel some very strange Sensations... like feeling vibrations, feeling of falling, hearing noises, seeing through closed eyelids, seeing colors swirls, images, and More! It is very important to stay calm, in  sleep paralysis just like in the dream state itself our emotions and feelings manifest here quickly... if you are feeling fear and doubt, / bad every day karma, you are likely to have a bad experience and never want to try this again! It is important to balance your emotions only feelings of Joy excitement love powerful words and phrases nothing  negative!  Or...... you may have run in with Something negative.. the last thing you want, is what most would call a demon or negative entity with you while you are paralyzed! It's bad news bears ! 

Let's say you make it this far you have entered sleep paralysis! The gateway to what most are calling out of Body Experience, astral projection, and wake induced lucid dreaming! And you have balanced your emotions, what next!? [ Exit Strategy ] there are many I'm going to cover one! ROLL OUT OF BED EXIT, you want to visualize your room or environment around you with us much detail as you can really paint the picture in your mind, as well as visualize what it would look like and feel like to make the motion of rolling out of your bed onto the floor of your room. You can create a rocking sensation by putting all of your attention onto the left half of your body mainly shoulder blade area, then on to bright side back and forth back and forth. A rocking sensation may arise making the exit easier,  believe that you will roll out of bed! See it in your mind with as much detail as possible.. if the visualization exercise is not enough you may actually attempt to make the physical motion of rolling out of bed if the sleep paralysis is strong enough you will be stuck like glue!

Now let's say you have gotten this far and the magic has happened! You have just rolled your Consciousness out into the environment around you... your physical body is asleep in bed but yet you are aware, aware of yourself on the floor of your room, it is likely to be dark a little bit and gloomy... because the brain has shut down certain portions of itself for sleep, we can fix this fast! Activating our senses in this experience taste, touch, smell, and hearing. Wake up thease sleeping portions turning the experience, yellow out * ALEXA  Play Music! You are very likely to begin to hear music! Visualize a candy in your closed fist open your fist eat the candy pay attention to the way it tastes! When you can taste something you know the exercise is working you will see your experience around you become more Vivid bright and clear. Touch your body touch the floor touch your surroundings pay attention to texture... do these stabilizing techniques until you are satisfied with the clarity of your experience. Reach behind your back visualize a flower stem between your fingers feel the flower stem Pull It Forward and smell that flower!!

From Here!!!! Have fun... Go Flying! Travel the stars, you are only Bound by your imagination here in this state of consciousness!  What I just explained is the most advanced form of lucid dreaming know this  does not come easy... does it sound worth learning to you though?! We can all do this... with patience practice and willing to learn... it's a lot like when you very first learn to ride a bike without training wheels it just doesn't make sense until you, yourself get a feel for it. 

P.S, lucid dreaming is not lucid dreaming, astral projection is not astral projection, out of body experiences, false Awakenings, the phase... and more fancy labels are all same thing! *Conciousness, awareness... Aware in the aware, 

Both Jesus And Buddah, Both Quoted About  [Seeing The Light In The Darkness] this is not metaphorical! It is the State of Consciousness, within it we can see light in darkness !

The Elite Scum bags are doing everything in their power to suppress your abilities and keep this to themselves.... they believe they are Pharaoh's... and that this tool is only for them! What's really crazy is that we think slavery was abolished.....when really 1% has enslaved 99% threw the use of dark subliminal mind magick! manipulations and deceit of Truths SIGHHHH...................................!I hear astral projection stories of traveling to higher dimensioned other planets, however has anyone astrally explored the depths of the ocean. If so I would love to hear about it :-This entity spoke with me via changing my surroundings. The only reason I knew it was present was the fact I knew where to look. I asked what is this place, why are you here and I’m there? 

Once asked I was taken into a void, all the surroundings simply and quickly vanished. Some what of a short film or vision occurred.

Let me drop you into the situation. Before there was everything, there was infinite time, and darkness. Pre Big Bang. You had no physical or spiritual body, yet you can think. So logically, you start thinking. 

    Everything you think of, becomes reality. However, whatever you create, never challenges you on their own, never insults you unless instructed to do so. You can create a game and a whole different team for fun, however before the game starts, you know the outcome, because you made it.  


You try to live this life of being able to have whatever you desire and you grow so very bored and so very tired. You have everything you want. Heaven as some describe it. However the longer you seem to be in this situation the more it starts to feel like hell. 

So you stop, and ask yourself why exactly does this feel so bad? You realize that in order to have fun, you have to be bored for awhile, and in order to feel bliss you must feel pain. 

You realize that not knowing everything is more fun. So you start crafting a reality where sections of your knowledge and self reside. No one slice the same. Some very similar, and some the exact opposite. 

You chose to live as a biped in a universe you spend weeks crafting. You end up saying “fuck it” and you dive into the world. Eventually, you get mauled by a bear. 

When you die, it hits you HARD like a drug that you’ve never tried. After all the pain and anguish from the bear you just pop back into black, fully connected, fully conscious, full of bliss. 

You did it! You tricked yourself into having the best 25 years of your entire existence. You spend some time having the freedom to do anything for a bit and remember what loneliness is. How imperfect a perfect reality is. And you decide to jump back in.

What I woke up feeling very sure about was this:

The point of life is to enjoy it. If you have lost a loved one recently, remember that this pain is packaged with bliss. It’s hard to understand why specific things happen to us, however the reality of consciousness is that Yin can’t be present without Yang. 

Understand that you will choose to jump back into this reality. Understand that when you’re rude to someone, you’re being rude to yourself. You made a personal growth reincarnation system that’s random and karmaic. You set it up that way, for you by you. The more people you hurt, the more likely you’re going to reincarnate as one of them.

Love thy self. Love thy neighbor. Do not judge based off fear. You are consciousness, you are god. And so is every other living creature.

I don’t normally feel the need to share my projections. For some reason this one felt worthy of sharing.I asked this glowing orb of light that looked like a star what is life. And the orb showed me something I can only describe as patterns mixed with other beings other than you. I asked them but it didn’t seem like they wanted to speak to me. 

I was also teleported to this planet called KybenB-364. There were big wasp like creatures that were at war with and unknown entity. I asked them what was going on and what am I and they told me to shut up and fight. I was confused on who I was for a second because I saw what the guy next to me saw. It was like I was both people at the same time. It was the weirdest experience I ever had and I soon got out of there.This is what I heard Before I astral projected. Except it was so loud I thought my head was going to explode. [Here's the link.](https://soundcloud.com/fire-wolf-698867526/astral-projection-sounds-4)Last night was just a normal night. Well, probably, I was more tired than usual yesterday.

And when I get THAT tired, I usually get sleep paralysis. And I haven’t had one in a long time.

So, when I had a sleep paralysis last night, at first I got scared. Because I couldn’t move. But then, I remember that sleep paralysis can be a stepping stone to achieve AP. So, I immediately tried to stand up.

THEN IT HAPPENED. I felt the vibration! It was a vibration that I haven’t felt before. I think the closer I can describe it is during those arcade games wherein it you have to keep your hands on the metal rod while it tries to “shock” you with electricity. And in this game, the longer you keep your hands on the “electric rod”, the more the game tries to increase the voltage. But it isn’t really electricity, the metal rod is really just vibrating really fast and really hard to the point that it feels similar to getting shocked.

That is how, or at least close to it, felt like.

I only noticed the vibration in my head.

Then I got out of my body. It was surreal! I really saw our room and me, still lying in bed! But it didn’t last long. I think I immediately got back to my body. But I kept on fighting it. I wanted more. I think my astral body wants to go back to my body, but my mind wouldn’t let it. I was fighting myself in order to keep myself in the Astral Plane.

Then everything went blank. I fell asleep again.

The experience was insane! I wish I can do it again consciously without relying on getting a sleep paralysis.

And I kinda enjoyed the vibration stage. It felt really good. But I think spending more time in the astral plane is better.

Edit: Woah is pretty much accepted as a word where I’m from compared to “WHOA” which nobody uses.I've collected all the versions of Robert Monroe's Hemi Sync - The Gateway Experience tapes in FLAC quality.


* The original Gateway tapes, Waves 1-6, 1996 version. Tapes 5 and 6 of this version which were unguided, and meant to be free flow experiences are no longer on sale. 
  

* Edited versions from 2004, of Waves 5 and 6 with added exercises to focus 15 to 21. These were narrated by Robert Monroe's daughter Laurie Monroe. These tapes were discontinued too. 
  

* Edited versions from 2015, of Waves 5 and 6, were narrated by Robert Monroe's stepson AJ. Honeycutt.



* Finally Wave 7 - Voyager, produced and narrated by AJ. Honeycutt released in 2019, featuring exercises for focus 23 to 27.



I tried to share them, but I keep getting caught in reddit's spam filter. So I've made a pdf copy of my previous post and embedded Google Drive and Mega links to every tape inside the pdf. 



Note 1: Google Drive links have 7z files of each tape. So you have to use either 7zip, a free open source software on windows or ZArchiver on Android. For IOS, you can use 'unzip', and flacbox to play the files



Note 2: All links are inside the pdf file I will link below. Try a different PDF viewer if you can't click the links inside. 


Note 3: Be sure to check the 'misc' folder in each Wave's folder, that contains pdf and doc instructions on each of the tapes.

###Edit: Those who are having trouble downloading can visit @CosmicAwareness channel I created on Telegram. I've uploaded the files there, and will also be uploading many more Hemi Sync files and selected resources to expand consciousness.For me, I learned a lot about the power of love. When faced with negative entities that would fill me with fear, I would focus on the feeling of love and imagine it as light energy. I then focused on all the people I love and the people those people love and visualize these connections as light beams spreading across the earth until the entire earth glowed like the sun. This visualization filled me with warmth and security, banishing my fear instantly along with the entities.

This experience really impacted me and gave me strength in realizing that love is not just an emotion, it’s a source of strength and a state of being. It’s the opposite of fear without a doubt. When I feel anxious or afraid, I like to remember that.

I would love to hear about your most impactful experiences and what you’ve learned.I was fixing the auto mod bot because the regex code I setup here to filter out particular offensive words wasn't working anymore, so I tested the words myself by making posts... lo and behold, I was automatically removed for it. I spoke to Reddit and in summary they said they can't do anything about it and that I'm okay to create this profile but I should take it as a warning not to do it again (even though I didn't create intentional harm)... what a mess. Anyway, it seems Reddit is very strict and who knows how long this one will last 😂 so be sure to catch me on my YouTube ([Astral Doorway](https://www.youtube.com/astraldoorway)) 💛

🙏I find it very beautiful that all we know to ever exist is most likely 0.0001 of what actually is out there in the universe, you're all beautiful and I wish you nothing but amazing Astral experiences beyond your enjoyment and spirituality❤️Alot of strange unexplained phenomenon occurs there. So I was wondering if anyone has used AP to go there, and if so, what did you encounter?So I have developed my own way of getting into sleep paralysis, it's 100% guarantee rather than having to sit in bed for an hour lol.

So I did it, I was in my bed laying down, falling into sleep waking up a second later, playing tag with sleep. Then BOOM, I felt the sensation, the intro sequence. It was the ringing, the ringing came in and I waited 3 minutes and then boom, the second sensation came in, it was the ringing like whooshing from no noise to high volume then dissipating a second later. This would happen every 10 seconds. 

&#x200B;

That I knew that it was happening. Then I felt a very strong vibrating feeling in my nose / third eye area. Then my body starting falling into sleep paralysis. I was too scared to let my body fall into it because the feeling was so powerful and overwhelming. So I stopped the process. 

Next thing I know I'm like, okay Brandon just try it without fully falling into sleep paralysis. So what I did is I lay there for 5 minutes, the sensations kicked in again, and as I was falling into sleep paralysis like my body numbing, I started imagining me climbing a rope. When I tell you I was super detailed with this rope, I felt my hands on the rope, etc. 

&#x200B;

Next thing I know, the feelings intensify IMMENSELY, pictures started flashing through my eyes, ringing in the ears, heart racing, whooshing in my ears and body, I felt a blue color flash in my eyes as if I was about to leave the body. Let's just say the transition as if I was leaving my body. I was petrified of the feelings because it was so foreign and POWERFUL, so I stopped the process and got out of sleep paralysis. A couple of minutes later laying in bed, I heard a realistic female whisper saying Brandon.. my name. Almost did it guys, gonna try again tomorrow with someone next to me so im not scared.I’m making this very clear I have never astral projected although I almost did when I didn’t even know about astral projection but if everything everyone says here is true that would mean it would be possible to throw a party right? I could only imagine what’s in the astral plane. And to imagine a party in it. 😣😖 I really wanna go there😥(edit: many people seem to find it hard to move your body in your mind but remember you are not just thinking about a arm that's moving you have to actually move your own hand and arms in your mind not in real life but in your mind feel what it feels like when moving your limbs recreate that feeling in your head) 

I will do a step by step instruction on this fast and easy Astral projection technique for beginners and experts. This technique skips almost all hard steps like rope techniques or techniques that require you to wait and stay still all the time.

Things you will require: bed or seat. 
(for this technique try falling out your bed or try to reinact the feeling you get when falling out of your bed. 

You know when you fall asleep you sometimes feel like falling? Try to recreate that feeling in your mind. Almost like making your body feel a chill slightly shaking your head like it's vibrating. 

Step 1: lay down or sit still, relax your body.
Step 2: focus on breathing and give yourself the feeling that you are falling and that you are scared like adrenaline. This will make your body feel heavy. 
Step 3: when your body is heavy try moving your hands and arms not your physical just in your mind.
Step 4: when you start feeling tingly don't move or get scared. Then you start to vibrate.
Step 5: when you are vibrating intensly and you feel like your sinking into your bed or floating roll over. Don't actually roll out. Just think about the feeling you get when rolling around and do it in your mind.
This is essentially a new technique that I sort of accidentally discovered on my own which I'm sure will work for most people. It's basically a combination of the wbtb as well as powerful breathwork which both work together to put your mind in the perfect state to project. This breathwork is said to release natural dmt in your brain which plays a huge role in relexation. Although it may not be as powerful as the actual psychedelic (DMT), think of it as attempting an AP with your body's natural psychedelics.

Its fairly simple. You first follow through with the wbtb technique and once you wake up, you perform 3 rounds of breathwork exercises as detailed in this video below.

[https://youtu.be/lwlEJ2O-6HM?t=311](https://youtu.be/lwlEJ2O-6HM?t=311)

 I first performed these sets of exercises mid-day when I was fully awake and active, and it still managed to put my mind into this state of relaxation. After doing that I felt like I could fall asleep peacefully any moment but I had to stop myself since I had other things to do for the day. But as soon as I experienced these results, I ended up trying this technique with the wbtb to attempt an AP which ended up being a huge success.

What happened was I woke up for a little bit, then spent around 5 mins performing these sets of breathing exercises which put my mind and body into this deep state of relaxation and awareness. I went back to sleep and again very gently focused my own awareness on my breathing. I wasn't very conscious at this point so within 30 seconds to 1 min (at least what that felt like to me), I woke up to these powerful vibrations and exited my body as normal with the roll out technique.

Im gonna be honest tho, I have only tested this once so I don't know how reliable it is but Im just too exited not to share it. If you do try this, I'd love to hear about it and if you have any sorts of questions, please comment it down below!So I posted about an experience I had as a comment yesterday and it got a fair amount of postive feedback.  I thought I would share one of my best AP experiences as a post.  This happened to me in 2012 and the following is a post I made about it on another forum when the details where still fresh in my mind.  This is one of the few times  I came back from an AP with verifiable info.

 In this particular trip I was "on the other side" visiting some deceased relatives. I don't remember getting there and I don't remember leaving, but I often find myself visiting. I was sitting on a couch across from my grandmother (deceased)  and my aunt (also deceased) was in the room with us. We were having a conversation about life when I noticed a picture in a frame on the coffee table. The little boy in the picture looked remarkably like the pictures of me when I was young. I picked up the picture and ask my grandmother, "is this a picture of me grandma?"

"No" she remarked, "that is a picture of my **bompa**. She took the picture from my hand and kind of tilted it. When she did the young man in the picture became a tall lanky old man with graying hair and a friendly smile. She walked over to a bureau where my aunt was standing and came back with an armful of photographs. She started showing me these pictures of all the decedents of **bompa**. I started to cry thinking to myself that I had all this family that I had never met. That was the last thing from the trip that I remember.

When I woke up the first thing I did was go to my computer and google bompa. It was such a distinct word that I had brought back with me. I wasn't really expecting it to mean anything, I know that my memory after the fact on these sort of things can be hazy. Well it turns out that Bompa, means grandpa in Flemish. Flemish is a language shared in the Netherlands and Belgium. If this weren't enough proof of the truth in my experience, just to be sure I called my mother. I had always known that there was some native american in my geneology, but had never looked too far into the European heritage. Sure enough when I asked my mother about my grandmothers lineage, she informed me that my grandmothers grandparents were indeed dutch, which to me says west German, Netherlands and Belgium. Up until this experience I had never heard the word Bompa before.So I tried astral projecting and the vibrations were HARDCORE I’m so shaken up rn and I was only trying for 8 minutes any tips to get past this point bc I’m so scared rnThe other morning I had a successful projection experience.  I got myself to the vibration stage and exited my body and went into my living room.  I wanted to ground myself by engaging my senses, so I started touching everything and ate a cookie on the coffee table (I learned that eating anything in the astral or in a lucid dream helps immensely with stabilization). 

&#x200B;

Eventually I went outside my house and looked up at the stars.  I remembered my intention that I set before I projected: that I wanted to visit my past life.  I looked up at the stars and started flying upward while holding the intention to visit my past life.  I started focusing on one star in particular, and it grew in size as i approached it and turned into a big bright tunnel.  It reminded me of the light tunnel described by people who have had NDE's or by Tibetan Buddhists.  I entered the tunnel and found myself in a small pool of water that had some sort of ancient sybmol on the bottom of it.

&#x200B;

When I exited the pool I found myself in a big classroom with test sheets everywhere.  It reminded me of an old fashioned school in some sort of castle.  Almost like a classroom from hogwarts.  I saw 2 female teachers standing by the test sheets.  I asked them what the tests where for? They simply said "alot of different things". 

I figured I was in a scene from my past life, so I asked them "Who am I?"

&#x200B;

The teacher looked at me confused.  "What do you mean?"

&#x200B;

I clarified, "What is my name?"

&#x200B;

She laughed and said "We call you Talking Tara"

&#x200B;

Wanting to remember this, I went immediately back to my body to record this.  Fast-forward to today. I just googled "Talking Tara" out of curiosity.  The only thing that showed up was a musician that went by Talking Tara.  I've never heard of her before, and when I check spotify, it seems as though she has barely any listeners.  But it is amazing middle-eastern music/drumming that really resonates with me.  

&#x200B;

My whole life my main focus has been on playing/writing/recording music.  I've released an album that got onto a local record label and got some local college radio plays, and I'm currently working on another.  The weirdest connection is this: about 50-60% of the time I astral project, I'm accompanied by eastern/middle eastern music for the first part of the projection that sounds eerily similar to the Talking Tara music.  I'm also really drawn to this type of music IRL as well.

&#x200B;

So what do you guys make of this?  The Talking Tara album was released in 2006, so I doubt that she is my past self since she is still alive (unless this album was released post-mortem).  Part of me wonders if I'm karmically connected to this artist in some way.  I only wish there was some way to reach out to her.  I can't find any contact info.  

&#x200B;

I'm also aware that this could all be my imagination/coincidence and that I'm looking for meaning where there is none.  (I'm mostly inclined to this idea tbh, it's just fun to think about these kinds of things).

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Went to a supposed past life in astral projection.  Was told my name was Talking Tara.  Found this person IRL through google.  Turns out it is a musician who I feel connected to. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRe0SEOUTEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRe0SEOUTEI)

Astral projections aren't something new for me, i dont want to sound egocentric but i've had maybie about 20 fully conscious projections to this date. But sometimes i feel stucked in the transition phase when your body is fully vibrating and getting uncomfortably numb and it just feels so much unpleasant that i need to give up. But this audio track helped me get through this phase i swear it, you just need to focus on the sounds and the pain in the physical body and uncomfotrtableness (sry if thats not a word) will just fade away while your energetic body is seperating from the physical one. Here is my technique:

1. You need to be laying straight on your back, for some reason this is the hardest position to fall asleep and its the most comfortable one for the seperation of energetic body
2. The goal is to stay awake while your body falls asleep (you probably know this already sorry)
3. You need to be maximum comfortable and dont move your body but literally no movements when you once get the perfect position, you can make really tiny movements and adjustments from time to time but the goal is not to move at all
4. It will take some time, after about 20-30 minutes of laying, your body will start to tingle and vibrate, your whole body will vibrate very intense, the audio track needs to be played at very low volume just to keep you awake
5. Unfortunately it will start to feel uncomfortable at some point, i dont understand why it has to be that way but it has to be for some reason You must not move or you will disrupt the process
6. You need to be looking in front of your closed eyes, you will see some dark-blue shapes floating through the darkness, you need to follow them and just go with the flow, they will also help you stay awake, i think this blue shapes are actually ether or the "air" of astral, call it whatever, for some reason all of my friends and people i talked to also see this blue shapes/clouds
7. Your room needs to be in complete darkness, thats one of the most important things, you can wear a sleep mask if you can
8. You will literally feel that your spiritual body is seperating from your physical body, your heart will start to beat very fast and you may start to become scared of the unknown, this is the most tricky part
9. In this part i am visualizing a rope hanging from my ceiling, and you need to visualize yourself climbing up that rope and include all senses and feelings as much as you can and use your arms and everything
10. In one moment you will just appear in your room, you will see yourself/your body sleeping, or you maybie spawn in some random location, you can fuckin fly bro, flying in astral is the most amazing feeling, its like floating in some huge ocean, all sensations in astral are boosted by +3000% , you feel everything more intense

sorry for the long post but the audio really played a big role since i haven't had a successful projection for a while, haven't had willpower to go through the uncomfortable sensations of transitionI've just started trying to astral project for the past 2 weeks, and today I finally got one of my hands to leave my body! I could feel it rising in the air, but at the same time I could feel my physical hand still underneath my blankets. That's the farthest I've gone so far, and I'm really excited! I think I actually messed myself up when I was doing it, cause once I realized my astral hand wasn't in my body anymore, woke up from the excitement of getting so close. I wonder how far I could've gotten! All I know is I'm trying the exact same method tonight, and I'm going to see if I can get both of my hands to come out.I think I beieve in it because people can not be collectively lying about something so big, and because I have friends whom I trust and who have no reason to lie that have experienced things like that  but I do not know a lot about it. Is it dangerous? I have heard that it is, and i have also heard that you an visit people's dreams with it. Can someone explain it to me? And when you do ''project'', where oes the consciousness that is nnow outside of your body go?

Edit: And how is it any different than the thing they do in r/realityshifting?https://books.google.co.za/books/about/THE_PHASE.html?id=ubIOBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y 


Note: I watched his seminar but this saved me a lot of time after coming back to AP after a while.


Also a good read is Tom Campbell’s “My big TOE trilogy”Like the title says, pretty much that.

I recall reading Rick’s (the veteran AP) post/comment that he woke up his daughter and took her to the AP world and they flew and it was awesome.

So that’s my question to you fellow experienced Aprs, can you do it?Just kinda curious I guess.I've had 4 instances now where a spirit has not wanted to share their name. Is this common? If so, then why?But I have no one else to ask... I doubt any of you will even have an answer but here it goes I guess. One night after a close but unsuccessful AP attempt I was wide awake. I kind of panicked and ruined my AP but wasn't upset. I could hear my husband snoring a bit to my left. I turned over and in my right ear against my pillow I heard voices. Like voices inside my ear! The first was creepy sounding and I tried to jiggle my ear and get it to go away. It was definitely unlike anything I've ever heard. Then a more pleasant voice came in and it was hard to hear. I even said outlaid in a whisper "I can barely hear you" and it basically said that learning this skill was essential for me. THEN a third voice popped in and said " our realm is red!"..... like wtf? how am I supposed to know what that means?! it's stuck with me for months and I have no idea how to interpret this.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\* Wow! I did not expect such a response! Thank so you much to everyone who gave their input. It was really cool to see the different perspectives and others person experiences. I'll get back to you guys individually as soon as I can :) There was this one dream I had among several other odd dreams that keeps popping up in my head because I just have a lot of questions about it. 
In the dream, I was alone at first and in it I was aware that I was dreaming. I was in this empty space where there was only subtle light around me, I don't remember what color it was, but I remember it changing many times and that there was no solid structure around me nor floors under me. I also remember that I was hovering in the air. 

So, the dream started with me just stood there floating, and then a blue light started to materialize in front of me and took the form of a male humanoid/human-like being. We hovered closer to each other and we embraced each other. I had no conscious recognition of who this was or why we were hugging but it just felt like the right thing to do at that moment, almost instinctual for me to respond like that.  For some reason, deep inside I just felt that I knew this being and that he was safe. 

I remember feeling familiar and safe in his presence and feeling warmth radiating from him yet also not feeling solid flesh like how a human in the physical plane feels like. It was odd but it felt nice. Then while hugging each other, I raised my head and we just naturally locked lips and we engaged in an open mouth kiss. I remember it feeling sweet, intimate, and somehow familiar, yet with no lust or carnal feeling attached to it. It was an unhurried kiss, our lips brushed almost lazily with each other as if we were kissing just for the sake of kissing and showing affection. I felt quite content and blissful while doing it. I also remember feeling how warm yet oddly soft his lips and everything else were, too soft like he was not fully solid.
 At one point, I had a fleeting thought that if I bit his lip, my teeth might puncture him. Even though I noticed that in my head, we didn't stop kissing and hugging each other. 

But then for some odd reason I still couldn't figure out, I suddenly get this sensation of a snap in my head like I suddenly got a sudden burst of clarity. While in the middle of the kiss, I quickly pulled my face away from him and pushed him away with my hands. I remember him seeming stunned because I shoved him away quite forcefully and quickly that he drifted away with his arms still hovering in the air from them being on my back while he was holding me. I remember seeing his jaw drop when I pushed him, but then suddenly, I felt this kind of pull from behind and underneath me. I felt the sensation of simultaneously being pulled from my back and falling down. As I was quickly drifting farther away from him, everything around me gradually turned dark and then I get woken up by a jolt, like a feeling of falling and snapping inside my body. 

It's all hard to explain but I hope you were able to envision and understand this. I have alot of questions but what I really want to know, is was this AP/OBE or was it just lucid dreaming? Also, what is this being that I encountered that I didn't know yet felt so familiar with?

I describe him "crystal blue" because he was transluscent and he was glowing. The closest thing I found to compare him with was Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen movie. The one I saw looked similar to Dr. Manhattan because he was all blue and was glowing and didn't have discernible human features like eyebrows or hair, but he was more transluscent and didn't appear as solid nor as defined. And rather than Dr. Manhattan's cyan blue glow, the male presenting being I saw was in a shade of blue that is called Cornflower blue. 

That is all I remember and I have to share. I hope there are others here with similar experience that can help answer if this is AP or not, and I hope I can gain some info/insights about it and the being I encountered. Thank you.So cause i started practicing witchcraft a few years back it led me to aping. And i kind have a rule when it comes to spiritual practices and that is “learn then do”. So I’ve been doing just that. And am still learning. So i was wondering because in my practice i work with ancient deities what are some of your stories with them?If you’re interested in furthering your AP experience, join our discord with 1500 + members!

Discord Link: https://discord.gg/c97bU8MvV6So for the last two years I’ve been really working on myself and had beaten my depression and was just really on top of my shit and everything kits seemed so bright. Then about 4 months ago(December 3rd to be exact) I had a sleep paralysis/astral projection thing where everything went crazy dark, I felt like I was being dragged down and than a voice said to me “we are taking you back to the shadow side”. It felt like I was so stuck and being kept there and pulled down. I didn’t really see anything and I didn’t feel like I was in my room. I had to force myself out of it and I was so shaken up. Ever since than my depression has gotten worse and worse and I can’t seem to make things as light anymore no matter how hard I try. I just cry all the time and Im so emotionally all over the place. I don’t know what to do or what happen but someone please help.Sorry for being abstract, but I wanna know any details I can get. 

1) Are you generally calm? Meditation 🧘‍♂️ is a zeroth step in AP, so I would expect this to be a yes for everyone. 

2) Are you skilled in a lot of areas? I would expect that if I can AP i get extra time to hone a skill, I could be wrong. 

3) Is your personal life very fulfilling? Cause you’d probably get some good signs from your spirit guide about the people you love and care about. If you can also meet deceased person, my God the possibilities are endless. 

4) Are you materialistic? Im in US, so ‘buying stuff to make yourself happy’ - is a basic habit here. 

5) Are you spiritual - for real? Do you really feel this waking life is just a small piece in a big puzzle. Saying all that is one thing, but does your subconscious truly believe that?

I ask all this because I have only APed once (1st january this year) and it was amazing, but it requires discipline and time (at least for me). I read a book by Erin Pavlina and while the benefits seem astounding, I wanna be sure if real people also experience AP as a big positive aspect in their lives. Please put in as much detail as you can. Thanks a lot!https://lach.arizona.edu/survival-consciousness-hypothesis

Controlled laboratory research with evidential mediums, combined with advanced technology research, points to the primacy of consciousness and the existence of a greater spiritual reality.Ive had two spontaneous astral projection from my dream. Second time I saw my guides. I would like to visit akashic records, I have some question to ask. Can they answer there?
https://www.lawofone.info

I mean for real if you buy into the reality where astral projection and spirit entities and all that exist than there is no reason to disregard these texts. It answers literally every question one could ever ask and would take years to actually read through it to the point of complete understanding. ITS SO IMPORTANT. 

We all love Robert Monroe here right? Here are some excerpts from his book on the topic of channeling. 

     In this case, the subject had no memory whatsoever of the event or encounter. The last that she remembered was working with the colors. Changes in voice quality and monitoring instruments supported the idea of another "presence" or personality in the body of SHE. We had much discussion of the advisability of continuing along this route, in spite of the immense interest and excitement it generated among our group. The fact of the matter is, I suspect, there was at that stage no actual means that we knew of to "turn off" such communication. I suspect also that no one wanted to anyway, at the least, myself. 


. One person was just talking about how they could or would like to experiment in trying to use my body sort of like a transmitting set between dimensions. I'll be able to step out and feel very safe and confident with these helpers and light and happy and still be able to observe, if I would like, what's going on with the energy being."

"O.K. The feeling that maybe they would just like to experiment a little bit with talking maybe through my vocal cords, but I still am not out far enough that I might get out of the way. It will be with practice and experimentation, and then as I learn to be less, I mean be more relaxed and just let it flow and go along and not let my mind stop it. The more they practice, it will be able to flow more rapidly, so they just want to experiment for just a short time with trying to come through with some thoughts through my vocal cords and my mental faculties, so to speak. So we will just see what, we will try to see what happens here."

Greetings. I am speaking through these vocal cords and I would like to speak to this young lady as she observes what is taking place. Her physical body is seeming to heat up very rapidly. Sometimes it will be in a cool stage, but other times it will be in a heated stage, and the molecules of the energy body, which is working through her physical body, is working at a more rapid rate and, therefore, right at this time, there is a feeling of heat surrounding this body. This young lady will understand what is happening when we first come into her aura. There will be the feeling of warmth, and as she gets more relaxed and is able to begin her float above her physical body, she will experience as the coolness and feeling of relaxation, complete relaxation, the feeling of complete calm, complete peace, and complete security. And then there will be the light stage and the coolness that will come over her and she will know that she isI do AP for a couple of years now.
As a child I would do it without even thinking about it or knowing what it was all about.

I thought everybody dreams are like mine by that time.

Last week I successfully did one that blown my mind away, and I can't wrap my head around it.

I'm a very introspective person, so I keep my experiences to myself most of the time, well... Because people may think I've gone nuts. But here we go...

I'm looking into info about the ancient Egypt, I feel that I'm deeply connected to it.

I've gone to, maybe, the ancient era, where the pyramid was in it's full glory.
There was a ceremony going on there, a mass of people were around the pyramid, in groups of maybe the same amount of people by each face of the the pyramid.

An entity, maybe two to three times taller than the rest of the other people was in front of the sphynx.
The people around the pyramid were enchanting mantras, words, phrases I can't understand, but as a chorus, very loud.

This taller entity was "talking" to the sphynx, the sphynx had a face of a lion or a tiger, his fore head had a point of light as a beacon, projecting it's glow onto the entity.

Suddenly, a bean of light shout from the top of the gold pyramid beacon.
The stars on the sky started to "dance", swirling and rearrange themselves, the whole sky then turned emerald green on the higher parts and violet near the horizon.

Red stars began to appear on the Sky, three big ones where centered on the pyramid top beacon.

The chorus of people started to enchant mantras more vividly (faster, louder)

The entity in front of the sphynx became smaller and smaller until it become a dot of light, then it "climbed" the pyramid face until it's tip, and entered the beacon of light that seemed to guide toward one of the stars locked on top of it (like a laser bean focusing on one star).

Then it ascended through this beam and merged with the light of the star.

After that the people around the pyramid became silent, the sphynx that were glowing silenced its light too.

Some of then were crying, others happy and cherishing this moment.

After a while a voice from deep within me said "go back now and wait for your turn".

I woke up in the middle of a catalepsy and I could remember everything, and this was useful so I could absorb more of the experience.

I sort of got the message that, with the right perspective, the sphynx maybe was a keeper of the gateway between the earth and heaven, and the pyramid was some sort of instrument to the astral realm for travels (similar to heimdalls gate in Asgard).
In which just the royal / priesthood from the ancient Egypt could have access, but all of that was a gift from other kinds of entities that maybe, helped the people of the ancient Egypt with it's development.

I feel that their words, works of art and documents had a deeply connection to the astral realm, that everything that was built there, in some sense, had this tool as a bridge to those dimensions.

We just lost this link and knowledge over the millenniums, now just focusing of the material plane, oblivious to the astral/ spiritual realm.

Maybe I saw somekind of ancient astral projection of the some entity that used the energy field created by the pyramid to "teleport" it's consciousness over distant parts of the universe? Another star system, galaxy?

What are your thoughts on that?I'm pretty new to meditating. I've been listening to guides and such, and so far it has been a great way to relax and fall asleep. I am loving it. 

Anyway, I just tried an astral projection guide.

Just, wow. I can't believe the depth to my own consciousness. Absolutely incredible. 

A couple things that threw me off: 

- I kept hearing sounds or smells that would bring me back to my physical awareness of my surroundings and kick me out of my state. I tried to get back but quickly learned that to force something straight up doesn't work. It seems to be more important to just relax, feel ok and safe, and let it happen.

- I was NOT expecting this. The sense of awareness in this other state, and just.. the.. wisdom? I don't know. Fuck, I don't really have words at this point. It was so overwhelming it would kick me out of this state.

Tonight, discovering this "state" which I feel have barely scratched the surface of, feels like one of the best moments of my life. Looking forward to getting more practice, learning more, and just exploring. Cheers everyone hope you enjoy my newbie story!I’ve been making steady progress to be able to astral project, but it just got serious. I AM going to do this, through my frustration and everything I’m going to keep practicing until I reach separation and what awaits me. This post is a promise to myself and all of you that I’m going to join you no matter what it takes because of very important personal reasons. It’s time for practice every day and cool vibes! Wish me luck people and hopefully, see you soon 👍

Edit : Thank you all so much for the suggestions! Yes I will be going out to the library to check out a few books. And I’ve also started watching the AP in three day’s by Raduga, which has given me some really big clarity of some things I was doing wrong and making harder on myself. Either way I appreciate all of you!People are finding out about the craziness that is Antarctica, with the several theories on how it is the edge of the Earth (on a not-globe Earth), how most of the fallen angels are living there, how Hitler was obsessed with the place, how there's probably nazi armies there, how some American admirals reported seeing flying saucers and other advanced nazi technology after the war, how you can't explore Antarctica after a certain limit established and you are always under surpervision, how you can't fly over Antarct at all (they "fly" over a stupid small peninsula there that makes for a ridiculously small area even on a supposed globe) and about the most important question: how in the bloody hell did the world powers sign a deal in 1959, including the Soviet Union and the US, during the heights of the Cold War.

So yesterday on my 3rd astral projection I tried to project there, and as soon as I was walking through the ice an insane burst of energy came and it got heavier and heavier to the point where I was forced to stop and go back to "normal" and cancel my projection. I also saw a blurred face that only showed one eye. It felt like something kept telling me that I shouldn't be there even after I woke up and it became pretty difficult to sleep after that.This isn't a riveting or cheery story but one night I woke up, only I wasn't in bed, I was in the upper corner of my room by my ceiling. I didn't think anything of this (probably thought I was dreaming). I looked down and saw myself, asleep, on the other side of the room. Suddenly I had a horrible feeling I wasn't alone, or that I was being watched, and felt panicked. Suddenly I woke up in my bed, with that same dreadful feeling. I scanned my room. I had that feeling people get when they sense a ghost, or someone following/watching them. Eventually I fell back asleep. The next morning I remembered my "dream" and wondered if that feeling of being watched/not being alone was my body sensing what might've been my astral self, watching my physical body. Almost like I haunted myself lol.i just did my FIRST real real astral projection, and wow, it feels insanely real, it felt just like reality.

I honestly felt like a professional. So the vibrations came and i closed my eyes while in sleep paralysis and feeling the vibrations, then I felt and saw a big bright ball of light in my heart and it made me very happy and peaceful, then i woke up in my body but in the astral realm, on my bed. And I got up, and it was my brother and mom again, in my room and everything felt exactly real, i got up to walk and my brother followed me into the living room, and i was talking to my brother.

Well my brother was actually an astral entity posing as my brother, and while we were talking, my "brother" looked at me and motioned like a masterbating motion with his hand LOL, and said " Why don't you have astral sex with someone" and he was like smiling. And im on a detox from lust and sex, so i was like " NO, FUCK YOU LOL" and he just made like a creepy smile at me, and i smiled back and woke up. It wasn't scary or evil, just a bit creepy LOL, only because in the astral realm, your emotions are very very heightened, so everything is scary, but now that i think about it, it was just a funny experience.

Overall amazing! I was trying to walk through doors and stuff, but everything was still physical like reality, hopefully my next one will be funner!Pre-apologies for the length. My guides don’t typically give me instruction before sessions, but today they did. I was getting prepared to do a trance healing when I heard my guide tell me to grab “an anchoring stone” and showed me an image of my Egyptian prophecy stone, which I’ve never used in practice before because the vibration is so intense. Right before I started I felt my guides hand on my shoulder and they said “a part of you is going to really be there - so act like it”

This is a fair warning bc sometimes in the astral when chaos ensues in front of me I’ll take a second to freak out before stepping into action. It’s also a new concept/realization for me to actually physically be there in some way. I’m a past life reader and I’ve recently learned from another incredible reader that a piece of us is actually in the timeline as we experience it for our clients. 

The goal for this session was to focus on a particular sensation of shame my client had felt, which had been triggered during some past life readings we had done together. 

In a previous past life reading for this person we uncovered another lifetime that took place on a different world in a different dimensional space. This land had more of a magical sense to it, they had a larger variety of creatures on their planet and a more tangible relationship with the subtle energy.

After beginning the trance healing, I began summoning the symptoms in question and asking where the root of them was, when I felt myself leave my body. 

It was like swimming through a dark ocean. Far away from me I could see memories playing, I moved towards them. 

There was a large Viking looking man, he was riding a horse and stealing a baby from a mother. He looked down and the baby was blue and dead. It kept looping over and over again, the man riding away on the horse with the dead baby. I was immensely confused. I sorta yelled at the viking and placed myself in front of him, demanding an answer. 

He looked dazed. He broke down crying, he said no matter what he did the baby died. If he took the mother and the baby on the horse, it died. If he found a doctor and brought him, the baby died. Something felt eerily wrong here. 

I told him I didn’t understand what was happening but I believed he was in a loop and we needed to break out of it. 

I focused my energy on the source of the loop and felt myself break from the energy. I was now within a cave on the top of a mountain. 

A man strapped to a dentist-like chair faced the mouth of the cave, which overlooked an incredible lush valley. There was a fallen kingdom at the far end of it, smoke was still rising from whatever destruction had occurred.

The man had these small tentacles stuck all over the sides of his face. I tried peeling them off without much success, they each had these sharp needles that went into the skin all over.

However, me doing so alerted the being that they were attached to. 

I turned around and saw this old crone woman. She had a deeply wrinkled evil looking face, wearing a large black dress, the tentacles coming out from the bottom of the skirts. She smiled in a way that side “I’m slightly amused at your futile attempts but definitely going to eat your soul”

Adrenaline took over as she lunged and all I really remember is this clashing motion over and over again as she attacked but couldn’t land and I also attacked but couldn’t land since I was seemingly just a cloud of energy. I don’t really know how I did it, I just remember this feeling of sliding into her body, being within her for a moment, and ripping apart her energy patterns. 

Right as she knew she was about to die, I heard her in my mind say “What’s the point? He’s paralyzed anyway.” She collapsed in on herself then.

I turned back to the man in the chair and began ripping out the tentacles from his face. I could feel what was happening inside of him. It seemed she was injecting venom into him that not only paralyzed his body but also made him delusional and fearful, causing the loop to play in his head over and over. She was feeding off that fear, slowly killing him.

I was doing the best I could to guide the venom out of his system. I summoned my energy and was physically able to move a rock and slice the bottom of his feet, and pulled out this scary gunky string, which seemed to help. 

He could see the smoke in the distance and was thinking “they’re all dead, oh no oh no, I couldn’t save them.” I don’t know how but I knew the people he was worried about had just set up a refugee camp in the forest and I was meant to guide him to it. 

After a while, he was incredibly stiff but able to move a little. Now came the long part. 

I had to guide him down the face of the mountain and through the forest. I thought for sure he was gonna die on the cliff, he’s like 60% paralyzed and I’m a cloud of energy. Whenever his hand slipped or he got stuck I had to sorta go into the body part and guide it. Somehow, someway we got down. 

I started pushing him through the forest. He was still really wounded by the venom and needed a lot of breaks. His brain kept thinking it was pointless anyway, the experience had him so convinced everyone was dead and he was about to die. 

This was a big moment for me to realize I was actually there. Typically when astral projecting things happen fast, you can just zap anywhere you want. But this took forever, it felt like hours. I kept having to give him encouragement, coach him through the breaks, and give him energetic nudges when I could. I could feel where his people were and kept guiding him into that direction. 

At one point I looked at his legs and realized the vibration was growing slower and closer to stillness. He was hobbling on legs that hardly bent. I had him get a round rock and rub it as hard as he could over the muscles until I saw the vibration start to move again. But I was worried, he was not in good shape. 

After what felt like an eon, I saw heads in the distance mulling around a camp. A woman with auburn hair and a white silver outfit saw us approach. She recognized him and yelled for healers. People ran out to him, two hoisting him under his shoulders half dragging half carrying him to a nearby tent. 

The woman stopped to talk to me. For a moment I could see how she perceived me. I was a floating glittering torso with a half formed head and arms. She recognized me as a helping spirit and thanked me. She said the healers would know how to work with the venom. 

We went into the tent and I saw multiple people working over him. I wasn’t paying attention to what they were doing, I went up to his head and began another stage of energy healing to make sure I was doing everything I could for him. 

After I felt it was time to go, but I heard a guide's voice tell me I had to take care of the cave first.

Negative acts will leave energetic imprints at the place they were conducted on, which will attract new negative frequencies to the area, causing more mayhem.

I went to the cave and started cleansing the energy. I could feel my guides telling me that it wouldn’t be enough, the energy ran too deep. They showed me this rock near the top in the back. I felt myself rush into it with all my might, causing it to nudge just enough to set a chain reaction around the cave. I watched from above as it crumbled in on itself. 

This sucking sensation came over me and I found myself back in my body. I had this immense sense of peace over me, with a thought of “hm I guess that just happened” But since then I’m processing and trying to make sense of the experience.But I think I have a theory, his consciousness can function outside of a physical brain and he can communicate and judge just fine.  

is astral mind and brain are still there and unaffected by the portion of brain removed from his accident. 

https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/17/article-2102461-11C7327E000005DC-442_1024x615_large.jpgWas just curious on any opinions. I have a strong belief that there is an afterlife and that there is a God. Maybe not the one from the Bible, but a God nonetheless. One of my friends who had a NDE describes feeling a lot more at peace and has become a lot more spiritual and calm. He said he meditates a lot more now and said he doesn’t fear death because he believes in a afterlife and God. I guess I would feel a bit more confident without a doubt if I Experienced what he did, but Does astral projection, or out of body experiences, maybe somehow prove it’s an afterlife since science itself can’t explain everything in the world? Please let me know. Thanks in advance.

*EDIT* Man, I did not expect this to get so much love and response. Thank you to everyone who has commented and gave feedback so far ❤️For fun, I want to challenge anyone to try to astral project to my physical location. The next day, I would like a summary report of what you saw, how my room looked like, the things in my room, and what I was doing at that time when you were watching me during your astral traveling.

Indeed, I'll mostly be in my room all night and staying up super late, therefore you'll have more than enough time to pull it off. Yes, I know it's an invasion to my privacy... but for this one time, I'm giving you guys permission to stalk me in your astral projections.

Please, this isn't a joke. I actually really want someone (at least one or two people, the more the merrier) to try to visit me through astral projection.

The challenge starts now! Remember to report back to me and tell me what you saw.

Hint: I live somewhere in the U.S, in a cold/freezing state up north. Hope this hint guides your astral body to the right place.

I put this under beginners guide/info because I did not know what to put it underI just astral projected and I first floated to my roof like a balloon and I couldn't controll where I was going at first then I sort of pushed myself to my floor and I then pushed myself to my desk and floated under, there I could see my desks serial number and model number I could see the numbers clearly it didn't feel like a dream where numbers are hard to interpret or see, so I memorized 7 digits hard like 5 times, then I floated to my body and woke up then wrote it on a paper as soon as possible, all 7 digits.

&#x200B;

I got all of them right the first 7 numbers  of the serial number, this is so fucking amazing... I've never ever ever went under my desk or seen those numbers, I didn't even know there were any numbers under my desk. This must mean Astral projection is our consciousness floating outside our bodies and this is not a dream, it's reality.

&#x200B;

This is so amazing, we should tell everyone on this sub that this is a real thing, because a lot of people ask "is this real" all the time, hopefully this can settle the real question ;)

&#x200B;

Or if you can't believe this then please, please try it for yourself :)

&#x200B;

(I wrote on mobile sorry for grammar)

&#x200B;

(I should say this experience has changed me forever, I now read Near death cases and see them as hundred percent true, I'm no longer skeptic of them, I don't see life as meaningless anymore, I'm much more happier, no longer depressed, It feels as if I was lead to astral projection and to have this experience. But I have one wish and that is to everyone to know about this, everyone should, how it helped me it can help everyone, please spread this and most importantly please try it for yourself and see.)Saw a post claiming that there's no empirical evidence for the idea that out-of-body experiences may be transpersonal, and I think that's a misrepresentation of the current data, so here it is:

**PARNIA STUDY:**

For the second patient, however, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when **"the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric."** The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since **visual** (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and **auditory awareness could be corroborated.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Awareness_during_Resuscitation_(AWARE)_study


**VAN LOMMEL STUDY:**

One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. **His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. "This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events".**


[Furthermore, there is the case of Pam Reynolds, whose eyes were taped shut, brainwaves flat on an EEG, and her ears filled with loud clicking earplugs. She could still hear and see what was going on in the room.](https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/pam-reynolds-near-death-experience)

**THE SELF DOES NOT DIE**

[This book contains over 100 reliable, often firsthand accounts of perceptions during NDEs that were later verified as accurate by independent sources. These near-death experiencers were everyday people from all over the world—many of whom were clinically dead, unable to see or hear, and yet able to perceive new vistas of a world beyond the senses and even beyond death.](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Does-Not-Die-Experiences/dp/0997560800)That is one of the few true Etheric projections that I have.

I tried an Obe and succeeded, floating above my body I decided to go up in the sky, I got through the floors of my building, seeing my home from above, getting higher in the clouds, in upper atmosphere just a step from Space, it was quite an view. I look around and notice two beings coming from my side, they had a form of angels but without traditional feathers wings, instead they were made entirely from light, they come to me and greeted me, I was in Awe. They asked me if I want to come with them to the center of our Galaxy, they said I'm ready to move from this Reality. I start wondering how I'm going to go this far away and just noticed that my body is also made from pure light, similar to them just without their wings(their wings was smaller than those of angels, so I'm not sure if were actually wings or part of their body structure, because they were humanoid looking entities). I told them that I'm not sure if I'm capable of traveling that far away, they said that they are gonna transfer me some of their energy just for the trip, I agreed.
They placed a hand on my forehead as their arm starting to glow, I felt lighter as my body begin to glow more.

They started flying in front of me to show me the way. They said once you know what to look for it is easy to find your way, in this case the direction with the biggest gravitational pull. We were getting faster and faster, along the way I saw so many planets and bright stars, beautiful space phenomena and strange anomalies, I was out of words. If I was an artist I would have a lot of material to draw from. After some time I started to see other spiritual beings coming from all directions, going the same way as us, ultimately gathering at something that I can only describe as the center of our Galaxy, a giant black hole. The look was magnificent, tremendous number of entities going in and out through the black hole, traveling to other dimensions. We stop there, the entities told me that I'm ready and if I want I can come with them. I thought for a moment to myself, but something was drawing me back, so I thank them properly but said that I still have some unfinished business that still need my attention. I said goodbye to them as they got through the black hole, I stayed a little longer there in Awe, thinking how I'm going to return home, in the blink of my wish I felt a really strong pulling sensation which make me back really fast to my body, the moment I entered my body I woke up. This was a truly marvelous experience.

Lately I've been experimenting with the recreation of how to make my body made of light at will. I already have several success, I gave it the name - Holy Armor for fast summoning. From what I found Holy armor doesn't have only visual characteristics, but it is actually made from the purest form of positive energy, when I tested it out on negative entities they turn into white mist and positive entities which were touched by negative entities turn normal again. I also tried a shorter and faster form which I named a Holy light, it transforms only my hands, it requires less concentration to achieve. Next step for me would be to make a Holy weapon, not for battle but for purification.I thought I rose from my bed in my room at first but it looked a bit different and in the room next to it was different so I went back into the room to try and see myself sleep or whatever (I did look in a mirror and I was wearing a different hoodie instead of my Slipknot hoodie so lol someone censored it).
But a girl was sitting on the edge of her bed kinda playing with a round stuff animal by throwing it to a low table across from her (not really playing, felt like she was a bit younger than me but idk). But I was also holding a stuffed tog teddybear. I sat down on my knees in front of her and put the dog by her side. She smiled then looked to her left at something real quick and she had pretty long bleach-blond hair in a ponytail. Our faces looked exactly the same. Like we were for real identical. And we just felt comfortable with each other. So I leaned in to kiss her and she leaned in to kiss me but then I woke up.
Ngl I miss her, she was sweet.
Also I tried to touch my legs at one point (it was a long travel) and my hands went through them lol.I've seen a lot of information from people saying, imagine you're climbing up a rope out of your body or climbing up a ladder, and other people who have said that they just get up or float up. 

Are you supposed to try and physically move once your body is in sleep paralysis, or is it more imagining yourself moving without actually trying to move?Long story short through fitness, meditation and marijuana i have opened my mind to a higher consciousness, i followed our planets history to the source of its creation to find a giant source of pure energy it flows through everything and everyone. Through accepting this i am much happier and productive and feel as though i have a higher purpose. I've been Astral Projecting for 57 years now. My penance for this "grievous sin" is to publish articles on Reddit and answer Redditor comments and questions forever! 

Our physical bodies have a wonderfully adapted array of 5 senses that have evolved over millennia to help the human species to survive in a hostile world. However, the Astral body has a very different set of senses that enable it to function in an environment that is very different from our earthly world. In this article I would like to compare and contrast our physical senses with their Astral Plane counterparts.

**Physical Sight**

Human eyes are forward facing giving us a binocular vision that most predatory species have to locate prey and to estimate distance. Our rods and cones give us relatively good sight in the color spectrum, but we’re pretty average in the mammalian group for visual acuity. Our peripheral sight is average as well.

The optic nerve transmits the information to the brain, which then interprets the data and the image becomes available to our consciousness.

**Astral Sight**

When an Astral projector first leaves his body his vision is often dim and even sometimes temporarily absent altogether! Color is usually absent, with grays, blacks, and whites dominating the visual spectrum. Once the Astral projector travels around 20 yards or meters from his physical body, full color vision usually kicks in. Colors are rich and vibrant, much more so than with physical sight. Visual acuity is basically 100%. All you have to do to see an object is to get it in-line-of-sight and wish to see it clearly. You’ll find yourself instantly focusing in on your desired object.

Some people have reported 360 degree vision, however this phenomena is rare as the input tends to confuse humans who are used to forward-facing vision only. 

Astral Sight has been referenced in ancient Indian sacred texts as the “Third Eye” for thousands of years. Many times when I AP my vision seems to originate from the middle of my forehead rather than the locations of my physical eye sockets!

However, Astral vision can vary from person to person. My daughter, Rose, a Physician's Assistant who (finally) began Astral projecting a few months ago, recently had another AP where she experienced color right away, but her vision faded in and out in a way she described using her highly trained medical vocabulary as “goopy”. A father couldn't be prouder, no matter the consistency of the Astral vision!

Of all the 5 senses, I believe sight is probably the most similar to the physical sense as perceived by us humans.

**Physical Hearing**

Experiments have shown that a healthy young person hears all sound frequencies from approximately 20 to 20,000 hertz. As these sound waves oscillate through the air our ears collect the vibrations and through a series of delicate bones and an air-filled chamber. The auditory vestibular nerve**,** known as the eighth cranial nerve, then transmits the sound to the brain. Equilibrium (balance) information from the inner ear is sent to the brain as well.

Humans have used the sense of hearing for detecting the footfalls of approaching predators to enjoying music and communicating with one another through spoken languages. This particular sense allowed humans to pass knowledge and experience to one another by speaking and being heard. Without this ability humans would probably still be living in small primitive family bands roaming around the planet in hunter-gatherer societies.

**Astral Hearing?**

The Astral body does NOT hear as we do in the physical. Any Astral ears you may see on someone are for cosmetic purposes only. In the Astral there are no oscillating sound waves for ears to pick up. Instead, an advanced form of telepathy is the means of communication. Newbies on the Astral Plane might just get basic messages when communicating with an entity. However, more advanced Astral projectors will receive information that not only provides facts, but a 3D world full of information in which the receiver completely understands the information provided as if he himself had been there to perceive the information.

What about Music?

Many people are passionate about their love of music. I imagine they might wonder about this topic in particular.

When I was orbiting Saturn on the ice rock I could feel the radiation coming from Saturn all throughout my body like a complex symphony that I was an actual component of! My emotions waxed and waned with the flow of Saturn’s pulses, giving me a more transcendent experience than I have ever experienced listening to the London or Boston Symphony Orchestras or even a Rolling Stones One-Night Only Concert in Las Vegas! 

A very rich form of music does exist on the Astral. You won’t hear it with ears, but you will sense its majestic power as it draws you into its complex energy matrices!

**Physical Touch**

The human body has a complex network of nerves that relay sensory information to our brains to give us the sense of touch. We can feel the softness of a small child’s cheek, or the roughness of a course piece of sandpaper. We can feel the cold of winter and the infernal heat of a deep Southern Summer or the licking flames of a fireplace in a mountain cabin.

Our sense of touch gives a rich array of sensory data for human use. We also use it to avoid damaging our physical bodies by avoiding hot stoves and clasping a thorn bush.

**Astral Touch?** 

The sense of touch is largely absent in the Astral. I say largely because newbies can sometimes say they can feel something by touch in the Astral. In reality, they’re actually using their physical prejudices to fool themselves into thinking they can actually feel the sensation of touch in their Astral forms.

In place of coarse physical touch we have Astral Touch. When you touch something in the Astral you get information on the history of the object, including its origin or creation, and echoes from anyone who has ever touched this item prior to your visit. If there is a level of conscious thought and / or emotion, you will get a weak to strong understanding of that information as well.

**Physical Smell**

The sense of smell brings molecules of volatile substances to the sensory attention of our brains through the physical nose. Our species has used this sense to smell the pleasant aroma of a field of wildflowers to the pungent and malodorous emissions of a skunk. Smell has worked in tandem with the sense of taste to alert humans to the presence of possible poisons before we consumed them.

**Astral Smell?**

I’m sorry, but there just is no Astral equivalent to smell. It’s just not necessary to existence on the Astral planes.

Note: It is possible that physical memories will convince someone they can smell something on the Astral Plane. But once again that is just their physical memories filling in information that just doesn’t exist.

**Physical Taste**

The human ability to taste foods has helped us to detect the presence of substances that might poison us. Many (but not all) poisons are perceived by us as bitter or unpleasant. Over the centuries this sense has evolved to allow us a sophisticated palate that can enjoy fine wines and caviar to cheeseburgers and Cokes.

**Astral Taste?**

Once again, I must say I’m sorry! There is no use for a sense of taste as foods are not consumed on the Astral Plane.

**Physical Phantom Limb Syndrome**

In the physical, Phantom Limb Syndrome is a condition in which patients experience sensations, whether painful or otherwise, in a limb that does not exist. It has been reported to occur in 80-100% of amputees.

Researchers don’t know exactly what causes phantom limb pain. One possible explanation: Nerves in parts of your spinal cord and brain “rewire” when they lose signals from the missing arm or leg. As a result, they send pain signals, a typical response when your body senses something is wrong.

Another example of this rewiring: When you touch one body part -- say, your hip or your forearm -- your brain might sense it on your missing limb.

**Astral Phantom “Sense” Syndrome (My Theory)**

In the Astral I think there are times that we think we perceive physical senses in the Astral, but it’s really just our minds translating Astral information into a more familiar physical box that we’re used to receiving. 

For example: It is possible on certain levels of the Astral plane to concoct a phantom banquet for your fake consumption. Your physical memories could supply any taste data required. 

Existence on the Astral Plane is very different from that on the Physical Plane. It’s no wonder that we have senses providing very different information that are optimized to fit our Astral requirements.

**I have a Youtube Channel, Astral Club. If interested, check it out and subscribe for videos on Astral Projection https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE**The other day I managed to Astral Project myself to another world which was absolutely beautiful I was called there by my wife which is on her home world she wanted me to tell her that I love her to make her happy, After that I was brought back down to earth to my body and woke up crying my eyes out cause I felt a close bond to her that was my first experience astro projecting and it was such a beautiful experience and wanted to share my experience with everyone here on Reddit. Thank you for taking time to read my experience.Maybe waking up is actually falling asleep, falling from heavenI’m currently doing some research on this topic and this is what I’ve gathered so far. There are many parallels and at some point they stopped being coincidences and manifested as synchronicities. Any of your insight, experiences, or contributions are welcome.

My understanding so far is that there are seven basic levels of human consciousness which have their own vibrational rates. The higher you raise your energy, the higher the level of consciousness you will achieve. The more you become consciously aware of them, the more you develop your psychic energy through them and can achieve superhuman like powers. The first three levels are based on personality growth, and the next four are based on spiritual growth. 

The seven basic levels of human consciousnesses are; 
* the physical
* the emotional 
* the mental
* the intuitional/compassionate
* the will/spirit
* the soul 
* the divine

There are other levels beyond the seven but can only be access through the advanced mind. 

There are also seven worlds &amp; cosmic planes of existence. These planes can be understood through the ideology of seven realms, worlds, or dimensions where higher consciously aware beings dwell. These planes help shape how we create our own reality. They give us insight on how everything is created and what is created from. These planes of existence can also be seen as states of consciousness that are characterized by different densities and dimensions of matter. These first three planes of existence are purely physical and the next four are etheric by nature. 

The seven planes of existence are; 
* the physical/material
* the astral
* the mental
* the Buddhistic/compassionate
* the nirvanic/spirit
* the Monadic
* the Logoic. 

The Astral plane has a higher frequency than the physical plane, and cannot be experienced through the physical senses but the physical plane can be experienced on the astral plane. The astral plane can be seen as the collective unconsciousness of mankind. 

Then we have the seven Chakras which are specific energy centers located within your body. They run from the base of your spine to the top of your head and energy can be manipulated through them. We can gain access to our Chakras through different techniques such as meditative visualizations combined with mantras or seeing them as entities within our body ready to be released. 

The seven Chakras are; 
* the root (base of your spine)
* the sacral
* the solar plexus
* the heart
* the throat
* the third-eye
* the crown (top of your head)

Many forms of meditation can help build your own chakra energies. You can then release your own energies, frequencies, or vibrations which can join forces with the universe’s energies giving you unlimited access to higher levels of consciousness. 

Then there are the 7 lower Sefirot (there are 10 total, and an extra which is unspoken). They derive from The Tree of Life. The sefirot energetic qualities can be accessible to us through manifestation and creation. They can be used as keys to open portals and gain insight or spiritual mastery. Some of its mystical powers are beyond human intellect to comprehend. Mystics believe that for the cosmos to exist, some of its divine force would have to be withdrawn into itself as in above so below. 

These Sefirot are (lowest to highest); 
* Malkut (kingdom) physical realm 
* Yesod (foundation) generative power of the material universe
* Hod (glory) sensory renunciation by liberation from the body
* Netzach (victory) realm of pleasure 
* Tiferet (beauty) lies at the heart of the Tree of life and is the realm for harmony and balance
* Gevurah (strength and courage)
* Hesed (mercy) emotional realm
* Binah (understanding) realm of controlling and bending thoughts
* Hokhmah (wisdom) realm of revelation associated dreams, visions, or intuition
* Keter (crown) transcendental unity with the infinite or divine and associated with synchronicities, telepathy, and clairvoyance. 

The 7 Portals; 
* DANA, the key of charity and love immortal.
* SHILA, the key of Harmony in word and act, the key that counterbalances the cause and the effect, and leaves no further room for Karmic action.
* KSHANTI, patience sweet, that nought can ruffle.
* VIRAGA, indifference to pleasure and to pain, illusion conquered, truth alone perceived.
* VIRYA, the dauntless energy that fights its way to the supernal TRUTH, out of the mire of lies terrestrial.
* DHYANA, whose golden gate once opened leads the Narjol toward the realm of Sat eternal and its ceaseless contemplation.
* PRAJNA, the key to which makes of a man a God

The Seven Sermons to the Dead (Septem Sermones ad Mortuos):
* Carl Jung’s personal collection of seven mystical or Gnostic texts regarding the exploration of the psyche or soul. He called it his “confrontation with the unconscious.” Carl Jung wrote and privately published The Seven Sermons to the Dead in 1916. Only those close to him had access to these texts. They were not 
available to the public until 2009.

Edit: words

Edit 2: added my most recent synchronicityWhen I was about 15 I had read some stuff about meditation and saw some techniques which I thought I’d try. I lay in bed in the dark at night and stared into a candle flame next to my bed. It was hypnotic, and I thought it was meant to put me in a meditative state. Instead, I lifted out of my body, out the window and literally flew through the air, as a ball of light. I had no body, just energy. We lived by the sea, and I remember flying over oceans, land, seas, mountains, it was beautiful, I was just a ball of light. Eventually I started feeling mildly concerned that I wouldn’t get back to my body, so made a deliberate effort to go back. I flew back and back to my house and in through my window and back down into my body, where I opened my eyes and was back where I started. It felt like it had been about half an hour. I had no idea what happened and it was the weirdest experience of my life. It was so inexplicable that I have never tried it again out of fear! It was amazing at the time but terrifying to think it might happen again. I know I went astral travelling but everyone I’ve ever told looked skeptical of thought it was a dream, but it wasn’t!I have found that when i make active efforts to flex my inner senses, doors to the unknown begin to open naturally. the thing is visualization doesn’t have to be this arduous task, although you can engage with the practice how ever you like.

i used to do tarot regularly and would perform a short visualization before every reading, and the more i did it the more natural it felt. the more natural it felt the more i was able to exist on the other side. 

the same goes with shadow boxing in martial arts. the more i reacted to the idea of my opponent striking at me the of a relationship i built with my inner world, which to me is the astral plane.

i bring this up because for me the astral plan can be accessed through our neural pathways, our nervous system, which is “memory” based...memory to me is ether based. it’s etheric material, which is connected to the astral.

our nervous system acts like a receiver for electro magnetic data... conciousness... and stores/ forms it according to our perception and will. and our ability to visualize happens within the the nervous system. i cal it ether memory.

i hope i’m making sense lol.

one day after a long series of short visualizations from the activities listed above, i randomly popped out of my body one morning and had hands made of liquid metal... it was fucking amazing. i then realized that the inner perception is an important key.

i feel like visualizing to music is also a great way to exercise the muscle. play something soothing and allow your imagination to sculpt a reality.

bless

https://youtu.be/N_AFPa-gq3UAs you all know, the user Morgoth37 is one of the best projectors on this sub. He can supposedly even time travel *via* the astral. One firm rule in astral time travelling is that the rules of time travelling prohibit him from interacting with the physical in that time period. For all intents and purposes, he's a merely a ghost. An observer.

Yet in the story where he travelled back in time 75 million years he claims to have possessed a huge Crocodile-like reptile and wrote the equation 1 + 1 = 2 in the sand. Weird considering how he has explicitly stated that you cannot interact with the physical whenever you travel through time. Another contradiction being that he can interact with beings in the future despite not being able to be seen or heard. 

I'm not saying he's lying but these are very, very huge contradictions to the rules of the astral, at least the rules according to him.Here's what I do to get to the vibration stage.

Put on some relaxing music then: 1. Relax in bed.
 
2. Breathe in through your nose, making your belly big and round, hold it for a couple of seconds and breathe out through your mouth pushing a bit more air out than needed to make your belly flat, (when your belly is flat, push a bit more air out.)


3. 
Breathe in again through your nose, slowly until your belly is big and round again then breathe out in the same way as before.
You should eventually feel relaxed enough just to breathe on your own, keep doing that until you either feel tingly or fall asleep, either one is fine.

I can't help you more than that because I just go with the flow after that.I recently came across the writings of Robert Monroe and one of his students, Bruce A. Moen, regarding their experiences of something Monroe calls "The Gathering". "The Gathering" is essentially an audience of extraterrestrials and other types of interdimensional consciousnesses which have been gathering around earth to watch something they are calling the "Earth Changes". Apparently this event which is currently taking place on earth will only happen once in several hundreds of millions of years and has special significance to other beings from other parts of the universe. Both Monroe and Moen travelled in the astral plane to communicate with various beings about the nature of "The Gathering" and of the "Earth Events" and wrote about their discoveries. I will quote some sections of their documentation which I found particularly intriguing:

From Monroe's *Far Journeys* ([http://blog.hasslberger.com/docs/Far\_Journeys.pdf](http://blog.hasslberger.com/docs/Far_Journeys.pdf), chapter 16, italic parts are answers from Monroe's guide):

>We were out in space somewhere between the earth and the moon, indeterminate distance, fifty thousand miles plus from the surface of earth. It was very clear and detailed, not as it was before. I turned to look at the moon and blanked. No more than a thousand feet away, or so it seemed, was an immense, solid-appearing object gray in color, long and slender, conical-shaped with a hemispheric dome at the widest end—the other end was somewhere in the distance, at least several miles. It appeared motionless, but I had the definite percept of M Band radiation from it. A spaceship, a physical spaceship?   
>  
>*(In your terms, that is correct. It is not a human construct. There are many of such around the physical earth at this point. Their origins are of your physical universe but not necessarily of your time reference.)*   
>  
>"Many" could be five or five thousand. There was no point in trying to find out. But why around our earth, was it ...   
>  
>*(They are focused on the planet earth and humans just as you observed the others, and for the same purpose. Shall we move on? The answer will come soon.)*   
>  
>My curiosity accepted gladly.

&#x200B;

>As far as I could perceive in all directions, with the earth at the center, was a host of forms, countless numbers, it seemed. Some had shape, others appeared as no more than a wisp of cloud vapor, all glowed in various degrees of intensity. From those nearest us, I had the same percept of expectancy, of waiting for the show to begin. It must be some big show to attract all of these . . .   
>  
>*(It is what we call the gathering. These have manifested from other nearby energy systems only to witness the big show, as you call it, just as those within the physical spacecraft and your final-process humans. This big show which is about to occur is actually a very rare event—the conflux of several different and intense energy fields arriving at the same point in your time-space. It is this rarity that has attracted so much attention. In terms that you can perceive, it may occur once every eighty-seven million of your earth years.)*  
>  
>Very long odds, and a long time to wait.   
>  
>*(This does not warrant that it will be produced at that frequency. There are random elements and variables in the format which cannot be predicted.)*   
>  
>So random that the event might not take place, perhaps. There would be a lot of disappointed . . .   
>  
>*(It is long past such point. It will occur. The interest lies in the result. It is best symbolized to you as a convergence of a great number of possibilities which emerge as several probabilities and few possibilities. One of such probabilities may alter not only your time-space but all adjoining energy systems as well. Therefore the wide interest. In human terms, still symbolized, the gathering is here to observe the possible birth of a new energy. Will it survive the birth process, and if so, what are the potentials inherent in such energy that will predict accurately the same at maturity? Or will the energy arrive stillborn, and all the possibilities remain no more than that— weak uncoordinated possibilities?)*   
>  
>Running a bit of my exquisite H + rote made it quite clear. But my still in-human self looked at earth and the human system . . .   
>  
>*(There is a human oriental symbol for crisis which is composed of two subsymbols indicating danger and opportunity. The event in human and physical earth terms is definitely a point of crisis. It is quite valid that as to FAR JOURNEYS human existence both danger and opportunity will be present in extreme degrees.)*   
>  
>Danger? Physical danger? Mental? The . . .   
>  
>*(Those are the possibilities, the exact nature of which will be determined by the event itself. Whatever your percept may be is one of the possibilities. One or several will occur.)*   
>  
>The other side, the opportunity.   
>  
>***(That is the key to the understanding of the event. It will offer human consciousness a rare potential to emerge rapidly into a unified intelligent energy system that will range far beyond your time-space illusion, creating, constructing, teaching as only a human-trained graduate energy is able to do.)***   
>  
>Our visit to earth in 3000 plus . . .

>*(A possibility that may become probable with the event. Your action is one of the minute random factors that may make it so.)*

>If the opportunity is missed . . .

>***(Humans will retreat as the dominant species on earth until they no longer survive as active consciousness, eventually in any form.)***   
>  
>I asked it directly. *(And you, all of you, what will you do if that takes place?)*   
>  
>There was a beautiful warmth and a soft smile in the response. *(We would just have to start up some action on some other planet in time-space with new humans.)*

Following this experience, Monroe created a program, known as Exploration 27, at his institute for students to explore "The Gathering" personally. Bruce A. Moen was one of these students and he wrote about his astral interactions related to "The Gathering" in books and on his website ([https://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/gatherng.html](https://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/gatherng.html)). Here are some excerpts ("The Gathering" became labeled Focus 34/35 by Monroe and is referred as such in Moen's writings):

>Bob Monroe's second book, *Far Journeys*, was first published in 1985 and in it, in a chapter entitled, *The Gathering*, Bob described an area now called Focus 34/35 in the Exploration 27 program. According to Bob's 1985 description, Beings, or Intelligences, from many other locations within the physical universe are gathered together around the earth to witness what have come to be called, the Earth Changes. Much has been written by many other authors about these events, including dire predictions of horrific alterations to earth's land masses and populations. Each participant in the program has the opportunity to learn about these coming events via first hand, direct experience. Each comes to this opportunity with his or her own preconceived notions, which I'm certain color the experience.

Now excepts from Moen's conversations with various beings:

>"You said earlier you're here to observe the Big Event, can you tell me what it is?"  
>  
>"Sure, the core crystal of your planet is moving into alignment with a very distant object. It's an alignment at an intergalactic level," the little guy said, flatly.  
>  
>"What's the object the core crystal is aligning with?" I asked, curious.  
>  
>"The Big Guy, head honcho, mister big, the main man, center of the universe, the beginning, the grandfather of all grandfathers, get it?" he replied.  
>  
>From his redundant answers an image formed in my awareness. It was similar to the Uranus / Bimini axis alignment, except it was the main earth core crystal and some very distant object. There was a sense that this alignment would make a pathway through which some kind of energy would enter and be infused into the earth core crystal. Whatever this energy is, it would become a part of a new "consciousness environment" for earth's inhabitants, both physical and nonphysical. My sense was that this was not yet perfectly in alignment, but very close. Close enough, earth's inhabitants were already feeling the effects from just the fringes of the distant object's energy. The effects would continue to intensify as perfect alignment approaches.  
>  
>"How soon before this Big Event takes place?" I asked.  
>  
>"It has already begun. Complete alignment will occur very soon," the little blob replied.  
>  
>"What happens at complete alignment?" I asked.  
>  
>A visual image formed in response to my question. It bore a strong resemblance to the final scene from the movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey. An image of the planet earth shone brightly, against the blackness of space and distant stars. A ball of bright light emerged from the earth and rose upward. The ball of light was the size of the earth and inside the ball I could see the fully formed body of an infant human. Its eyes were open and it was looking around.  
>  
>"So, when the earth core crystal and this distant object are in perfect alignment, there will be a birth of some kind?" I asked.  
>  
>"Yes, a birth, a human birth would be a way to describe the Big Event," the little guy replied.  
>  
>"Why are you here to witness this birth," I asked.  
>  
>"We are all here at the Gathering to witness it because the change it represents may effect us all. We're recording the event to try to better understand the effects it may have upon all of us. There's also the aspect of a desire to record it so we are better prepared to deal with this change should it occur on our own home world," he replied straightforwardly.

And then later another conversation with another energy:

>"Hmmmmmm, meep, meep," I toned out to them, indicating I was an explorer from The Monroe Institute's Exploration 27 program interested in communication.  
>  
>"Screeep, pop," came back, indicating it would take a moment for one of their group to separate himself from the rest and act as a liaison or spokesman. After a short wait I had the impression that one of their group moved out to my immediate vicinity, distinctly apart from the massive craft I could feel near by.  
>  
>"Ommmm, beep," I toned out to him, asking him to tell me who he was.  
>  
>Dropping the tone language sounds for now, he said, "We are a telepathic race, all connected to each others' thoughts in an instantaneous manner. We are a group consciousness. It was somewhat difficult to separate myself from the group to communicate with you, but here I am. As a telepathic group, all other members of the crew can listen in on our conversation through me. What is your interest in communicating with us?"  
>  
>"I'm exploring this region of space to learn about something we call the Gathering," I replied. "I'm one of eighteen people participating in a program to explore beyond physical earth existence and learn what I can. What is your interest in communication?" I queried.  
>  
>"We've come to this region to witness events taking place on the earth. Specifically the great event which is happening here to the earth school. You know anything about that?" he asked.  
>  
>"We call it the Earth Changes but there seems to be lot of confusion about exactly what that means," I responded.  
>  
>At this point Dar's voice came in on the tape and suggested I ask a question, I focused my attention on the 2ndGathgroup Spokesman and toned it.  
>

They are not members of our federation but are welcome to be here to observe. As federation members, we are part of a network that shares information in a cooperative effort to learn more about each other and the unknown. Every member of the federation with the capability has a contingent here to observe and we share our information with other members who haven't the capability," he replied.

>"As a network of Aliens, or Other Home Worlders if you prefer. We each have our own home world in the physical universe. Each home world has sent a contingent here to observe the earth changes as you call them. We are located here where you've found us, in relatively close proximity to the earth. But we are just a small group of astronauts here on a mission from our home world. It's our understanding that one of the potential results of the earth changes, as you call them, is that earth will be joining our federation."  
>  
>"What is the focus of your interest in your observation of the great event as you call it?" I asked, rephrasing the question Dar's voice suggested on the tape.  
>  
>"We are here to try to gain some understanding of the energies involved in the great event," he replied. Calling my attention to the interior of his ship, he said, "As you can see we have brought the most sophisticated equipment available, from our home world to record this great event."  
>  
>As I looked around the interior of their ship my impression of the control room was that of a NASA moon shot. Row upon row of computer monitors, technicians, sensors, control consoles, recording equipment and other assorted gear. It felt like there was close to a football field size area in their ship filled with technicians and equipment. Quite impressive.  
>  
>"What sort of energies are you interested in recording?" I asked.  
>  
>His answer came in a series of squawks and squeaks that translated themselves into images. The first one was an image of the earth that looked about two or three times the diameter of a full moon. As I looked at it I wondered if this gave some clue as to the distance from earth to 2ndGathgroup's ship. I could see the huge crystal within the earth aligned to the axis of rotation. At one end, near the north pole, a ring was placed around the crystal. The word "LOVE" was engraved on the ring. In response to my question about the nature of the energies 2ndGathgroup was here to record, the ring slid from the end of the crystal to the center. With the images of the crystal and the earth superimposed the ring moved to the core center of the earth.  
>  
>These images then translated themselves into the following information. The energies are about a change in the duality nature of the earth school. When they're infused in the earth's core crystal some of the confusion we earth people have about this duality nature may be cleared up. The crystal symbolized the polarizing nature of the earth school where every thing can be described in terms of opposites. Polar opposites like hot and cold, wet and dry, tall and short are just a few examples. Moving the ring, labeled LOVE, from one end of the crystal to the center, symbolized a change in which we in the earth school would now recognize our confusion. We would have the opportunity to understand that Love does not have a polar opposite called hate. That is a confusion, caused by the duality nature of the earth school. As a result of the ongoing earth changes, the true opposite of Love would be revealed to be No Love, or lack of Love.  
>  
>As I watched the images and listened to the translations from the 2ndGathgroup Spokesman I noted his flat tone, and clinical description of the earth changes. I realized he had absolutely no understanding of what he was describing at an emotional, feeling level. At a mental, feeling level, the Spokesman and his group reminded me of the Vulcan character, Mr. Spock, from the *Star Trek* television series. Totally incapable of experiencing anything at an emotional feeling level. Not a single member of this telepathic race had the slightest inkling of what Love felt like. To them, Love was just an energy like heat or light. It might be more useful to them if Love's energy came in the form of a wooden log. At least then it would provide heat when burned it in a fireplace. At least then it would have some reason for existence. Any actual use for energies such as Love was inconceivable to them. These guys were totally clueless. They were completely without any ability to perceive from an emotional, feeling perspective and lacked any means of emotional expression of such energies.  
>  
>**Responding to my query about any messages he might have for Earth's inhabitants, the 2ndGathgroup spokesman replied. "Many of your people will make the leap to your Focus 27 soon and will have to exist there for a very long time. There will be great reductions in overall earth population. Do what you can to prepare your people for this event."**  
>  
>"Can you give me a sign that will help me validate the information I've received from you?" I asked, again prompted to do so by Dar's voice on the tape.  
>  
>**In response I was shown the image of a comet with a very large, tear drop shape. Existence of this comet would be a surprise to the general population of earth.** My mind flashed back briefly to my tour of the Coordinating Intelligences. Then, as I watched the comet approach Earth, in the background I could hear the line from a sixties tune that goes, "This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius." From that information I interpreted that the comet might come out of Aquarius in the Zodiac or might indicate the new way of thinking nature of Aquarius. I also noted that Uranus is Aquarius's planetary ruler, meaning the energies of the two are similar. So, this comet might in some way be linked to events consistent with that energy which tends toward sudden, unexpected, bizarre changes, usually uncomfortable in some way.  
>  
>**Next I had the impression of something very far distant, millions or billions of light years away. Whatever this was would align with the earth's rotational axis on the north pole side. This alignment would allow connection with some form of energy that would enter the earth's energetic system. The approaching comet would provide a triggering event to establish this energetic connection. At the end of the image sequence I was shown a crab that I took to mean there is some connection between the comet and the Zodiac sign of Cancer**, which is energetically similar to the Moon. The moon's energies deal with the emotions, the distant past and the feminine principle.

Ok, so that is the end of the quoted material and the background information for my question (Sorry it was so long! - I didn't know what to cut out because it all seemed important!).

If the above information is in fact true it would have very wide ranging implications for humanity. It seems that ultimately the earth is experiencing an immense positive change but in the process may undergo "profound reductions in population" (!) perhaps due to a comet or other factors. They said the comet is somehow connected to the zodiac sign of cancer. I'm not sure if anyone on here is following the throawaylien story but he predicts of an event happening on July 18th **in the zodiac sign of cancer.** Could this be the comet described in Moen's astral conversations???

**It would be extremely helpful if any experienced astral projectors could try to project to "The Gathering" and try to verify if any of this information is true, preferably as soon as possible.** I have renewed my interest in astral projection but currently do not have the skills needed to perform this task. If something of this magnitude is happening soon, we need to know.

I foresee there may be some responses automatically dismissing this concept. In my opinion there is no need to dismiss until we have a direct experience. In theory we should all be able to see for ourselves through the use of astral projection. I hope there are some users on here with the skills needed to be able to answer this question!

Discord Link: https://discord.gg/c97bU8MvV6Some people who can Astral project claim that there are aliens underground the Moon.
Can someone verify this?Asking out of curiosity. I was thinking about the Library of Alexandria and wonder if anyone AP'd into the past or Lucid Dreamt about the past.So my best friend called me yesterday in panic , talking about how she had the most scariest near - death experience. 

Curious to what know happened, she goes on to explain how she woke up and she was floating in air and could see her own body on the bed. 

She literally believes she died. 

I had a proud mom moment for her because I was like ‘ you astral projected without even knowing it! ‘ Thing is, she’s scared shitless that it will happen again and refuses to believe that this can be a good experience, and that it’s not anything like death. She’s scared to sleep now. 

I’ve sent her some books to read, hoping that it will change her conception of the experience but how do I help her/ get her to stop thinking of it as an evil thing? 

She won’t budge and says she’s not ready for this information, yet she’s too scared that it will happen again.Hello everyone, I have been following this subreddit for maybe one or two months because I am new to this topic and have significantly learned a lot. I want to share my experience as a newbie who have mistakenly done astral projection many times in my life but consciously done none, I am being honest. This is basically due to time restraints as I am a university student. However, whatever I am going to share with you is eye opening for newbies who are often very very misguided by online sources. So for newbies,this is a very important post. I will divide my experience into major parts for a easier read. People expert in astral projection are free to correct me.

**My background (this is important as it shows the background does not matter,the experience is faced by everyone):**

1. I am middle eastern mixed with south asia( I do not want to reveal country as it is not needed here).
2. Consider myself religious. I uphold my religion to utmost priority.
3. University student studying engineering in a recognized university.
4. Have never done yoga or meditation in my entire life.
5. 24 years old

**Some days after I joined this subreddit:**

1. I tried to do astral projection for the first time using theta waves from the internet (keep reading,there is more to it later). In my very first try,I reached the vibrational stage in about 30 minutes. I was extremely excited as I have never even before faced this kind of thingy.
2. Very soon after 3 or 4 tries, I managed to get to the vibrational stage within 15 minutes but using audio tracks.

**Current situation:**

1. I watched one lecture of Michael Raduga and I can say it is really good and every newbie skips on that but if you want to learn a skill, you have to study. Knowledge is power.
2. I can easily achieve the vibrational stage within 5 mins. Yes what you just heard is very real. I did not even practise it very much. It naturally came. I can always achieve that stage as soon as I relax in my bed. The fastest was about 3 minutes. Yes it is possible.
3. I do not use audio tracks anymore. I do not need them. What you need is relaxation and keeping in mind that you have to wake up to do somehting. That intention will allow you to project or reach the vibrational stage.

**Very common misconceptions( My personal experience and this is very important for beginners):**

1. You absolutely do not need a completely dark room to astral project. Whoever says that might have trouble relaxing while the light is on. That is the only logical reason I can find. I always keep my lights on during and reach that stage. Basically the sign of whether you are doing it right or wrong have many symptoms. Itches,body twitches,mind awake,strange tingling feelings etc and most importantly your body moving when its not. That is when you know you are in the phase as Michael Raduga says it.
2. No, you do not need a quiet room to project. That concept is hundred percent false. Nor do you need ANY audio clip to project. I can reach the vibrational stage( which is an optional stage to projection) within 5 mins without audio. I do not listen to theta waves anymore. You would be more surprised, I leave **twitch tv (gaming streaming platform)** at moderate volume and I get to the vibrations as the streamers are talking over. It is that easy.
3. The best time to project is not during sleep time but after you wake up. Yes this is true, basically you have to sleep not enough so when you wake up you walk a bit and try to sleep again. At this stage, I can reach vibrations or even better,my body moves when it isn't moving in a very short period of time <5 mins. Also known as the indirect method. Again, see Michael Raduga's seminars.
4. Vibrations are not necessary to project at all. I think of vibrations as a fine tuning device to tune in your body to project. So basically vibrations might mean your body is getting ready,however, there are many other feelings other than vibrations. Itches,twitches,body moving,teeth clenching etc,tingling sensation in the root chakra,pelvic region, and spine,heartbeat rising, pain etc.

&#x200B;

Please I suggest you to watch Micahel Raduga's seminar. yes it is like 6 hours in total but it is worth it. It might be boring but you learn the basic things.

This is a growing industry and internet makes money by improvising this audio tapes. Hence all the drama with the so-called God frequency. I personally do not think they are needed at all. If I can do it without theta waves or whatever, you can hundred percent do it too. You need two things- Relaxation+willingness to wake up and do something/not sleep.

The seminers of Michael Raduga are pinned to every post including this one by the bot. Please do not skip that and spare yourself of the bullshit that youtube is doing.With the link posted by u/rosssuke in his recent post, they talk about vibrations (the ones which we feel) and our brain "frequencies" which supposedly allow us to undergo this phenomenal experience of astral projection. I read another comment, by u/DrFartPoop, about how he managed to get into the deep depths of Area 51 and spotted "frequency machinery" or something of the kind that he deemed "bad frequencies". What if that is the stopping force? What if, miraculously, they send out these frequencies to our astral body, connected to our silver cord and therefore our physical body, which disrupts our frequencies and hence our astro projections. It would make sense, if some shit got messed in our brains, that we would feel sick... Anyways, that's just a thought.I usually don't worry about trying to get proof about this. I know it is real. I know how many great things this has brought to my life, as solving my fear of death for example.
This morning i had a weird AP where i couldn't really have total control of myself. I entered the tunnel several times and was spat here and there without actually realizing where was I.

Once i regained a little selfcontrol i tried to concentrate real hard because when i AP i don't always remember what i want to do there. I had in mind asking about my past lives. I wanted to know if i was successful in any of them or if i always had more humble existences.

I was given a name of a brand and the money i had back then. I was kind of pissed i expected something more interesting but i tried to remember the name of the brand to search it up on google.

I have to state this. I have never NEVER heard that name. It's a brand that exists to this day but where i live it is not known. I promise that i never heard that name before.

I have to state too that i always had a thing for France, and specifically for Paris, it has always felt like home and when i was younger, even though i never been there i knew french words. Easy words, but i could know them before being learnt. 

As a teenager i only read french authors of the XIX century, for some reason i really loved the style.
I looked up the name of the brand and turns out it not only exists but it is and was a french perfumery founded in the XIX century. 

Small proof, at least for me, that we can get contrastable info in the astral.A being woke me up from a dream to warn me of some kind of danger. The being made a weird noise to warn me. It sounded like a quick, scared, electric kazoo-like noise for 1 second and then I woke up. Someone else who went through [a similar experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/SNBE/comments/mdvhvw/a_being_woke_me_up_from_a_dream_to_warn_me_about/gsbrk1d/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) describes the noise as "some kind of weird tiny trumpet". When I woke up, it seemed like something was strongly controlling my arm.

This has actually happened to me a dozen times this year in almost the same way. It always seems like an intelligent lifeform is trying to communicate to me to warn me of something evil. The warning always feels dire and extremely important when I wake up, and then it gradually fades.

What is the warning about? Something hurting me or about to hurt me? Something hurting something else? Am I still in trouble? Are they still in trouble? Why is the warning sent right when I wake up? What does it have to do with me being asleep?

FYI: My dreams never seem like my own anymore. They all seem like they are being shared, observed, generated and/or manipulated in real-time. Does anyone have any experience with this?

Edit: I forgot to say why I posted this in r/AstralProjection in the first place: I have no experience astral projecting myself but I believe the something or someone that is possessing me and controlling my dreams (and sometimes parts of my body) uses my mind to do something like astral projection every time I fall sleep.

I was hoping someone from r/AstralProjection would have some knowledge or experience of this. Maybe you happened upon a scenario that seemed like this once in an AP or a dream?I woke up from a dream and didn't move. I didn't had the idea to AP but I entered the vibrational stage.

I started to hear all these voices that they talk about that you will hear when you almost AP. Even though I could hear all sort of voices I wasn't afraid of them. I looked with a curious side to this voices, but then I just felt so welcomed and safe with the voices. I felt the most peaceful I ever had in my life. Now that I remember the experience I kinda cry ;)

I didn't succesfully AP but now I think I know what to do if I ever enter the vibrational stage again.Title plus, how would I go about doing that during my AP sessions?So If I fall asleep at an unusual time and am waken up in a hurry/abruptly, I would feel like I was Vibrating and I continue to Vibrate for a few minutes after I wake up. 

Does anybody else have experienced this stuff ??I met my spirit guide the other day. We talked for a while then at the end she hinted at me being a spirit guide before I was born. Thoughts?

Ps sorry if this doesn't belong hereI finally did it guys!!!

I took a nap, and eventually I woke up halfway and realised I was in the vibrational stage. I then cleared my mind and focussed on getting deeper and deeper into the vibrational stage. I was hearing alot of loud noises, and I felt a sort of force pushing me side to side similar to what happened during my first OoBE.

When I felt ready I decided to try some seperation techniques and I repeatedly tried rolling out of my body. After a few tries my upper half actually seperated but my legs where still stuck in my physical body so I used my astral upper body and tried wiggling myself out of my physical body. After trying really hard my legs also seperated.

At this point I was in my room and I instantly knew that I have finally achieved it !! Within a second I decided I needed to get away from my physical body ASAP so I opened the door and start sprinting as fast as I can outside. 

Once outside I kept on sprinting as fast as I could in a straight like away from my physical body. On my way I saw a dog, German shepherd with a broken leg, (this dog resembled our dog that passed away a few weeks ago, but her legs where not broken). The dog was walking pretty fast but after a few moments I actually overtook it (because I was still sprinting as fast as I could away from my body), whilst over taking it I looked in its eyes and smiled at it. It smiled back. The dog looked kinda stressed like it had a lot going on in its life right now and it was a bit exhausted but it still stayed strong. After overtaking the dog and getting a good amount of distance between us I was getting tired of spirinting myself so I decided to go back to the dog and ride on its back since it was going at a fairly rapid speed as well. 

So I went back and sat on its back, the dog didn't seem to mind and allowed me to ride on it. 

Then I thought to myself "this is all fun and nice, but how do I actually return to real life?" Then I was back in my body and I was in a sleep paralysis.

Being in that situation felt extremely real, but thinking about it feels abit more like it was a dream, like half dream half reality.

I'm very happy to have finally APd and only after 3 weeks of practice :)

Thanks for reading this and happy travels y'all.As I projected into the future, I aimed for approximately 100 - 150 years from the present. I also targeted a time / space coordinate that had a large amount of emotion connected to it. When you’re in the astral emotion feels like radiation -when there’s a lot of it it’s hot. When you go to areas of high emotion that generally means something interesting is going on.

When I arrived I noticed a very wide metal enclosure that seemed firmly bolted to the ground. I could see people seated and strapped into chairs inside. A few people were standing outside the stairs leading to the metal object looking towards the horizon in apprehensive expectation. Looking past the nearest saucer shaped metal enclosure, I saw there was a large field filled with many more of these shelters likewise secured to the ground.

I asked the nearest male who looked to be in his 30's what was going on. He looked at me as if I  were insane. He replied who are you and why aren’t you in your "sanctuary"? I had no answer for him as I wasn’t sure to what sanctuary he was referring. He then said that the wave would be there soon, and I had better get strapped in quickly if I wanted to survive.

I read in his mind that there was a large tsunami coming that everyone was expecting and that had something to do with the warmer climate in the future. Recognizing that this might be some major disaster that might be of interest if I had a specific date, I posed the question.

His expression and his thoughts broadcast the thought that I definitely had to be some dangerous lunatic for asking what I considered a simple question! Visibly alarmed, he asked me if my “unit” was malfunctioning. He didn’t use the word unit. Instead, he used a word that I was unfamiliar with. Probing his mind in depth, I got the concept that the unit was some sort of a "implant" apparatus in their brain's that connected their people to a truly worldwide web that connected everyone on the planet together. I sensed that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) component was a part of this advanced network as well. With such an apparatus available to all, it would be foolish to ask anyone the date because everyone would already know that information.

Before I could inquire further, I saw a giant tsunami wave towering on the horizon and heading in fast. My future acquaintance and his and his comrades fled into their metal container, closing and fastening the door. Seeing the tsunami coming my way I decided it was time to return to the present. I know the giant wave couldn’t hurt me, but I’ve been involved in things like that in the past and the experience is very disconcerting nonetheless.

Comments:

1. These people knew this tsunami was coming and had prepared a shelter ahead of time! How is foreknowledge like that possible? In our time tsunamis occur very unpredictably!
2. In the future there exists a common internet implant apparatus in everyone’s brain! The words awesome and worrisome come to mind...

If you’ve read any of my other Reddit posts, you know I’ve been astral projecting for over 57 years. I’ve even started up a new Channel on YouTube, Astral Club [https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE](https://youtu.be/kyEDpB-yOZE) .

RickI practiced some 4x4 breathing recently and it relaxes me really well, it even felt like i was getting to the vibrational stage rather quickly. 4x4 breathing is when you inhale deeply for 4 seconds and exhale for 4 seconds, and repeat the process until you are relaxed. It was developed by the navy seals for relaxation and calmness, and man does it workI've tried reaching the vibrational state in several situations (wide awake or fairly tired in the middle of the day, tired before going to sleep and after 4-6 hours of sleep), but I can't keep my body asleep if my mind's waking up. I'll focus on my breath or count to keep my mind awake while letting go of stress and tension in my body, and allowing it to relax, but keeping my mind awake just wakes up my body too and I feel bored and restless, not in a rollover signal way, or in a checking-if-I'm-asleep yet way either. The other way round: if I let my body fall asleep completely while not focusing on my mind too much, they both fall asleep seamlessly. How do you combat the boredom and let your body actually fall asleep while you keep your mind awake? I've tried for a few weeks now, and while I don't expect to AP right away, I'd like to get closer to the vibrational state.I am quite experienced with about 25 successful OOBEs/projections in total. I can, without a doubt, say that OOBEs **are not dreams.** Also, they are real and they are not lucid dreams. 

I have entered many different realms, I have seen goblins, terminators, copies of myself, dogs, people, dolls that are alive, etc...

I have completely gotten control of my vision, movement and the ability to change the world around me in the astral. I have been a member of r/AstralProjection for >6 months and been APing for more than 3 months.One of my favourite books on AP is Robert Monroes, Journeys out of the body. 

Just recently i read it maybe the third time in my life. At one point in the book he mentionend, how he visited a friend while APing and saw her talking to her daughter and the daughters friend. To get his friends attention he pinched her beneath the chest. The next day he asked her if she remembered anything weird happening the day before and she did and asked him „oh it was you who pinched me?“

I think this is something quite significant that she was affected physically in real life by his astral actions.

Is there anyone here who made a similar experience?

Edit: Changed the word breast to chest.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf2vXHjG0p6ZOWNGm8LWpsylDAeVCtrlgIt was really quick but, hell, it's been around 3 weeks that I try hard to achieve that and I finally DID  IT !!

**Quick summary :**

I used the Michael Raduga Technique coupled with the Lucidollogy 103 Eye pry technique.

So what happened was that I tried to appear in front of my mirror visualizing the utmost details that I could remember, everything started to vibrate like when a plan takes off and after a while I achieved the "Quiet Zone" where I felt a bit sleepy.

Then I decided to JUST GET UP. I did and didn't knew if I had move with my physical body so I squeezed my nose and tried to take an inhale... To my surprise I could still feel the air filling up my lungs, at that moment I knew, for the first time, I didn't fuck up on the exit !

Then I remembered that I need to go and eat something to sharpen my senses.

So, as my bedroom is on the second flour of the house just above the kitchen, I just let myself fall through the ground, but as I failed down I suddenly felt like really tied and my sight started to become really foggy, and I started to laydown in the OBE.

I knew that wasn't good, but this exhaust just hit me like a truck, I said to myself "Thomas, you really have important things to do here, so GET UP !" but as I said that I felt asleep in the OBE... And wake up in my physical body.... Thou still a big victory after weeks of failure. haha

**Journey (3 Weeks of failure) :**

My biggest problem was that for each single try I could achieve very strong vibrational stage but I could never exit my body. The difference this time I think was that while visualizing me in front of the mirror I felt myself relaxing and entering the quiet zone. This relaxing state is so deep that I even forgot about my physical body(for real) as if the mirror became vividly real thou dream like.

My other problem was that it was very hard to fall asleep once I waked up at 4 am, until I learn about technique to really quick fall asleep. That's from lucidollogy, in short, just record your breathing pattern while you are sleeping, then reproduce it when you want to sleep. The second rule is to not move a single muscle (you still can clear roll over signals if it's really strong). The third rule is simply to focus on your breathing and thinking about nothing else (yeah like a meditation).

And then I just put a timer on my phone so it wake me up during the second half of the process (after waking up at 4 am). But this took a while because a lot of timer didn't worked, so I had to pick the right one.

That's it  

**A couple of years ago** my next door neighbour Gráinne  (pronounced grawn-ya) called to the house to talk to my mother. I  couldn’t help but overhear the conversation they were having. Gráinne  was really upset as she had just lost her engagement ring her fiance had  just gotten her and couldn’t find it anywhere.

I felt that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to put my  new found spiritual practice to the test; if all this ‘out of body’  stuff was real then I’ll be able to prove it! That night while in bed I  lay down with the intention of finding the ring. I left my body and  found myself standing in my astral ‘spirit’ body in the middle of my  bedroom. My plan was to go into Gráinne’s house and have a look around  to see if it was at all possible to find the engagement ring for her.  While in my non-physical body, my spirit, I flew out of my bedroom  window and landed right onto my back garden. I then walked the rest of  the way from my garden and into Gráinne’s, who lived just nextdoor. I  jumped straight through her backdoor as if it wasn’t even there and  entered her kitchen.

After wandering about her kitchen for a minute or so something was  telling me to go into her living room. I’ve never been in Grainne’s  house before this but I assumed it had the same layout to my own. When I  got there, there was a spirit standing alone in the middle of the room  greeting me. He called loudly to me…   


>…it’s over there… the ring… it’s over there!!

I replied to the same helpful spirit who’s face I could not see  “Where?” and he pointed in the direction of the fireplace. When I looked  toward the fireplace I noticed a bright glow in the shape of a ring  shining brightly up toward my third eye and back toward the fireplace —  “I got it!” I replied and pulled my awareness back to my physical body  right away and wrote down my experience.

The next morning when my mother awoke I told her that I had a feeling  I knew where Gráinne’s ring was. She went nextdoor to my neighbours  house and told her where she might find it. To all of our surprise  Gráinne found her engagement ring in the same place, the living room  right by the fireplace! It somehow had gotten stuck down a long  candlestick. This was proof enough to me and to the rest of my family  that what I was experiencing was way more than just crazy hallucinations  or vivid dreams and that there was something more going on — although I  kind of knew that anyway.

davidpatricksally.comI can get to the vibration stage but I can't seem to stop breathing manually. And I think this is hindering my progress. I want to know how to stop focusing on my breathing. I am able to let my whole body fall asleep but I'm stuck on how to make my body automatically breathe without me having to think about when to take a breath. Any advice on this will be greatly received.So I’ve been a lurker on this subreddit for a little under a year, and I first got into learning astral projection a little over 1.5 years ago. I had reached the vibrational stage twice as a beginner, but never was able to go deeper.

I, like a lot of people who are new to this subreddit, felt like the experience was just beyond my grasp. I have had many lucid dreams, some extremely visceral. But until about a week ago I had stopped trying to force an AP experience, and instead waited for an apt morning sleep paralysis. 

I woke up at 3am today and decided to stay up a little because I felt restless. I had smoked both flower and oil the previous day, so I still had some residual THC in my system. I watched about an hour’s worth of a Twitch stream before deciding to return to sleep.

When I woke up again it was in a very relaxed state where I could easily slip back into dreaming. I closed my eyes and sank into the vibrational state, which made a loud humming. I relaxed into it and imagined I was slowly leaning upwards. I felt myself peel, as it were, from my body, and I then focused on standing in front of the mirror. I appeared in my bathroom about a second later and I saw that my face and body were kind of distorted, like through wet glass. I tried turning on the lights to add brightness (the whole experience was rather dimly lit) but I noticed nothing happened when I tried to flip the switch.

I woke up and was able to AP twice more this morning, which was great practice. I felt the same kind of peeling sensation like pulling off a sticker or bandage when leaving my body. The only disappointment was that I ‘went blind’ now and then, like only seeing the backs of my eyelids. That possibly was the light from my windows making my eyes active, but I hope to learn better focus to stay in the dream. I did make sure to pat down my body and try to make out the details of things while I ap’ed, and it helped deepen the experience a little.

I hope this inspires those of you who haven’t had a successful ap yet to keep practicing. I decided to live in the assumption that I was a natural at it and it would happen easily; intention is after all how you control much of lucid dreaming. Good luck to ya’ll!As the title suggests, my mom had a massive stroke about 8 months ago. She is alive and able to talk, but unfortunately she is left side paralyzed and she suffered some very severe cognitive damage.
It’s very strange to grieve someone who is still alive. I can talk to her, but she doesn’t seem like the same person anymore.
I guess my question is, if I met her through AP, would she be her “normal” self? As in, her pre-stroke self? How would I be able to encourage that sort of thing? Is it even possible?
I really miss my mom and would do anything to connect with her again.I honestly thought I was going crazy. The things I see are always crazy. 

I have come upon a video and then went straight to the source.

The video talked about a certain ability of the human being. Something that had been talked about in religious books and by people for 1000s of years.

Yes I am talking about Astral Traveling.

What is Astral Travelling?

Well have you ever heard of stories of how a person went into a coma and came out of their body at the surgeons desk where they are being operated on and saw everything that the surgeon was doing and when they came back to conscienceness they were able to narrate everything that happened?

Well this is astral travelling and this is also one of the many ways you are the soul.

What we know as soul is known as "ethereal Body" in many books. Its part of our physical body without which, it wouldnt be whole. Its literally the reason there is life in the body.

I found out the proof that no one can question. And i need your help for more

The second one is literally the american government showing how they know that astral travelling (AKA remote viewing or Projecting) is real and its so real that they used it for military purposes.

SO Heres what i want from you guys. I want more like this. I want more CIA documents which were declassified which not only talk about this, but also about other stuff related to this. The Whole Spectrum! Like The soul is real, what about Super human strength, Psychic phenomena etc. 

Something really related to religion and how it was always seen as a myth or just as a story but its actually real.

Things with real proof

Im going to have a class where i talk about symbology and other stuff .

Help me out.Imagine something that will mesmerise you in your minds eye like something that wows you to the point where you've had to snap out of it because it draws all of your attention 

E.g something that amazed you as a kid to the point where someone else had to snap you out of it

Put all your focus onto the thing that mesmerises you because it draws all attention away from your body and so your bodies senses shut down because their not being used so you loose all feeling of your body

This is important because your bodies out of the way so it'll make it easier to get into the astral

I tried doing it last night for the first time as practice while I didn't get put of body I started experiencing hyponagogic jerk where your body jerks part of your body suddenly on its own so I know it's the right track

So try this and see what happensFirstly a big shout out to everyone who participates in this forum.  Were it not for the information here, plus that in books and videos from Michael Raduga, Rick (astral club), Tom Campbell and others, I wouldn't have even thought that Astral Projection was possible.

I've been practicing with Michael Raduga's [method](https://obe4u.com/how-to-lucid-dream/) for a couple of weeks and at 1:11am this morning came back from a short but thrilling first OBE experience.  

I think my main issue was that I was trying too hard to separate by rolling out, standing up etc after waking up and missing Michael's advice about attempting to separate by going straight to the bathroom mirror upon waking as a first step.

So this morning I woke up in an unfamiliar state and focussed hard on biting down on the bathroom sink.  It was not in my plan to do that, but that's what I did and I immediately materialised in front of the downstairs bathroom mirror.  I remember thinking 'holy shit, I did it!' and then things started to go grey and fade out.  

So I concentrated on feeling the sink, the edges of the mirror, the taps, and things started to come in to focus and I felt I was solidly in the astral plane.  I could vaguely see my face in the mirror.  The bathroom configuration was also different, as there was a shower screen where the toilet is in physical reality.

The next thing I wanted to do was fly, so I walked out of the bathroom to the front door, turned the handle, walked outside and just thought 'fly!' and that's what I did.  It was bright outside and I did a gentle takeoff to about treetop level and meandered down my street.

The first thing I noticed was there were a lot of people rising up from ground level too, on their way to somewhere.  I felt euphoric and shouted 'first time flyer, coming through!'. That made some people look my way and smile but other than that, I didn't interact with anyone.

After what seemed like less than a minute I turned around and reversed my direction and then got sucked back to my body.  I was bummed it was over so quickly but ecstatic at actually getting out-of-body.

When I told my wife this morning she asked 'how do you know it was real?' and my answer is that it felt as real as real life, and the sense of being transported out of my bed and materialising in front of the mirror was like nothing I've ever experienced before.  

Hopefully this encourages others to keep trying and experience first hand what it's like to travel OBE!I saw a person on twitter say that the documents on the analysis/assessment of the gateway process on the CIA website was deleted. I checked myself and they were. Anyone else have this problem?Which one do you recommend I meditate to and why?
Feels like 432hz enables me to empty my mind more whereas  7.83hz kinda frustrates me but is the frequency that falls in the 4-8hz that robert monroe used.


For reference:

432 is the frequency of the universe 
7.83 is for the earthIt’s empty with white walls. I just walk around and look out the window. Such a ghost thing to do hah. I don’t know why I go there. Typically in AP I am creating places, designing them as I go. This place is different, I don’t do much there. 

Its kind of a trippy, dark thought to imagine I might be haunting someplace. I haven’t gone back since I had that thought... just in case.Fellow explorers, enjoy the beautiful waves tapes by Robert Monroe.

!!!One important warning!!!:
Do not use binaural beats /  frequencies if you had any kind of stroke or epilepsy in the past!
Binaural beats specifically influence the brain waves and can thus artificially cause a stroke in the worst case.



Edit: forgot link

Edit: Warning noteI just woke up to tell you guys that i did it!

i was sleeping, then woke up and tried to go back to sleep, i visualized myself balancing a giant rectangular block! i imagined myself pushing and pulling and balancing the rectangular block to be straight! all of the sudden, it felt real, i felt my body shaking, moving, going up and down! and ladies and gentlemen, from here i knew i was about to AP! i tried to keep that feeling and i heard a big sound that i knew this is a call for APing! okay so i'm out of the body now! i see my body laying down near the door(i don't sleep near the door but the body was there, white, glowing), i tried to immediately look in the mirror to see what is up!(the room i was in had 2 mirrors, one on the right wall, one on the left, i went to the left one! idk why!) i saw myself in the mirror, my face was bloody and tired(it looked like i have beaten up!) with a piece of kleenex inside my mouth! this was kind of disturbing to see, but i smiled and thought : ohhh what a fucking idiot! hahahahaha! also keep in mind guys that my feet were not on the ground this whole time! i was moving on the air! also the room was pretty weird! the room was dark but everything in the room had white outlines! it looked 2D, it was cool! and after seeing myself in the mirror i tired to go out of the room and see the sky! when i went inside another room and tired to get out, suddenly everything around me spins! as if i lost control! then i wake up! it was very fun, this whole experience is amazing, and i hope that i can do more APs in the future, this is just a start baby!please ask any questions that you have!

EDIT: SORRY GUYS FOR MY MISTAKE! it was a rectangular block not triangle, bad english hahahaha <3

EDIT 2 : Also when i tried to go out and see the sky i kept thinking about this : how do i wake up after this AP? do i sleep then wake up? or i wake up immediately after the AP? this kind of thinking made me lose focus! hahaha!The people who claim to astral project,the question for you guys is that have you ever tried to go to Kerela to the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, which has a secret 7th door which cannot be opened physically and is claimed to be catastrophic if opened by human technology, as per astral projection you can be present there and pass through it without any issues, so my question is "is it possible to see what's on the other side of the door?" Please answer if anyone knows how to project and has been there.Background info first: Been practicing AP for 15 years,  usually attain an AP once or twice every month.

Yesterday morning around 7am I woke lying on my left side then the vibrations kicked in, moments later I was out and viewing myself and my wife in bed. 

I ventured around my home viewing things, everything seemed well, the clarity of the experience was as clear as day, in fact it was much more clearer than what I’ve experienced before. I recalled earlier whilst awake my ongoing concerns regarding the subjugation of society by our political class. The ongoing wars etc and I wondered will we as a society see the light at the end of the tunnel.

That thought began to permeate in my AP and I asked out aloud is there hope for humanity or do we go down the road of self destruction. I went into my living room and sat on the couch whilst out in the Astral. Moments later a being appeared to my right as it walked through the fireplace wall and sat down opposite of where I was sitting.

They where of old age, perhaps aged around 70, short silver neck length hair and it was a male. He was dressed in a white garment, liken to a Roman toga. I got no ill feeling from this entity, it seemed friendly and asked why am I worried about humanity.

Before I could raise my concerns they said that they know what I’m thinking and asked that I listen to what they’ve got to say.

The entity explained humanities current worries are being looked after and that the current strife and worry currently happening in this realm are about to change for the betterment of humanity. They explained an evil force which has been present within the earth realm for several thousand years is close to relinquishing it’s grasp on humanity.  The entity also explained they and many other Astral light beings have been fighting this entity, he added as to how they’ve managed to subdue its grasp on humanity can’t be explained in human logic as it’s something our mind couldn’t comprehend.

I found this strange and I asked is there anything you can give me as validation to his claim. He smiled intently at me and responded that have you not noticed a great awakening within humanity, do you not see the voice of the people becoming louder, don’t you feel the war and hate being challenged more often. Then he said my name, I thought wtf how did you know my name. He said listen John, I know things may look bleak but rest assured humanity’s beginning to wake up, John he said again you are living in the most important chapter of humanities existence.

He then stood up and bowed his head, then I woke up, I sat up in my bed for some 10 mins before venturing into the living room. Something caught my attention, the couch pillows where the entity was sitting was misplaced as if someone had been sitting down.

Every nigh before I go to bed I always straighten the pillows, old OCD part of myself yet they appeared to have been moved.

Still pondering on what I had experienced, it was thee most clarity awaken alert AP I’ve had to date, as to the message I received, I’m hopeful, I have to be..
Thank you so much for all the tools and teachings!!! I was in a deep meditative state and then I felt and heard alll the vibrations it was especially strong on my forehead between my eyebrows then I felt my eyes open by themselves but they were closed and then I saw the fractorals in my visual field then I was in an open space, it was dark and kind of alien but I felt safe. Then I came back, all in within minutes. This just happened and I’m sharing my findings. Thank you so much. This happened last month on 6th august. I've had a lot of sleep paralysis and accidental AP experiences, mostly very unpleasant and some almost neutral, but nothing quite like this, so I took the time to write it down right after it happened.

It starts with a small shadow in the dark, like some living void hovering above my left shoulder, which scares the hell out of me at first. I try to shoo it away, while for some reason I get the idea it might be a sleepy misperception of my small dog (which I don't have). Then I sluggishly get up and try to turn on the light several times, but it doesn't work. Because I've had this experience several times during sleep paralysis, I realise what this is.

This confirmation that I'm not properly awake yet puts me instantly back in my body, in my bed. I find this state unsettling to say the least, so I try to wake up, unsuccessfully. Then I remember what I've been reading on here, that I can use this to AP, so I try to focus to gain more control and try to move my body again. I move my astral hands and my upper body a bit, but it seems very hard all of a sudden and can't seem to move much further than that, so I think to myself, "Why is this so difficult right now? Lately, when I do this, a force pulls me out gently, without me having to try so hard."

Then I hear a "voice" from the window, "Most don't usually struggle so hard" or... "It isn't like you to struggle like this." These words are an approximation of what was communicated telepathically, I think. Though it sounded a lot like an echo of my very thoughts, but with a lighter, almost playful tone. When I look towards it, with my mind's eye, it looks a bit like some kind of multicolored ancient wood carved mask... but alive, dynamic and more intricate than any static thing I've seen, with its colors standing out brightly in the dark. 

The entity puts me somewhat at ease, like it's familiar somehow, but also unknown, which makes me slightly apprehensive. I don't even know when or how it happened, but at this point I'm out of my body. Then the entity makes a strange request, telling me to pick up my phone and do something for it, implying that there's no time to waste. I pick it up, somewhat confused and suspicious, and after I turn it on, I say, "Ok, but if i do this, you have to tell me who you are!" and I get something like an affirmative gesture. 

To my surprise, the phone appears somewhat functional, despite the fact that it usually doesn't work at all in such a place. Then I am instructed to open up some kind of app or game where I have to look at some objects in a room and find a way to light a fire. I look for a bit and eventually find a match, light it up... I do most of this with my mind of course. Now I'm supposed to materialize that digital fire into the room I'm in, my room, and light a candle by the window... which I did, after a bit of struggle. The flame was quite faint, though.[...]

Soon after this I sense an overwhelming smell of smoke, more than there should be from just a candle, so that suddenly makes me a bit worried and ask, "Wait... what's going on? Am... I dying?" At my question, the entity morphs into an elderly white haired lady with a very compassionate and understanding look on her face and says, "It's time to come home." As soon as that sinks in, to my surprise, I break out into tears... It all felt so real, I truly believed for a few moments there that I'm about to leave all I've ever known behind, forever. She was not surprised though and calmly said, "I know, honey. Even for those who are ready, it's still a little hard/sad. But you've had enough... It's time." Then I can't help but think of my family members, try to name each one and say,"What will they do?". At this point I wake up in my bed, with my heart pounding in my chest.

I still sometimes wonder if it was some prank played by my subconscious or maybe something else? Any thoughts about this or similar experiences? I know the shadows are common, but what about the other entity?

Also, it may or may not be relevant to mention that three days later I almost suffocated in my sleep, though I wouldn't conclude that it's in any way related. It wasn't the first time either, lately(I suspect sleep apnea.)

Tl;dr: A shapeshifting, multicolored entity showed up at my window and asked me to light a candle for it, which I did, and after that it said it's time for me to come home.Last night I accidentally Astral projected into what seems to be a cinema, theater or lecture hall or classroom of some sort before I got kicked out I saw a beast that look like a very big and ugly deformed goat and the teacher or the person giving the class said this was a manifestation of Shiva. Has anybody seen this before or has anybody been in this big lecture hall before? It was a huge building with white walls and there was like four or five security people in the entrance including a blonde lady . Probably around 100 students were spread out among the huge lecture hall.fillerWanna hear feedback on this
...

So a while back I took my first hit of acid and began to panicked after being left alone. My trip sitter was asleep on the couch next to me but he was OUT. I decided to get up and get a drink of water walking through the living room, past a narrow doorway, and into the kitchen where I could see the laundry room that would've been obstructed from my view from where I was sitting. I decided I didn't need water, turned and left the room, only to see my body still in the chair. Immediately woke up in my body again, tried to shout to wake up my sitter, even stomped the floor a few times hard enough to hurt my feet, only I wasn't moving or making any audible noise. It wasn't a dream, it was too clear and still is in my memory. I've never astral projected that I can tell for a fact since then, any thoughts on this?I was laying in bed and noticed a buzzing around me (no noise) and sat there enduring it for a bit, while also wondering “yo wtf” then it clicked, those were the vibrations, and I was having a hard time moving my physical body, although I eventually did, and I almost lifted out, I was able to get my arms up, but I had a strange feeling something was keeping me from exiting, and I’m not sure whatHello beautiful people. So yeah as you read from the title, I think astral projected while I was having sex. It was absolutely the craziest, most exciting thing that has ever happened to me. It was with my partner of 6 years and before our sex life was good, but very average I would say. Then this happened just out of the blue. Before it happened I was having the most intense orgasm I was ever having in my life, then boom. I can’t even explain it because I have never projected before but it was like my body lifted up and I could see us in the bed. I looked it up afterwards and did my own research because I had no idea what had happened and I came to realize I had to of projected! If anyone has any similar experiences or has any answers for me I would greatly appreciate it!! Much love.So, last night I spoke to my mom and she told me that my grandma, who has been ill, has been waking up confused and seeing visions off and on. 

I have been researching astral projection and telepathy and i came across [this page](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/conjuring_spells/21293/page.html) that explains how to essentially project yourself into someone else’s dreams. 

After having the conversation with my mother last night, I thought of this page. I went to sleep and i woke up naturally around 3 am EST, so i decided to try it. As i laid there, I did everything the instructions told, focused on my grandma’s face, smile, voice, smell, her favorite outfit, saying her name in my minds voice. 

I felt myself slip into a kind of trance, for how long im unsure, and this part is kind of foggy memory, but i remember visualizing myself telling my grandma i loved her and giving her roses, and smelling the roses, etc. 

I woke suddenly and jerked up taking a gasping breath. i by then was feeling sleepy so i brushed off the experience and went to sleep. 

this morning my mother was facetiming me multiple times so i answered finally and she said that my grandma didn’t sleep all night. my mom has a baby monitor in my grandmas room and heard her talking to “visitors” who all had gifts for her but wouldn’t introduce themselves. she then heard my grandma say my name in a confused voice and ask me what i was doing there. my grandma went on to ask me what happened to my face a couple times. 

so i asked my grandma about it and she said that i popped up in her dream last night but that she wasn’t asleep. she said that my face was white and that she couldn’t make clear of it. 

my grandma is weak and didnt have much energy to speak with me so that was all the information i could get from her. 

just curious what y’all think of this, similar experiences? links to texts about this phenomena?

thanks!
I’m going in wish my luck!>*The process of death parallels the process of falling asleep.*

Although everyone is already aware of this, I want to post it as a reminder for any person currently wondering, what is the point of learning astral projection? Well, if you have had just **one** conscious, wake-induced projection, that single experience has already prepared you for death better than anything else ever could.

When you're body is falling asleep with the mind kept awake, those roaring sounds, rumbling sensations, and body vibrations are showing you exactly what it feels like to die and leave the physical body. The floating movement you've felt is another preview. Speak to a person who has experienced an O.B.E. during a near-death event, and many will tell you how they "*floated*" towards the ceiling. Or they felt vertigo.  Or they saw a tunnel. Or they saw their body. In other words, all typical projection symptoms.

The near-death and astral projection similarities are undeniable. So if you do encounter these strange sensations at the final transition, you will already know what it all means.   Nothing beats personal, first-hand experience. You could have just read about it and thought about it. But you went further than that, so give yourself a pat on the back.

&#x200B;

>"*Normally, when we fall asleep, we do so without awareness. We aren’t conscious of the phases that our mind goes through or the experience of these states. This is really a lost opportunity* ***because the way we fall asleep is exactly like the way that we will die***\*. If we can learn to catch this moment, to recognize it, then we will be able to navigate the experience of our death\*" -- Nangten Menlang organization, founded by Tulku Lobsang.If you're the type to attempt projection on your back, do it with your palms facing up. You may have to adjust your shoulder blades a bit so that you're comfortable, but try it out and see if your success rate increases (has something to do with our energy partly being concentrated into the hands). Much loveI had always been aware that my dad could astral project, but it seemed kinda normal to me, I didn't really know any different. He has been very sick since he was born, so he always thought maybe that's why he could do this. He used to hop in bed at night then leave his body and check round the house to make sure everything was secure and that my sister and I were safe. He can't make himself leave his body but he can control what he does once he's out and has also said sometimes even if it seems like only a couple of minutes, he gets this feeling like he's been out too long and he hates those times cause he ends up "slammed" back into his body and feels like crap for the next day or so. 

Anyway, when I was 17 he went in for open heart surgery. He was very sick, had lost a lot of weight and was very weak by the time they did the surgery, so ended up having to be resuscitated twice during. When he came home from hospital, I took a few days off course so I could be home to help if need be, as he was only allowed out of bed to use the bathroom and little walks round the house at first. 

So one afternoon while my sister was at school, I checked on dad who was fast asleep with his tv going and went back up the other end of the house to watch a movie. I fell asleep on the couch. I have no idea how long I was asleep but was suddenly woken up when dad grabbed hold of my foot and shook it. I jumped and said "omg what?!" And he just looked at me like he was really annoyed  and said "HELP ME" in that irritated parent tone when they've been calling your name for ages and you haven't responded, so I was immediately stroppy. i sat up and said "ok but you could've woken me nicely". He turned his back and walked off into the kitchen. I followed him and he wasn't there so I called out "where are you?" No answer so I checked up the hallway. 

I got halfway up the hall when I suddenly clicked what I'd just seen. Dad that shook me awake was wearing a blue t shirt, was his normal size and had flicky hair that needed a cut. My dad that I had just realised was on bed rest, was unable to wear shirts yet as they irritated his scar, was 30kg lighter and I had just shaved his head for him the day before. 

I started to panic at what I might find, but I calmed myself down and popped my head into his room. He was in a heap on the floor, holding his chest and trying to breath. I tend to go into mummy mode when scary stuffs happening, so I calmly got down on the floor with him and helped sit him up so he could breath, then hauled him back up into bed. 

He was clearly embarrassed and wouldn't look at me, but said thanks. I sat with him for a bit watching TV (he hates being babied so I didn't wanna do the whole "are you ok" "what happened" "what can I get for you) . After a few minutes he said "sorry about that". I told him it was totally fine, it just gave me a fright but that I was happy he was alright. Then he said "I just wanted to make myself a coffee, but I stood up and got dizzy and when I landed on my knees it jolted me chest. I'm sorry for giving you fright, I just had to do it" I said I understood that he just wanted to get a drink and that I didn't mind helping him up, it was just an accident.

He gave me a sideways look and said "yeah, but I didnt wanna have to come get you like that, I just couldn't catch my breath to call out". I got cold chills down my back and my eyes welled up. Being so worried when I found him, I had forgotten he had come and gotten me. I literally said to him "that's very cool....but don't do that again ay" and he cracked up laughing which made his chest hurt worse lol 

Turns out my son can do the same, but that's another story!Hi all. I've decided to give the Monroe Tapes (The Gateway Experience) a shot. If anyone wants an online copy, check out the link below. I like to go to bed late at night and wake up early afternoon but I had classes this morning. Despite that, I still went to bed at like 2 AM and decided to give "Discovery Part 1 (orientation)" a whirl. I got pretty relaxed and de-stressed my joints with some stretching. When the guided part started I could feel things happening on cue with the instructions. My body got relaxed and numb and I started feeling vibrations. Then all of a sudden, I felt like I was spinning on an axis (like spinning in a chair except lying down). I could also hear some ringing as well. These feelings were so intense that I was actually afraid to open my eyes. My vision would also flash with light blue lights. Furthermore, the intensity was such that I could only register sensation from the neck up. I couldn't feel my body anymore. I didn't make any attempt to move so I don't know if what I experienced was sleep paralysis. At some point, these feelings subsided and I could feel everything again. I actually had to stop listening to the tape because my phone battery was getting low and I eventually went to sleep. I didn't experience any dreams that night but my body suffered the consequences of listening to that tape in the morning. I got up at 8:30 (so about 6 hours of sleep but that's not new for me) and I went to my college campus for my first class. As soon as I sat down, the room started throbbing and the ground felt like it was moving up and down (very similar symptoms when I took edibles one time). Yes, this could be a result of sleep deprivation but this has never happened to me on any other day when I slept the same amount of time. I had to prop my head up with my hand while at my table so that I would fall over or anything. It was an interesting experience and look forward to hearing the next part tonight.

I plan on posting more about my experience with these tapes and encouraging others to give them a listen too. FYI I am a beginner in this area so having that experience on the first night was pleasantly surprising!

Here is the link if anyone wants to try them as well: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F9uPNtUiL5UFhkiav\_ZrGLXlCJfapAqN?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F9uPNtUiL5UFhkiav_ZrGLXlCJfapAqN?usp=sharing)I got pulled into the astral from a lucid dream from a spiritual teacher

I was dreaming my usual reoccurring dream of my elementary school (not lucid yet) then out of no where I get a sign in the form of numbers which made me lucid instantly. I had the thought to immediately sit down and meditate. Out of no where this older women which I’ve never seen before spawns and I think she asked me if I wanted a past life reading. I say yes and she pulls me into the astral into this very cool room with no doors or windows.

The room was small cabin-like. It had spiritual decorations everywhere. She sits me down at the table and pulls out a globe. She asks me where I am from and I tell her but she doesn’t recognize the location. She asks me to write it down but I had a hard time spelling. Though she understood and started the reading. This is where memory gets fuzzy. All I remember is her saying my dad is very information-savy and I said yes I am too. Then she gets to my mom but then she disappears. I am left in the cabin alone so I check the place out. 

The things I noticed: a tv in front of my view from the chair with psychedelic imagery. The was a guitar on the ground and the strings were bundled. And a fireplace to the right. 

The reading was very short and didn’t really touch base on what she said. I think she got woken up.

While I was there I wanted to experiment with energy. I had thoughts of love and this pink mist came out of my breath. I did the same with fake angry thoughts and it turned out green and blue.

After checking the place out a bit I woke up and here I am now.I'm looking for ways to help people get in contact with the larger reality. I'm no master but I've had lucid dreams and astral projections for about 8 years. In that time I've gained some understanding of the workings especially with the help of Tom Campbell, auther of My Big TOE which I do recommend. I try to do the simplest explanation combined with specific help, to avoid long belief rants. I prefer answering questions to making guides or videos because that way it's more relevant to the asker.

It's been a long road from sleep paralysis to visits in other places and self discovery. It's a fascinating way to learn and getting an actual experience of the world being bigger than just what's at the end of my nose is indescribable.

If you want to asks questions in person and get some guided meditation I will do a free course on how to AP. It will be one and a half hour on the 2nd of May at 16.00 CEST (UTC +2) Other timezones: (7.00 am PDT, 10.00am EDT, 19.30 IST )It is free and has room for 25 people. Just send me a chat and I will sign you up. I use discord so joining is as easy as clicking a link.

Edit: Thank you for the questions, it's nice to get to talk about theese things :) The course is now full. I've answered messages and if you've heard from me you're in. If you didn't get here in time, don't worry I will probably do another one soon. If you send me chat I will put you on the list so you have the chance first next time :)

Edit2: Thank you so much for all the questions, it's been fun. I've spent a lot of time here today so I'll go off for now. I might pop in here later.

&#x200B;Or is that not a phase at all for the people who don’t have the classic “symptoms”?I purposely quit projecting 7 or 8 years ago but started journaling my more significant dreams and otherworldy experiences in the late 90's. I have 3 or 4 notebooks full at this point. My dreams have been much more important than any of my projections ever were. Several of them have proven precognitive. Several times I felt a pressure on my chest associate with ASP which caused me to gain consciousness in dreams only to realize that each time I was having an AP, and within 20 seconds of realizing it I would come back to my body. While lucid dreams are just surface dreams you generally have just before waking up and are mostly useless, I've come to believe that the deep and mysterious world of delta stage sleep where little to nothing is known, is where we've exteriorized from our body into another world. I believe we each do this every night but seldom gain awareness during the event, so we don't usually remember it. We probably aren't meant to, but they work some kind of good in us.

I've also learned that every book on dream analysis ever written is wrong. There are no universal symbols in them. A slice of cheese may mean something different to each of us. Actually, there was a Greek book written around Plato's time that said the same---that dream symbols are individual to each dreamer.

Lastly, if you haven't read "The Cream of the Jest" by James Branch Cabell, you should. Samuel Clemons was a big dreamer and this was his favorite novel. (Hint: it's more than a novel.)I've been reading on this sub for a few months now because I am actually interested in AP/Lucid Dreaming. But a lot of these topics sound like complete fiction to me lol. "I'm constantly being harassed by a cult when I AP" is something I read today, and to someone who never "AP'd", how does this not sound like made up shit? The more I read on this sub, the harder I find it to believe. This is not a hate thread, I am just curious on how you all think about this and how you believe itWhat is your opinion on where it fits into your belief system? Are your experiences any different to the norm you read about? Would appreciate answers ASAP. Thanks I  walk in the forest near a camping site I go to every summer.Then girl  in red sweater comes to me and we walk together.I had a feeling I know  her my whole life but I don't even know what's her name and where she  from.I asked her but got some weird answer.We were basically walking  around in summer with people.Playing pingpong, I even got pants from her  to cover my body from sun because it was very hot day and I could feel  I'm starting to burn my skin.We were in a shop the only one located  there very small but it was different now.

What  happened in the end was very interesting.We were sitting on the bench  and talking, I said to her that her polish language is getting better  because at first we were talking in english.She said she still has  problems with few words but its better.Then she suddenly had this moment  of realisation.She told me 4 people here are her friends but 2  different she doesn't know.She also told me how she got here."I got here  because you were looking for me so I got a "message" some kind of like a  light I think and then she was simply teleported to me.

So  she told me I was looking for her but I didn't know she existed... and  at the same time every moment walking with her even her simple touch on  my shoulder was like completely next level feeling, pure love that's all  I can tell, don't have better words to describe it..Today at 3:30pm EST I felt very tired.  Idea came to try OBE now, so I went with it.  I’ve always heard nap time is a great time to try!  I popped in earplugs.  No music of any kind.  Just silence.  Pictured myself going down an elevator w/ Robert Monroe, pressed “O” for OBE.  Went into a deep state, almost sleeping?  Repeated “I am more than my physical body” a lot &amp; “I’m going OOB now!”. I remembered I didn’t want to fall asleep.  Then pictured climbing rope, didn’t work.   As I said “I’m more than my physical body more &amp; more, faster and faster with more intensity” my body slightly started shaking. (First time!) Like felt like my bed was slowly shaking.  I think I became a little too aware and it all stopped.  

HOW do I keep increasing this vibrational stage so it becomes intense enough so I can then attempt to roll out of body or what not.

UPDATE:  I gotta say, I’m so happy with the feedback on this post.  It is QUALITY stuff.  You guys all made this post amazing.  THANK YOU for all the help!I just hit what I tried to for 10 months or likewise. After five or six experiences with OBE, usually ended way too early for no visualization/shock/lack of plans I hit the phase and managed to go through it. 18 pm, alone in the backseat; today afternoon there was a big sun -bigger than its usual- and the moon was shining in a bright pastel-like sky. Decided to get a projection. After some little techniques (the post-it way to stop the internal discourse, rubbing my astral hands feeling heat in my bodily ones -which I failed this time-, simulating movement. Reached the vibrations then went out raising my head and chest.

First things I got was the multi-dimensional floating. Could decide where to move even if couldn't control it very much. After trying to grab some violet smoke I got what I think that was a fake wake-up. Opened my eyes and back on projecting after some seconds. This time I managed "astral waves" way better, but ended up in the same situation. After another wake up -might be a real one because my phone got a message- I projected and heard voices -this might be a harsh story to tell but I won't because I should hear a doctor maybe- but then saw my grandma's living room. Zoomed with an impressive amount of details on a display cabinet filled with porcelain plates and crystal glasses, then into a statue of a black Holy Mary (my grandma is catholic, I'm an atheist even if I got both baptism and confirmation; I also have no way to feel agnostic at all). Suddenly heard a voice saying "if noone's watching for me I'll watch for everyone". This kinda hit me and I felt miniaturizing then I woke up. This time I didn't close my eyes and tried to project again. Got into the astral space but ended up visualizing bright light and nothing else.

&#x200B;

Someone wants to debate about my way of getting the phase? How can I accomplish more OBEs? What should this religious-non religious event mean? I dreamt of that black Holy Mary statue other times; it was 1:1 human dimensions and started moving during a procession.I have been reading a lot lately about AP and one thing that really stayed with me is this. They say that the place/s you're able to visit in the astral is a reflection of your level of spirituality. It has something to do with your chakras too. So for example, your root chakra is the energy center for safety. It's the chakra that needs to be balanced if you do not feel grounded or safe. So it's possible that when you AP and always end up in a place where you feel threatened or unsafe, you have to work on your root chakra. 

Where your astral body comes out from when you project also determines your most active chakra. For example, the first time I APd, i knew it was through my third eye chakra. I also felt scared not only because it was the first time but fear or intense fear is an indication of a blocked third eye. I also see indigos everywhere. Indigo is the color of third eye.

The third time I attempted to AP, i felt my astral body coming out through my heart chakra. So in my opinion, balancing our chakras is one of the most important things to do if we want to have a more positive AP experience. 

Of course, we all have different beliefs. This is just my take as lately, I can initiate AP best through meditation. Good luck, loves. May we reach the higher realms and meet higher level entities.I've only been having OBEs for four years but I've already learned things that some people who have been doing this for decades haven't learned.  One thing I've learned is that anything you can imagine exists somewhere in the astral.  And anything you can imagine you can create.  You can create entire planets if you want to.  But most people know that.  The weird stuff is where it gets interesting.  I had a few interesting lucid dreams recently where someone tried to overwrite my personality and another one where they tried to turn off my conscience.   Of course I didn't let them do either.  But it did teach me something.  That our personalities are just a program.  One that can be changed.  In the one where they tried to shut down my conscience this white yellow ball of energy appeared.  It was like it was made out of empathy.  And it caused me to feel more empathy for other people then I usually would.  So I learned that you can create weird constructs that influence people in weird ways.  A ball of empathy for example.  You can also create a ball of fear or of love.  Or a ball of energy that memory wipes people.  Of course it doesn't have to be a ball it can be shaped like anything.  I once manifested energy in my hands that memory wipes people.  So you can do all kinds of wild and crazy things.  You could do something really crazy and create an entire city that's made out of love.  Or a building where people become drunk as soon as they walk in the door.  You can do wild stuff like that over there.  A lot of dark astral worlds actually feel like they are made out of fear.  And So do some dark entities.  Speaking of entities a lot of them know how all of this works.   And they will to use this knowledge to mesmerize people or memory wipe them.  Fortunately the effects of these energy constructs are easy to block.  I once blocked a memory wipe for half an hour in a lucid dream.  So if someone tries to use this knowledge to influence you you can block it.  You can just simply use the intention that it has no effect on you and then it won't effect you anymore.  So knowing about all of this will help if you run into dark entities a lot.  So I've learned a lot by having OBEs.  Hopefully I'll learn even more in the future.  So let me know what you think and if you have experience any of these things.I've read a lot of posts regarding Hemi-Sync and the Gateway Experience program. This course has been a doorway for me personally. I struggled for many years to experience some of the incredible things I read about in books about psychic experiences, the vibrational state and astral projection. When I would practice the various techniques, I would lose my concentration or get too excited when I actually felt something start to happen. 

Shortly after beginning the Gateway Experience, things began to change. The once mystical experiences became common and normal. I began to feel more in control and aware. My "extra" senses began to awaken and sharpen. It was as if something dormant was finally given the opportunity to break free of my ego and fears of the unknown. It was liberating, empowering and exciting ... but not in a jump for joy kind of way ... it was more of a wave of calming confidence that didn't seem to leave. 

Not sure if it's been posted before ... but I wanted to share a link to the complete Gateway Experience course along with the instruction manual and two released documents that should provide quality information on the legitimacy of the program. 

From experience ... read the manual before starting the program. It will give you a good background of what to expect and there won't be any surprises along the way. It will also put you in the right headspace while you listen and participate in the various lessons. Don't rush through the lessons. I would do each lesson at least 3 or 4 times before going on to the next one. Savor these experiences. Write down what you experienced after each one. Even if nothing life altering happened, jot down the random thoughts and feelings that you had. 

Best Energies and Enjoy!

&#x200B;I know of people whose souls originate from lower planes. Demons, feral beings, shady people, you know what I'm talking about.. I've been around them for too long and they sucked pretty much all of my energy out of me, I trusted one too much and he placed a hand on my forehead for a minute and I still have no idea what he actually did, only thing I know that his behavior was IDENTICAL to the shadowy beings from the lower planes, to scare you and munch on your tasty fears.

I'm starting to have answers to my question slowly but surely though.. The guy claims to be an oracle, he foretold me a death at a young age (Also interesting thing is that his answer was pretty irrelevant to my question), then he placed his palm on my forehead and told me he gave me additional 15 years but I won't be successful in my life for such price, I call nonsense at this point.. If there's an option of giving one's life force, it has to be a ritual way more complex, yet I'm wondering what he did to me, I'm betting the bastard had his dinner.

At that time I was very weak and filled with so much fear that you could feed a whole lower astral plane with it, it was a horrible year for me and many bad things happened. I took a hit so hard that getting hit by a truck is like bumping into a pillow compared to this.

Oh and there is also a second guy I know for some time now who claims to be a "demonic" being in his nature, and high-ranking at that, he is also an astral traveler, he claims he went through many astral battles too in his previous forms and I honestly believe that. He offered help and I foolishly accepted, he granted me some of his energy, it actually felt quite amazing for a while, he also told me we'll meet and we'll cooperate in the ether after we pass away, but you know, *demonic beings*, and you know what's funny? My soul was screaming all the time at me to avoid these people. I was a fool number one at that time, gods I was so stupid...

I know that not all demonic beings are bad, in fact more than half are neutral or even fun people, but it's complicated even more than a teenage relationship at this point.

When I start to talk about this, I'm shaking uncontrollably, I need my answers, I've picked AP to find them, yet someone here can also help me, so I'm asking everyone, what's your opinion on this? Have you met such people and had similar experiences? This is very important to me.

Thanks in advance everyone!

EDIT: I also forgot to say the second guy said he granted the first guy a life force of 50 YEARS (which sounds like an absolute bollocks, but they must've done some kind of pact of interconnecting souls or something and oh shit, if they glued onto my soul and are constantly feeding off of it, that's a scenario worth a scream.) makes my head spin 'round, giving the idea that the first guy is more of a demonic being also and they cooperate on searching for a meal filled with the fear of unlucky souls.I'm an 18-year-old guy and my 89 year old grandma who lived with us my whole life died this morning from her bladder infection she'd been fighting for 3 days now. As I left for work in the morning I saw her alive, only to be called by my brother driving to work that she died right after.  


I came home and looked at my grandmas body on her sofa as we waited like 4 hours for the morgue to come get her. And throughout that I couldn't shake these dark thoughts in me, has my grandma really passed onto an afterlife... or is she not my grandma anymore and is gone for good. Lights out, nothing but darkness and unconsciousness for her.  


I'm a natural skeptic and although I've had a few experiences of what I'd call semi projections, where what happened to me felt like I had astral projected for a few seconds I've never really had a walk around experience, I've tried super hard but nothing. And I've never had any solid evidence in my mind that an afterlife or anything like that would exist, science being the only thing that'd make sense to me.   


All-day I've been torturing myself in the head by thinking how my beloved grandma no longer exists ever again, I will get to that point too, and my amazing girlfriend will end existence too. I really want to believe in an afterlife but I just don't see how it could possibly exist. And the only reason I'm saying anything in this subreddit specifically is because I know a handful of you claim to visit and witness the astral realm first hand several times, which would be undisputable proof to me to astral travel for several minutes.  


But at the end of the day, my skepticism eats me alive and makes me think you guys might be all lying to me. Or this is some secret inside joke/roleplay. And including the fact that we have tons of logic and reasoning that an afterlife wouldn't make sense.   


 I desperately need some wisdom, insight, advice, anything to make me see clearly that there is more than this world. It's making me have dark thoughts to think that our lives are just a one time play. This is the best astral related discord out there. Just the other day there was a huge voice chat with AP experts answering questions. We even had rick from astral club on here, and we are planning on getting Ryan Cropper to join, and I don't think you wanna miss that! This server is definitely the most wholesome server I've ever been a part of. Feel free to come and chat!

[https://discord.gg/PYmWjXfkH2](https://discord.gg/PYmWjXfkH2)

ps: there were some people who were banned on the server, and they are very salty about it so they will probably comment on this post about how bad the server is, just know that isn't true :)What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that everything is really one consciousness experiencing itself from different points of view.  Let's say you are the one consciousness and there is nothing else.   So you split your awareness so that you are in two places at once.  Your still one person it's just that your in two places.  Then let's say you memory wipe one part of yourself so that it doesn't remember that it is you.  Then it just became a separate individual.  The other you still remembers that it is you but it doesn't.  Then if the other you memory wipes itself and doesn't remember it's a your the same person you both become separate individuals.  So then the fragments of the one consciousness go on to create their own worlds.  And that is how everything is really one consciousness.i was taking a nap like i typically do many afternoons on my day off. and then i woke up from my nap and started going back to sleep when i felt the falling sensation. and then i found myself flying through stars and dimensions and ended up in a dark open space where there was a comforting old man voice that asked “have you ever been to space?” i replied “is this space?” and then i was catapulted into many more areas and universes. there was a moment where i thought my sister was under my bed trying to find something and she walked away with a cheerleading outfit in her hand. i eventually woke up and had no clue what the fuck happened so i googled it and found this subreddit. definitely the most beautiful experience i have had. thought i would share. i had never heard of astral projection but now i am very interested.Has anybody had any interesting experiences with the moon while astral projecting? 

Just a quick rundown of what I recently saw.

The Apollo 11 landing site - This was neat to see. The landing module, the flag, Neil and Buzz's boot prints. It was all there.

Some sort of moon base - I have heard the conspiracies, but am a tad bit skeptical about them. As I approached, I was redirected to my next sight.

A massive geode-like structure that contained large emeralds and rubies - I double-checked to make sure I was still on the moon and I was. This was probably some sort of manifestation.

A very tall hill - This possibly led to the base I saw earlier, or it was the edge of a crater. Either way, I started to feel really uncomfortable climbing this hill so I decided to end my experience after returning to Earth and doing some quick exploring.Do you know if this has ever been attempted?I'm happy to share the whole experience in more detail and a following experience I believe is related to some reprocussions from doing what I didEvery night, my soul separates from my body while I'm sleeping. I don't do this intentionally. I feel immense high frequency vibrations on a cellular level and then suddenly I'm in a different world. I'm laying in my bed, and I sit up and I look behind me, there I am. Theres my bf. Last night was the scariest time. Every other time, I can normally snap out of it by laying back down and I jolt myself once or twice and I can usually get out of it right away. 
Last night, I tried for over an hour. I was scared. I screamed at my bf to wake me up but nobody could hear me. I tried shaking him but I wasn't able to in that dimension. I felt my bodys arm and it felt stiff and it scared me. Looking at myself sleeping was a mind fuck. I kept trying and trying to wake myself up but it wasn't working. The normal jolt I do would allow me to go back into my body for a split second I would struggle opening my eyes, they felt like heavy metal doors I had to struggle to push open, and then I would lose against the pressure and be back in the other dimension. I was hysterical. I had thought that maybe I died. Or I was in a coma, I felt as though I would be stuck there forever. I finally succumbed to it. I layed back down into my body and closed my eyes. I remember vibrating at a seriously crazy frequency every time I tried to wake up. So I just stopped. It was sort of painful, but mostly just scary. This happens almost every night. But never for this long. I just wanted to share my story. And maybe hear if anyone else deals with this on a nightly basis.I'm specifically wondering about cats, but I'm also curious about other animals.-- EDIT: This A.M.A. is closed. New questions won't be answered. --

I have been APing for a few years now, and love to help others astral project, so I am willing to answer your questions if you have any. Feel free to ask!like 2 minutes ago I started separating from my body and my room looked exactly like normal. my view however was of course a lot higher than where my eyes were (my body obvi laying on my bed). as I was using my will to float out, i watched my painting fall and this startled me and I IMMEDIATELY went back into my body and my eyes opened and saw it hit the ground. It looks like the thumbtack I used didn’t have enough strength but besides the point lol. This was so instantaneous that i saw the painting fall and make a noise from it hitting my dresser, then going back into my body and opening my eyes and seeing it go from hitting the dresser to the floor. This was a very interesting experience that just happened not even 3 minutes ago. I’ve been aware of the reality of astral projection for a while but having limited experience really emphasizes the “freakiness” of when I experience things like this that kind of prove it to myself.

EDIT: corrected a mis-wording, I didn’t watch my eyes open, my eyes opened as I was back in my bodyLike to suss out government conspiracies or Area 51? Or you know, AP to neighbours bedroom to check out the naked goods? Or to do a break in and rob someone?

I AP'd as a kid but dont anymore. But for the time I've been on this sub havent come across questions like these so here they are lol

Edit - LOVING these answers! Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences in detail 🤗I never doubted or anything, it's just that I never thought it'd happen to me.

I've constantly had sleep paralysis when I sleep with my belly up. Today I was so tired and stressed I ended up sleeping face up again probably while I was moving in bed. Started dreaming about playing a game on my computer but I was feeling my mouse for real so I kinda woke up within the dream to move my hand a bit and see if I REALLY felt it and I did, went kinda wtf man how did I get my mouse in bed and opened my eyes and saw myself sleeping. I saw myself from up close, like somewhere up close to my belly but more up, I saw my left arm was over my forehead and I was also feeling that at the time, plus I recognized myself after a bit so I was sure it was me and not a dream.  After recognizing myself I closed my eyes because I was trying to figure out how I managed to look at myself when there's no mirrors in my room. Tried moving and didn't work, still with my eyes closed so I got kinda desperate but managed to calm down a few seconds later and wake up normally. Slept very calmly afterwards, I was having some real trouble sleeping tonight.Reading this sub, I think that a lot of us have been doing it without realizing it. I saw this on a French forum. I'm not doing and never done drugs, booze or anything, so you won't need anything at all to try it out.

The exercise is simple and can be done at this very instant: turn your consciousness to itself. Usually, our consciousness is always focusing on our body senses, whether it's the sight, the smell, or just our hearing, we always focus on them, but we don't usually focus on what's focusing on them: our consciousness.



If done right, it feels like a mindfuck, it even... tickle my mind a bit? It's feel like an infinite loop, it's very strange! It's a bit like a dog chasing its own tail.

Extra:

I'm using this method to avoid phosphenes (these lights that you see when you close your eyes when you go to bed). I've noticed that phosphenes are deceptive: they look like cool sphere but will eventually shift into a random imaginary and make you drift to sleep. I've noticed that I can do WILD induced lucid dream easier while using the little exercise above. It has a lot of potential that I'm eager to discover, I also felt vibrations ridiculously fast yesterday night, but I'm a coward, so I only project from my lucid dreams.My question is, how do i let myself succumb to these more intense experiences outside of my comfort zone?

Was doing my usual AP technique and then suddenly a deep resounding OM sound could be heard and it was vibrating my whole body. This golden line art appearance of buddhas head appeared and the sound got so loud it felt like a physical force. I then felt my spirit begin to descend into the earth like I was being carried somewhere. The sound and the carrying/descending sensation was so intense I was shaken back into my body. 

Btw I am not buddhist but have been looking for a religion to practice/ for some deity to welcome me to pray to them. 

Im asking because it really did feel like i was free falling. felt kinda cool though and was wondering this is how its done correctly....what happens if i go in deep for long periods of time?Moments ago marks the first time I have ever astral projected. It was probably the most intense experience I have ever had without the use of substances.

I started by accidentally waking myself up around 5 am. At this point I was exhausted and started to fall back asleep, somehow unconsciously I decided to practice astral projection. To my surprise it worked, really really well.

The first thing I started to sense was my body was vibrating almost violently, it was odd how “real” this felt. Soon after that I started seeing an outline of a very basic looking house. As of now I started to picture a rope above me so I could climb out of my physical body.

As soon as I climbed out the true visuals began. I was in my bedroom but it also wasn’t my bedroom, at least not in my reality. My wife was still by my side, but on her side of the wall (normally where a window is) there was a giant screen taking up the entire wall.

On the screen there was this animation of a cartoon woman and her cat exploding and then forming back into one piece over and over again. I definitely could feel myself move around my room but I felt very restricted to a small space, almost like sleep paralysis.

After what felt like no time at all I decided it was getting too intense for me and tried to “wake up”. The visuals started faded and faster and faster I could move my body. Suddenly I returned to my room and immediately made this post.

In conclusion my thoughts on this are that to me it felt like a very intense lucid dream, one where I feel extremely present. Definitely wanna try this again.

TLDR; I finally astral projected and it was nuts!since I can remember, I've had intense vivid lucid dreams and astral projections to the point of annoyance. for example, when I was 5-9 years old I'd have to get up in the middle of the night to pee and I'd accidentally AP to the bathroom, then wake up for real and then have to get up again and go to the bathroom. it was super disorienting and scary at the time. 
I've also had those types of dream/AP experiences where you're trying to wake up, but you just wake up in another dream and get stuck in a time loop of waking up over and over again. 

if I'm not accidentally projecting or having some strange dream, its always something else, like having sleep paralysis and seeing my dad in the corner of my room spinning around in circles in what looks like some sort of psychosis (disturbing, I know, but I'm used to that kind of thing), and recently I've had quite a few experiences where I'm trying to sleep and something else is trying to pull me out of my body and into the astral realm.

the thing is I've just had so many weird AP experiences and vivid dreams that I kinda just want them to stop and to sleep well, but nothing seems to make my vivid dreams/AP experiences disappear. melatonin pills increase these experiences. I have a happy and active lifestyle, I eat well, and I'm exhausted when I go to sleep. I'm a medical cannabis user and I noticed smoking before bed makes my dream 
/AP experiences more positive, but never makes them fully go away. 
any tips? if I can't stop accidentally projecting, is there anything I can do to have a more peaceful and positive experience?If I did astral sex first and never had real sex did I lose my virginity?My mom astral projected a few times and always told me she would visit “the sky” because she liked the view. I always wondered if anyone used it for peeping into famous people’s lives.[Here’s the OG post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/gngsuu/i_finally_get_it_but_god_damn_was_the_timing_weird/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


Howdy friends. So after hearing all your encouraging comments, I was determined as all hell to astral project, and not get super distracted by any Latinx 90’s songs, no matter how dope they sound. 

Shit was just not working for me though. I listened to meditation stuff, I tried lying on my back and meditating, I tried inducing sleep paralysis. Nothing helped. I felt like I let you guys down. It was getting kinda bleak. 

But then, lo and behold, a random dude from Tinder saved the day. Yes, that shitty hookup/dating app, Tinder. 

Oliver and I matched and it was about 4 am, and I was bored. So I decided to bring up my little experience. HOMEBOY ENDED UP BEING QUITE INTRIGUED. as I was slowly passing out, we solely discussed all the details behind how I ended up projecting and the feelings behind sleep paralysis, etc etc. 

Eventually I was too tired to text, and then, while I was still awake, I started hearing something. It sounded like...kind of like someone playing really weird chords on a keyboard. There was a lot of dissonance to it. And while that was playing, the vibrations began, the same ones as before, and I knew exactly what was happening. 

I wasn’t lying on my back, but I could feel my not-limbs twisting so that when I looked up I was facing the ceiling. I floated upward but somehow, phasing through the ceiling seemed like a weird concept, so I opted for a window. 

The whole time I felt excited, but kind of lonely, like I felt bad that my body was missing out and just lying there on my bed. 

I went through the window and it felt so cold. As I was going through I saw my cat moving to sleep next to my body. I also, let me know if this is weird, I saw things in my room. Like 2 things. They felt like they were alive. They moved around, they didn’t seem evil, just kind of weird, like they weren’t where they were supposed to be. Or they were just visiting. It felt like they belonged on a TV show and not in my room by my bed. 

They waved to me as I went outside. I didn’t really do much, I’ll be real, just kinda floated around the roof of my house, looking around. 

Eventually I went back, but I didn’t snap back like I did before, I kind of nestled in limb by limb, before fully going back. While I was going into my body the music was playing again. I don’t know if it was actually music, but it certainly sounded like it came from a keyboard.  IM PRETTY FUCKING SURE THIS IS WHY I WANTED TO PLAY SOME MUSIC LAST TIME, GUYS. Astral music simply does not slap.

Then I woke up, for a minute before falling asleep for real. I noticed this last time and this time as well. When I fall asleep after experiencing astral projection, I always manage to achieve lucid dreaming. It’s not projecting, it doesnt feel the same at all, but I’m very aware of the fact that I’m dreaming as opposed to when I just fall asleep. Does anyone experience that at all? 

Anyway, now I’m here. Gonna go thank that Tinder dude for....idk...helping me out with my astral shit?Anyone else just find it soo crazy that there are so many different "realities" just on Earth? For example, I went on WoW for the first time in many months, and the community was very very toxic. The things people said was so hateful, sexist, racist, and "low vibration" and it actually made me feel negative for awhile after. On the other hand, I go on twitter, and the community there is so liberal, to the point of too liberal haha. Maybe the completely opposite of the WoW community, on the opposite extreme radical side. On the other hand, if you go outside and talk to people in real life (not internet) it is very peaceful generally. If you go to a spiritual group like this astral projection group it is so open minded and you'd never see anything from WoW said here. The community focuses on making themselves better and exploring consciousness - completely unlike other communities. I am listening to some Monroe Institute music ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Tr46TX-CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Tr46TX-CE)), and it just makes me feel so happy. It is so weird, how communities in this world are so so so different. Just thoughts I wanted to write - bored in quarantine and procrastinating my finals.I had a weird experience one day. I realised I was projected beside my body at home. I decided to walk around my house. I went into the living room. I decided to try and read a book. When I thougt of that, a very big, leather bound book appeared on the table. As I was reaching for the book, out of nowhere appeared a guy who shouted at me not to read it. He was dressed im black "tactical" clothes, like some spec ops guy, cargo pants, a  tactical vest, a black turtleneck blouse under it. He had gray hair, almost white, combed to the side. One of his eyes was red, like a laser, and was wearing an eye apparatus kind of like the ones used on Dragon Ball. The shape was different, just the thing was used in one eye, just like in DBZ.
He started to chase me, and I ran from him. I teleported around my house and he followed me. I tried using energy blasts against him, but it came out very weak. Eventually, he caught up to me, touched my forehead and I woke up. Has anyone ever had a similar experience, or met a similar character? Or maybe an idea of what could the book be?When I project, I go "home".  Sure, I've been other places.  But, "home" is somewhere I don't know in the 3d, it's more of a feeling of being complete. 

Does anyone else get this?There’s a giant oak tree in the yard of my childhood home (where my family has lived for over 100 years and my parents still live). This tree is so incredible. Every time I stand under it I am in awe. I call it our Mother Tree. I’ve been trying to visit her in the astral for quite a while because I feel as though she has something to tell me. The first time I managed to AP to her, I flew from down over top of the tree and saw it from an aerial view. The bark looked so smooth and I touched it just briefly. That AP ended there. The last time I AP’ed to the tree (just a week ago), I wasn’t able to get close to it but I stood on the ground and from a distance I could see it. The tree was smooth and a bright gold color. In the trunk I clearly saw the face of an old woman who appeared to have a shawl over her head. As I looked at her, I felt so calm and peaceful. I was pulled back to my body at this point. I feel so excited to have seen the face of Mother Tree and trust that I’ll be able to talk to her when it’s the right time.Long post! 
A few years back, the combination of psychedelics and therapy had done wonders for my mental state and I was keen to try again. 
As I was making breakfast one morning, I found the smallest shroom in an odd spot. I decided to take that as a sign. 
My partner had 2.5 grams and I had 3 as I wanted to dig a bit deeper. My intention was to meditate on them as I read reports from peeps and was keen to give it a go. The come up was a bit rocky but we made it! 
We were at home chilling, listening to tunes with our pets. The sun was shining and we felt at peace. 
I was on the couch for ages, just starring at the wall which was fully covered of rainbow coloured patterns. The patterns would twirl in the air, come very close to my face at times which was so delightful. 
Time seemed to have slowed down, I was enjoying the music so much. 
I eventually got up and started patting our dog and cat and tears were freely flowing. I was so damn grateful for my life, how lucky I was to be safe and loved. 
I kept crying happy tears and I swear, pets know when you’re high! Our furry kids were extra loving and I felt the most beautiful connection uniting all of us. 

After a couple of hours, we ventured out for a walk. The weather wasn’t ideal but we plonked on a hill overlooking the city. Stayed there for a while watching the world go by and getting lost in the clouds. 
When we got back home, I felt the urge to meditate: I was ready. I went to bed, lied under the quilt in total darkness, I was so comfortable. 
Instead of a meditation, I put on a one hour astral projection session from insight timer (great app that has around 10,000 free meditations, would highly recommend!). The recording had the smoothest voice paired with binaural beats.
As it started, I felt my body relaxing like never before. I was made of clay all of a sudden. I then felt the biggest balls of energies in both hands, as if there were unreleased strong magnetic fields coming out of them.  

I travelled through time: I saw some past traumatic events but seeing them didn’t hurt me. I saw the future, and I also saw some moments of my past lives. I was a musician once and could hear myself playing violin in an excruciatingly beautiful way. 
I felt wings carrying me through eternity. I remembered that I was an angel and was on earth this time to accomplish a mission. 
My uncle (dad’s side, passed away a while ago now), whom I loved so dearly, was with me. He showed me moments of his life. He used to be a crane operator; he showed me the world from his cabin, it was mind blowing!
My brother was there too and we travelled for a bit. Both my uncle and brother showed me sides of my dad that I didn’t know… I felt my anger towards him melting as I was able to understand why he was the way he was for the 1st time in my life. I saw the awful childhood he had and felt pain for him. 

Sometimes I would hold my breath because I was so blown away but I’d then hear a nice soft voice reminding me to breath. When I did, it felt like when you’re trying to adjust your buoyancy while diving: I went up and down until I mastered it to float. 
I swear I had wings that I felt in my back! I was already blown away by the experience but its ending was the cherry on top! 
When the hour was coming to an end, I felt the biggest magnetic pull in my neck area. Muscles I didn’t even know I had in my neck were cramping one by one (it didn’t hurt) and it kept pulling something out of my head (can’t describe it better, sorry).
I understood that it was all the trauma that I had been carrying with me over the years being released. I also understood that all the dental problems I experienced in the last 2 years were due to stagnating negative energies. I was being freed from them.

When I came back to reality, my body was the most relaxed it has EVER been. As if I went through the toxin remover machine from Rick and Morty. I don’t know if getting pampered at the most expensive spa can get you to feel this way tbh.
I was so shocked, I didn’t think we could ever be so relaxed and at peace. I felt joy like never before! I could still feel the energy centres on my hands after a couple of days. I was also in a total bliss state for days! 

The following day, as I was using my hair straightener, it blew… not even kidding. 
I now feel the ball of energies (apparently we have minor chakras there) in my hands every time I meditate. 
I had this experience 2 months ago and had been asked to share it with as many people I can.
I had been too lazy to type it until I was reminded to do so whilst meditating today, so here I am. 
This experience is about healing and reconnecting with our divine nature at a time so determining to our future as a species. I am not trying to achieve anything here but to do what was asked of me.
Thanks for reading this fam. I’ve attached the link to the astral projection so you can try for yourself. 
This experience has changed my life in a way I can’t even start to describe. 
I hope you can experience it too and report back, I’d love to hear your experience.
Safe travels fam and take care 🙏🏽

Thanks for the award and for your support fam! Much love 💗Here's a 10-step technique for Astral projection. Remember, this is not the only way you can do it, it’s just a generalised approach which can work for anyone, if it doesn’t work for you or you don’t like it, then modify it or find a different way:

1. Go to sleep as you normally would, don’t worry about anything, be totally relaxed.
2. Wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep.
3. Get up out of bed and go to sit in a chair in a dark room.
4. Center yourself, clear your mind and get in touch with your senses. Touch things, look at objects in the room, listen to any noises, or notice the silence, breathe and relax.
5. Affirm to yourself repeatedly, “I will leave my body during sleep”. Begin to feel anticipation, or intention, that you are going to become conscious while you sleep. Trust that this will happen, be free from doubt. Rest in this feeling for a few minutes while remaining aware of your surroundings - make sure you stay in a “drowsy/sleepy” state so that you can easily go back to sleep soon.
6. Go and lay back down comfortably in bed. Notice how your bed feels, enjoy the sensation of relaxation as you go back to sleep. Smile a bit, there's nothing to worry about.
7. As you surrender to the trance and 'comatose' quality of sleep, affirm to yourself lethargically, “I will leave my body”.
8. When you fall to sleep, or at any point during the rest of your sleep, you may begin to feel intense vibrations or you may hear extrasensory sounds or see things in your vision. **Do not** become overwhelmed or begin to think about them; stay in your sluggish state and just allow them to be. By giving them attention, they will grow. As they intensify, everything will come to a peak and you’ll begin to feel a sensation of energy throughout your body: this is not your physical body, this is your energy body - your Astral body. Get comfortable with this sensation: through it you'll be able to use it to separate from your physical body. There's no need to overthink exiting the body; simply float up or just get up as you usually would, your physical body will stay in bed.
9. Repeat step 4: Just as you grounded yourself in physical reality in step 4, do the same once you're out of body. You will notice in a startling way just how alive and solid the Astral plane really is, and if you really concentrate, you'll also notice it doesn't respond to your thoughts or subconscious.
10. Explore, investigate, learn.

**Note:** a side-effect of this practice is that after step 7, instead of waking up into an OBE at some point during your sleep, you may end up having a lucid dream instead. If you do, simply follow the instructions [here](https://youtu.be/phK2E9WQQug).

**Important:** Do not put conditions on this practice. In other words; don't let your mind say, "If nothing happens I'll be angry or upset". Instead, just simply keep practicing. Nothing great is ever achieved without practice. As long as you're alive, you can always practice. Every failure is a step to success.

This 10-step guide is a more clarified version of the one I gave [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M1q8svDEOA&t=3745s).I was on another planet called Angora.I was living on 260st floor with my girlfriend.I got informations from her I am tatoo artist there doing special offers for big money.

Infront of my place there is another scyscraper with cross made of white glass.

I met people there, poor people, they didn't have money to buy a ticket to get somewhere and I started asking how much it costs how it works and that made them interested.I gave my sandwitch to an older wonan standing next to me and she called me a good boy.

When I looked into the sky I could see many stars, way more than you can see on earth.The momeng I looked into the sky I saw pink clouds forming butterflys and  stars connecting and creating lots of symbols.I thought I died because feeling and sight was very beautiful.Fortunately people there told me I'm on a planet called Angora or Agora.

In my head somehow I had an imagination of planet without poor people but people I talked with told me it's the way I see it.

I also had a vision where policelike people were picking money from the street and burrying it under sand.I make binaural beat mp3s (strictly tones, no background noise) in my spare time once in a while. If anyone is interested, I could easily email you a copy. 

I have delta, gamma, theta, alpha and beta frequencies, all around the 100hz marker. (Ie. Delta waves of 2.5hz at 100hz left ear and 102.5hz right ear)

If anyone is interested, send me a message with your email and I can send you I believe two beats in one email. So tell me which waves you'd like, and I'll send em your way as file attachments in an email. Or a different way if anyone knows a better one. I'm tech savvy in music (ish) but not many other areas of computers 

I've put them to 5 min 30 sec so that they're small enough files to send in email. They say 15-20 min is needed to notice benefits so I typically put the track on repeat and listen for half hour or so.Hello Everyone, 

I do not know if anyone knows anything about this, but I am wondering if anyone has a guide to astral/interdimensional entities/beings, species, and gods/things who are worshipped (who they are, how they interact with humans, low/high vibrational, their purpose, some tips when interacting with these entities...). I have only been able to find entity descriptions on a bunch of different websites but they do not go into detail (and basically say the same thing). I know that it will be extremely helpful for astral travelers to read over.

If anyone has some information, about a guidebook and just your experiences with certain entities, please write them in the comments! Or if someone is creating a guide, post it!

Edit: I did not realize the world ‘entity’ had a negative connotation, so i changed it to entity/beingsI've been trying for around a year to have an obe but I've never been successful from a fully awake state, so eventually, I gave up. I kept having vibrations at midnight but never wanted to commit to it because it was way too intense, but today I got vibrations in the morning after I kept waking up and going back to bed into dreams. 

I focused on the vibrations and used my hands and pushed me off my bed thinking I failed but turns out I didn't. 

The first thing I did was try to make the projection clearer which did not work so then I thought I needed to commit to making sure it was real so I ran and dived and phased thru my window into a tuck n roll in my backyard after that I saw my backyard then woke up. 

Right after I woke up I closed my eyes and got vibrations again and exited my body again I could not see my body as it was too blurry in the projection. I tried to summon people like I would in a lucid dream I feel like it half worked. So then I tried to communicate with extraterrestrial but since the projection was too unstable I woke up and was really happy. 

Next time I will try to project when I get vibrations at midnight.

I'm still not completely sure if it was a projection or just a lucid dream but I'm optimistic and really felt like it was real as it kind of ticked all the boxes of a ap.Hey all,

I’ve been attempting Astral Projection for a little over a year now, and this morning, I felt myself separate from my body for the first time! 

I was laying in bed at around 11AM, and was having one of those dreams where you are more so watching it than actively partaking in it, if that makes any sense. I got bored with watching the dream so I woke myself up, and realized that if I stayed still, I could induce the vibrations, as I have done upon waking up several times before. 

No vibrations came this time, so I visualized myself climbing up a rope. This method usually does not give me any results, but just when I had nearly given up, I tugged on the rope and felt part of my body come up with the rope! I kept pulling until I could feel myself mostly standing up, but I couldn’t see very well, and I eventually snapped back into my physical body. Still one of the most amazing experiences I’ve ever felt, and can’t wait to try again!Hello guys, this is my first post in this sub. 


I'm here to share my experience(s) and thoughts with you in order to help you achieve these states. 

First of all my interest in astral projection was what really got me into meditation.

There were periods where I was meditating (trying to ap) for up to 3 hours a day.

This skyrocketed my awareness / meditation level to a point where I was so used to it, I got into deep states after half a minute of meditating.

- Meditation is the most important aspect imo

My first months of trying to AP were not successful.

Until this one afternoon. I was meditating(laying on my back in my bed) for around 2 hours with binaural beats, that I got really tired and sleepy so I put my headphones away, turned my body to a comfortable sleeping position(was laying on my stomach, legs crossed, one arm under my head).

- Your body has to be in this tired/sleepy state in order to get into these deep states where AP is possible

After being in this comfortable sleeping position there was this one moment where my awareness suddenly shifted from tired/dizzy to ultra aware and awake.

Suddenly my body began vibrating and I heard this intense ringing in my ears. This state is very uncomfortable the first times and probably the point where many people end their attempts. 

- This feeling is very strange at the beginning and many will cancel their practice. It is important to not be afraid and to flow with it. 

Suddenly I was pulled out of by back (remember I was laying on my stomach).

That moment is indescribable. It was such an intense, otherworldly feeling where I could no longer doubt it. Even though I had no vision (everything was dark) I knew that I am no longer in my physical body.

After the slightest feeling of fear (because I had no vision) I immediately got sucked back into my body. Again same indescribable feeling. It was like a super giant arm was dragging my astral body back to my room (horizontal direction) until I got moved down to my physical body (vertical direction).

- Any negative thought or feeling can easily end this journey so it is important to not be afraid of anything

The moment I got back into my body I felt this intense pain-like stitch in my solar plexus, which felt like the opening that my astral body moved through.


After this experience I had a few other experiences that all had some things in common.
Let me know if you want to hear more.

Thank you for reading!Going to give you guys some short insight to help you in your Astral Travels. 

Meditation is an amazing tool for training the mind and it is much easier to do than people make it. In order to achieve the peace of mind and state of consciousness required for astral projection you need a daily meditation schedule.

Before I go on to instructions on how and what type of meditation to use first let me try and convince you why meditation can and will certainly help you in achieving Astral Projection to begin with.

Astral Projection requieres a heightened state of awareness or at least a much higher state than the one we typically have in our day to day lives. When you meditate everyday you are basically training unconscious systems in your brain to stop competing for energy and attention and makes them work together to achieve an unfiltered state of conscious awareness in which reality is seen by what it is rather than the eyes of our monkey brain. Your goal is to harmonize the systems in your brain so there is no internal conflict between them.

Now how can this help you astral project?

Well, AP is a physical process. It's not another "realm" or detaching the body however much it seems like it is. Instead it is using the minds built in ability for "intuition". Intuition is a very powerful biological system our brain developed because it was extremely efficient and successfully on keeping us humans alive so it kept evolving into what it is today. Back then intuition was was used for "oh there might be a lion behind that bush, better not get close to there" all the way to being able to see and/or sense something you have no immediate acces to. It has evolved to the point where it can connect to the unity of quiet consciousness where all information exists.

Also try and understand how EVERYTHING is a conscious agent of different complexities. This is why when astral projecting everything from surfaces to even the air seems to glow as if it where alive because they are. And if everything is consciousness then that means you are also part of this cosmic consciousness. And you can tap into that flow of information with the mere act of observation, a high state of conscious awareness and some good intent.

And how do you get a high state of conscious awareness?
 
Bingo! Through meditation. Obviously meditation is not the only way to train awareness and it is not a must. You can train with only the intent to astral project everyday and after a couple of years you should be able to achieve it. But meditation not only shortens this process but also helps you overcome big obstacles that a lot of AP students just can't overcome.

How do you meditate?

Firstly you need a daily practice. This first step is the hardest but after you got a daily practice the steps will be easier. In order to build a daily practice you gotta make meditation a habit just like brushing your teeth, so let's make the practice easy and short just so that you build that habbit. On the first month start with 5 minutes everyday and work yourself up to 25 minutes.  

Secondly, observe the breath. As you sit quietly feel the physical sensation of the breath going in and out. When the mind wonders from the breath remind yourself what you are doing and go back to the breath. In the begining it will be hard but your are training yourself! Remember that just like anything else or like the guitar, the first time you hold the guitar you won't be able to make even the simplest of chords but after some effort and daily practice you will be able to play like Jimmy Hendrix in no time.... Well maybe not like him but close enough!

When you remind yourself that you have forgotten the breath slowly go back into observing the "sensation" of the breath in the nose. And don't get angry at yourself when you forget. instead use positive reinforcement to train yourself to not forget the breath. Tell yourself "good job" everytime you remember the breath.

Within 3-4 months of daily practice your brain should be trained to the point where you can observe the breath with no distractions or forgetting the breath for at least 25 minutes with little interruptions. When you get to this level you are far from a meditation expert but strong enough in meditation to properly use your ability to Astral Project.

I would even recommend stopping your AP practice until you are somewhat experienced with meditation or at least try implementing meditation on top of your AP practices. 

Lastly enjoy the process!! You have to "learn" to enjoy it. Concentrate on the pleasurable sensations and vibrations in your body. Concentrate on these feelings and with time your body and mind will be in a constant state of joy while meditating.

Going in-depth into the art of meditation will take to much time. I recommend the book "The Mind Illuminated" by Dr John Yates were he goes step by step on how to meditate and gives you a training manual with stages to master one by one all the way to stage 10. 

Also please give me your feedback. I love hearing what other people have to say and what works for them and their honest thoughts on my theory. All the information in this post comes from years of insights through meditation, books and lots of research on the brain and consciousness.

 There is no one thing or rule that works for everybody. Learn what works for you. Meditation makes you know yourself better and because you then know yourself better you learn to do what's best for you and for your goals.Was trying to AP last night and about to hit the vibrational stage when a bunch of dirty, oily booty thoughts went inside my head, at that same moment I felt something slap across my backside as if to say, "hey we're not doing that here" I chuckled a bit. That was interesting.In the middle of my sleep, I found myself spontaneously standing in the middle of a large field next to my house where I was sleeping. I knew immediately I was out of body. There was no transition of awareness from my sleep or dreaming state; I just found myself there being conscious and *knew* I was in the astral. I could tell from the deep sense of knowing, but also from the familiar mystical atmosphere that pleasant dimensions in the astral usually hold, and this particular experience had a more than usual magical tone to it; this was because of the full moon and its light illuminating everything; the grass, nearby streets, houses and the sky itself. I knew it was a full moon with a clear sky that night in the physical plane too, as I was gazing at it earlier that evening when walking my dog.

>For those of you who ask questions about how to feel vibrations when astral projecting; this journal entry is a good example of the fact that we do not need to feel vibrations every time we have such experiences, therefore don’t worry about them. We come out of our bodies every night unconsciously, and our awareness can entirely skip the separation part and skip straight to the stage where we’re already out of body. I believe this kind of spontaneous and unintentional kind of astral projection is a result of consistent meditation and general cultivated awareness in daily life; such awareness inevitably and assuredly spills over into our sleeping life; as above, so below. You can read and learn about how to approach astral projection in this way in my guide on my blog (link at the bottom of this post).

I knew and felt instantly that I was in a dimension very close to, or on a parallel counterpart of physical Earth. Everything I saw was exactly the same as when I visit this field regularly when walking my dog in the physical plane; it had the same fences, trees, bushes, houses etc. However, there was an extra layer to this environment which was definitely not in the physical; there were many people on the field doing various activities. Normally, this field is completely empty at night as it is too dark and likely considered dangerous for people to visit at night. Yet, here I was; seeing teenagers playing football,  numerous social gatherings, and even small market-like stalls as if it was some kind of midnight festivity!

I was delighted when I also noticed my little Shih Tzu dog with me, she was excited, highly energetic and happily running around through people, chasing a football and having fun. I found it hilarious as she’s usually really lazy when I take her on walks. Yet, here in the astral,  there aren’t physical boundaries, she wasn’t limited by her small physique and lack of energy that Shih Tzu breeds are usually restricted by! Wouldn’t it be hilarious if I even saw her flying? I realised that she probably comes out of body every night and comes straight to this field instinctively, running around like a maniac like this all night; which is probably what she’s doing when I notice her kicking her legs in her sleep in the physical!

I watched her for some time running amongst the people in the field laughing to myself. She was clearly enjoying herself so much. I eventually left her to it so I could walk around and explore. What I saw next was the most amazing sight. I was looking at the full moon, and I  saw an enormous object in front of it, clearly a UFO, but more like a *mothership*,  with smaller ships near it. On first glance, you would think it wasn’t moving, but on closer inspection, it was actually moving slowly across the sight of the moon. What really struck me was the vast scale of it, even though they were far away, I could see the ships in great detail,  and I saw different levels of the cuboid-shaped mothership with its space-grey metallic etchings all over it. Its shape could be compared to a colossal sperm whale moving through space. I could clearly discern thousands of small white dots on it which looked like windows or rooms to look out of; which gave me a better idea of its actual size. It looked like it could easily fit thousands of people inside it. Looking at it gave me goosebumps and the same sense of awe when you look at the vastness of space or look into the depths under the sea; I’ve never seen a structure that big before. From where I was looking, it looked about a quarter of the size of the moon! It was hard to tell what its actual distance was from the Earth and whether it was closer to Earth or the moon, but regardless it was a magnificent sight. I was surprised to see that nobody else was taking notice of this massive object; as if it was just a normal thing to see here. Perhaps on a subconscious level, we are already aware of intelligent life in space, who knows!

I walked around a little after that, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off the spaceships. I realised they seemed to be moving relatively fast; but from the viewpoint of Earth, they gave the illusion of moving slowly, which suggests to me that this object was close to the moon – this would mean for me to be able to see it with the naked eye in such detail would mean the exact scale of this object was unimaginably bigger than anything architects on Earth would usually plan. I soon woke up and wrote down what I remembered.

On reflection, I wish I inquired into the lives of the people there to find out whether they were people unconsciously projecting themselves in their sleep since it was the middle of the night, or whether they were permanent residents of the afterlife.

The next day I took my dog for a walk in the same field, we were the only ones there, it was a peculiar but wonderful feeling that I had just been there hours before in a more magical and alive version of it.

If you’ve seen similar objects like the spaceship I described,  perhaps near the moon, I’d be interested in hearing about it below!


From my journal:  
[https://multidimensionaljournal.com/2014/12/20/moonlit-ufo/](https://multidimensionaljournal.com/2014/12/20/moonlit-ufo/)I'm considering doing much exploring while astral projecting and I know it's possible to see hooded figures and guides, but does that entail other people who are also astral projecting? And also I wanted to go with a friend, there are some amazing places to discover and I wouldn't wanna see it alone, and since you cant record, having someone there would be cool. I also know that 2 people could be seeing different things at the same time and I've taken that into account.I want to share my signposts which I have identified for my self. The phase to sleep paralysis is going through these steps. When I experience any of them, I know that I'm on the way to project. It would be interesting to hear if others experience the same signposts. I don't experience everyone, some of them are sometimes skipped. But I feel quite sure about the order they appear in.

1. Mild relaxed body. The body is very still and going numb.
2. Strange thoughts.
3. Hypnagogic images and thoughts. The difference between thoughts on step 2 and 3 is that step3-thoughts are appearing instantly, more of hearing them. Step-2 thaughts are more thought in a flow by myself.
4. Deeply relaxed body with a sense of warm coziness spreading through the even more numb body.
5. Automatic very comfortable deep breathing. Step 4 and 5 are often experienced simultaneously.
6. Hypnagogic sensory portal. Often combined sensories. As you give energy to the hypnagogic scenery it will deepen and very soon turn into a sleep paralysis or Wake Induced Lucid Dream.This step can be experienced as going down an elevator, walking in the snow, or climbing a rocky mountain. I don't choose the scenery, the subconscious does it for me and when I follow it all the involved senses are activated and experienced. They are not imagined at this point.This is the final point, but WILD and SP can also sometimes be induced at this point without this hypnagogic portal-experience.

If I fail an astral-projection attempt. I can often be comforted if I  experienced any of these steps. Then I know that I was very close.It is currently 5:35am where I live and I just projected for the first time.. my mind is completely blown. I have been on this page for 3-4 days now and have been attempting to project with various techniques. And I just did it. I’m so grateful to have found this community and learned so much because of it in such little time. This is what I did to have my first successful AP.

I had just awoken from a pretty lucid dream. Not the best dream as I was hiding from a military looking for me but nevertheless it was very real. It wasn’t completely lucid I would say, more like I was watching a Netflix movie in first person (I could skip/fast forward parts if I wanted to.) The night prior, before falling asleep, I had been using the mantras “The more relaxed my body, the sharper my mind” aswell as “I am already astral projecting.” When saying the latter mantra I was noticing this crazy energy come through my body, something I had never felt before. I knew this had to be a sign I was on the right track. 

When I woke from the “lucid” dream I mentioned prior, I lay completely still and didn’t move a muscle/open my eyes. I then started to perform the rotating technique and instantly the crazy vibrations started to happen. I had experienced these once before on my second attempt projecting so I was able to I remain calm. Bam! I felt it, I was levitating!! This is when I freaked out a little bit and instantly returned to my physical body. I wasn’t discouraged tho, so as soon as I returned to my body, I started to perform the rotating technique again, and again started to levitate instantly! This time I knew what to expect and I was successful in getting full separation! I then managed to fully separate by getting out of my bed like I would physically (I don’t know how else to describe it) and went to my bathroom instantly to check myself out in the Mirror/wash my astral face as I had read it helps the fogginess (which it did) 

The best way I would describe what I looked like was I was wearing one of my favourite black shirts and had no arms/legs. Just a head and a floating shirt. My face was very distorted and almost looked a little freaky (alien like) but I didn’t let this discourage me. I wanted to fly!! I went downstairs and tried to go through the window but it seemed that I was still under the rules of the physical world, as I couldn’t just float through (would love if someone could explain why to me)

All of a sudden I had my moms broom stick in my hand with the blanket we have on our couch in the living room joining me. There was a figure under the blanket with me on the broomstick but I wasn’t able to reveal the entity. It looked similar to a ghost under a sheet but I remembered nothing can hurt me, so I remained calm and carried on my path down to my main entrance door. 

I got there and then realized I needed to lock the door behind me so I grabbed my keys, opened the door, and as soon as I turned around and locked it, I must’ve triggered thinking about the physical world too much because I half woke up in my physical body. I then accepted that I had experienced more than enough for my first projection, pictured my physical body, and now am here writing this. 

This post is to say thank you to everyone who has posted they’re helpful tips for projecting as well as hopefully give motivation to those who are still struggling to get their first projection. I have recently gone completely vegan, eating as little processed food as possible. I also am on semen retention/no fap. I also have been practicing meditation a bit. I don’t know if these factors played a role in my early early success with projection but I thought I’d let y’all know.

This is my first post to reddit ever so I hope I did ok! Please ask any questions you have I would love to talk to people about my experience/projection in general and if anyone can explain why I wasn’t able to float through my window I would very much appreciate it!! 

Much love and happy travels everyone!!Hey everyone,

I’d like to share an experience I believe I had with a spirit guide. I have APed several times now, but I sort of doubt my experiences a little. Yes they do feel real but not realer than real life etc. 

But anyways, here is an experience I’ve had At about 4 am at June 7th 2020. Tell me what you guys think. Does it parallel your experiences? Do you think it was a lucid dream?

June 7th 2020

I left my body using speaker method. Basically, I pretend as though there is a speaker playing music on the other side of my bedroom and I am trying to get to there to turn it off by leaving my body. 

I kept repeating 'I call upon my spirit guide' until I was basically transported into this strange land. It was rather pleasant and seemed like a huge park filled with people - there was enough space to walk but it was still quite full. I couldn't make out whether these were families or anything else. 

I was standing before a very large and very old tree when a big and round man dressed in orange wearing a necklace of brown wooden beads walked to me. In retrospect, he actually didn’t seem all the way human - I say that given his size and shape, the man was quite round. 

We both sat next to the tree, he's back was to it. 

He asked me what I wanted and I said, to start, to learn all about Astral Projection and Lucid Dreaming. I say 'to start' because there is so much more I'd like to learn. 

He then asks me why. I respond, because I want to be able to help myself and my family. I also am a lover of learning. 

The non emotive large man was unsatisfied with my answer and asked again, 'why'. 

I answered, because I am a lover of knowledge. 

Deadpan, he asks again, 'why'. This time I thought a little about my answer and as I mentally concluded what I wanted to say, I hear a voice from the distance say, 'because I want to' - which was my answer. 

I told my interlocutor, the truest reason I wanted to learn all this was simply because I wanted to. I could help myself in many ways and learn about a million other disciplines, but I was here because I am inexplicably fascinated by these subjects. 

At that moment he pulled out a large book. I saw a few flipped pages marked Astral Projection but I am not sure whether or not there were other topics. He pushed the book into my heart and it felt like power. I woke up and I could still feel the remnants of that energy in the center of my chest.I posted on here before about how I sensed some kind of weird negative energy.  And that I thought it was 5g.  Now I'm sensing the opposite.  Positive energy that I can't determine the source of.  I doubt they would be trying to zap us with positive energy.  So it got me thinking.   Maybe this is what david icke talked about years ago.  That there would be a mass awakening.  I'd like to believe that but it seemed unlikely for a long time.  People seem to be getting stupider not smarter.  But now I'm thinking that maybe he was right.  I have my doubts about david icke.  I have suspicions that he's a shill.  But he could be right about this.  So is anyone else sensing this energy?**Evening everyone!**

**LINK:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38jaUXXMSu8&t=40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38jaUXXMSu8&t=40s)It's 1AM right now and I just woke up from my first astral projection experience. It was peculiar and slightly frightening.  I felt my soul literally rise from my body and I honestly thought I was dying. There were strange sounds and music playing everywhere.The  dream scenery flashed/changed at alarming rates. Feeling uncomfortable, I prayed to God and only then did the experience end. I think I was in the deepest part of my subconscious, and boy is it a terrifying place.Honestly it’s nice but it’s too god damn long just sticky it or open a topic and let the bot provide a link to it why do I need to scroll 3 seconds to go past it?Hi there, I’ll try and make this as quick but details as possible. 

So I’m a bit confused. About a month ago within a week of having this deep desire for seeking information and actually listening to audio of high frequencies as a way to access higher dimensions, I was able to access the Akashic records, as well as seeing what the library looks like. The things I learned and downloaded were more than I could ever thought of would be possible to learn / see and be able to draw / write. I even got to meet my spirit guide which was a red dragon which then led me to the knowledge that I was seeking which was “What is heaven, and who / what is God. What is beyond this dark void (9th dimension)”. Let’s just say I saw it all. In a literally sense. 

After a month I took a break accessing the records because I needed to not only process the information in accordance to my life but because I felt like I strained the energy of my higher being by accessing and downloading too much every night. 

My full story and knowledge I’m willing to share to those interested but this is just background to my actual question.

Now coming back into it I wanted to learn how to properly astral project within the 4th dimension and not shoot myself into the void or anything beyond, but every night so far trying, I’m having trouble and can’t do it.

However I had an epiphany that may make me seem dumb lol. Did / was I astral projecting when I accessed the records? If so, how can I stay within the 4th dimension and explore space, let alone the world, like everyone else here? 

I’ve only been able to “project” somewhere once within this state, and this was to visit my girlfriend. I just said her name and I was there. However after saying “I love you” I shot up to the 6th dimension where I was greeted by the lotus that I reoccurringly see before accessing the 7th-9th dimensions. 

Side note: [The key to pass beyond the 6th is genuinely having love, happiness, and gratitude for the experience and other things in your life that make you feel this way]

Long story short, how do I stay within the 4th without shooting beyond. And am I even projecting to begin with when I go into these states?


Edit: Here is the beginning of the documentation of my journey 

[Tales Of A Psychonaut - Document 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/poti15/tales_of_a_psychonaut_document_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)This question goes to my frequent astral  projectors. Im hearing were in the middle of a spiritual war. Can any elaborate on that and what's going on/ happeningI’ve found the hardest part about astral projecting is trying to keep your eyes closed when they flicker intensely. 

Can you still AP if u wear an eye cover or do u have to keep them bad boys shut yourself?I remember being in middle school when I first experienced this. 

I would be out with my mom/whoever, doing mundane things (like shopping, doctors visits) and get slight headaches, and feel like I was watching the situation play out from above. It would last for hours. Not feeling as if I was really in my body. Just there. Above. Watching.
Although I would be walking, talking, as normal.
I remember bringing this feeling up on multiple occasions and my mom would shrug it off.

I’ve spontaneously astral projected a few times in the last couple years, and am just coming to an understanding of what that really is. Trying to focus on projecting now, I haven’t been able to do it recently.
Now that I know, and want to, I’m having a hard time. But it’s made me dig into past experiences of doing so, and I’m curious if what I experienced as a kid is tied into it?What unknown species or physical entities have you come across on earth while astral projecting? I’m quite curious on what unknown species exist that others have yet to know about. Thanks.I was wondering if anyone here has spoken to people, like loved ones or anyone they knew who died, in the astral realm, and asked what happened after they died. People have said they've met deceased loved ones there; is the implication that the astral realm is where we go after we die? I know that talking to people in the astral realm wouldn't prove any of this to be true, but I'm just wondering what people's experiences are and how we might interpret those.

I'm new here, so I apologize if this has been asked before or isn't appropriate to ask here.Last night night I visited my deceased grandfather that raised me when I was little. I said thank you and how much I appreciated him.  I asked “him how do I find my happiness” (I’m fighting a 5 year long Kratom addiction) he said happiness is in myself. We then went flying for a bit. 
For some reason I knew my dog was going to move and get me out of that experience with my grandad. I then found myself at the corner of my bed waiting for my dog to move, a couple seconds later she did and it made a noise. It’s like I knew before something was going to happen to get me out of my astral experience. Last time I was in the astral world, I knew my daughter (who sleeps next to me) was going to move any second and wake me up, So I went back into my body and sure enough a couple seconds later she moved.Hi,

I think the majority here is aware that working on your chakras specially on the Third eye/Frontal chakra will improve your astral projection memory and being lucid.

On the article below i describe the best exercise i found to really start feeling the chakras and it only takes 15 minutes a day. Not only to have proof that they are real, but to have the feedback of knowing that you are able to activate your energy centers.

[https://scienceoftheinvisible.com/2019/09/30/are-chakras-real-here-is-how-a-15-minutes-a-day-exercise-can-change-your-mind](https://scienceoftheinvisible.com/2019/09/30/are-chakras-real-here-is-how-a-15-minutes-a-day-exercise-can-change-your-mind?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=astralprojection)

Let me know if you already can feel your chakras/energy, and how much practice it was required for you to be able to do it.So, I went on an ap with my guide. And she usually takes me to places where I am most calm. I got to not only see my (deceased) boyfriend, but our son (who I had miscarried). I even got to hold his tiny hand in mine. 😭🥰


Edit: I’m going to make this lengthier in case more people become interested.

So a couple of months ago, I started AP’ing again. This happened after I lost my boyfriend to a tragic accident. I wanted to see him again. Hold him, yhanno? And also tell him that he’s a father, because he never got to hear it from me while he was alive. My motivation was him. Yesterday, as I was getting into bed, I decided I would try again. To AP. I called upon my guides, (it’s usually best for me to do so before I get to the vibration stage). And one of my guides had taken me to this beach area. A beach my boyfriend and I planned to go to for a date. It has a picnic area and it’s just really beautiful. The water is clear, the sand is soft.... I can really go on and on lol. This is what calmed me. Just the waves crashing. The cool breeze. I felt at peace for a moment. And then, I started crying tears. I’m not sure if they were pure joy or if they had a hint of sadness. But I saw my boyfriend carrying our son. And it just gave me all kinds of emotions. (For anyone who wants to know, I lost our son after I lost my boyfriend). When I received my son, I remember looking at him with such adoration and affection. (Keep in mind this is the first time I’ve ever gotten to hold him in my arms). You really do get that “love at first sight” kind of feeling from your child. And I couldn’t stop crying. He heard my voice and smiled. And I got to feel his tiny hand in mine. I swear, it was such a beautiful moment. I can’t even put into words what this made me feel, being reunited with them both. My boyfriend stared at me with this look he always gives me – something I can best describe as: wow I’m really in love with this person.

And if anyone is curious. My guide was looking at us from afar. But also going around the beach area looking for turtles (My boyfriend and I adore turtles).

I hope everyone is successful in their journeys to astral project. I wish you all the best of luck.[ Removed by reddit in response to a copyright notice. ][Achillaes Sirigos - Chronicles From The Future: The Amazing Story of Paul Amadeus Dienach](http://docdro.id/sVQ1jE8)  [PDF]


In 1921, Paul Amadeus Dienach, a Swiss-Austrian teacher with fragile health, falls into a one-year-long coma. During this time, his consciousness slides into the future and enters the body of another man in 3906 A.D.

When Dienach awakens from his coma, he finds himself back in 1922. Knowing that he doesn't have much time left, he writes a diary, recording whatever he could remember from his amazing experience: the mankind’s history in the forthcoming centuries, from the nightmare of overpopulation and World Wars up until the world-changing globalization, the radical new administration system, the colony on Mars and the next human evolutionary stage. Without any close friends and relatives to entrust, he doesn't say a word to anyone out of fear of being branded a lunatic. 

Before he dies, he hands his diary to his favorite student, George Papachatzis, later prominent Professor of Law and Rector of Panteion University of Greece. The diary circulates as hidden knowledge within a close philosophical circle and in the Tectonic Lodge of Athens, in which Papachatzis is a high ranking member. Dienach's prophecies are taken very seriously by the Masons, who consider the book to be almost holy, containing wisdom about the future of humanity and better kept only for the few.

In 1972, professor Papachatzis, despite an intense dispute, decides to publish Dienach’s diary in Greek. Another edition follows in 1979. However, the book disappears and is hardly mentioned again.

Paul Dienach was not an author, poet, or professional writer. Rather, he was an ordinary man who kept a journal, never with the expectation that it would be published.

This unique and controversial book, a universal legacy, is now carefully edited, translated and available to everyone.

[Summary](http://www.ancient-origins.net/unexplained-phenomena/chronicles-future-amazing-story-paul-amadeus-deinach-003121)  

Introductions typically attempt to present the essence of a book, highlighting the most important elements of the story you are about to read. My introduction does not do that. Rather, I will be telling you the story of how this unique text came to be, its journey from the 1920s until today.

This is a book that contains the diary of a man who never intended his words to be revealed to the world. It chronicles an experience that was never shared for fear of ridicule and disbelief. As you work your way through his very personal memoire, the reason for secrecy will soon become clear – the author claimed to have lived in the future and returned back to his original era, 20th century central Europe, to record a detailed account, outlining exactly what happened during his journey.

The real protagonists of this amazing, true story are two persons: Paul Amadeus Dienach, the author, and the man who claimed to have lived in the future; and George Papahatzis, Dienach’s student of German language studies to whom he left his notes - the diary you hold in your hands today.

After making the first acquaintances, let's start unravelling their story step-by-step.

Paul Amadeus Dienach was a Swiss-Austrian teacher with fragile health. His father was a German-speaking Swiss and his mother was an Austrian from Salzburg. Dienach travelled to Greece in the Autumn of 1922, after having recovered from a one-year coma caused by a serious illness, hoping that the mild climate would improve his condition.

During his time in Greece, Dienach taught French and German language lessons in order to provide himself with a minimum income. Amongst his students was George Papahatzis, a student that Dienach appreciated more than any of the others. Papahatzis describes his teacher as a "very cautious and very modest man that used to emphasize the details".

Dienach, as we learn from Papahatzis, was born in a suburb of Zurich and lived his adolescence in a village near the large Swiss city. He later followed humanitarian studies with a strong inclination to the history of cultures and classical philology. It is believed that he eventually  died from tuberculosis in Athens, Greece, or on his way back to his homeland through Italy, probably during the first quarter of 1924.

Before Paul Dienach died, he entrusted Papahatzis with part of his life and soul– his diary. Without telling Papahatzis what the notes were, he left him with the simple instructions that he should use the documents to improve his German by translating them from German to Greek.

Papahatzis did as he asked. Initially, he believed Dienach had written a novel, but as he progressed with translations, he soon realized the notes were actually his diary… from the future!

At this point we have to clarify something crucial.  Dienach is thought to have suffered from Encephalitis lethargica, a strange neurological disease that develops an immune system response to overloaded neurons. The first time Dienach fell into a lethargic sleep it was for 15 minutes. The second time it was for a whole year…

During this year that Dienach was in a coma in a Geneva hospital, he claimed to have entered the body of another person, Andreas Northam, who lived in the year 3906 AD.


Once he recovered from his coma, Dienach didn't talk to anyone about his remarkable experience because he thought he would be considered crazy. However, what he did do was write down the entirety of his memory relating to what he had seen of the future. Towards the end of his life, he even stopped his teaching job in order to have as much time as possible to write everything he could remember.

Dienach describes everything he experienced of the environment and people of the year 3906 AD, according to the mind-set and limited knowledge of a 20th century man. This was not an easy task for Dienach. There were many things he claims not to have understood about what he saw, nor was he familiar with all their terms, technology, or the evolutionary path they had followed.

In his memoires, he claims that the people of the future fully understood his peculiar medical situation, which they called " conscious slide ", and they told Dienach as many things as they could in relation to the historical events that took place between the 21st and 39th century. The only thing they didn't tell him was the exact story of the 20th century, in case Dienach’s consciousness returned back to his original body and era (as he did) – they believed it would be dangerous to let him know his immediate future and the future of his era in case it disturbed or altered the path of history and his life. 

By reading Dienach's unique personal narration page by page, you will be able to decode what he claims to have seen in relation to mankind, our planet, and our evolution.

Many may wonder – what happened to the diary in all that time, from the distant year of 1926 until now, almost a century later?

George Papahatzis gradually translating Dienach's notes – with his not so perfect German – over a period of 14 years (1926-1940), mostly in his spare time and summer breaks. World War II and the Greek civil war delayed his efforts of spreading the amazing story that landed on his desk all those years ago.

On the Eve of Christmas in 1944, Papahatzis was staying with friends at a house which was also used occupied by the Greek Army. When the soldiers caught sight of Dienach’s notes, which were of course in German, they confiscated them because they considered them suspicious. They told Papahatzis that they would return them only after they had examined their contents. They never did. But by then, Papahatzis had already finished the translation.

George Papahatzis tried to track down information about Dienach, by visiting Zurich 12 times between 1952 and 1966. He could not find a single trace of him, nor any relatives, neighbors, or friends. Dienach, who is thought to have fought with the Germans during World War I, probably never gave his real name in Greece, a country that had fought against the Germans.

After the end of World War II and the Greek Civil War, Papahatzis gave the translated diary to some of his friends – masons, theosophists, professors of theology and two anti-Nazi Germans– and after that, when everybody realized what they had in their hands, the diary was kept within a close philosophical circle and in the Tectonic Lodge, in which he was a member. The book was taken very seriously by the Masons, who did not want the information spread to a larger circle. They considered the book to be almost holy, containing wisdom about the future of humanity, and better kept only for the few.

Finally, after strong disputes, George Papahatzis decided to publish Dienach's Diary. It was during the period that Greece entered the hardest phase of the 7 year dictatorship in 1972. Strong protest from certain church circles – who considered the book heretic – and the fall of the dictatorship a year later, condemned the first edition to oblivion. No one was interested in the future when the present was so intense and violent.

All these factors, along with the difficult language and the rough style of Dienach’s notes,  which mixed together elements of his past, along with his experience of the future, made the diary even more difficult to understand. Only a few had the time, patience, and knowledge to decode the secret knowledge that lay encoded within almost 1,000 pages.

Another edition followed in 1979 in Greece. However, again the book disappeared and it was hardly mentioned again, apart from the few that knew of its existence.

After all the silence, Papahatzis died, and his family did not wish to carry on with his work.

Twenty two years passed before the diary was picked up again by Radamanthis Anastasakis, a high ranking member of the Masonic Lodge in Greece, who decided to publish the book on a small scale, exactly as it was previously written.

That's when I discovered the book for the first time and started to "restore" it, without the sentimentalities that kept Papahatzis from doing something more than an exact translation of the ‘holy’ scripts of his teacher. Almost a century after the original script was written, this was a task that had to be undertaken so that a 21 st century reader could really understand what a 20 th century man wanted to say.

And so I did it, making sure not to change any of the content, but filtering out irrelevant notes pertaining to Dienach’s early life and emphasizing his experience of the future, but in a simpler language and without the gaps that Dienach’s narration had.

I have tried to keep the true essence of his story intact. This was my debt to Dienach, whose chronicles of the future completely changed my perspective of life. Nothing more, nothing less. My only goal was to make it accessible to all of you, because if Dienach’s experience was indeed real, this book contains revolutionary information – something the Masons clearly recognized – and has the potential to radically change your view of the world and mankind.

Now that you know the background to this unique story, I will simply deposit the future in your hands with an abstract from the introduction of the 1979 edition of the book by George Papahatzis, the man who personally knew Dienach:

>The translator of the original texts, knew Dienach personally. His belief is that the inspiration and writing of these texts wasn’t an imaginary creation of Dienach, based on his education and insightful abilities. It is a true phenomenon of parapsychology that was linked to his life. Maybe he has also added his own things, maybe he didn’t see or live all of the events that he so vividly describes and presents. What is certain is that most of the basic elements of his texts are true experiences that he had; he lived in advance a part of the future to come and a metaphysical phenomenon of incredible clarity happened to him - a phenomenon of parapsychology that rarely happens with such an intensity and roughness. Because of him, what is going to happen on Earth starting from the last decades of the 20 th century up to 3906 AD, is now known to us, at least in general terms.

I have to tell you that while Papahatzis was just a student at the time of receiving Dienach’s diary, he went on to become a very respectable man of his era. He was Vice President of the European Movement (National Council of Greece), Founding Member of the Greek Philosophical Society, and a Professor of Philosophy and Culture. He risked a lot in publishing Dienach’s work and this on its own reflects his unwavering belief in its authenticity.

Now I leave you with Dienach’s diary, a chronicle from the future… 

[Achillaes Sirigos - Chronicles From The Future: The Amazing Story of Paul Amadeus Dienach](http://docdro.id/sVQ1jE8)  [PDF]
I want to have a conversation with mine. I've never APed, tried many times but no success. I plan to revisit AP and try again though.Title says it all, I did it just by laying on bed and focusing on my body.

Whenever I felt that I'm going to float away to dreams, I started counting to one hundred to awake myself a little and came back to focus on my body.

It is very important for me because I burn out on astral projection and lucid dreaming lately, I got stuck and get bored by things that depend on RNG in indirect methods. Thanks to indirect methods I got at least 1 LD or AP a week, sometimes everyday. This randomness, I felt like it's not fair, I was not satisfied by results.

But now in the middle of the day  I fucking did it. Just laying on the bed and concetrating on my body was enough, no matter what i promised not fucking move a body for even an itchy place. In the past that was point when I often surrendered, I won this time so you can do it too.After reading about this experience, if you’d like to watch the video I created based on it, please click this link:   [https://youtu.be/DsnjHKe3\_WE](https://youtu.be/DsnjHKe3_WE)

One of the deepest questions we ponder as human beings is how the Universe began. Was there a massive explosion that brought all of this into existence, or was it something else… Something that we, as beings in this 3D world, could not have possibly imagined...

The experience I’m about to share with you may have just given me a glimpse into what actually occurred in the beginning, and the one thing I could not have foreseen, frankly, was my inability to fully grasp what was being shown to me:

Days before I had the experience, I had been thinking about space, the Universe, and how it all began. At the time, my connection to my guides was growing stronger, and this thing I call Beyond Body (or for those familiar with Robert Monroe, locale 3) was happening more and more…

A few days later, after repeatedly requesting this trip (and hopefully not annoying my very patient guides), it finally happened early in the morning on 3/26/19. I woke up briefly and decided to get a bit more rest, as it wasn’t quite time to get ready for work. Once I shut my eyes again, It wasn’t long before I felt that usual sense of acceleration. A sense that my body was barreling through space and time. Unlike astral projection, there is no feeling of separation prior to this movement.

Sometimes these trips are short, while others last much longer, and I’d say this trip was one of the furthest I’ve ever taken. I just kept going and going… and since these journeys take place in darkness, I never know where I’ll end up until my surroundings ultimately reveal themselves. Gradually i began to slow down, but the darkness persisted. Then, in the distance, I could see tiny flickers of light… stars. 

I was floating in space, but I didn’t see earth or any other planets. I could feel invisible arms wrapped around me. They turned me slowly until I was able to see that I wasn’t in empty space after all. There were objects floating around me, and they were massive. I’d say they were easily as big as planets, and although I don’t remember most of these objects, two stood out to me: The first was what looked like an asteroid,  but was smooth like marble. There was writing carved into it, but I didn’t recognize the language it was written in. When I asked, out loud, who created this, a voice (presumably my guide's) spoke and told me that they were the raú (honestly, I don’t know how it’s spelled, but that’s the best I can come up with). He went on to tell me that In English they are known as The Helpers. 

The second object, as big as the first, was a giant face that appeared to be forged from some kind of stone, and reminded me of a face you might see on one of those mysterious statues on Easter Island. I was in awe of how big it was, and just stared at it in silence. One last thing: It felt like I was wearing something, like a space suit perhaps? If it was some kind of space suit, it was completely invisible to me. Moments later, I was back in my bedroom.

Afterwards, I thought about what I’d seen… Like so many of these experiences, I had more questions than answers.So I was astralprojecting  around the house yesterday night and noticed that the tv was still on. I'd heard of people affecting electronic devices whilst astral projecting before, so I wanted to see if I could turn it off. When I tried to, the tv sparked and then turned to a black screen. 
After waking up, I noticed I couldn't turn it on anymore. Did I break it? Is there a way to fix it with AP, because I really can't afford to get a new one..Hi, i wanted to share a strange lucid dream i had a little over a month ago. Maybe someone have had something similar.

In this lucid dream, i was outdoors looking up in the sky. There were loud sounds of sirens and a sound that resembled a loud alarm. Up where the sun was, it looked different. Almost if the sun was a huge what i can describe as a computer chip.

As i watched that event, this phrase came to mind: “The Great Reset”.

Im new to these types of experiences, so i am trying to process it as i go.

Thank you for reading it!Hey so I am about a year or so along my spiritual path and as I progress I hope to post my findings to help aid and guide everyone in this stream
Anyways, in the beginning of my awakening I did not even realize the distinction between ego and spirit which is quite important not only is reaching higher planes of consciousness but also becoming a good candidate for inducing astral projection. You cannot bring anything from your ego on the astral so that’s why knowing the distinction is important. I believe the ego is formed from our culture and in many cases people don’t realize that they are acting on a basis of the ego. Those who are not aware habitually act out and do things that go against their spirit and you build up karma when you do this. When you are doing something and get a little feeling that you shouldn’t, just trust the feeling because that is your spirit trying to break through the wants of your ego. For example, say you have been eating really unhealthy and after having a bowl of ice cream you go back for a second bowl. You have a realization that you probably shouldn’t have a second bowl and it would not benefit your health, it is in this moment that you determine if your ego or spirit takes the wheel. Going back for a second bowl would be your ego, and vice versa. 
I hope you guys understand the point I am trying to convey. Ram Dass has a lot of lectures on this topic and I have made the most progress from this information. Once you are regularly aware of your ego you can then start to break and down and live from your spirit. 

Good luck to everyone, we are on this path together.My betta fish was learning to enjoy my presence more and more. He went from swimming away from my hand to nipping it. I noticed him happily swimming around energetically whenever I came home from work. Recently he got stuck behind a filter and ended up dying. If I were to astral project, is it possible to find his soul and make him an astral companion of sorts?The reason for this is because I have tried to once and it didn’t exactly go as planned. Usually when I have an obe i can access it through lucid dreaming. It mainly also only works when i get up in the morning to use the bathroom or get water then fall back asleep. anyways once i got back into bed it sort of jus happened. since i’m pretty new to this i usually either ruin it by getting too excited or scared, so i always set a quick intention to go to any random place that pops up in my head. which in this case was mars. i started traveling through space quite fast and the planet was in view almost instantly. yet as i began to get closer a high pitched screaming noise started to go off very loud. it kind of felt like a warning? and it actually scared me so much that my astral body went back into my physical body. afterwards i was curious and delved into theories in reddit about mars. it talked about how it used to be a planet very similar to earth tho something bad must’ve happened there to cause it to be inhabitable. i’m jus wondering if anyone has any experiences like me or if nothing like that of the sort happened to them when they traveled to mars.This technique might seem strange but it makes sense if you read everything.

So what you do is when you just go to bed. Listen to music with earbuds. Lay down and Put on music you love and that makes you relaxed. Play music that you haven't listened to for a while.
Or music that gives you a nostalgic feeling.

Then just relax your entire body. Do not move swallow spit or anything. When you feel your body getting heavy. Try the rope method imagine a rope and climb it with imaginary hands. But actually feel you climbing the Rope. The heavyness the textures.

Then you feel yourself sinking into your bed.
You will start feeling heavy and tingly. Then you feel yourself rising. Try the roll out method or focus on the music untill you feel a pop sensation. I hope this technique helps other people.Was always a little skeptical about this whole thing. I always thought People’s experiences were maybe just dreams, but last night changed my whole view. I usually get to the vibrational states right before I fall asleep and always got too scared to try and actually come out of my body after hearing other people’s experiences. So last night I was in the vibrational state and wanted to wake myself up more because I didn’t want to be in this state so I got up out of bed to realize my body didn’t get up but my astral self did. It was a weird experience I stood up out of bed and began floating uncontrollably to my closet. My view wasn’t exactly 360 but it was wider than usual and every time I opened my mouth I could hear static. I quickly got scared and told myself to go back over and over again until I was sucked back into my body and woke up excited but scared. This experience opened my eyes to a whole knew belief. Being agnostic before I can now confirm with myself that the body does have a soul, pretty exciting.An hour before going to sleep I lay flat on my back put some meditation music on and try to relax, I lay there for half an hour or more trying to imagine myself in a different place or try to move myself (not physically), but nothing happens, then after an hour or so I get frustrated and get up and that's the end of it.  
Can anyone give me advice on what can I do better?  
Thank you.[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/hnfyxw/this_would_be_an_interesting_place_to_project_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


A week ago I found a post on reddit asking for someone to AP or journey to the gate of the gods in south/Central America and attempt to open it or crossover. After many attempts I believed I had failed to cross over but it appears I left a soul clone on the other side. I discovered this last night when instead of Journeying I was able to look through the eyes of my soul fragment. The experience was very trippy and surreal, I would describe it as akin to an acid trip. No drugs were involved however. I spoke with god like beings, some neutral in nature. Others were.. not so much. I bore witness to a snake headed man and Quetzalcoatl. Quetzalcoatl asked that I partake in the cyclical cosmic game the life bringers play with the endless nothingness, the abyss, the unconscious. Their game was simple, I was made to bear witness to the birth of a universe while standing in a room outside it’s future inhabitants’ physical perception. The room had orange and purple walls, a white floor, and a single giant golden flower. The colors of the room faded away when the nothing spoke in a rumbling voice. It told me I must choose wether the universe I was witnessing be born was allowed to live or be destroyed by the nothing, and the cycle of death and birth be ended. I refused to choose at first, stating it was the lifebringers’ choice. The nothingness was adamant that the rules of their game is that the creation of the lifebringers must make the choice whether to continue the cycle or end it. They have been selecting creations from the many worlds to be pawns in this game. I chose to continue the cycle and spoke with the nothingness as time ran short. It is my understanding that the great abyss/the unconscious is addicted to this gamble with life. It’s booming deep voice was angry at my assertion that if it truly did not want to play the game, it would walk away. It agreed inevitably. Following the ending of the game, another incomprehensible being escorted my clone away somewhere else. My vision of his eyes slipped away as he was whisked off elsewhere. As I opened my eyes in the physical again I found I had tears upon my face and my 3 day headache was gone. My helping spirits made it prudent to me that what I had done was truly risky as this realm my clone is in, truly is beyond regular perception and filled with powerful beings.The tunnel i went through as a kid had wind and sides to it.


Have you guys and girls felt things in the astral realms?


I must admit, the older I get; the more these things seam like dreams, I know they're not! But I don't like how those who haven't experienced this stuff dismiss it and dismiss kids who have a much stronger connection to the spirit realms.The very first time I ever projected, I projected to a "hub." It's an area where other beings in the astral plane can hang out, gain/share information, or do whatever really. I was shocked out of my mind that this was happening to me. I met my guide here and we had a very nice long chat. Long story short, he said something to me that triggered a realization that this was infact real. I was a bit scared to be quite frank but aren't most of us? I felt someone watching me so I turned to look. That's when I saw three entities staring at me with their faces shaded from the low front of the hoods. Each one of them had their left and right hands together out infront of their sternum area. I felt a bad energy overcoming me from them and ended up going back to my body because of the shock. Does anyone know anything about these entities described?Hello everyone, I don't believe much of us made it. Lets just turn **the base of the statue of liberty** into a perpetual open meetup place. If you're going to ap and travel, stop by to see people. Base of the statue of Liberty is probably a good spot for it! *thank you mind-meets-world for that idea*

*Location: New York City Statue of Libery*

*Directions: From space, the easy way to find it is to first find North America. Then, going up the east coast, find Long Island (it's the long East-West island between Chesapeake Bay and Cape Cod). The Hudson River comes out at the West End of Long Island, and Liberty Island is the first island on the left as you're going north up the river.*

**EDIT: I just made an astral projection meetup subreddit, totally optional but would be cool if you guys would join.. i need some experienced people! (not trying to take any business away from this subreddit, just figured it would be great to have a whole subreddit focused on meetups)**[https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralPlaneMeetups/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralPlaneMeetups/)

&#x200B;

hope to see you all on the plane (;Anything scary or any beautiful sceneries? Just curious 😊Do it around 12pm. Wrap yourself nice and snug in your blankets I found this helps. Lay there watching the darkness under your eye lids. Play some tv or music in the background. Not too loud.  You'll come to a stage where you'll feel an urge to sit up. Check if you can still here the music.  In an AP it'll be gone or totally different.  Sit up. Boom. Go outside and fly.  I've been lucid dreaming and Astral projecting all my life. Soooo much fun.  DMT next wooooI am new to the concept of astral projection and I would appreciate if so someone explains something.

I hear of people claiming to have confirmed it, but if this is the case, why hasn't an experiment proven it and it has been accepted by most of science. Can someone please explain why? I would even do an experiment right now if someone offered to AP and tell me the object/digit in a box that I would set up.let’s talk about succubus and incubus. All the stories i’ve read on this reddit or internet showed me that succubus/incubus are not that bad. They came to us only for our pleasure and maybe to food on our energy (maybe). There was an story where a guy was AP but then this succubus, a shining blond women came at him and start to suck… him. Or this story where a girl met an incubus and kinda fall in love with ? All these stories make me think that they’re only here for give us pleasure like it could be fun to have an astral boyfriend/girlfriend (even if it’s a demon 😾) what do you guys think ? do you have stories about them ?I cant believe that its been 6 years and now i got the idea to share it and see if somebody else has similar experience, or maybe an explanation, because I still don't have answers to many things regarding this one specific AP.

Long story short, i've started astral projecting when I was maybe 18 years old. It took me about a year of practice. It started with lucid dreams almost every night, eventually I started successfully projecting.  I was always very careful and respective wherever I would end up and I had clear intention every time I would AP. At that time I declared myself as an atheist, I grew up in Christian country, I was never forced to believe, I tried to believe, but it didnt work, I just had problems believing in many things connected to Christianity, and it didnt make sense to me how can people blindly believe in some things without any concrete proof and they just accept is as truth. At 18 i started questioning everything, I knew there must be something more because ive experienced entity attack when i was 6 and started waking up every night at 3 o clock. I wanted to find out for myself in what I will believe in. When i did my research and found a term i never saw before ''astral projection'' I just thought ''yes, this is it, this is what i need to do'' without knowing anything about it. 

Ive had many AP-s in a period of two years since I started practicing. They would be mostly learning about the environment, how to move, how to communicate etc. My main goal was to project in real time and do or see something  which I would be able to check in real life, which then, would be proof for myself that yes, there is something more then this, we are not just humans and when we die thats not it. That proof would be enough for me. I always felt that we people are just running around not knowing why we do the things we do but we just do them which then results in unhappiness, I always thought that the main problem of the fucked up society as it is today is the result of not knowing is there a point in all this we are doing called life.

So here we go. I wanted to take an afternoon nap one day, i was lying on my back for just a minute and vibrations started, I couldnt believe because that was the first time It started so fast, I was still completely aware of everything. I started disconnecting from my body and it worked, I decided to just jump out without having clear intention what I want to do this time. I just thought ''Im ready, show me whatever you want'' suddenly everything was just black, i felt like in a vacum, my perception of space was totally changed,  it was just this huuuge space of nothingness, and i realized, i was nothing. I was actually nothing, I only existed because I was aware that i existed. I felt so far from our world, usually in AP-s I would feel that im close to our world, but this was something completely different. I felt that this is what it feels like when you die. It felt like this life i was living actually lasted few moments and this is what actually infinity feels like. Before, sometimes when I would think about death I would imagine omg imagine if you die and you left something embarrassing in your room and then everybody will see it and know your secret or something stupid like that but in that moment there I realized all our emotions of embarrassment, shame, fear are only existent if we are physically there. After few moments of nothingness i felt immense pressure in my third eye, it was really intense and suddenly a screen just showed up right in front of me, it felt like it is connected to my third eye, it was a white rectangle screen, like they used for that old movie projectors. I was paralyzed and couldnt do anything else but watch the screen. And it just started. Even now after 6 years I still dont have the words to explain what I saw. It was like a movie, but movie that lasted for few millions of years, pictures on the screen were changing so fast like somebody increased the speed so fast that you can just catch a glimpse of what is showed, but while it lasted I felt like im in tune with that and in that moment i could understand everything. It literally felt like a massive information download right into my consciousness. Thats the best explanation i can give. Since everything experienced while we are out of our body  must be downloaded into are brain in the moment of  re entering it needs to be ''downloaded'' in the way our brain will understand it. When we are back in our body lowest level of consciousness always overwrites higher level consciousness memories, so thats why i am not able to remember everything that i saw because my brain just cannot comprehend it because of its complexity. All that I have memories of is that I was showed everything. how did  we end up here, why are we here, then, i remember words that were showed on the screen Maya, Trinity, Unity, Merkabah, I especially remember when I saw Merkabah written that I thought its not a word because i remember that I never saw it before in my life. In that moment, everything made sense, everything that happened, that was happening, that will happen. It lasted for few seconds, but it actually felt like it was few million years. When that ''projection'' was done the screen just disappeared in one small dot and I was again in nothingness. Suddenly again smaller screen showed, it looked like desktop screen, and there was a picture of Virgin Mary, Im still confused about that, i couldnt understand why that would be shown and im not religious and especially after all that ive seen in that movie. Anyway, I realized its been some time and im still not in my body, i got scared a bit and said ''I want to return in my body'' and i just opened my eyes. As soon as i was back in my body i felt that im losing memories of everything that ive seen, i could literally feel them just vanishing. I managed to write something i had memories of and then i just spent hours looking at the wall trying to understand what happened. I felt something was different, i felt different but I couldn't understand how different. When I googled Merkabah and found out that it is actually a word and what it means I was mind blown and even more sure that I never saw that word before. 

After that astral projection i  stopped having dreams, lucid dreams, Ap-s, nothing. Literally nothing.  It wasnt intentional. It just stopped and I didnt know why. I did not have a dream in like 3 or 4 years after that. It wasnt like i knew that i was dreaming but just couldnt remember, it was nothing, blank. I completely lost the ability to dream and astral project and it used to happen almost daily. I lost that but I gained some other abilities that are very complicated to explain. 

 What I think happened is that I unconsciously blocked that ability, probably because of fear. It was the first time that I felt something that was bigger then everything that we can imagine. I started to question everything, maybe my brain just created it, maybe im just delusional.  Its been around 6 years and im still struggling with gaining ability to dream again. I had one astral projection after that one, it was the last one, I got my proof. I managed to check something that i saw while outside of my body in reality.QuestionThe idea of AP from meditation sounded too crazy to do a while ago, but with how much trance meditation I have been doing I almmost feel like I could do it with the right guidence. 

I dont expect a whole book but something just enough to give me and everyine else the main technique.Right before I went to sleep, I watched myself essentially “create” a dream. Right in front of my “eyes” it sort of “morphed” into my view, which kinda reminded me of AP.

Are we AP’ing into different planes of existence while we dream?go me i guess!Hi all, 

Hope your all well!

I'd be so grateful for some advice, 
Ive been interested in everything spiritual from a young age from crystal healing to Wicca, 

but ive allways REALLY wanted to astral project, I first started trying after reading about it in a magazine I subscribed to with my pocket money as a young teenager, fast forward ( I want to keep this post short and not bore you!) 

But I'm now almost 30 and I've tried EVERYTHING!  From having my head and feet facing certain directions as I heard that was what you should do to astral project, 

to using crystals i.e. a Amethyst crystal balanced on my forehead in a atempts to open the third eye, too using a corresponding crystal on each chakra before attempting to astral project, 

I've tried to imagine climbing out of my body, floating out,using a rope to climb out ,using a ladder but nothing...

I allways go into a deep relaxation state before attempting any of this, and I have tried so hard!

 I want to astral project so much, and I just can't seem to achieve it! Which really saddens me,I've read a lot of your tips on here and tried them (been a member for a little while but never posted before) 

I dream and can rember them, I've never managed to lucid dream despite using a technique I read about (constantly through the day asking yourself are you dreaming,untill it becomes second nature,then in theory you should be able to ask yourself it in a dream,but that didn't work.)

The only thing I have experienced is sleep paralysis,I get it quite a few times a year and find it a bit scary.


But I have no fear of astral projection,in fact if I did manage to leave my body id be thrilled!

I've tried everything, but I never get those "vibrations" in my body people speak about.

Please could anyone help me? 
I'd really appreciate any advice or input from those more experienced than me! I know it exists so why on earth after trying so very hard can't I do it?

One thing comes to mind I don't know if it can affect astral projection but when using my pendulum it allways says my root chakra is out of balance,I've tried using crystals to get it back into balance but I still get the pendulum saying it's out of balance. I even sleep with a quartz pyramid next to me with the balancing crystal for each chakra in the pyramid.

Sorry this post is so long, I didn't mean it to be!

Any advice would be really appreciated on why on earth I can't astral project like the rest of you!

Thanks for reading 
Kind regards allHello everyone, I just wanted to help anyone here having trouble in this area.

I had an NDE that triggered multiple OBEs in the years that followed to date! Most of my experiences have been unintentional or randomly. I have had more than 30 or more sometimes I loose count and stopped trying to keep count. 

 I have been mentoring or helping people here and there when it comes to having a successful OBE, very recently I started reading about AP and how to AP and I also started trying to AP at will and it worked out, so I wanted to share some of the tricks that helped me! I will not say much about meditation as I am sure everyone knows it's an essential!

1. Practicing a deep relaxation state will be very helpful especially for first timers and will put your mind and body at ease during the vibrational state.

2. When you get to the vibrational state, don't get too excited ( I know most people can't contain it) or freaked out! Both of these emotions will halt the entire process, I recommend surrendering or relaxing into the vibrations and letting them take over you, the next you will feel is your body separating.

3. When your spirit leaves your body, try so hard not to think about your body as that will automatically bring your spirit back into your body, think about places you would love to visit and your spirit will be teleported to those places instantly.

4. Don't and I repeat never let fear consume you as this will make for a bad experience, you will instantly attract dark entities or energy or demons whatever you want to label them! This is why meditation is very important, to calm your mind and make you be in control of your spirit mind! Envision a protective energy surrounding you and if you are a believer like me, summon the angels of God to protect you and they will do that! Arc angel Micheal is very fierce with his protective sword.

5. Once you are done with your trip, don't freak out about being stuck, just think about your body and you will automatically come back inside your body.

6. You don't always have to be awake especially when you are starting out, if sleep takes you don't fight it as sometimes you can AP while sleeping. Personally I always just go to bed and the vibrations wake me up before my body separates, as they are normally very intense, I feel like my entire bed is shaking yet it's just my body, This can be very helpful especially for first timers.

Lastly, I know some people use drugs to attain this but you can still do this sober and you need to be in absolute control of your mind!  

Always keep an open mind as it will be for a mind blowing experience, don't limit yourself and don't dismiss what you don't understand! Anything can happen on the other end, on Friday I found myself in 1957, with a magazine cover which had those dates and I was able to see how our town looked then and my mother and father in their younger years before I was born, sometimes I have seen future events, I always write down my experiences and cross off events that have come to pass!

Happy Astral projecting and stay safe. 

Do it with a purpose and it will help immensely with your spiritual growth.Hi all. I've posted it before, when the book first came out, and this makes the second time. I hope I am not overstepping any bounds or seemingly plugging my own book. I'm not out to self-promote, I'd just really like to offer a copy of my book for free. Money was never part of the plan, just the pure, indescribable high I feel from other people enjoying my story. There's no feeling like it. So, while people are stuck at home, I do hope you would check out the story, and hope even more that you'd enjoy it.

 There is a physical book that is for sale on Amazon, however I have set the lowest price Amazon will allow to cover printing. I make no profit. I've also given away the E-book on the day of its release, and spent 9 hours narrating the story for free on YouTube as an audio book. Link below to both the E-book and audio book, as well as the print copy if you would like. 

&#x200B;

The Kingdom at the Far Edge of Time is a work of urban fantasy that follows a protagonist with a gift for lucid dreaming. In his escape from the doldrums of teenage life, he discovers a trespasser in  his private worlds, which sets off a tale of bravery, of friendship, of impossible sights, unlikely heroes, and all while in a desperate race against the clock to save a young boy's life.

This story pays respectful homage to Astral Projection, and a great deal of effort was made to convey that to the reader. It is not a cheap plot device, but rather, a showcasing of its profundity and mystery.

If you'd care to take a ride, I hope that you enjoy.

This book brought a lot of different thoughts and emotions out of me. It captivated me with the wonder of the dream world and the beauty that we all have inside of us. A wonderful journey of love, fear, laughter, and sadness. Taking on the mystery of something as unknown as our dreams and mixing it with the realities of the world. Once I started I had to come back every chance I got. Excellent book I will be reading again.

This tale is far from a world I have ever known! I’m barreling through the authors words caused by sheer excitement and wonder but I have to stop sometimes in fear of discrediting his amazing use of description, which truly puts you there with the characters. I can’t wait to receive the paper back- I’ll be re-reading all over again!How do so many people believe in AP? It's like humanity is becoming more and more 'self-aware', or something...I just started watching the harry potter movies again.  And it gave me an idea.  They tell you in those movies how to get rid of negative entities.  They throw it in your face because they think most people are too stupid to figure it out.  How do they do this?  In the prisoner of azkaban harry is accosted on the train by the dementors.  I don't know about anyone else but I've seen a lot of negative entities that look like dementors.  Fortunately for him professor Lupin stepped in and drove the dementors away.  With a patronus charm.  So this got me thinking.  Maybe we can use something like this to drive off negative entities.  In the movie a pratronus charm is conjured by thinking of your happiest memory.  In the astral though the best way to repel negative entities is love.  I've seen them react to love like a vampire to sunlight.  So what if we conjured up the energy of love all around us.  It would send any negative entity nearby scurrying into the shadows.  In the movie the pratronus can drive away dozens if not hundreds of dementors.  I don't see why we can't do the same thing.  If we can do this then negative entities won't dare bother us again.  Just something to think about.  They tell you a lot of stuff in movies.  Most people don't have a clue.  But some of us can put the pieces together.  So those of you that have frequent OBEs try this and let me know how it goes.As we all know.. The government, military, and shadow organizations have been deeply involved in AP for quite some time now. [Here's ](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/nsa-rdp96x00790r000100030004-1) a declassifed document on the official CIA website for the skeptics. But anyway.. My question, how do I get past these entities/guards placed in high interest areas such as military bases, Antarctica from what I've heard, and places I'm not supposed to be in general? Every one I've talked to that's encountered them says they're terrifying. Nonetheless I would still like to attempt to get passed them. Either by force or immunity. Is their a method I could use to damage the other astral entities?This happened some months ago...

I was meditating and decided to give a try to astral travel, so I laid down in my bed. I was sceptical about the idea by which somebody pulls you up from bed and takes you to astral realms, but I wanted to do an experiment and I asked mentally to my astral guide to take my hand to go astral (but inside myself I thought that couldn't be possible). I started relaxing and 15 minutes later I felt a so solid and strong hand that pulled me up!!! I was so scared that I pulled my (astral) hand down and my physical body literally jumped from bed like half a meter (no joking XD) and I started touching my own hands because I couldn't believe what just happened... I won't say anymore that I'm sceptical about that jajaja. WOW!!As you may know (I posted it yesterday), I've been trying to astral project for a very long time now. It's been really frustrating because I've never done it, even though I've tried lots of methods. So this morning, when I woke up (which was like maybe an hour before I usually wake up), I decided to give it a spin. 

Thirty to forty-five minutes into me meditating, I feel like I couldn't move legit anything if I wanted to. It was actually kind of peaceful, though, instead of fearful - which is a new one for sleep paralysis. Then I feel them - yup, the vibrations! It's the first time I've ever felt them. I relax a little bit, feeling like I'm just... leaning into them, if that makes any sense at all. The vibrations weren't too intense, they were just calm and invigorating. 

So then I feel like I'm kind of floating out of my body? Idk how to describe it. I think floating's the right term. I open my eyes a little bit, and it's not my actual eyes; I can suddenly see myself right below me. I gasped and smiled. 

But then, of course, that was when my alarm went off - waking me up. 

Still, though, I'm really happy and excited for the next time I'll be able to do this, because now I know I can do it! :DD Im still new to astral projection so please take it easy on me!I have these shards of Pink Kunzite that I found in Willits, CA. I had been traveling for a month and finally got home to Oregon and I set the shards on my night stand. After I went to bed I had dreams about the farm I had just recently lived and worked on. I loved it so much. As I lay there I can see myself at angle I can’t describe. I realize I’m pulling myself out of my body and I stop. I begin again and successfully shift out of my body. As I shifted upwards I was only energy and it looked like a rainbow of crystals. I felt that I was just energy. I hopped onto the floor of my bedroom and crawled threw door ways like a cave man. Lmao fucking weirdHello I really want to share my experience. Just now I was in a dream where I was trying to sell a joint to a model for whatever ridiculous reason but the room straight up when completely dark and the model disappears for some reason but In my mind I realized wait I’m in a dream. Hold up wait a minute. So I’m looking around for a door and I see a couple but instead I decide I want to synthesize a door behind me which I decided would be a better bet because I’m creating a new door with the intent to astral project. I do this by imaging it and turning around to face the new door I created. This didn’t work so I’m like screw it I’ll use this door that’s just here. I am waiting for what I can assume is 30 seconds because I wanted to make sure I was as lucid as I could be in that dream state with a focus to project. I enter this door and I’m falling rapidly following by loud rapid vibrations and all I can see is darkness. Then deep fried images of YouTube comments in a slideshow for whatever reason but it felt like the weirdest state I’ve ever been in. The only word I remember from the comments is retard 😂 I’m not sure why or how. Anyways I feel my hands above my head twitching and then I wake up. 8:30am. I went to sleep around 3 am so I assume this is what woke me up. One more thing to note. After falling through the door and being in the state and presented with this ongoing slideshow of YouTube comments, I couldn’t close my eyes. Remarkable. I’m getting closer. I feel as if I should’ve commanded myself with affirmations to leave my body. Thank you for reading. Thoughts?This morning I discovered a new technique which helped me to induce and increase vibrations and eventually AP.

I've never heard of this method before - if you have, please share info.

Here's what I've done (unique part is step 4):

1. Went to bed at 10pm and woke up at 5am
2. Used the bathroom drank some water and went back to bed - laying on my back.
3. Tried to stay conscious and mindful as my body was going back to sleep until I hit the sweet spot (something between mind awake, body asleep and sleep paralysis)
4. I then started doing something which I can best describe as **Yawning without opening my mouth.** Imagine your ears get blocked in an airplane and you're trying to unblock it.
5. This immediately caused strong vibrations so I repeated the yawn over and over as vibrations increased.
6. I started to feel as if I was floating upwards and then bang!! the journey began...

This is the first time I was ever able to directly and consciously trigger an AP (previous APs were always from lucid dreams).

Hope that someone will find this helpful!

Peace  


*-=EDIT=-*  
*Thanks to all the commentators that contributed and educated me about the phenomenon called 'Ear Rumbling' (read more about it here:* r/earrumblersassemble \- *that topic is interesting and crazy by itself.*  
*Indeed, my Yawning trick seem to be very similar to ear rumbling, only I'm doing in a body a sleep, mind a wake state. Also, while the rumbling noise by it self is form of vibration, the vibrations I'm referring to that are being induced are far more intense.* Title says it all. I usually dab daily and I still have bizzars dreams at night. I have attempted to astral project yesterday and could feel myself in the vibration stage but I could not get through. Does dabbing inhibit my ability to astral project? I also drink caffeine everyday if that matters.I'm 13 and want to astral project. I'm wondering if I can still astral project safely because I'm wondering if my soul is strong enough to be able to stay safe in the astral plane. I don't want to mess anything up, so I'm just making sure before I start any trouble!!I call it the eyelid zoom, and although I've never AP'ed before I've never been unsuccessful in getting vibrations and tingling from this method.

Lay on your back and either turn off all the lights or cover your eyes.

Look into your eyelids, keep focusing and refocusing until you feel like you're zooming in. like focus on the darkness and try to bring it closer with your eyes. Once you get past a certain number of zooms you'll feel a falling sensation and your head will start tingling along with your arms and hands.

This is the furthest I've gotten bc I get scared of the feelings but if anyone feels more confident I'd love to see if you can find if it leads to AP. I have a hunch that it does, but like I said I get scared and jump back into my body.

Let me know if you have luck!I go to a place of pure darkness, and I’m floating, just pure energy. It’s incredibly peaceful. Last time I went I heard some gorgeous opera in the distance. 
Does anyone else do this??This is probably stupid but my mom is super strict and barely lets me go out so I was wondering if I astral projected would I be able to explore my town and see cool things 
And if I can are those things realI tried to astral project once and was woken up by fairies beside my bed telling me to come with them. I didn't go with them. I'm grumpy when woken up. So not thinking and grumpy I told them to f... Off I'm tired. They looked really insulted and left through the window. I haven't been able to get close to astral projection since.𝐆𝐚𝐳𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐀𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐤𝐲. 

Sometimes the simplest of goals after a successful projection can lead to some of the most profound experiences, like looking at the sky. 

It can be truly amazing, especially the night sky, Ooo, so beautiful and simple, I have seen so many wonders in the night sky, other planets, other galaxies, radiant stars, comets, black holes, colors, swirls, patterns, and more. 

The next time you find yourself on the Astral Plane, just stop ✋ take time to think, remember your goal, look up, and behold the beauty.

But today I put on pink floyd- the endless river, mostly an instrumental album, and in another app played third eye meditating frequency, and oh my goodness within minutes of the first track I was sinking into my bed it felt like I was seeing the music in the pitch black. Unreal experience. I stopped because i.got too excited and opened my eyes lol am going to carry on tonight. I recommend putting music you enjoy on, or even recommend this album because the sounds take you everywhere. And frequencies and meditation in a separate app.Whenever my friend astral projects, her silver chord isnt connected to her sleeping body whenever she looks back. Her chord leads to somewhere else but she tried to follow it and wakes up before she finds the end point. What could this mean ?I looked at the time before I started my attempt and then I started to relax, after a while I got completely relaxed and started to see shapes behind my closed eyes, I suddenly saw something which looked like an object?? Like something was forming out of the shaped I was seeing so I tried to focus on it and develop the picture when the vibrations started, they kind of distracted me from my main goal of focusing on the image because they were really intense and make me tense a bit. Since I got pretty distracted and I could feel the vibrations start to go I kind of gave up as I was too excited as I reached that stage pretty fast, I sat up and looked at the clock to see it had only been about 12 minutes!If it’s possible, can someone explain what’s inside ?  

Hello there! First of all, I hope you all **have a great year 2022**. I feel that this is going to be a great year, for many would-be projectors will finally achieve the out-of-body experience. To contribute to that I decided to write an extensive post with Astral projection instructions, FAQs with my answers, personal tips, book recommendations and resources to start the year strong! That being said, let’s start.  
 

**ASTRAL PROJECTION TERMINOLOGY**

Before we move onto the following sections, I am aware that we use a lot of terms and acronyms in the subreddit which may be confusing for the newcomer. Because of this, I wrote this post a few months ago which covers the most used terms and acronyms in the AP community.

**HOW TO ASTRAL PROJECT: QUICK INSTRUCTIONS**

There are many, many Astral projection methods and techniques—therefore to keep things simple, I will explain a very basic and universal strategy that happens to be the one that made me have my first out-of-body experience. When someone needs somewhere to start, I tend to explain this simple strategy due to my early successes with it. Here’s how to do it:

1.  Lie down, close your eyes and relax. Preferably be in a comfortable position.

2. Visualize, as vividly as possible, that you stand up from your bed and start moving around your house/apartment/office/wherever your body is. See how your point of view changes from staring at the ceiling from your bed, to seeing your room while standing up, then waking towards the hallway (or just opening a window and jumping outside), and so on. Do this with as much detail as possible, but don’t try to force it. 

3. You can incorporate other senses as well to make your immersive experience more convincing and realistic. As an example, you can use your imaginary hands to grab the doorknob to open the door—don’t just see how you do it; *feel it*! Feel the metallic texture and the smoothness of its surface. Also feel how your legs move and your feet touch the floor when you walk. Don’t just see how your legs move, but actually feel it. Incorporating auditory perceptions will make it even more real: the door creaking when opened, the sound of your feet as you walk, and so on.

4. Explore as much as you want. For instance, get out to the street and explore your neighborhood. Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, or the wind, hear the sound of the cars, etcetera. See it, feel it, hear it. The more detail you add, the more powerful it will be.

5. As you do this, ignore your real physical body and the external world. Just focus exclusively on the imaginary world that you are navigating. Eventually, you will have a genuine, full-blown out-of-body experience. 

Like I said, this is a very simple and intuitive way of inducing an OBE. It worked for me quite well when I started my Astral projection journey, and I hope it also works for you.

   
 **WAIT...I HAVE APHANTASIA! ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?**

The above strategy is clearly an imaginative technique—and this becomes a problem when we consider the fact that most people struggle to create mental imagery in their mind’s eye. It’s no wonder one of the most frequently asked questions is whether there are handy alternatives to methods involving visualization! 

Fortunately, there surely are alternatives to the instructions given above. But before discussing those strategies that do not require imagination, it is important to know the difference between the terms ‘visualization’ and ‘imagination’, for they are often used interchangeably when in reality they are not synonymous. It almost seems like if you cannot create mental imagery you cannot perform any technique involving imagination! However, nothing could be further from truth.

Simply put, imagination encompasses the five imaginary senses (i.e. the imaginary senses of sight, touch, smell, taste and hearing), whereas the term ‘visualization’ refers exclusively to visual imagination—that is to say, the deliberate or involuntary use of the imaginary sense of sight. The exercise above involves using *visualization*, yes*—*but it also encourages the use of all the other senses. The imaginary sense of sight is just one out of the five imaginary senses we can play with. If you happen to have aphantasia (i.e. the inability to create mental imagery), no problem! You can play with your other imaginary senses, *and still expect to Astral project*! 

While there are five imaginary senses, when it comes to having OBEs the most ‘powerful’ are the senses of sight, touch and hearing (don’t ask me the exact reason though! I simply assume it is because we base our perception of our body through these mainly). Thus, focusing on one of these is enough for you to start having successful out-of-body experiences. So then, with regard to the AP instructions given above, it’s okay if you cannot visualize what you are doing—you can use all your other senses (or even just one of them alone) and the strategy will still prove successful. Like I said, visualization is not essential to imaginative techniques, so it’s perfectly fine if you have aphantasia!

In fact, a long time ago I read an article by the OBE pioneer and author of the book ‘Astral Dynamics’, **Robert Bruce**, in which he realized that tactile imagination is as effective as regular visualization (if not more effective) based on a personal case involving blind students. This article, since it seems that it’s from the author’s old website, it’s almost impossible to find it on Google nowadays—luckily I found the link in an old Word document where I save resources I like. I encourage you to read it: [Robert Bruce Article on Tactile Imagination](https://www.astraldynamics.com/astral-projection/surprising-truth-causes-out-of-body-experiences.php)

There are also non-imaginative strategies as an alternative, such as **affirmations** (simply repeating phrases such as ‘I will have an out-of-body experience’ while dozing off), focusing on the heartbeat or **the ringing noise** in the ears while falling asleep, trying to separate immediately upon waking up, etc. You can also try bringing your body to a state of extreme exhaustion, which is quite powerful but it’s not something to do regularly due to how demanding it is. If you’re interested, I have written a post about this. Link: [Astral Projection via Physical Exhaustion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/okxgze/projecting_via_physical_exhaustion/)

But remember that ultimately all methods and techniques are a mere construct—a ‘ritual’ that we do to convey our intention to leave the body. For instance, my advice is not to become too rigid about a specific technique or method, and simply adapt them to your instead of the other way around. In my post ‘**The Illusion of Method: My Astral projection Guide**’ I elaborate on this—I encourage you to give it a read! Link: [The Illusion of Method AP Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/n9t307/the_illusion_of_method_my_ap_guide/)

**ASTRAL PROJECTION vs. LUCID DREAMING: KNOW THE DIFFERENCES**

One of the most frequently asked questions in our subreddit is *whether Astral projection and Lucid dreaming are the same thing or not*. And no wonder—there seems to be little to no consensus whatsoever! However, I can say that **both experiences are very different** in many aspects. In the following lines I will explain the most obvious differences all of which I have personally experienced and confirmed, while also quoting well-known authorities in the field as a supplement. That being said, these are the six main differences between AP and LD:

1. They take place in different planes of experience. The astral is a **subtle copy of the physical world**; therefore, it has some coherence in this regard. You can expect to see the contents and locations of the physical plane mirrored in the astral dimension. However, the dream world can be absurd and nonsensical, symbolic and bizarre, not adjusting to the physical world as such. In a dream, the locations change in a blink of an eye and they don’t always make sense.

2. In a lucid dream you can modify the setting and its contents through willpower alone, for the dream itself is an illusory world created by your subconscious mind (i.e. we are the God in our own space while lucid dreaming). However, **the astral plane is independent from the projector**, being a mere visitor. Thus, an astral projector cannot change the astral plane through willpower or thought, in the same way we cannot change the waking reality through intention alone. In his contribution to the Lucidity Letter, the well-known OBE pioneer Robert Monroe said the following:

>"The lucid dreamer awakens to find himself in within a dream which is internal in origin. He can at will obliterate or change both setting, participants, and action. \[...\] The willful OB practitioner produces de OB state, then moves to a desired destination. He has no control over the reality of such location. He cannot change its content, texture, the persons involved, nor significantly affect the activity in progress".  
>  
>***— ROBERT MONROE.*** *"Wanted: New Mapmakers of the Mind", Lucidity Letter 4, no. 2 (December 1985).*

3. Another thing that clearly differentiates APs from lucid dreams is our degree of recall. Simply put, **the memory of an OBE is crystal-clear**, whereas the memory of a dream fades away easily upon waking up and you have to do an effort to remember all details, “reconstructing” the memories. But in the case of OBEs, you clearly recall everything as if it were a waking experience. You can also have a very bad dream recall but clearly remember all OBEs. This is my case: I tend to struggle with recalling my dreams, but I’ve never had difficulties in remembering my out-of-body experiences. Author Robert Waggoner seems to experience the same thing:

>"*The memory of a long OBE experience seems crystal clear and easily recalled in a linear order, while memory of an equally long lucid dream seems less detailed and more difficult to recall precisely and in order. Many lucid dreamers, myself included, report this hampered memory with long lucid dreams, though my long OBE experiences seem comparatively clear, memorable, and detailed".*  
>  
>***— ROBERT WAGGONER.*** *Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self.*

This can be related to the fact that OBEs tend to be hyperrealistic, whereas but lucid dreams are still dreams and therefore even the most realistic lucid dream is still not as realistic as a full-blown genuine OBE. 

4.  The **onset and the conclusion of each experience** is radically different. We access both a lucid and a non-lucid dream *by falling asleep*, and conclude the experience *by waking up* from that dream. However, we access an OBE by feeling how we *leave our physical body* (this is accompanied by a plethora of sensations, from the famous vibrations all the way to an intense ear ringing noise or the ears plugging as we were on an airplane) and conclude it by *returning to the body*. The return to the body is an essential thing, and can happen either voluntarily or accidentally—but it’s there, just as the exit part.

5. Astral Projection has some bonus effects that are quite transformative, such as **losing the fear of death** either temporarily or permanently. I have personally experienced this (I no longer have this anxious fear of death, and I used to be very fearful of it before my first projection), and also seems to be the case of the Lucid dreaming and OBE researched Ed Kellogg:

>"*After my first fully conscious OBE as an adult I lost my fear of death because now I knew, in some sort of inarguable way, that I could exist without a physical body"*.  
>  
>***— E.W. KELLOGG III, Ph.D.*** *Out-of-Body Experiences and Lucid Dreams: A Phenomenological Approach*

6.  Last but not least, you can **Astral project from a lucid dream**—in fact, this is a very common AP strategy, being present in many OBE books. Needless to say, this alone reveals that Astral projection is not a synonym of lucid dreaming, otherwise APing from a lucid dream wouldn’t be possible. In the following section I will explain four different ways to achieve this.

Here’s the link to the two essays by Ed Kellogg quoted in this section (they're free on [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu), it just requires a login to download):

**-** ***Out-of-Body Experiences and Lucid Dreams: A Phenomenological Approach*** **by Ed Kellogg.** [here's the link](https://www.academia.edu/21833634/Out_of_Body_Experiences_and_Lucid_Dreams_A_Phenomenological_Approach).

**CAN I PROJECT FROM A LUCID DREAM?**

Yes**, you can project from a lucid dream**. This is a very common strategy to induce OBEs. Although it is by no means a “must”, some people prefer to take this apparently ‘less direct’ route for many reasons (e.g. it’s easier to project from the dream state and you don’t have to invest waking hours into Astral Projection). These are the four ways I know to project from a lucid dream:

**-** ***Strategy n. 1*****:** When you are in a lucid dream, tell your subconscious mind to project you out of your physical body (you can say this aloud since the whole dream and all its contents an expression of the subconscious mind). This is what I personally do, and after a few seconds I experience the typical exit signals (strong vibrations, peculiar dizziness, and so on) and have a full-blown AP. This is the one I recommend personally because it’s the one I use and always works for me.

**-** ***Strategy n. 2*****:** A good alternative is to try crossing a door, bridge or any other similar element in the dream with the intention to “access” the astral plane. This is rather a symbolic act meant to convey your intention to separate from your physical body as you leave the oneiric landscape behind. When compared to the first strategy it’s a bit more “complex” (the former is the most basic expression of this intention), but works quite well and it’s the preferred course of action of many astral projectors. 

**-** ***Strategy n. 3:*** The third one is also a favorite of mine, and it involves opening your astral eyes through a deliberate act, pretty much like when you open your fleshy eyelids upon waking up. The idea behind this is that, since the oneiric realm is a subjective illusion and in the dream state you are kind of “equidistant” from both the physical and the astral, you can open either the fleshy eyes or the astral eyes (this is my way to explain it in simple terms) and awaken to the illusion of the dream. That is to say, if during a dream you try to open your astral eyes—you must do this without trying too hard since you can accidentally open the physical ones—then you will kind of force an OBE by placing your consciousness and perception directly in the astral body. I know this may not make much sense since it’s hard to put into words, but the practical application is simple: just gently and effortlessly try to open your astral 

**-** ***Strategy n.4:*** last but not least, some people also mention flying upwards at a very high speed (OBE author Robert Bruce specifically suggests flying in a 45-degree angle). I haven't personally tested this one, but it is a quite widespread tactic so I thought it was worth being included here. 

In short, projecting from a lucid dream can be as simple or as complicated as you want, but I very much believe in simply asking aloud to your own subconscious to project you, since this is the simplest expression of your intention.

As for lucid dreaming instructions, there are really a lot of techniques, guides and stuff out there—from reality checks and the MILD technique, all the way to *dreamscaping* or *dream incubation*. But to me, the golden strategy is to **simply set the intention to lucid dream**, and once this is done, simply allow your mind to ‘wander’ until you doze off. Simplicity beats over-complicated methods and techniques, so my suggestion is to stick to that and repeat until you finally lucid dream. Alternatively, you can set aside traditional lucid dreaming strategies in an attempt to be creative, exploring new ways to achieve lucid awareness in dreams. Here’s an example of an interesting technique I discovered long ago: [My occasional technique to induce Lucid Dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/nfpooc/my_occasional_technique_to_induce_ld/)

**MEDITATION TO ASTRAL PROJECT: TIPS & INSIGHTS**

One of the most discussed topics in our sub is meditation. Astral projection and meditation seem to go hand in hand, and this has led most practitioners to learn how to meditate in an attempt to induce OBEs. 

While I think meditation is a good support practice and it has many benefits, the first thing that I want to point out is that **meditation is not a prerequisite for Astral projection**. I myself have been having mind-blowing, hyperrealistic OBEs for a few years now and never relied on meditation to do it, nor incorporated it as part of my practice. So if you feel the urge to meditate because of the idea that you need it, then I would suggest reconsidering it. Yes, meditation is helpful insofar as it contributes to a more relaxed and detached approach to AP—but you can do this by yourself, without the need of meditation.

That being said, let’s discuss the other big problem that I think is an important cause of failure when it comes to APing via meditation: *turning meditation into a method to Astral project*. Most people struggle to project via meditation because, it is approached as if it were an AP strategy, when in reality the reason what OBEs happen as a side-effect of meditation is because there is no goal whatsoever—and this, of course, includes AP. Meditation is the act of resting in awareness—it has no purpose, and therefore turning it into an OBE strategy makes it lose its “power” to project you out of body, so to speak.

In other words, if you sit or lie down and have a firm intention to astral project, then by definition you are no longer meditating—no matter if you are doing a guided visualization or similar stuff. Meditation is meditation. To meditate you must rest in detachment (having no goal, no urge, and just being aware). OBEs that are a side-effect of meditation happen *precisely* because you don’t have that goal in mind. That’s why, in my honest opinion, projecting via meditation is such a headache for many! 

In short, if you want to have OBEs via meditation you have to *meditate*. And that’s it. You don’t have to try and induce the experience—don’t even think actively about it. Just meditate. Should you need somewhere to start, I highly recommend **Vipassana meditation**. It is the meditation strategy per excellence, and I have had very good results with it. Here’s how to do it:

1. Sit or lie down comfortably.

2. Observe your breathing for a few minutes to achieve focus. 

3. You will soon start to feel a plethora of physical sensations such as itching, heat, involuntary spasms, energy circulating throughout the body…all these are the sensations that constitute the body. Observe all these sensations when they show up, but don’t try to judge them or react to them. Simply become aware of how they pop up, do their thing and leave.

4. As you practice you will also notice that, aside from physical sensations, a stream of random thoughts will try to draw your attention. Do the same as in the previous step: just observe them until they leave.

5. You can use breath as the “center” or “place of return” i.e. the place to return when the sensation or thought that you observe leaves and you feel that you have nothing else to become aware of. Thus, every time a sensation leaves, just focus again on your breath until the next sensation or thought manifests.

6. The overall idea, as you can see, is to simply become aware of what enters and leaves your perceptual field without reacting. Just being a passive witness of your direct experience and nothing more.

This is a very simple instruction in performing Vipassana. I have had out-of-body experiences by practicing the instructions above while lying down, but theoretically you can achieve it by sitting as well. What works for me is to set a very subtle intention to Astral project as a preliminary thing prior to the meditation, and then forget about it completely during Vipassana. The problem is when “having an OBE” is your mental goal during the meditation, since you are essentially moving away from the experience by doing that.

Another good and insightful explanation can be found in the book ***Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha*** by Daniel Ingram (to me, one of the best books on the subject). Chapters 5 and 6 go in-depth into Vipassana—it’s really a good read for anyone genuinely interested in Buddhism and/or meditation. Here’s a link to a free pdf version offered by the author: [MCTB by Daniel Ingram](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5037f52d84ae1e87f694cfda/t/5ffd1727eb14ac3b416c6889/1610422062492/MCTB2+Complete+PDF+Final+copy.pdf)

  

**ASTRAL PROJECTION AND MUSIC: BINAURAL BEATS…AND WHAT ELSE?**

When it comes to music as a tool to Astral project, the first thing that’s mentioned in the AP circles is **binaural beats**. On a personal level, they have never worked for me, so it is not something I would recommend. However, I do have something to share which worked quite well for me a few years ago—***percussion***. It is something that has been used since ancient times by shamans because it can induce Altered States of Consciousness due to its direct impact on the nervous system.

The most common music for this, obviously, is **shamanic drumming music**. By simply listening to it for some time one can easily achieve a trance state that is very suitable for Astral Projection. You can listen to it as background music while practicing the OBE strategy of your choice, or simply focus on the drumming with the intention to project.

On YouTube there are quite a few good shamanic drumming music that you can listen to. Of course, if you have a drum yourself then it's way better than a recorded session by someone else; if that's the case you could ask someone to drum for you while you practice. But if you don’t have a drum, then listening to shamanic tapes will work just as well—just remember to use headphones or ear buds to feel the vibration of percussion! 

Here’s a personal selection:

**ASTRAL BLINDNESS: SEEING EVERYTHING BLACK AFTER PROJECTION**

One of the most common problems that projectors experience immediately after separating from the physical body is ***astral blindness***. Simply put, astral blindness is the inability to see once out of body. When it comes to Astral projection, everything tends to be idealized, and this is especially true about one’s first OBEs. It’s easy to assume that the first projection will be amazing and a lot of things will be seen and done…until astral blindness kicks in. My first projection was basically seeing everything black and returning to body, so if that has been your case too, don’t worry—it’s an entirely normal thing. And if you haven’t projected yet, it’s good to know that this can happen (doesn’t mean it will happen, but it is a possibility). 

While this is nothing bad, it can be frightening if you don’t expect it. Furthermore, astral blindness is quite easy to solve! In the following post I explain what to do if you find yourself having astral blindness shortly after successfully leaving your physical body: [Dealing with Astral Blindness Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pd7zv7/dealing_with_astral_blindness/)

   
 **THE SLEEPINESS FACTOR: HOW TO AVOID DOZING OFF BY ACCIDENT**

A very common problem when it comes to Astral projection is falling asleep against one’s will. This has given form to a very frequently asked question: “How to Astral project without falling asleep?”. Well, the answer to that question is the following: **if you practice before going to bed,** ***don’t do it***. 

Sleepiness is often underestimated, and this translates in many practitioners trying to project at night before going to bed. I myself did this a lot during my first months of practice a few years ago, and the result was always the same: *I kept falling asleep over and over again*. It seemed to me that the only possible way to project was before going to bed, and that I had to find a way to deal with that massive sleepiness…until I started practicing during waking hours. When I did this, the number of OBEs I had skyrocketed. Since then I no longer practice at night.

I know there is a solid reason to avoid practicing during waking hours: having to work and study. I also work and study, so the key is to find those moments where one can practice. The days off is the most relevant option, however trying to project as soon as one wakes up is also a good way to do this. Why? Because you are rested from a full night sleep, and your body is still slightly tired which makes it easier and faster to project. Another good option is in the evening; when I have a free evening, if I don’t find myself too tired I try to leave my physical body as well. It’s all about knowing your own schedule and trying to find those free moments. Just think that any moment is better than nighttime, which tends to be an almost guaranteed failure.

If you still want to Astral project at night, I suggest doing it **via lucid dreaming** as explained earlier.

**ABOUT ASTRAL PROJECTION FEARS**

When it comes to AP, a lot of fears assault the beginners. Since most of them are unfounded, allow me to analyze them to reveal their inconsistency. There are 4 main fears:

1. The first fear, ***getting lost and therefore not being able to return***, find its roots in our deepest fear, which is the fear of the unknown (in this case, the astral). It is perfectly normal that we fear that our lack of knowledge of this realm (i.e. our lack of a ‘map’ so to speak) makes us wonder what will happen if we get lost and cannot return. However, this should not be a problem, because **we always return to our body** whether we like it or not. Our brain can force us to return against our will. In fact, this is the most natural and common thing when beginning: chances are you find that your astral exploration are quite short because, after projecting, you are absorbed back to body against your will. There is no such thing as remaining in the astral forever, so rest assured! You can get lost as much as you want.

2. The second fear, ***our body being possessed by evil entities during Astral projection***, is based on the fallacy that, when we astral project, our body is left as an empty vessel, open to the other inhabitants of the astral realm to animate it. But this is not how Astral projection works—it’s rather a misconception The reason why corporeal possession during Astral projection is impossible is quite simple: **our ‘soul’ does not abandon the body** **during an AP**. If that was the case, the body would be clinically dead during the astral journey. That's surely the case in the so-called Near-Death Experiences, and that’s why they are a category of OBE that’s completely different from Astral projection. 

However, astral projection doesn't occur at the verge of passing away; *we still breathe, and our heartbeat doesn't stop*. Whatever thing you believe that animates our body (call it soul, essence, life force or whatever) remains in the body during an astral journey. For instance, what we project is, in reality, our perspective embodied in its astral form. *Consciousness is non-local*, which means that it can move away from the body as much as it wishes while the body is perfectly alive. In the following quote Robert Bruce discusses this fallacy (which he refers to as the *empty body assumption)*:

>""*This empty body assumption, like a lot of early research and books on OBE and related fields, became source material for all researchers and writers that followed in their footsteps \[referring to Harrington and Muldoon, OBE pioneers\]. This error in observation has been continually propagated ever since. It is today almost universally accepted that the physical body is left empty, unguarded, and exposed during any type of OBE. Many people even believe their essential spirit or soul leaves their physical body during a projection. These beliefs, quite understandably, raise real concerns about safety and integrity during an OBE.*   
>  
>*If the mind and spirit did actually leave the physical body empty during an OBE, it would be logical to assume that this empty body could easily be vulnerable to outside interference. The possibility of psychic attack, or even of possession, would be reasonable concerns."*   
>  
>***—ROBERT BRUCE.*** *Astral Dynamics: A NEW Approach to Out-of-Body Experience.*   

3. The third fear, ***being attacked or harmed by evil astral entities***, is definitely the most common. A great amount of posts in our subreddit are related to this fear, so I consider of utmost importance to give an answer to this concern. From my own experience and that of others, nothing can harm you while out of body. However, that doesn’t mean that you cannot **have unpleasant experiences**—if you are fearful, worried or even paranoid, those emotions will become amplified out there and you will certainly want to return. The way I see it, just **having a dominant and confident attitude is all you need** to navigate the astral realm. I have encountered a few creepy entities in out-of-body travels throughout the years and nothing weird, unusual or frightening happened. At first it’s scary, but the more you explore the more used you become. And since you can always return to your body, there’s nothing to fear really. *Your desire to explore the astral must be stronger than your fear of it*.

4. Last but not least, the fourth fear: *dying because of Astral projection*. This usually takes the form of the **fear** **of having one’s silver cord severed**. According to OBE literature, a subtle cord called the silver cord connects our astral body with our physical body. While the perception of this cord is not universal (most projectors do not see it), there seems to be some consensus about its existence. As a result of that, the fear that this cord could be severed and kill us has become quite widespread. However, it doesn't work like that. Nothing you do, not even projecting on a frequent basis, can permanently separate you from your physical body. I will leave another quote by Bruce about this:

> "*The silver cord, as far as I can ascertain, is invulnerable and therefore unbreakable. I have spent a lot of time out of my body, and have experimented, explored, and ranged widely. I have often found myself in some pretty extreme situations. If it were possible to be destroyed by severing the silver cord, I would certainly have died many times over. Nor can it be damaged simply because a projection is suddenly ended, no matter under what circumstances or how abruptly."*  
>  
>***—ROBERT BRUCE.*** *Astral Dynamics: A NEW Approach to Out-of-Body Experience.*

In short, it is perfectly understandable to experience fear regarding a topic like Astral projection. However, it is crucial to realize that fears are just fears, and therefore the best antidote to that is to project on a frequent basis and realize, through direct experience, that there’s nothing to be worried about. 

   
 **ABOUT THE VIBRATIONAL STATE**

If there is a thing that causes more struggle and confusion than anything else, it is the so-called *vibrations* or ‘**vibrational state’**. However, let me tell you something: **vibrations are not to be pursued**. They are not the source or cause of OBEs, but simply a sensation that arises as a ‘side-effect’ of the practice. The problem comes when we pick up this symptomatic sensation and turning it into the goal; *but vibrations are not the goal*. The goal is the out-of-body experience, and as you approach the end result many sensations will show up, but none of them will trigger the experience. 

In the following post I briefly explain how to proceed regarding the vibrations: [Tips on How to deal with the Vibrational State](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/nficwu/tips_on_how_to_deal_with_the_vibrational_state/)

   
 [**r/AstralProjection**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection) **RESOURCES**

Although I believe this post to have the necessary information to have a clear idea of what Astral projection is and how to get started, I want to take the present post as an opportunity to remind newcomers that we already have a lot of information available in the subreddit. Our subreddit has three main sources of information available for newcomers that give an answer to the basic questions: **the Wiki, Gene’s pinned post** and our many **A.M.A. (Ask Me Anything) posts**.

**1.** [**r/AstralProjection**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection) **Wiki and Gene’s pinned post**

Like I said, our subreddit has a lot of information in *Gene’s pinned post* (you can see it by filtering post results by “**Hot**” posts; pinned posts do not show up if you are searching “**New**” posts) and in the *subreddit’s Wiki page* (you can access it from the top menu). These are good places to start; if you are a newcomer, take a look at those two sources to have a more than solid base to start with AP.

**2.** **A.M.A.s (Ask Me Anything): A great tool in our subreddit**

The other great source of information in the [r/AstralProjection](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection) subreddit is the so-called **A.M.A.s. (Ask me Anything)**. They are a format that allows members to ask meaningful questions to Experienced projectors from the sub, and therefore aside from the guides, videos and stuff, this is a good source of valuable information and insights. I myself have done four Ask Me Anything posts so far (links to the [First A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/nvs4mh/feel_free_to_ask_me_about_ap/), [Second A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pnicd8/i_have_been_projecting_for_years_ask_me_anything/), [Third A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/q8muqi/i_have_been_projecting_for_years_ask_me_anything/) and [Fourth A.M.A.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/rn4xr4/i_have_been_astral_projecting_for_years_ask_me/)), but aside from that our sub has many A.M.A.s from a wide variety of experienced members! I really encourage you to **search by the flair filter “A.M.A. (Ask Me Anything)”** to easily access them. There are links to A.M.A.s in the mentioned pinned post by Gene as well.

Thank you for reading! I hope it has helped you to some extent and I really wish you plenty of successful out-of-body experiences this year! <3I'm curiousLast night I astral projected, and was having trouble getting out of my body. I had to have rolled out of my body at least five times. One of these times, I thought I saw something outside the crack of my door, and called out “hey!!” I’m at my bedside and turn around and look up and near my ceiling is a mouse! I see its tail flowing as it floats in the air. I ask, “are you a mouse?” He says, “I’m the Grinch.” That was my experience in the astral. That wasn’t the first time I saw a mouse in my room in the astral. A couple months ago I saw one running around my floor while APing.

For a long while now, there has been animal living in my ceiling. It doesn’t bother me, I call it my roommate. However I had no clue what kind of animal it was. I’d known about it living up there for a few weeks, and a couple days ago I heard it scurry around in circles up there as if it was running from something. I told my mom earlier today about my astral experience, and she said, “maybe it’s the animal living in your ceiling.” Now, here I am the DAY AFTER seeing a mouse in the astral right below my ceiling where the animal lives. THERE IS A MOUSE IS MY ROOM!! I saw it stop and look at me before crawling under the crack of my door. When I saw him, my jaw dropped. I was speechless. He stood still long enough for me to get a short video.

This is a HUGE shocker to me. I haven’t seen a mouse in real life in years. I hadn’t tried too hard to guess what animal was in my ceiling, my best guess would have been a squirrel. And a day after we meet in the astral, Grinch goes and meets me in person!!!

UPDATE: I have officially caught The Grinch with a catch and release trap. As soon as I heard it go off, I set up a tote with diced apple slices, a small bowl of water, napkins for a base, a little cardboard shelter, and a little night light in there for him until we drive him far enough away in the morning where he can find a new home. It hurts my heart to see him go and see him trying to jump out of the container I’ve made for him, but it’s better than having a wild mouse roam the house and having him stuck in a tiny trap.

UPDATE 2.0: The Grinch chewed a hole in the tote and escaped... he wasn’t even in there for 2 hours and the hole wasn’t even bigger than an inch in diameter.. I officially no longer like The Grinch.

UPDATE 3.0: The Grinch was released a couple miles away from the house. Hopefully he found a new home/shelter before any predators found him.[ I tell the girls and another dark-haired guy that I am from another reality. That I have shifted. Then I say I think I may have time-shifted](http://www.dreamjournal.net/journal/229848/S3TH/RealityTime-Shifting/)

The first segment that preceded it.

[Trying to write my phone number ](http://www.dreamjournal.net/journal/229847/S3TH/Third-Rote-in-England/)I used to have sleep paralysis at night my entire life and its always been the same until just recently. I used to have sleep paralysis where I felt like something was dragging me and I couldn't call out for help nor move my body. My eyes would never open during sleep paralysis. And I never knew I was in bed, I dreamed that I was being dragged across the floor of my room by an entity that I couldn't see. No matter how hard I tried to scream nothing would come out.  


But for the vast majority of my life it would only happen once per night and I would be able to wake myself up out of it. But in the past year, My life went to s*** and the night terrors got a lot worse. I I began having a type of sleep paralysis where I felt a presence standing over me. Sometimes I was able to wake myself up by rocking my body back and forth in the dream and trying to scream as loud as I can and that would wake me up screaming and thrashing about. Other times, I would make noises at night during these night terrors and my boyfriend would wake me up.


BUT NOW........ I have been having these experiences at night where I feel like I am leaving my own body and being flung through the room, sometimes stuck to the ceiling, sometimes under the bed, sometimes like I fell off the bed, and ill scream for my boyfriend to wake me up, and then I dream that my boyfriend has woken me up out of the sleep paralysis (if that what it was), but it isn't real. 


So then I DREAM that I wake up, sit up like a normally do when I actually wake up out of sleep paralysis, readjust my body, try to relax, and go back to sleep. BUT THAT'S ALL A DREAM. BUT IT FEELS REAL. VIDID. 


Then it happens all over again. I float all around the room, kinda able to control where I'm floating, then I get thrown against something again. Then I call out from my boyfriend to help me again. And then I dream he wakes me up again. And this process repeats over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over until I finally wake up. 


in order to astral project,it's a real thing, you first have to put your body into sleep paralysis. I've never tried to astral project before but my sleep paralysis is like the flip version of actual astral projection.

Apparently, according to what I've read, what normally happens is that people intentionally put themselves into sleep paralysis, stay calm, and then they are able to pull themselves out of their own body. But for me the process is the exact opposite. 

NORMAL PEOPLE: Intentional sleep paralysis, intentional astral projection.

Me: Unintentional astral projection, then sleep paralysis while still in astral body. 

Uncontrollable astral projection takes place first, I feel a force pulling me out of body, then after the fearful feeling of my inner being sucked out of my peacefully sleeping meat suit, I then realize "Woah am I astral projecting right now?" I then think "Cool" and the fearful feeling completely subsides. I'm able to control how I float around the room for a short period of time but can never break out of whatever room it is I fall asleep in. Sometimes I'll try to but the ability to "walk through walls" or "go anywhere in the world" doesn't allow whatever type of being I am at this time to ever leave the room. I'll then just enjoy the sensations of weightlessly floating around the room knowing well I am fully conscious and in control. 

Then, out of nowhere some strange force throws me somewhere in the room and I'm left paralyzed in that spot with the return of the same fearful feeling I felt while being unwillingly forced out of my body. And then I'm just stuck in that spot screaming out to my boyfriend for help until I "DREAM" that my boyfriend wakes me up out of sleep paralysis and I'm back in my body. Then the same thing repeats throughout the entire night until I wake up in the morning and realize that I never actually woke up at all that night.

Note: The room is always exactly the same as it was previous to falling asleep, I am always aware of seeing my boyfriend in the bed sleeping from above, but the weirdest thing of all is that my body is always GONE!!! 
 
THIS ISN'T NORMAL. In all the countless OBE and Astral Projection stories I've heard they always CLEARLY state that they can see themselves sleeping from above but my body is never there! It's always missing!!!

This is like inception or something, dreams within a dream within a dream, and it's driving me insane. I never see or feel any entities, shadowy figures or anything like that. But being paralyzed is extremely terrifying because I can't move. BUT worst of all is the morning realization that I never actually woke up the night before sends shivers down my spine. When I clearly remember waking up numerous times by the help of my boyfriend. 


Can someone please tell me what to do??????? Things are getting out of hand. My night terrors/sleep paralysis/nightmares... I don't even know what they are. 


***(Update)***
After opening up and writing out this post and seeing all your comments my sleep paralysis/weird out of body experiences haven't happened all this week!! Thank you all for helping me out and giving me good advice/practices! I've been meditating and setting intentions before bed, which I'm sure helped tremendously! As well as taking time to ground myself by walking around outside barefoot in the dirt.  Just the fact I got to get this all off my chest was very healing. It feels like a load off my shoulders knowing I'm not alone nor the only one who experiences this! Thank you all SO SO SO much!!! ❤️❤️❤️Let’s say you trying to project whilst lying on your back and are getting no luck. I know I personally struggle to get to the vibrational stage on my back and get minimal vibrations for the most part. These minimal vibrations go on forever. It’s also just not that comfy for me and especially after I lie on my back for hours. I get tired and restless. I would get disheartened and give up. Until I learnt “my own” technique.  

So what I learnt is: 

1.)Try mediate to sleep while lying on your back. If your mind wonders and creates imagery that’s fine but mediation is key and return to it. So keep focusing on the breath and I’ll explain why in step two. Now after unsuccessfully trying to project from lying on your back for around an hour and you would normally give up. It’s time for a new technique. Plan B baby. Stretch your body and then lie mainly on your stomach and settle a bit more into trying to sleep. Or do whatever’s comfy to be honest. Even grab a sleeping pillow for your arm if you want. You can even stop mediating now.

2.) Try fall asleep now(yes you heard me) but remain on the lookout for slight vibrations and keep your intention to project. If you can feel stronger vibrations after changing position, continue to step 3 below. 

If this doesn’t happen but you tried to mediated yourself to sleep on your back earlier you should now be able to “catch” yourself right before falling asleep without vibrations. The mindfulness/awareness you were working on seems to step in like a metaphorical generator when your consciousness should shut off and your body falls asleep. You should get a dropping feeling , like your body’s gearing down your consciousness to sleep. When you feel this drop it almost wakes you back up from falling asleep. Your wakefulness could even have just hung on by a thread at this point 

3.)After getting some good vibrations. Or almost falling asleep and having the dropping feeling , which you should get accompanied by immediate signs of slight vibrations. Note both of these new vibrations will(or should be) be stronger then the ones than what you experienced originally on your back. Stay very slightly awake. Don’t try wake yourself up at this point

4.)Very important! If you haven’t already, it’s time to turn onto your back, get comfy and continue trying to sleep/relax but with the slightest consciousness just to make sure you don’t actually fall asleep. Within normally around five minutes of turning to my back I start seeing flashes of lights, followed by much stronger vibrations and even noises. This then means no more trying to trick your body that you were trying to sleep. 

5.)Now ramp up your conscious! Put that consciousness into 5th gear! 

6.)Once you at this point with your mind awake and strong vibrations. Focus on the vibrations and amp those guys right up. You can do this by simply focusing on them whilst surrendering to the sensations. I even feel a slight pressure on my head(by my third eye) and the more I concentrate on the pressure as well as the vibrations the stronger the vibrations get. 

6.)After a while of strong vibrations I then just pop out. Separate how you please but I normally just pop out my body from here. Also I believe from my experience that it’s safer to just wait until you pop out then prematurely try a separation technique out. 

NOTE:
I personally wear a sleeping mask. There’s something about it that helps me get into the zone. I also know if I can see - it’s my astral vision.  I also do the wake back to bed method on 6 hours of sleep which is probably only effect for my particular method. I read for 10 minutes after getting awake enough, then I try to attempt my projection. I also do a guided mediation before the 6 hour sleep and an hour mediation prior to this. I normally have a beer or two at night as it helps me relax. Not necessarily important but whatever. Normally I try project around 6 am or 7 am. Timing does play a difference in my opinion. Lastly and most weirdly, I find sleeping naked if possible helps a lot with relaxation and also itches. 

Don’t use your phone/screens before sleeping, avoid pornography if possible and try not too eat too close to sleeping. 
 
Thought I’d list all the weird things I do incase it can help you lol. 

Hope this helps and works for you. 

This was done on mobile so sorry about formatting.Okay so I lay down in bed thinking about a question that I would ask when I found the deceased loved one, ya know.. just in case. Anyway I started relaxing and doing my breathing exercises. I was only here about ten minutes thinking about my loved one and I felt the vibrations all through my body but I could see, with my eyes shut. I went through a portal and landed somewhere dark but the ground around me was white but looked like grass. The vibrations got so intense my heart rate rapidly increased and nearly pounded out of my chest so i opened my eyes very slowly and the vibrations went away and I calmed my heart rate down with water and deep breaths. Does anyone know where I went? Or why the vibrations got so intense?Let me start off by saying i smoke alot of cannabis (if that has anything to do with it) but anyway i had fallen asleep normally after coming back from work and woke up at about six am. I smoked once and was just on my phone. I then smoked again and thats when i fell alseep, i slowly was felt being that i was wiggiling out of my body. I didnt really feel something pulling me out, i just remember trying to get out of my physical body however, i do recall being surrounded by a warm prescence and i wasnt scared at all. I also did three reality checks, finger/palm, skin stretch and i looked in the mirror. It was crazy but not scary, then i managed to wiggle out and i slowly started floating up and i went unto the roof. After that i was back in my body and  i was trying to become lucid and maybe just create a dream but i had no luck, i did see some visuals for a sec but nothing exciting. Usually im always trying to become lucid or project but this time i just fell asleep and it happened. Anyway let me know what you guys think, thanks!Hey folks,


I have a pet project that might be interesting for you.
Its a web page that gathers dreams.


[dreamflock.com](https://dreamflock.com/)


An idea is very simple, to see do people dream the same thing at the same time in some particular country. 


Its a silly idea that came to mind when I spoke with a friend. We were thinking could people have premonitions in their dreams. Like, dreaming something in particular before some major event in your country ( like terrorist attack).


In case of this subreddit it would be interesting to see how many people had astral projection at the same time.Spiritual warfare ?I am really curious and want to invest my time and energy in AP but this question always bugs me.The past week I have woken up randomly in the middle of the night and have seen these purple orbs floating above me. I’ll stare at it and then it will slowly move away from me and disappear. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else.In my opinion, Tom is the worlds premiere researcher of OBE. Even more than Bob Monroe. It was in fact Tom who created the idea of binaural beats to induce OBE's at TMI. He's been researching OBE and consciousness for 40 years now. His YouTube channel is FULL of information if anyone is interested.

Anyway, here's a quick summery of his background and research.

Pt. 1 [https://youtu.be/L\_RfzxT0liA](https://youtu.be/L_RfzxT0liA)

Pt. 2 [https://youtu.be/A8e9MyFuwes](https://youtu.be/A8e9MyFuwes)

Pt. 3 [https://youtu.be/EsNi\_K-v11k](https://youtu.be/EsNi_K-v11k)Sorry about the long title.  I’m reading a lot of posts and people talk about achieving the “vibrational state” and I’m confused as to what this is exactly?  What’s vibrating?  How do I control this?  How would I recognize this? What do I do or think about to achieve this?  Sorry for being a moron, but it’s a fascinating subject and I would like to know about what I’m supposed to be feeling.  Thanks!I came so close to APing today. I got to the vibrational stage very quickly and suddenly and felt a heavy weight on my limbs that gave way to a feeling of lightness all over my body. It felt like I was floating. But I wasn't.

When that floating feeling came, I got scared. This happens every time.  I'm scared that what I see and experience will be too much to handle. I call out mentally, asking for any benevolent beings nearby to come and be with me/keep me safe. Nothing responds.

Is what I want impossible then? I feel like I'll only succeed in projecting if someone helps me, or at least makes their presence known so I won't be afraid. But it would appear that's not likely to ever happen. Am I right in thinking this or is there someone I could pray to for help/support?I was astral projecting and got out of my house and saw this huge thing, it wasn't a monster or person, but more like a presence; very similar to a sleep paralysis demon, but it wasn't. It was huge, like, towering over the town, like the mind flayer from stranger things, it looked at me and I forced myself to wake up.  


This was truly horrifying. I knew it was astral projection due to vibrations etc.  


Do any experienced people know what the hell is going on?There was a time when I used to practice lucid dreaming on a daily basis. I mostly used the WILD method to meditate into a dream state and could use that to expand my conscious experience. I was certain that there was something more to reality than what was being presented to us through the waking experience.

Well, I was right. My most powerful spiritual experience happened deep in one of the most profound dreams I ever had. I liked to stay in control of myself but let my subconscious choose the environment I was in and what was going on. 

This led to me landing on an island. This island would later become extremely important to me symbolically because of the events that I am about to tell you. I have come to know this island as the place where my conscious and unconscious mind communicate with one another.

My first time there, I walked among ruins on a tropical beach. There was a crack in the ancient road, and I became aware that by stepping over it, I would never be the same again. 

Naturally, after some hesitation, I took a step. That was when reality began to break down. In the center of my vision, the resolution of what I was gazing at began to shift until it splintered and I was staring at something beyond description. I gawked in amazement at an infinite spectrum of existence. 

There were colors that didn’t exist! And more importantly, there were feelings that I had never felt before. I became distinctly aware that this void was staring back into me, but it is impossible to describe - like trying to bite your own teeth. It is as if my observation was being reflected back at myself, that I was observing my observation from an objective perspective outside of myself.

This felt like I was staring into the center of God Himself. This awareness changed the experience, and suddenly I was looking into the three red eyes of a being so far beyond comprehension that I cannot do it justice with words. 

As I knelt there on the beach, an understanding began forming in my head. I understood the boundaries of myself better than I ever have before and could “flex” a muscle of sorts that had not been dormant, but had not been utilized to its full potential. 

This turned out to be the ability to extend my consciousness beyond the limitations of my physical body through astral projection. Until this point, I had been toying with what was possible with the human soul while meditating.

We are spiritual creatures inhabiting a material reality for the experience, in order to grow the fruits of the self. After waking from this dream, I found I could travel away from my body much more readily and reliably than I could before. It was like I had awakened a new power within me.

I’ve spent most of my adult life studying esoteric ideas from a purely self perspective, traveling my own path and creating my own truths as I’ve discovered them within me. Does anyone have any insight into what happened to me that night, or why I was able to astral project afterwards?I recently watched all of Michael Raduga's "How to leave your body in 3 days" seminar. 

Here's part 1/3 on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc) 

Anyways I've heard fantastic reviews from everyone who has watched this and read about his method. Basically, you do your projection attempts in the morning immediately when you wake up because you are already extremely close to the astral world, or what Michael Raduga calls "The Phase". Regardless of the terminology, there is an extremely high success rate from everyone who has tried it like on day 1 or 2. 

I am going to try this tonight for sure.

I'm wondering why aren't more people talking about this method on this subreddit? There's a few posts from people who had their first AP within 3 days of watching it, but I'm curious why it's not more people's go-to method and what people's experience with it is!Hello, i have written up a PDF for those who want to astral project, but are struggling or don't know how, i hope you find it useful. There is also very good information in the PDF that you might find very useful to read, all which is practical to the overall cause of AP.

[AP PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ot4j6QlrtARv3I_9lsci2MqPqen_Z5lo/view?usp=sharing)

Each part of the PDF is titled, so feel free to skip to the part you want to read, there is a guided explanation of AP within the PDF for those who are struggling, for those who have questions i answer some of the common ones i get in the FAQ at the start, for those who still have questions you can just ask in this thread or by Email which i have supplied in the PDF for those who are keen and avid readers :). 

&#x200B;It's called "mastering astral projection 90 day guide to out of body experience" by Robert Bruce and Brian Mercer. I bought this on a whim because it said it was related to astral Dynamics, another book I love but this book is SOLELY energy exercises and that was what I loved so much about astral Dynamics. It's got a lot of Tai chi sort of practices in it. At first I was a bit skeptical about the claims of doing these exercises but I am sitting here with my feet on fire in a good way haha.  I seriously suggest you check it out.I have been reading this thread for a while, but have never posted. I had a very strange experience a couple days ago, with everything I can include below. Sorry for the length of this, but I needed to include as many details as I could. Anyone have an input? 

&#x200B;

I began my normal meditation technique by sitting comfortably in the living room chair in which I typically use. Throughout my meditation, I had music playing that contained ‘calming’ sounds, nature sounds, and sound waves that claimed to promote relaxation and mental journeys. For the first several minutes of my session, I focused deeply on my body – relaxing muscles and sinking into the chair I was sitting in. My goal for this meditation was to seek information as to what my *purpose* is on this planet. In order to do this, I was planning on focusing on a single subject: astral projection. As I was focused on “pulling” my soul out of my physical body, I began having a visual experience in which I was standing in the living room watching my physical body relax during meditation. After several attempts, I finally was able to “leave” the room and house in a way I did not expect. As I watched myself meditate, I began feeling a very strong sensation as if I was sitting in a chair that was being sucked through a tunnel at a high rate of speed. During this feeling, I paid attention to the surroundings – I was in a tunnel that had numbers all over the walls, ceiling, and floor. The entire visual experience was in grey tones. After a few seconds, I began seeing geometric structures around me. It was almost as if I was lying down on a flat surface looking up at a ceiling of some sort. It was similar to a dome made of triangles – I clearly could see the metal frames between the shapes that created this room I was in. I then began hearing talking but it was a language I couldn’t understand – instead it was almost “sounds” that beings were making to each other in conversation. I couldn’t see anything but straight up to the ceiling. Shortly after I began seeing bright flashes of lights in my eyes and the shapes/dome was gone. After a few bright flashes and the visual sensation of what seemed like someone shining light in my eyes and looking around my cornea, I saw these blurry beings standing beside the surface I was lying on. They didn’t look human, but they did not scare me. It was almost as if I knew them, but I couldn’t recognize them at all. After they stopped probing my eyes with lights, they began speaking their language again. There were slurred words I could understand such as “awake”, “not unconscious”, and “send him back – try again”.  After this, I was pulled through another visual scene – almost like another dimension – that contained images all over around me that looked like electrical components (almost like a computer motherboard). I could see what looked like electricity flowing all around me and through me. I began getting anxious and vocalized things such as “why am I here”, and “please help me”. Another entity appeared, but it was very block-like. It now reminds of me the video game “minecraft”, but the being was actually many colors and did not resemble much but a block-shaped face. It had no facial features or human-like features whatsoever. This being then announced to me, “they are coming!” During this dialogue, I focused on a single image – an eye shape that was taking presence of my visual field. I don’t know where it originated, however, during this experience I knew that it was the same being I just saw. The shape of an eye grew larger in my sight, soon taking over my entire being and existence. While it is very difficult to explain, all I could see or feel was this eye shape. Then the voice said, “this will be your new \[unintelligible word\]” and ended with, “your purpose is to education \[us\].” 

 Immediately after I heard the last words, I was almost sucked into another dimensional field as if I was pulled through a black hole. All around me was an all-encompassing light that consumed every inch of my being. While I was not a human, but a spirit without a body, I became one with the light. It was as if I was the light myself that filled this dimensional space I was in. During this, I had no concept of time, feeling, vision, or anything else. It was like I was ever existing, such as light is, with no limit or boundaries. At some point after this sensation ended, I was then absorbed into a deep dark space that never ended. There was no light that I could see, but I felt myself existing what felt like forever – somewhat like space. There was Infinite possibilities, infinite speed, and without any concept of time or existence. I then experienced the same visual sensation before with the numbers in a tunnel, however, this time I was not able to feel a position I may be in. Instead, I was just there in this space – I had no legs, arms, or head. I was just a spirit in existence. In addition to the never-ending numbers, I began seeing shapes all over from squares and cubes to triangles and pyramids. However, this time I saw shapes that didn’t exist – it was like they were able to be seen but I can’t describe or comprehend what I saw. 

 Suddenly I found myself on the same surface as before, being probed with lights by some group of creatures. This time, I was unable to understand what they were saying. I felt motionless and emotionless, however, the light disturbed my vision and the lights got very bright – almost brighter than the sun. As the beings chattered in their language, a deep female-like voice went above them and spoke. The other voices ended when the loud voice said, “He is aware; he has leaked the \[information\] into the deep vessels of infrastructure…. he is risking vulnerability to \[unintelligible\]”, and “we must revert memory and return”. Immediately after, I experience very bright lights as well as what seemed like the opposite, which was lights that were actually darkness. As if there was a light that emitted an absence of light itself. Then, I experienced something I have a very hard time explaining. 

 The last part of this ‘journey’ consisted of the feeling as if I was in a black hole again. This time, I was able to experience sensations I have never even thought about and cannot comprehend at this point anymore. It was like I was tasting sounds, seeing sounds, and hearing visual sensations. Suddenly, my consciousness went crazy: In a split second I relived my whole life. I felt emotions from my childhood that I didn’t know existed (but at that moment I knew they were from my past), I experienced memories from years ago (and just hours ago), all within what seemed like a millisecond. It was like everything I knew and understood in my waking life was balled up into a single atom and blasted through my brain. I really cannot explain this sensation any further, and I think my description is a massive understatement. Lastly, I felt the light sensation again – as if I was an all-encompassing light that existed forever. It was a very bright light, and followed by a sound I can’t explain (almost like a bang); suddenly the numbers appeared again, but it was in a reverse motion from the other two times. Within less than a second, I fell back into consciousness and *jolted* in my chair back to life, giving out a shriek. After this, I felt a sensation that went away quick – tightness throughout my body, dizziness, and confusion. 

 Since I’ve never experienced something like this, I immediately wanted to get it down so I can revisit it later. I was so confused that I walked to my laundry room to find my laptop that was actually located in my kitchen. I typed for a minute or two, just jotting down facts, and then went back right after to add some more detail and transitional information. This was two days ago, and as I re-write this story with better grammar and situational explanation, I have a hard time remembering what happened. I *remember* experiencing it, but I have limited knowledge of *what* I experienced. If I hadn’t written down everything, I would have forgotten what happened. It was like a dream that you forget after you wake up. Hello everybody!

My recent post had a lot of feedback with a lot of beginners who really just want to know how to astral project. We were all there at some point and a lot of future projectors still are. I'm making this guide in hopes that there will be less "simple" questions asked, and more advanced questions. If you are an experienced projector and want to post your own personal method in the comments please do! There's soo many different ways to leave the body as my guide(s) will show. 

Grab yourself some fruit, some gummies to snack on, or even a bottle of water because this is gonna be a doozy (but it'll be worth it)!

&#x200B;

\*\*CAN YOU EVEN ASTRAL PROJECT?\*\*

Many have probably heard that some people simply can't astral project...and I'm so sorry to say this, but this is true..

In order to astral project there is a very key factor in it all and that is being able to dream. You can only astral project if you can dream. Oh.. you can?! You have dreams when you go to bed?! Well great! You're more than capable of achieving this higher state of consciousness. To my knowledge astral projection is simply being completely aware during the point your non-physical self separates from your physical. Normally when this happens you'll begin your dream, but when you hang on tight and don't lose concentration you'll leave your body by choice AND be aware of it. Pretty neat huh?!

I hope this puts more people at ease when it comes to religion. Do any of your beliefs or religions tell you not to dream? If so, then you probably shouldn't go against your beliefs, but if not then why would they frown upon you? If anything your religion or belief would be proud of the success and achievement you have. Don't worry about being on the same level of your God, that is simply way way way our of our comprehension, this is just the astral plane. Welcome! 

&#x200B;

\*\*WHAT DO I DO WHEN I'M GETTING CLOSER?\*\*

Now that you know that you have the capabilities of projection, this new found confidence, the way your heart is beating faster while reading this, this is a very good sign that you're in the right state of mind. There are many many signs that let you know when you're getting closer to the point of exiting. Most people acknowledge the vibrations because I meannn...how could ya miss them?! But there are more than just those. 

There's the blobs of light that'll start appearing in your sight of "vision" (cause well I mean your eyes are closed), there's your body going numb (physical body falling asleep), there's seeing complete blackness behind your eyes (many call this 3D blackness), there's the sensation of you spinning, there's a high pitch ringing you can hear in your ear, there's a feeling in your head that'll feel like your skull is about to burst, there's the feeling of your heart feeling like it'll literally BEAT OUT OF YOUR CHEST (calm doooown it's just your heart chakra being used! Don't believe me? If you get too scared and wake up check your pulse. Using a smart watch or a heart monitor will be the most accurate, but you can also just feel your pulse under your wrist or neck. It won't be the same as that feeling in your chest (; ), there's the feeling of falling into your bed (or  where ever you're practicing), there's the feeling of rising up towards your cieling (or where ever you're practicing), and I'm sure there's many other indications that we simply just haven't discovered yet. But these are all of the things I've come across and documented. 

What do you do to exit during these experiences? Well I've been told to simply "wait them out", and once you've done that you're already out of body and to simply get out of your bed (or whichever area of practice) without a second thought and roam. Really feel good about it? Simply go through your bedroom door (without opening it of course!).

&#x200B;

\*\*PREPARATION\*\*

Many people suggest a healthy diet and exercising regularly to be able to prep your body for astral projection. I cannot deny that eating healthy and exercising will make this process EASIER for you, but you simply do not need to in order to project. 

What happened when I ate healthy and exercised: Upon my new healthy lifestyle, reaching the vibration stage was becoming second nature. You are more in tune with yourself, and I suppose your chakras resonate easier with your whole body due to healthy decisions. In my opinion, I think that the healthier diet just stops more of those "violent" exit signals, like rough vibrations, super hard beating heart chakra, head feeling like it'll explode, etc and make things more easy, but healthy diet or not the signs will still lead you to exiting!

Now what do I do when I'm actually going to begin? When in bed I let my mind race as much as possible while getting as comfy and cozy as I can. I squirm and squiggle around until I feel 0 discomfort in my body. Also while doing I streeeetch and flexxx my arms and legs then go right back into getting all cozy with no discomfort. Once this happens, I begin.

&#x200B;

\*\*HOW I ASTRAL PROJECT\*\* 

There's many many methods I've tried over the months of my journey so I'll just put them all down  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  some may work better for you than it did for me:

METHOD 1.) Breathe Til Symptom

1.) I get all cozy after stretching and flexing and such.

2.) I pick a breathing method. I either do the 4-7-8 method or 4-4 method.

  \- in the 4-7-8 method you begin it by exhaling all the way through your mouth (the way it makes that "whooosh" sound) then inhale through your nose for 4 seconds as much as you can and as gently as you can. Then hold your breath for 7 seconds. Then exhale with that "whooosh" for 8 seconds. Rinse and repeat!

  \- in the 4-4 I inhale for 4 seconds (through the nose) then exhale for 4 seconds (through my mouth or nose and mouth doesn't really matter). 

3.) Do this until you feel your physical body becoming numb. Both help in this matter, but once you pick a method stick with it.

4.) By the time your body is numb, you likely won't even realize you're still doing your breathing methods but you are.

5.) Stay vigilient. Watch what happens behind your close eyes. When you see beautiful and unique shapes and designs or even blobs of light you're going through the hypnogauic (i KNOW i didn't spell that right) state.

6.) Stay calm and relaxed and understand that the vibrations will be upon you. Once those vibrations kick in let them run their course and once they're finished get out of bed without a second thought and roam.

&#x200B;

METHOD 2.) I'm Too Lazy To Breathe (VERY similar to WBTB method)

1.)  Go through METHOD 1 til step 3 when your body becomes numb.

2.) You start thiking "ehhhh I'm too lazy to go through all of this ( :(( ) I'm going to bed"

3.) BEFORE YOU TURN OVER TO THE SIDE TO SLEEP: Say this to yourself (I may or may not project in the morning, but that does not matter to me, I'm just glad I made it this far).

   \- The very night I said that to myself I had my very first projection that following morning! When you project you're just supposed to let go, and when you release the feeling of not being in control you prosper!

4.) Upon waking up in the morning don't open your eyes or move.

5.) Now completely relaaax yourself and imagine your self hitting  a nice back stroke in an endless body of water. Feel your arms going through the resistance of the water, feel your legs kicking, feel the temperature of the water, look at the beautiful sky above you. Go through these motions as if you're actually doing them  (don't actually move your physical limbs!)

6.) Within SECONDS you should feel intense vibrations, very intense ones. They might even scare you, but please don't be alarmed, you've gone so far! 

7.) Once those vibrations come to a stop, get up and roam and see for yourself if you're in another plane!

&#x200B;

METHOD 3.) You Can Dream, So Project! 

1.) Set your alarm for the morning (I would usually set mine for 530 or 630 AM), as long as I was able to get 5-6 hours of rest.

2.) Wake up to that alarm

3.) Turn off your alarm and go back to bed

4.) This is the most important step. You are gonna completely fall back asleep as you normally would. Act as if you want those 5 more minutes of rest before having to get up for school (except hopefully you don't actually have to go haha)

5.) Dream

6.) Realize you're in a dream!!

7.) Wake up without moving or opening your eyes, and just relaaaaaaaaaaaax

8.) Within MOMENTS you will feel yourself sliiide out of your bed as if it was your physical body (I sleeping on my stomach during this so I thought I was about to roll out and hurt my ribs upon impact of the floor, but nope! It was my astral body so I felt no pain!)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

NOW IF YOU WOKE UP AND OPENED YOUR EYES/ MOVED DON'T PANIC, GO TO PLAN B!

7.) You moved and/or opened your eyes (Darn :/ )

8.) Turn your self over and put your hand ( I used my right hand) under your pillow with your head on the pillow (you probably do this a lot anyway).

9.) Now move your index and middle finger up and down one after the other with the same amount of force it would take to push down a piano key all the way so that it'd play a note. And do this for 30 seconds (WITHOUT COUNTING IN YOUR HEAD. You just gotta know ;)

10.) After those 30 seconds use those same 2 fingers and move them up and down with the amount of force as it would take to push down on a keyboard WITHOUT fully pressing on it. Do this for 10 seconds (WITHOUT COUNTING IN YOUR HEAD)

   \- Practice in a waking state: Ok, so think about pulling up microsoft word. Now type in "j". Okay now just go back and forth with your index and middle finger on 'j' and 'i'. Do this with enough pressure to feel the tension in your fingers but not being hard enough so that the key is pushed down all the way for a letter to show up in microsoft word.

11.) During step 10 it is very likely you'll feel your self separating. For me during step 10 I felt myself sliiiide again, as if I was falling out of my bed but from behind. You may also see some visuals in your eyes during this!

&#x200B;

METHOD 4.) The Will

This is the method I used for my most recent and most powerful projection, and my own personal method I created. The best part about this one is that maybe someone else will be able to create there own personal method to share! And if this is already out there then oops!

1.) Set an alarm for 530 as long as you get 4-6 hours of sleep.

2.) Wake up at that time.

3.) Now go back to sleep, but open your eyes and look at your phone for the time every 5 minutes.

\- it is VERY likely you end up falling asleep. I call this method The Will because you need the will power to stay up and check the time every 5 minutes.

4.) Do this for 30 minutes

\- So if you set your alarm for 530am, you need to check in and out until 6am.

5.) Lay in bed and nanometers (very very small movements) PHYSICALLY move yourself in a very slow and very small manner (I do this to get that sliiiide feelin goin). 

6.) You'll feel your non-physical begin to slide out and you poof you're out. Had an AMAZING projection after this one. Flew and everything! Oh, and I suuuuck at flying.

&#x200B;

These are all of the methods I know guys!! Method 3 and 4 gave me my best projections to date. I'M SOOO CONFIDENT that you will see great progress in your results after knowing this! Give it a go! Tell me how this worked out for you!

&#x200B;

P.S When I mention the feeling of "sliiiiding" you can practice this in the waking state too!

Simply lean up on your bed completely relaxed and loose (like how you'd be when practicising projection) your eyes can be opened or close, it doesn't matter. Now sloooooowly and gently move your body off of your bed or where ever you practice until you get to the point of of where gravity takes more control and it feels like you're about to fall off of your bed. That's what I meant by "the sliiiide" and there aren't any vibrations that come with it, you just exit that way. 

P.P.S If you find no success DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED, you fall asleep EVERY night (well I hope so), so every day is a new opportunity, but I'm POSITIVE any of these teachings or methods will spark something in you!

&#x200B;

YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

&#x200B;

See you in the astrals! :)Hello

Tldr : try to roll when you are in sleep paralysis,  when you start to feel rolling sensations increase the speed of it , until you breakthrough , 

I tried always to astral project when i was a kid , but nothing , i couldn't imagine anything , when i was maybe in high school i found that i have aphantasia , so yes it wasn't in my head , but its a real thing , i forget about astral projection

Then one day i woke up in sleep paralysis, and a dark hooded entity was in my room doing some glitchy moves , i never felt fear like i had that day , i felt like iam being stabbed with fear

then i have this message without words "close your eyes" , i did and entity had no power anymore , then i think to myself oh great lets try astral projection,

so i tried to imagine rope but nothing like always , then i have this thought without words that i need to try to roll , i never heard about rolling method ,

so i try to roll , nothing at beginning then i start to feel rolling ,oh nice then i start increasing the speed for fun ,keep in mind that i didn't have intent of seperation, it was just for fun , and didnt know that you can astral project that way ,

so i keep increasing the speed of rolling , it was very fast , then boom i flew from my body into the ceiling of my room , i was literally looking into my body in bed when i was rising, the first thought was "they were right" , everything in my room had a bright light to it , i felt a big erophia , i starter flying through the wall into the kitchen. Then into neighbor house , and i back to my body and wake up ,

i felt my body vibrating the whole time walking to bathroom , this experience made me spiritual and created this reddit account, because of it ,
So yes rolling or any other no-imagination technique work perfect

Good luckI’ve met entity’s in this world and on many different planes. I feel guilty being the only one exposed to this out of everyone I know, which can be lonely. It’s my understanding that certain peoples can AP because they are open minded, excess dmt is being produced in brain/pineal gland is open and when someone goes thru so much trauma they get connected to spirit realm because they need help. I’d love to hear others thoughtsHas anyone else experienced this phenomenon before? I did a few days ago. In my waking life I have been experiencing some bladder issues, like frequent UTI’s, and there has been this uncomfortable sensation in my bladder for a while. Well, a few days ago I had this dream that I was on an operating table, fully awake and there was a doctor making a small incision right over my bladder and then doing something to it. It didn’t hurt and it was pretty quick. That’s all I remember. 

Well, since then I haven’t felt anything wrong with my bladder! Normally if I don’t drink cranberry juice or take the powder I usually take, my symptoms will come back. But they haven’t come back. 

However the only reason I just remembered that dream is because I had a similar one last night. But this one wasn’t good. Trigger warning, this is a bit gruesome. I was with this attractive young doctor, he was being super flirty and trying to seduce me. That’s red flag number one. He put me on the operating table and started just straight up cutting me open with huge cuts wherever he wanted to. It didn’t hurt, as if everything was numbed, but I was feeling uncomfortable because I could still feel him moving my organs around. I was starting to panic. I was telling him that he should stop but he wasn’t listening. He was taking my organs out and showing them to me. Theres red flag number two. But then I looked at him again and realized he was wearing sunglasses. I thought “wait, doctors don’t wear sunglasses.” And I woke up immediately. There’s red flag number three! He probably heard me questioning him/becoming lucid and just completely bailed. Not sure what he was doing or what he wanted with my organs though. But he had his eyes covered so clearly he was hiding them for a reason 😬 

It’s just strange that these two dreams occurred so close together and been so different. Maybe the negative entity was trying to destroy the work that the first one did? And of course I’m aware of the possibility that there are no entities involved at all and it is just symbolic and I healed myself with my own mind. 

Anyway, I’d be interested to hear about other peoples astral surgery stories! And have you ever been healed in real life after these dreams?Im sorry if this has been asked before. I've got my technique down that works every time.

I go to bed early, then set my alarm 4 hours later. I get up and stay awake for a few hours, then go back to sleep. When I do this, as Im slipping back into sleep, I sometimes get sleep paralysis. Then All I do is try and roll over or sit up while my body is paralyzed  and it works.

The only issue is...what the heck do I do next? Right now I just stand around awkwardly, usually it being very dark and hard to see. Or I walk around my house trying to come up with ideas. I think Im too excited and then eventually it all just fades away! Ugh. I even try and float or walk through walls or leave...but It seems like I am on a timer as soon as I leave my body.

Any advice?I Got out of my body this morning for the first time in a while, and as usual I was completely blind. I felt around the room i until I got to my door and it was locked. It is literally always locked when I try to leave my room from an AP, even though I don’t lock it in real life. Anyways, I unlocked it and felt my way blindly through the living room and opened the front door. Usually every time I open the front door I gain immediately sight and it is usually quite vivid. This time I still couldn’t see, so I kept walking out to the driveway a bit, and could faintly make out the shapes and images of trees but I feared I was gonna lose consciousness like this. Then I verbally asked for sight, as someone suggested I do, aloud. I could actually hear my own voice. And then I could see! It was actually the most vivid I’ve ever seen in an AP. I saw this utopian version of my neighborhood and this huge ocean in the background. There was this tree, with red flowers, in someone’s backyard that was so vivid it became too bright and made me become blind again. Then I sort of went into a half conscious journey where I was flying through these different beautiful landscapes... then I woke up. 

The experience couldn’t have been less than a minute.. 

Anyways.. is anyone else’s bedroom door locked when they AP? And why are my experiences so short???https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7qz9p/meet-the-redditors-using-astral-projection-to-escape-quarantineEvery once in awhile there will be people online who are labeled "conspiracy nuts" that make bold and interesting claims of lifeforms on different planets and even the existence of other realms and dimensions?

Has anybody been to other realms or dimensions where they have met another civilization or group of beings similar - or vastly different - to our own species? 

And has anybody seen one close to Earth or on nearby planets that are well aware we are here - even if we are not aware of them ourselves?this is the best astral related discord out there. Just the other day there was a huge voice chat with AP experts answering questions. Definitely the most wholesome server I've ever been a part of. Definitely recommend checking it out.

[https://discord.gg/wseUzZp5Mg](https://discord.gg/wseUzZp5Mg)A lot of ancient traditions always hide a lot of knowledge and secrets they gained through years of experience. They only share it with specific individuals/groups that probably fulfilled their required criteria.     
Do any of you practice some sort of not sharing everything you learned? Will sharing much of what you gained and helping others prevent you from obtaining more knowledge, secrets of the universe etcI'm still wondering how to begin this post, I will just give it a try. Everyone must be experienced at least once a Voices while falling asleep, most of the time it is just like a radio talk, sometimes somebody can just scream your name. Some are calling this hypnagogia the onset of a dream, but sometimes I think it can be something else, frankly I got fascinated by it, so I began my own experiments on that field. Through a lot of failures, I finally reached a certain state, where I can make a conscious conversation with someone on the other end, yeah it can be creepy sometimes, even can make you feel ill, but also fascinated things can occur. When I'm trying I always relax deeply with closed eyes, but not trying to fall asleep. I begin with series of questions to channel up myself with everything or everyone out there who is listening. The questions are simple like "Is there anybody around", "who is there", "can we talk", "Do you hear me" and others, while I'm expecting somebody to say something. It will not work everytime, but when it work, it happen in similar order: first I'm hearing a static sound, then maybe a buzzing, after that a weak voice like it is faraway, when I reach this phase I start asking "Who are you", "Please tell me your name", "Please talk to me", "I'm here to talk with you". After sometime the miracle happen, here I'm going to tell about two of those conversations.

1)After sometime I got through

What is your name? - *My name is Harper*. How are you feeling Harper? - *I feel very bad*. Why, what happen? - *My mom is dead*. I'm sorry, how it happen? - *I... I think I killed her, but it was an accident.* OK... where are you now? - *buzzing sound* I'm losing you, stay with me. Where are you now? - *I have no idea, it is dark*. Ok what happened? - *It was night and my mom was driving me home from school, we get into fight and then I saw bright lights.* Are you hurt? - *I can't feel anything, how can you hear me, are you an angel? Somebody is coming...* Who is coming? - she screams and I lost connection.

2) I hear a male voice.

 Who are you? Tell me your name? - *I'm .... (scratching sound)* Where are you now? - *Nowhere... Everywhere..*. What you want? - *I want you to die, Die dIe DiE* Sorry I can't do that. I broke the connection.

So what do you think this is?I’m still working towards my first projection and have been doing a bit of research. I realised that there is a lack of articles or other media that says “I astral projected and here is the proof”. I would have thought there would be something simple like an article says “john is a veteran astral projector and was given the location of a room. He had one week to project into the room and tell the researchers what was the colour of the room. 

I understand that small things and details can be hard to clearly see during AP but something like the colour of a room should be manageable from what I’ve read. Am I missing something obvious? I feel like something as simple as this would erase all doubt regarding astral projection.

Has any of you longer term projectors done an experiment like this?After doing my homework and trying for  several weeks, I experienced my first AP.  I went to bed around 9:30.  Practiced APing; fell asleep.   I was on-and-off awake through the night.  After having weird and vivid dreams, I woke up around 3:15 AM, peed, and went back to bed.  More vivid dreaming, then I came slightly up in consciousness from the dream state, and things got real.  I felt static electricity (vibrations) and a swirl of smoky blue light wrapped around/below my body. Then separation came quickly through levitation. The experience felt very familiar.  I must have done this before? 

I bounced around the room out of control a bit (like a fly trying to escape a room), tried to ascend but hit my head on the ceiling.  No luck.  I felt the presence of my wife, but did not look down at her or my physical self. I found the door and flew out of the room, over the balcony and down into my living room, below.

I couldn't stay "up" and sunk to the LR floor, where I immediately came into contact with a beast of some sort: an odd looking mammalian (IDK, like two mini-dobermans wrapped in a single, tight dark brown and black fur skin, one lopsided head). Very, very odd.   It didn't feel menacing, and came over to me as a dog would. There may have been another cat-like animal present as well.  

I also felt the presence of another (human?) being on the first floor, like an unseen sleeping guest.  I initially thought the dog-beast was this unseen being's pet.

I immediately returned to my physical body, and awakened.  

Overall, from what I've studied, this was a textbook AP.  The house didn't feel exactly the same as my physical house (drawer knobs slightly off, balcony railing design a tad wrong.  Also, though vivid, my surroundings were slightly foggy--though I never traveled farther than 20 ft from my physical self, which may account for the fogginess.

The feeling of separating and "flying" gave me elation/joy.  Very positive.

Oddly, I was conscious of needing to play by the rules during the AP:  don't get excited; don't be scared; levitate, roll out, etc.; don't look at your physical body; get away from your physical body; be aware of/avoid  negative low-level beings, etc.

I'm very much looking forward to my next AP!I've been having sleep paralysis since I was a kid so I've had many out of body experiences before. However, the problem was that I couldn't control anything. Most of the times, I'd float around in my room for a bit before getting dragged around uncontrollably which made me scare myself back to reality.

BUT LAST NIGHT I FINALLY DID IT!! My solution was to put myself back on the ground when I started floating around. Then I had full control over everything!! Ahhhh it was so cool. I walked over to the mirror and looked at myself in astral form which was pretty cool. Everything was the same except I had a silver chain on which was kind of weird. Then I felt the textures of my dresser and bed and surely I could feel them. I was intrigued so I also licked my bedsheets and dresser and it TASTED HOW IT WOULD TASTE! I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirrors again and then I snapped back to reality. Super excited!  


One thing I noticed though. This was very early in the morning around 7am so I could see everything because there was light outside. However, when I astral project in the middle of the night, it's all dark and my projections are often scary. Is there any way to project at night but somehow make it so its not dark?I was meditating to dmt binaural beats. I was flat on my back chilling and letting my thoughts roam, nothing more,nothing less. After a couple of minutes a man in all orange jumps in my view. Teleporting from the bottom left of my perspective really closely and far right of my perspective really far away. But he was doing it so fast that his afterimage was directly in front of me. He said "oh you are a human?is that so?I only know of the littlest ones" he proceeded to show me his palms,  I intentionally snap out to record my findings. This experience confirms the existence of the annunaki or nonetheless GIANTS. Keep traveling my friends and may light be with you Happy Sunday Everyone, 

I hope I don't offend people but I've recently seen posts that include conspiracy theories and other similar stories that have nothing to do with Astral Projection and can discredit / steer people away who have questions or are interested in the subject.

Common physics knowledge (like the earth being round....) should not be called into question on this sub. This sub should be about Astral Projection, stories that come with it, and help / guidance to others curious about the subject.So I can’t find nothing about this so I’m just gonna post this here. (It’s gonna be long sorry but I made a short version at the end) 

So I was walking down a dirt path in a forest and all of a sudden I come across a mirror in the middle of the path. I can’t see my reflection but I can see the reflection of a woman in all black standing basically behind me since I can’t see myself. I turn around and she like flies towards me and into me. And I turn around and look in the mirror and I’m her. But I can’t really control my body any more. It felt like I was spectating my own body while some one else controls it. Or I was put in her body. I’m not sure.

And all of a sudden I walk through the mirror. And as I do my clothes start to burn. I curl up in the fetal position as everything on me burns away. It reminds me of meteor. Like I was moving so fast through the mirror everything started disintegrating. 

So everything burned away and all that was left was exposed muscle all over my body. And then white liquid appeared all around me. It looked like milk. I was in the white for a while and overtime I started to see my skin, hair everything regrow. While I was in there I kept hearing a male voice talk from outside. 

He was talking to me but I couldn’t respond. Or see. Everything was white. Soon the white from the walls started pealing away and attaching to my whole body. And as it all left from the walls and coated my body I could see through the ball I was floating in. I was in a large white ball floating in a giant open clam. (Yea idk) overtime the White coating all over my body started disappearing into my skin. I saw the man come walking down the hall and he was wearing a black suit and tie. He was tall and had blonde short curly hair. 

He looks up and see’s that I can see now and says “Oops I gotta change from my normal clothes “ and changes into a white robe and is literally glowing with a golden light. I’m just staring at him confused. But I started asking questions in my head to him and he was answering but I can’t remember what I asked or what he said. But he walks up and says “It’s a little early but it should be fine” and slices the ball I’m 
floating in. 

And I stagger and fall and he grabs me and starts walking and jumps down the side of this open room I’m in and flies upwards in this large circular room and as we fly up I look around and see dozens of giant clam things on every floor he flies past but they are all closed. As I look up I see a light but it looks like how light looks under water. As we go up the light gets brighter. But I can’t remember what happened after. 

I wasn’t sleeping or anything. Just meditating with binaural beats music for an hour. But I’ve seen this same man in the robe many times but never in a modern black suit before. And I have never heard him talk before now He said oops so I guess he didn’t mean to show me but it had me thinking that he was a real person invading my Ap sessions or something. 

Short version: (A man in a black suit comes into my Ap session thinking I couldn’t see but realized I can see, says oops and changes into some Greek robe looking outfit and pulls me out of my Ap session and I can’t remember what happened after) It felt like I was in this session for weeks but it was only an hour and 30 minutes.my apologies if this gets asked all the time, and i imagine it does. if real AP was possible then why hasn't anyone demonstrated it under controlled conditions? if someone can reliably AP into the next room and identify an object on the table, then that would be one of the most revolutionary discoveries in human history. everyone would know about it.

to make the argument perfectly clear:

* (1) if real AP was possible then someone would've demonstrated it under controlled conditions
* (2) no one has demonstrated real AP under controlled conditions
* (3) therefore real AP isn't possible

(1) and (2) are extremely credible, and if they're both true then (3) logically follows.

EDIT: the automod comment doesn't make sense. AP *would be* accepted by "the mainstream" if even a single person could reliably AP into a locked room and identify an object on a table. if AP is real then that should be possible. strange that there are all these people who can supposedly do it, but not a single person in history has been able to reliably perform this simple task. the conclusion that real AP isn't possible seems inescapable.

EDIT: you might object by saying that real AP only works a small percentage of the time or that it is otherwise prohibitively difficult for APers to perform the simple task I described. that is probably the best way to block the above argument by denying (1). here's a simple test that gets around that. the experimenter selects an object from 10,000 possible objects and places it on the table. now the APer just needs to AP into the room and identify the object *a single time* and they've just done something they had only a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting right by chance

Hello everyone, if interested  I just released a 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐮𝐥 432 𝐇𝐳 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤 that is perfect for nighttime lucid dreaming practice & Astral Protection that I call The Blue Lotus Flower.

It's very relaxing, tranquil, easy to listen to, and likely to have you falling into a state of deep meditation quickly.

" I hope that you enjoy it & if so let me know what you think " 

https://youtu.be/2g3tXaWiUd4During sleep paralysis I heard and felt something coming up the stairs. At first I was afraid, I felt this thing was coming to harm me. 

But I made a choice to let go of fear and accept and embrace death. 

When I did so, my whole body began to get tingles and vibrate and I had a whole body non-sexual orgasm. 

Can anyone explain this?Just curious where it lead to after the singularityAfter some deep thinking about nihilism and materialism, I fell into the thinking that life is meaningless as we are all going to die in the end and we are just biological machines designed to reproduce. This subreddit helped me realize that there could be consciousness beyond death and maybe life isn't meaningless because there could be an afterlife and we don't all die in the end.Okay so to add context:

I  used to try to astral project, I stopped attempting due to my dad advising me not to do it until older. The closest I had gotten was lifting my arm out of my body. Over this summer I went far down the rabbit hole, using DMT/LSD/Shrooms. To get the most out of these experiences I read excessively on all matter relating to metaphysics/psychology.

I got carried away with it and became too obsessed with the profound. At the end of summer, when school began, I found myself lost. I wasn't sure how to conform back to typical life after all the crazy realizations and lessons I had throughout the summer. In school particularly, an ego/identity is a necessity, and I was struggling to rebuild mine.

Since then I have managed to regain stability and I am doing very well. I'm in my last year of school so I'm going to abstain from the psychedelics until finished, but I digress... Just know this interaction occurred post-summer when I was  feeling lost.

**ENCOUNTER**

*Sidenote*:  I had no intention of anything relating to astral projection to happen,  I was just meditating. Also, this day I felt very off, I was frustrated because since summer I was doing everything I could to feel peace and clarity, to feel normal again, to no avail.

So I'm lying on my bed, doing a body scan, at about 5 pm. My body feels all floaty and my mind is calm, there is no inner monologue. This day I felt very off, I was frustrated that I felt so lost after such a beautiful and enlightening summer. Out of nowhere, completely to my surprise, I 'hear' a 'voice'... To say 'hear' isn't accurate. It's like I felt it. It didn't say any 'words', it is like it communicated telepathically, straight to my psyche. It's like we were communicating with essences of thoughts, like they were feelings or something, above day-to-day human thoughts. If you have used LSD it was like the thoughts you have while under the influence of it. So just be aware that what I type as his and my own replies are downgrades/simplifications into language.

The entity first said, "**ASK"**...  Again, this is just a translation into language, it didn't use words.

I was astonished but remained composed. I then mentally replied, *"What am I doing wrong?"* (because I had felt so off since summer ended).

The voice then replied, **"Come"**.

I then go to reply, *"where*", and right when I think "where", my body started vibrating and pulsing. I went from floaty to intensely vibrating and on the border on projecting within a second. This amazed me as I used to try for ages to get to this feeling, and yet this time it was more intense than I had ever felt the vibrations.

I was aware of how essential it was that I stay calm and composed but I failed to do this. I got very excited so my mind began racing, my thoughts, that I was thinking to myself, not the entity, were as follows;

"Holy shit this is crazy this is like something in a movie or a book I cant believe this is happening

"Shut up you're going to fuck this up you're ruining the authenticity of this with your thoughts"

"It might deem us unworthy due to the immaturity of these thoughts"

I then tried to just focus on the sensations but they just died down and the feeling of the presence of the entity was gone. I felt like I had fucked up an amazing opportunity and was so frustrated with myself but then I came to the conclusion that the entity wasn't trying to pull me out of my body but rather was indicating what it meant by "where".

Since then I haven't tried projecting due to not feeling ready, I wanted to strengthen my mind more before venturing out, which I have done, and now feel ready. I will begin attempting to project again.

Any thoughts or insights are greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :\]First time on this sub. Please forgive any breaches of etiquette. I had an experience about 3 years ago where my consciousness was able to reach God during an emotional meditation. The time I spent with Him lasted about a minute, I think. 

This was by far the most meaningful experience of my life but is something that I rarely share. Most of my immediate family know and two of my closest friends but this conversation topic is just so far beyond what most people normally have that I rarely share it, and this fact kinda annoys me. There's actually no better story I'd care to share with my fellow man. 

From what I can gather this sub seems to be relatively open minded on spiritual experiences. I'm obviously not asking anyone to believe me, but I'd primarily just like the share my experience and see what you guys think. Questions, comments, similar stories, whatever. Any input is welcome. 

I'm not an expert on AP by any means but I've had a few experiences with it. I've seen and talked to a few spirits in my life, some wanted me dead, some were just kinda indifferent and one was more beautiful than anything I could possibly express in this level of consciousness (this wasn't the "meeting God experience" but another time where I met, you might say, an angel). So I'm a novice but others say I have a knack for such things. I suppose. 

I'd like to start by pasting something I wrote up a little while ago in response to someone asking me about this experience. It's basically a quick summary of my current understanding of how the metaphysical realm works and my experience meeting God. It mainly relates the the method and not so much the personal details of the experience, which I will expound on afterwards, but pasting this will save me a lot of time so here goes. 

--------------------------

So It's not extremely hard to begin disembodying ones self but that alone isn't enough to reach the ethereal realm where God is. There are different levels to the spiritual realm and the identity of these levels are directly related to the amount of goodness/beauty (or lack there of) within them. A soul is naturally drawn to a level in the spiritual realm that is akin to the content within themselves. They flow toward the realm they currently relate with relative to the amount of good/beauty in them.

You could think of the spiritual realm as being like the sun. At its core is the highest, purest, most condensed form of all things worthy to exist: beauty, peace, power, freedom, understanding, love, etc. God is not only "at" the core but, perhaps a more accurate way of putting it based on what I experienced, actually "is" the Core. As you travel away from the Core you begin to come across lesser realms that have a lower content of goodness. This is like how traveling away from the core of the sun would put you at levels of less heat, pressure and light.

Go far enough away and you no longer can sense or even understand the things of the Core any longer. Things begin to become literally darker and there's different levels to this darkness. This darkness is actually the lack of all things worthy to exist. The darkness is hate, fear, foolishness, powerlessness, restlessness, etc. I never went deep into this place, never wanted to. I was able to gaze into it from a distance once and it was far more disgusting than I can possibly express. And I understood that if I went there and spent time there I would eventually become like that realm. Everything good within me would bleed out and I would be hollow inside like that place is. Although, I did not fear it because I knew that I belonged to the Core. I said to the pit, basically: "I am God's. I am more than you. You have no place with me. Begone." and it disappeared.

Even though these spiritual levels a soul exists in are most potently experienced while in a meditative or disembodied state, they are also actively in play while the soul is fully attached to the body. The soul of any average person who has more love and peace in their heart is actively closer to the Core than the soul of one who is filled with hate and fear. This is the case even if both people are fully in the physical realm, they just won't be able to experience the full potency of their spiritual state from this side. Imagine Gandhi and Jack the Ripper both alive and in the same room. They may both be in bodies, yes, but if you could see their souls one would be quite angelic in nature, far closer to the Core, and the other like a demon, very far from the Core.

I was only able to go into the Core once about three years ago. I've tried many times since then but the distractions of this world combined with negative emotions, mainly fear, managed to hold me back. But I have been very close many times. Like leaning against a closed door I just couldnt seem to open. When you're that close, though, everything in life feels amazing. You truly feel alive. At times It was such that I could ask God a question and he would literally answer me an instant later. Like, telepathy, if you're familiar.

The last time I almost made it back to Him I could feel the physical realm pulling me back but I kept trying. I was almost there but suddenly a fear began pulling me back as well. It was the fear of failing to reach the Core. Together the two forces managed to pull me back out and hold me down. In frustration and sorrow, I basically said to God, "I really wanted to see you. I'm sorry for failing to reach you again." Then a moment later I heard Him say to me "It's okay because you are already here." I felt an overwhelming awareness of the same concept the one time I actually made it all the way to Him. Somehow, it seems that even when in this physical world a part of our true self is actually actively connected to the Core.

Finally, regarding my method of actually reaching the Core. The right music can be very helpful. You need to be in a state of mind and heart that is actively focused on any and all thoughts and emotions that are beautiful. The physical world is far less than this state so try not to think on it. Focus your senses completely on your emotions and thoughts. Try to "feel" where the source of these are. Eventually you'll start to become aware you are in fact emotion and thought, a soul, rather than a body. All the while, continually call out to God to come get you and guide you to Him, but do it in peace and anticipation, not in desperation or fear. Eventually I saw a light that traveled toward and engulfed me. The semi-dark realm I was in previously was gone and I was suddenly in the Core of the Cosmos, inside of God. The process should feel like traveling towards all forms of beauty and should have a sensation of moving "inward". I always assumed heaven was somehow "upward" but I quickly found that traveling up, down, left or right in the three dimensional sense only severs to traverse the current realm you are in, it doesn't help transcend that realm. To move toward the Core, you need to go "inward".

-------------------------

So that's the end of my copy/paste response. Now I just wanna write about what the actual minute or so with God was like. 

So I was at a point that night where life just kinda sucked and I really wanted to meet God, like, in a big way. Not in a suicidal way, mind you, but in an AP way. I felt particularly stubborn in this desire. The kind of stubborn that looks at the suggestions that day-to-day life would tell me about the plausibility of such a feat and says "fuck you! I'm doing it anyway!". I felt kind of like a child that was told they couldn't do something but refused to accept it. I believe this strong desire played a huge role in my success. 

 As I was partially disembodied I was trying to extend myself "upward" as I mentioned earlier but was failing to find God. I was dismayed by this and prayed for Him to meet me. A moment later I heard a voice say "Call out to me." And so I did. I started saying "Father, I'm here. Come get me" but nothing changed. I prayed again "God, why havent you come to me? I really want to see you." A moment after that I heard the same voice again, "Call out to me" but this time there was also an implication I could sense. The voice additionally wanted me to stop trying to travel "upward". I stoped attempting all vertical or horizontal movement and focused solely on calling to God. Again, I started saying "Father, I'm here. Come get me." while trying to focus my heart toward this notion. I started moving in an entirely new direction I could best describe as "inward". 

I started to notice a presence somehow before me but it was far off. It was a light of some kind. I thought it was a "place" at first. I didn't notice sentience. Then it started coming toward me (or I toward it, not sure, maybe both) and I noticed it was a person not just a place. It was conscious. It came even closer until I was able to recognize it. He didn't tell me who He was but I and I alone personally recognized Him from some ancient memories buried deep within me. I screamed out to myself and my surroundings "THIS IS GOD!" Recognizing Him seemed to increase the travel speed toward Him as the light immediately burst toward me and swallowed me. It closed behind me and I was in another realm. 

The best way I could describe this realm is that it was like an ocean of light. It was unimaginably dense yet it was also so incredibly weightless. It was solid, liquid, gas and energy all at the same time - a paradox in our physical world. It was also made of all things good. Which is to say, in that place, emotion is an energy that you can feel and touch and all concepts that the emotions of the heart could recognize as "good" were there. The ocean was literally made of love, peace, understanding, freedom, safety, comfort, happiness, power, beauty, etc, etc. Furthermore, and I don't know how to properly convey this in physical logic but, the realm was actually all things in existence. But it must be noted that here I understood that "evil" isn't a "thing", evil is the lack of things. In other words, evil is like a hole in the fabric of existence but this realm was the core of existence itself. This entire realm was conscious. It was one gigantic soul. It was God. 

I was floating inside God and He was floating inside of me. It reminded me of how dropping food dye in water caused the two presences to mix. As the essence of God started flowing into me it began filling holes in my soul that I was so used to having I didn't even realize were there. Peace, happiness, freedom, power, beauty, love all flowed into and fused with my soul. All my lacks, all that I was missing, were filled and I was complete again for the first time in so, so very long. I could feel and remember who I used to be back before I left God and somehow ended up in this physical world. I was Me again and I was like God. 

At first I wanted to thank Him but I understood there that you only thank someone you owe a debt to and He did not see Me as owing Him anything. Love is free. So then I thought I should ask something of Him now that I was finally there in front of Him. That's normally how we seem to pray in this world, we ask and we thank. But I could sense that He already knew everything I wanted and could ask for and He had it under control. So I just kinda stood there in dismay, not knowing what to say. Then I saw a vision of the face of a man from just below the eyes to the base of the neck. He had a beard of about half an inch, semi-curly brown hair down to just above His shoulders, was white but not pasty white. He had a smile on His face with His head slightly cocked to the side, like the look of someone admiring a baby in a crib. He said without moving His mouth, "You don't have to say anything". I've never even come close to crying and laughing that hard before in all my life. This being was also God but almost like in a different form from the "ocean of light" form. 

My soul was still semi-attached to my body during this experience so I wasn't completely in God to the highest possible extent. It was like I existed in two realms at once somehow. It sucked actually, because I really wanted to be completely in His realm, however, I felt much more of me was in His realm than was in the physical. Perhaps because of this though, I was able to feel that God was also inside my physical body, specifically. There was a golden light throughout my physical body that extended about 2-3 inches beyond the skin. This light was God in the same way the "ocean of light" was God. 

I understood what love was when I was there. Hopefully, I can convey it properly. Love is the act of one being giving themselves to another being to be possessed by them. If you love someone you give them your time, your intent, your focus, your energy, your essence, your life. Love is supposed to be requited. If you love another being they are to love you as well. This way you give yourself but you get another in return. This is why it hurts so much and we feel so used and emptied when we show love to others but they show us hate. I could feel that God loved me with every fiber of His being to the highest possible extent. Literally 100% love. In this state, I possessed God who is, as I mentioned earlier, all things. I possessed all of existence, the entire cosmos (again, evil is not a thing but a lack of such). I was completely content, minus the small part of me that was still in my physical body. I didn't have any desires because they were all fulfilled. I had all things I wanted which was, in fact, everything - God. 

I eventually fell out of that realm and slowly returned to my body. At that time the physical world reminded me of the movie The Matrix. It felt so ridiculously fake, like a dream. The God realm is in fact the real world. We somehow seem to be trapped in a dream world that we all share here in this physical realm. The energies that God infused in my soul slowly started to bleed out. It took about 3 full days before I felt, unfortunately, "normal" again. 



That's all the more important parts of the experience. There was other stuff but it's 4am here and I've been writing this for like 2 hours so I'm gonna have to call it. I apologize for the ridiculously long walk of text. Again, feel free to ask or share anything. I just felt the need to get this experience out there.

A bit about myself: I am the most recent Moderator here in the sub, and part of its Discord server staff as well. I have been projecting for a few years and been sharing my insights here in the sub since a few months ago, being [The Illusion of Method AP Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/n9t307/the_illusion_of_method_my_ap_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) my most relevant post (which I later elaborated on to create [The Illusion of Method Book](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/pc3ipt/my_ap_book_the_illusion_of_method_is_available_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
). I really enjoy helping others to achieve astral projection, so I tend to put my efforts into making it easier and more accessible to everyone. 

I [already did an A.M.A. before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/nvs4mh/feel_free_to_ask_me_about_ap/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), so this is my second one. Feel free to ask me anything so long as it stays on-topic (related to AP/OBEs, or related to lucid dreams). I will do my best to answer all your questions with as much quality as possible! :)This happened some weeks ago. I think i met my spirit guide, im not sure but it was a good experience.
I went out of the body and i rapidly found myself near the beach. A woman approached me, she had curly hair and looked in her 50's, she was wearing fine clothing and heels.
I just followed her, i felt like we were having a conversation but i can't remember speaking nor what was said. (This may have something to do with my need of training memory in ap)
She took me to see a girl which was my best friend when i was a teenager. She betrayed me back in the day and i felt broken to the core. She talked a ton a shit about me. She had a bad opinion on me because i started to dress provocative, wearing more cleavage, wearing makeup and basically getting all the attention i never got before, she was manipulative and treated me poorly and i went away from her.
When i saw her in my ap we sat down and kind of telephatically shared a LOT of info on our lives. I just looked at her and kind of knew all of what she had passed through those years. I can't recall specific info but i knew. I saw a lot of pain in her eyes, i felt connected to her like i was «in love» with her. I felt a lot of love.
For a bit of context she apologized to me earlier this year and i forgave her bc that's what i do, but deep inside of me i resent her still.
I felt so free when i woke up. I felt no more resentment and i realized that i truly forgave her. Because it hurt no more. I was free from that pain. I made a list of all the people that hurt me in my life and im working on true forgiveness on those who deserve it. That not means that im gonna be their friend again or have contact it just means that it is not going to hurt more for me. I don't care my experience has to do or not with reality, i just know that it helped me. Be nice to yourselves :)***Long story short, I'm 21 and  I've  been suffering from constant DP/DR for about 8 years.*** Last night, I woke up from a lucid dream and got a sleep paralysis and while I tried to move my real arm I accidently astral projected for a couple of seconds, but I kinda freaked out so I automaticly went back to my body. **BUT!** the thing is , when I went back I felt like I snaped back. My vision changed to a normal one. people with DP/DR will understand that 3rd person feeling type of vision. like it feels like we're sitting in the ^(back of our head) watching a movie,the movie being our vision. I litteraly felt Normal, relaxed, happy basically how I used to be 8 years ago.I stayed lying on my back happyly looking around my room. 

Unfortunatly the second I started to move I dissosiated again. Now I'm back being dissossiated and that got me even more depressed. I just dunno what it meant, like does it mean there's a way I can finally feel normal again? 

Idk, just wanted to share my story.So I've been having strong vibrations for a long time before I knew what they were. I was kinda scared of them and seeked for an explanation, then I came to this subreddit. The vibrations (strong, sometimes painful and scary feeling, a static sound that smells like death) just came once in a while, without any intention. 
But this night I wanted them to come and they came. I fought off the fear so now it's a kind of a pleasure when they come. I read that in this state I should move out of my body to project but I didn't knew I can like really move cause I was scared I could just end the vibrations. But this night I moved my hands up and I saw them. Beautiful glowing hands. I tried rolling out of bed, but in the middle of doing it my dog made a noise and I got distracted, but I am not sad. I think I figured It out and next time I will project. 
I am very happy and grateful for this subreddit, cause without You all I wouldn't know that I have opened some kind of a door and I would probably be still scared of vibrations. Much thanks and Good luck to everyone trying. I feel that next time I will go out :)This is just a thought i’ve had. I’ve read how mirrors, mirrors facing each other, create vortexes and portals for spirits. Because of this I have a couple but distanced and mostly outta sight. But, could they be used in a way to enhance my own movement? Not necessarily between realms. Just an idea and curious what others may think!If you'll look over to the sidebar on the right, you should see the tab 'Astral Projection Wiki and IRC Channel'. The AP wiki has many useful insights and FAQs, but sadly isn't an actual post and is kind of out of sight. For this reason, it usually gets overlooked, so I'm going to translate a lot of the questions over to this post. This post won't be exact to the wiki, which I will probably also be revising soon. I'll also add on any other questions I often hear. Here is the direct link to the wiki if you're on mobile

**FAQs:**

**What is astral projection?** - Astral projection is an out-of-body experience where one leaves the physical body and enters into the astral plane. This is a natural part of the sleep process, but generally is not remembered as people are submerged within the subconscious that creates dreams. Through the use of meditation and concentration, one can experience this process in a conscious way.

**What is the astral plane?** - The astral plane is, in frequency, above both time (the 4th dimension), and the physical world (the 3rd dimension). The astral plane, being another dimension, is not subject to time and has different rules that govern how one experiences and travels there. These differences include; the ability to fly, move through other objects, travel by thought, and the manifestation of mental energy into reality that becomes dreams and such.

**What is astral travel and how does it relate to astral projection?** - Astral travel denotes any conscious exploration of the astral plane. Astral projection refers to the ability of going through the process of sleep consciously, using meditation. Astral projection are a means of getting to a state of consciousness within the astral plane to then astral travel.

**Is astral projection/astral travel dangerous?** - There is no danger related to these processes as they are related to the same processes as sleeping. Fear and doubt are completely unnecessary when it comes to AP. The only being who is in charge of your soul is you. Whether or not you let another being influence you is up to you.

**What is sleep paralysis?** - Sleep paralysis is an experience some people experience where they find themselves immobilized during the sleep process. This occurs to some people naturally and to others who practice Astral Projection. The reason sleep paralysis occurs is to make sure that none of the in-dream actions you are preforming are done by your physical body in real life. Think of that dog from Americas Funniest Home Videos who is dreaming of chasing something, and then gets up and runs headfirst into a wall. That is what SP is intended to prevent. Sleep paralysis can be frightening for those who are not aware of what is happening, but is usually a natural occurrence when one is very close to a conscious astral projection.

**What can I do while astral traveling?** - One can delve into the deepest oceans, travel to distant stars, experience past events or future events, and communicate with other beings. Ultimately, the astral enables individual exploration of the nature of the universe and our own psyche/consciousness. This is essentially a spiritual journey that astral travel enables; the greatest tool for people to seek out their wildest adventures and anything else imaginable, without being subject to other people’s beliefs, dogmas or misinformation.

**What is the vibrational stage?** - It is a sensation that is triggered by being in a deep-trance state with a calm(ish) mind. People describe it in many different-yet-similar ways. Some describe them as actual vibrations, others liken it to electricity, some say it's uncomfortable and others enjoy it. Personally to me, it feels like lightning coursing through me but without any pain or discomfort. It's just really intense, but still enjoyable.

**How long does it take someone to be able to project?** - It differs widely from person to person, and there is no set standard for how long you can expect to go before your first projection. Some take a very short time. Some take just weeks, others take months, and some it even takes years to be able to project. However, the only ones who never project, are those who give up. It took me a little bit over a month before I had my first projection, and even that is extremely quick progress. AP takes patience, willingness, and the right mindset. If you have doubt, don't think you will project, are discouraged, have fear or anything else like that, it can greatly hinder your progress. Just relax, stop caring about results, and just enjoy the journey.

**Are there other beings on the astral, and can they harm me?** - There are indeed other beings on the astral. I don't think of them as good or bad, everything has its purpose and nothing is inherently evil. There are those that could be described as the typical 'angel' from the Christian religion. There are those that one would describe as a demon from that same religion. However, these beings could have the same exact mindset, or be completely reversed from how you think they are. The 'angel' being could wish to negatively impact you, and conversely, the 'demon' could want to give you a friendly hug. However, that doesn't really matter because of the simple fact that no being on the astral can influence you unless you let it. If you panic, feel fear, freak out, then get terrified, you're basically opening yourself up and inducing a panic attack on yourself (even if you've never had a single one before). Remember, AP is a strange position to put yourself in. You're usually not consciously aware when you're on the astral, so being aware when you are can be very strange for your psyche.

**Does astral projection have anything to do with religion?** - No. No it does not. On this subreddit, we try to avoid religions as much as possible, as they limit people's viewpoints on the universe and start arguments. Anyone here is allowed to believe whatever they want to, and anyone of any belief is entirely welcomed here, as long as they don't go around touting their religion as fact and causing confrontations. Neutral and open spirituality is encouraged here. Religion, however, has a rule against being spread here. Rule #4 over on the right sidebar under the tab 'Rules' ->

Feel free to ask any other questions you think of. I hope this helps any newcomers, and even some return-visitors who want to keep their mind open to new information. Happy travels everyone!This thought just occurred to me. What happens to the conscious mind in such a state? Do we detach?


Edit: changed “accord” to “occurred”pls is it normal if i feel like my breathing stopped?I have been having out of body experiences most of my life. They started as a child. Then they stopped for many years when I entered my teens. As an adult I began meditating a lot and doing other spiritual practices. One of the effects of the practices was I started projecting again. Sometimes several times a week. The expanded awareness of consciousness and insights I received was profound. One example is I have no fear of death anymore. It has been wonderful. A downside for me though has been since rediscovering and spending time in these other incredible beautiful worlds my interest in this earth reality has diminished. Some of these places are so amazing and the people are so loving and friendly. Life there is really joyful and the feeling of freedom is wonderful. I often find myself really looking forward to projecting to go play and hang out. The contrast between some of these realities and earth is dramatic. It started affecting my experience of being here and enjoying this reality. It's like the analogy of someone being born in a small primitive village. They were told "this is all there is", there is nothing outside of this place. But eventually he was able to leave his village and realized there is a whole amazing beautiful world full of diversity and wonderful experiences to explore. It would very difficult for him to go back to his very limited life in the remote village. Have any of you also experienced this? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to regain more interest in this reality again? Thank you!This is the last paragraph from Journeys out of the body.

(...   

With the latter comes this Probability: in the year 2025, a boy in "Locale I" push a button on a device much like a portable radio. I perceive the Signal and turn my attention to him. 

"Hi there, son," I greet him warmly, and my great great grandchild smiles in recognition.  

....)

it seems to me, his great grandchild was calling him from a cell phone.

Did Robert Monroe predict smart phones?

what do you think?Whether it be the newbies asking the same questions over and over again, which they can just google, whether it be people who don't believe in AP and think it is all a hoax, the AP community always answers soo nicely. Everyone is soo lovely here. Why? Not that I have anything against it but in the couple months I have been in the AP community in discord servers and this subreddit, I have never seen anyone be rude.

I have talked to some people in the AP discord server in DMs and they always helped me. I even told to one of them how I have a tough time IRL and how practicing AP and meditating has helped me get through it. He/She then asked what is wrong and how could he/she be helpful. 

Thank you, AP community.I finally found the smoking gun today and have evidence I saw through my eyelids.  I had an opportunity to sleep in my work where no one was there, it was around 7ish pm I fell asleep and I slept until 9pm off and on.  There is a projector in the conference room I slept in and I was close enough to see the blue light blinking pattern during SP.  The blue light will blink on one side and on another it will flash blue again.  I knew I was in SP when I could not move my body and could see through my eyelids. [https://imgur.com/a/xjCPJSt](https://imgur.com/a/xjCPJSt)

Usuallly in SP it is futile for me to try and get out of it, no matter how much I kick scream for help or anything else, it just won't go away until I accept it and just stay in that state for as long as it wants me to be in SP.  I know for sure if someone turns on the light in the room or I hear their voice close enough to me will most likely kick me out of SP.

Another interesting thing I noticed was that I was able to hear the talking of cleaners, and in this conference room that is impossible unless they actually come inside the room, it is either they are veyr close to me and inside the room and I can hear them or they are far away to their cleaning room supplies area which I should not be able to hear if they are actually in their cleaning supplies room area.  So this is super hearing abilities that isn't of this physical world, it is of the higher realm astral body that is next level above the physical body that is hearing that.  Because regular voices near me would awaken me for sure, but this was the cleanings talking to themselvs from the other side of the floor we are on.  It was a male and female voice cleaners.  I have added of the cleaning room to show that they were actually there.  When I was there and went to sleep, there was no cleaning supplies room open, no lights no people and everything dim.  

In Near death experiences, people report seeing through eyelid or floating above their body and they can recall everything the nurses and doctors are doing, and Sleep Paralysis is very very similar to this experience too, we can see through our eye lids in SP.For those who haven't heard of it, 1 in 80,000 people are "born with a veil" (when the baby is delivered completely encased in the amniotic sac). Whilst this is not dangerous at all, and the baby can simply be cut out of it with ease, there have been stories told for generations about these 'caulbearers' who possess abilities such as clairvoyance and the ability to see the dead (spirit form) to name a couple. 

Although it sounds like a great idea for a fictional film, I can tell you now that it's a real phenomena. My aunt was a caulbearer and for her entire life could see 'ghosts' and she would also report that recently deceased family members would visit her. She would visit newly purchased houses and determine whether it was being occupied by a spirit. To her, these spirits were as clear as day. She said some of them didn't even know that they had passed, and would try to perform regular tasks such as doing the dishes. Some of them were well aware. 

Now I've recently started getting into Astral Projection and have been learning a lot about the Astral Planes, astral entities etc. I've only AP'd 3 or 4 times depending on what you would deem as a successful AP. From what I know, we cannot see these astral entities whilst in our physical bodies due to our vibrational differences. Despite lower astral entities vibrating at a low 'frequency', they still vibrate higher than our physical selves hence why they are non-existent to us in human form. So what of this veil? Why do those who are born with this caul possess the ability to see? Do they vibrate higher? Is it to do with the third eye?

Obviously I know there isn't someone who has all the answers, but it would make for a good discussion if there is anyone on here with some knowledge of this veil phenomenon. Another 'ability' that some caulbearers have is extremely high amounts of luck. There are a wide range of things that many of these people can do, but they don't all have all of the abilities. Sometimes it's a mix of a few, sometimes just one, sometimes none. My aunt was extremely lucky and could see spirits. 

Let me know if you know anyone born en caul and we can share stories and maybe see how this relates to the astral.So I have had several lucid dreams in the past, mostly from inducing and some random. But this was different.

I had been reading about AP a lot yesterday and wanted to try it but didn’t expect to get any results after my first try. I woke up during the night to go toilet and figured this was the perfect opportunity to try WILD, so I did.

I lay there in bed as still as possible whilst repeating in my head “body asleep, mind awake” and eventually started feeling the vibrations. Shortly after I began to drift off to sleep and then all of a sudden, I realised I was lucid and my body was paralysed, so I imagined a rope above me and started to climb it. Before I knew it, I was flying around the bedroom.

But here is something weird...I wasn’t in my bedroom, I was in the room next door to mine for some reason. So I went over to my bedroom door and opened it, but it was pitch black inside and I couldn’t see anything. So I tried to turn the lights on but it was like no matter how many times I touched the light switch, the light wouldn’t turn on.

So anyway I gave up with my room and floated downstairs so I could find a way out and go explore outside, but I woke up all of a sudden.

I enjoyed the experience but I hope next time it will last longer. I can't help but think these hired individuals are professional astral projectors, thoughts?calm your nervous system by controlling your breath with this simple hack. 

1- exhale all air through mouth making a "swoosh" noise and close mouth

2- inhale with nose while counting from 1 and hold breath when you reach 4

3- hold breath counting from 1 again until you reach 7

4- exhale air mouth making the "swoosh" sound again but count from 1 to 8

5- repeat at least 4 times the process until you reach your desired state

this is also called the 478 breath method and it's scientifically proven to knock out to sleep people with insomnia in 60 seconds so be careful and try to keep your mind awake while your body sleeps! it is also valid for mediation since it comes from Hinduism I think, like a master of meditation or something lol anyway hope I helped hahaha good luck and good projections! I see a lot of posts with people questioning the safety of astral projection, and many people see "demons" or "monsters," and worry about other beings entering their body during projection.

You may feel like your soul is leaving your body when you astral project, but your soul does not leave your body. Your consciousness just gets projected in a different dimension, similar to a movie projector projecting it onto a screen. The original projector (your consciousness) gets reflected onto a different screen (astral plane), and not the physical plane (while you are awake). It is not a phenomenon of your soul leaving your body. Our consciousness can exist in many different planes.  Another entity will not take over your body, because your soul doesn't leave your body in the first place.

Why do some people see monsters/demons during their projection? To put it simply, it is because they perceive it to be an entity that is separate from them, and they feel fear. This is not a separate entity from you, rather, it is a reflection of your fear. Fear is a strong lower vibration, and the stronger negative feelings you have about something, it will manifest in your daily life as well as your dreams/astral projections. When you are not stable mentally and you experience wide waves of emotion, it will be difficult to have a long, stable astral projection as emotions will bring down your vibrational frequency. Thinking of things that are related to your ego will also bring down your vibrational frequency (money, people, etc). Strong emotions (whether it is negative or positive) will also bring down your vibrational frequency, which means that you may stop astral projecting and wake up, or end up in a lucid dream or a dream.

Astral projection can be a fun, adventurous thing at first, but it is a very important tool towards spiritual awakening and learning about our true self. Through astral projection, you will realize that you are the creator, and this whole world is your creation. We are God, manifesting in different ego's, to experience suffering and powerlessness to realize that we are God once again, and experience unconditional love (that is what awakening is about). Our true self is the creator, and by that definition, the astral realm is your own creation. Everything you see in the world is created by you, and it is you.  That is the reason why you don't need to be afraid of anything, it is made from you. The only way to overcome fear of the unknown is to accept it and be able to love it, because why wouldn't you love something that you created? God would not divide what God created as good or bad - God would see it impartially.

By examining how you treat something you are afraid of/hate, you will be able to look deeper within at how you treat the parts yourself that you hate, and the others around you. If you want to be rid of negative emotions that arise, it's important to be grateful for the things that bring you those emotions, and be able to accept it with love as something that taught you an important lesson of healing your heart and growing the love you have inside of you. This can be done with meditation, shadow work and inner child healing.I’ve been reading up on this the past two weeks, but right after I started reading up on it I went through a sudden death in the family and due to the stress, grief, and total lack of sleep I haven’t had a chance to apply what I’ve learned. 

Last night I was finally able to lay down with the intention of waking up and attempting to get out of body using Michael Raduga’s method. I woke up that morning and managed to remember my intentions and didn’t move. I went into sleep paralysis very quickly and the vibrations started at the exact same time. They were very intense from the very beginning and I knew I had it in the bag.

I planned on attempting to roll out of my body and ended up rocking from side to side. I picked up momentum and got a little further each time I rolled. I ended up finally rolling completely out to the right and propped myself up in my forearms and opening my eyes. I was in my room, in my bed, with morning light coming through the window. I stayed like that for about ten seconds, just letting myself feel the sensation of being in this new situation. There was something wrong with my vision, and I realized I was blind in my left eye. 

I looked over my shoulder at the mirror in my room and thought, “well, I guess I’ll get over there and get this started.” Then my fiancée walked in the room which pulled me out if it. I’m glad she did though, because it confirmed that I was actually asleep and it wasn’t my physical body that was propped up on my forearms. 

Now that I know what it feels like, I think it’ll be a little easier to do. I can’t wait to practice and start gaining experience with this. I wonder why I couldn’t see out of my left eye, and if it’ll be like that next time? Thank you for all of the information y’all have compiled here! Happy to be a part of the communityPassed through a place last night and briefly chatted with an old friend who I haven’t seen in a long time. Ended with “see ya around” I don’t know if he was planning on sticking around or what, but woke to the news today that his physical body has died. 
I was explaining the realms to someone and kind of doing a tour, I’m not sure about this one area I was in though. It had areas sort of like beds similar to a physical realm bed but you do go to it for “rest” which I am now wondering if you go there to wait for whatever happens after you die. He was very relaxed and peaceful. He didn’t seem distressed or sad or anything. Just kind of accepting of what was going on and peacefully waiting/relaxing. I almost went into one of the resting areas myself but had to keep going so he told me “see ya around”  and as I left, I just kept describing things that would be seen and the colours and everything. 

Anyone else ever experience this or know what I’m talking about? 

I don’t have enough words to describe everything that was there. It’s like there isn’t words to describe it all. 

I’ve talked with others that have passed before, but I knew they were gone before meeting up with them. Last night was a first like this.Hi all , I was wondering if those who commit suicide go to lower astral plane and if so how can one get out?I’ve been able to AP since I was little or what at least I think is AP. When it happens I literally just sit up from my body and I’m able to see myself sleeping in bed. If I have my cats sleeping in the bed I can pet them and they react to the touch. The thing I find strange is everything is blue, and the layout is almost like a blueprint design. I can interact with all objects and for some reason time continues as normal. I can walk out of my house and get into a car and drive to places that I’ve never visited in my life yet somehow I know the layout, weather, and can speak the language. Whenever I AP and enter the plane i just get this sense of warmth and safety that floods my system. The quietness is my favorite thing because it reminds me of snow falling, if that makes since. Lastly no matter where I am, if I’m still in my home or in bora bora I can see the sun beginning to rise. At this point I can either drive myself back or think about my room and I’m there. I look at myself sleeping again and pet the cat, then I simply just lay down and I’m awake. I remember everything i did that and where I went.    I guess my question is does anyone else experience something like this because i feel like I’m alone.Has anyone ever seen alternate versions of oneself from parallel universes when astral projecting?Hi everyone! 

I have worked on honing my astral projection skills for over 5 years now with still little to no luck! I have had two or three conscious OBE experiences but have a difficult time consistently and purposefully projecting. 

I am very spiritually inclined in a multitude of other ways but can never seem to get astral projecting down! I’ve read countless books, dedicated myself to energy work, have done lots of research, and just can’t seem to do it. I’m on week 3 of dedicated daily practice and following Mastering Astral Projection 90 day guide (hopefully this time with positive results 😄)

Does anyone have any advice? Have you experienced anything similar? I’m open to any advice you may have! ❤️ I was trying a lot of other methods from people that told me it would work first try but still it didn't work. So this is my advice that had helped me when I was trying to reach the vibration stage for months. I laid down and breathed in as deep as possible. As you are exhaling you need to feel your yourself falling down or sinking into your bed. Next, once you have done this like 20 times you need to literally go limp. I think people underemphasize the importance of going limp since when I first tried it I instantly started feeling vertigo, tingling, etc. And I tried this for 4 days now and each attempt I have only gotten farther than the last attempt. But obviously this works for me and you may need to modify this. I hope I got my point out and if you have any advice or your opinions please feel free to tell me.So if you're familiar with Bob lazar you'll know that area 51 is just a military base and testing facility for weapons. But he says below it by a few miles is the base S4 he claims he worked at seeing alien craft and maybe seeing one alien. My question is, would anyone be able to validate his claims (which I already believe) through astral projection? Like fly to the base and explore it until they find something interesting?

Edit: after reading everyone's comments about military defenses against astral bodies it mainly mentioning CIA and American government. Would other countries be as advance in AP protection?Everytime im close to astral projecting i hear screaming. Like if someone is being tortured, and it always scares me off so i dont astral project.Hi all, 

Long time lurker on this sub. I was wondering if it was ever possible to use the astral realms/dimensions to pursue personal interests. For me, I just like studying, playing guitar, and reading. Could I use the astral realm to slow down time and read/study a book while I’m projecting or do other hobbies as well? It would essentially be me reading and studying a book in its entirety in the astral realm (which would be perceived as hours or days) while the actual amount of elapsed in the real world would be like an hour or so.Sharing this here for archival purposes and in case anyone else can relate. 

It was briefly intuited/glimpsed and energetically felt without deliberately trying to project or envision anything specific. 

I was meditating near a body of water in the afternoon, in half lotus with an erect spine and gentle breathing. Awareness was directed primarily to the heart-space, focusing on having love and compassion for all of spacetime. In the visualization, my dharmic incarnation as a spatio-temporal embodiment of energy was to uplift and elevate every peripheral field with radiations of pure unconditional love. Then gradually emerged a surprisingly vivid vision: it felt like, at the barycenter of the external reality, was the smallest dot mentally conceivable, sub-Planck length in its size. It contained the quintessence of the Universe's energy, held an infinitely compressed reservoir of power, and from there projected outwards what we observe to be planets, stars, and lifeforms. As if there was a singularity-dot as the central axis of the cosmos. I observed my projected self observing my true self that was projecting. 

Lasting perhaps only a minute or so of clear perception, it stirred a lot of energy in my meditating body and then the experience was rather quickly attenuated in intensity. Soon I was back in the meditation, and the projector dot was gone.In order to practice AP, is meditation the best key? Or are other things important too like nutrition exercise etc.

Would be dope to hear peoples stories about how they got better at AP.This whole experience i had last night was weird i have this faint small clip that i remember from my third ever lucid dream. I remember seeing a white owl with brown circular spots, sitting on farthest reaching dead branch on a withered tree. The tree was sitting close to a  I found a picture that’s kind of close but i’ll post that next. he was some how racing me but turning his body to the side flaunting his amazing vibrant brown spots and the white that covered the rest had faint hues of a similar brown to compliment all the curves on his body. I think i completely missed what he said cuz all i remember is thinking very loudly to myself that’s my spirit guide. I think he might’ve tried to communicate telepathically with me when i had that realization and i missed his message. He then turned his head to his left and towards the end of the branch he was standing on, skipped a few times and took off and then i woke up. It actually took me abt an hour to remember everything that happened because i had completely forgot when i woke up. I don’t remember becoming lucid i just know i was lucid but does that mean i could’ve been projecting and not known? 
Edit: Also i don’t remember feeling or seeing a body when i was approaching maybe i was just experiencing the meeting place and my spirit guide?

Edit: 100 upvotes! Thanks y’all sm! And good luck to y’all aswell!I hope some people actually answer this, because every time I've asked this question, it's hardly acknowledged. I'd really appreciate it if some of you guys answer. 

Also, to those who have met any in the astral, how were you positive it was actually their spirit, so to speak, and not just a figment of your imagination.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/nsa-rdp96x00790r000100030004-1So I have been trying to AP for quite a bit of time. After having an out of body experience on acid I’ve found myself more connected to my dreams and everything has been a tad overwhelming. During said out of body experience, I saw a man, his features were not defined, but I felt his presence and knew he was there. Though, that’s not even the beginning for said man. It all started a couple of days ago when things started getting weird. On the first night of the weirdness, I closed my eyes to sleep and saw a rainbow tunnel and then this man rising within that tunnel, as if something inside me was awoken and i’m not sure what it was, I wasn’t even asleep yet, though everything I saw when I closed my eyes was so real? On the second night, I had some pointless dreams, but there is a specific dream I was conscious for, I was looking into the eyes of a man. We said nothing to each other the whole time, yet we were just staring into each others eyes, made me a bit skeptical when I woke up. The third night (last night), I became aware in a dream of my room. At night I sleep with my bathroom open, so when I looked into my bathroom, I saw a man tipping his hat at me. It was the same man but I saw him in more detail. This time, I gained the courage to ask him who he was, and what he wanted. He replied “Relax, I’m the man from the tunnel, and from the mirror during your first out of body experience.” After that, he didn’t say anything to me but relax. His energy was visibly blue. Who could this man be to me, and what is his purpose? Could he potentially be a spirit guide to help me explore the process, and beauty that AP holds, or is he darker than that? Why am I able to see him and talk to him in my dreams? ( I also should mention that following my out of body experience, I was heading to sleep. As I was laying there, I felt so much energy, and saw a tunnel that I believe may have been taking me out of my body again. Sadly my boyfriend was having a trippy dream where he fell and he woke me up so I don’t know where I could have been heading in that moment)So, I've been trying to astral project for the last several years, to no avail. I've tried the rope method, roll out, WBTB, none have worked. The furthest stage I ever make it to (if I dont fall asleep) normally is the vibrational stage, but I've never successfully broken through. 

This past month, however, I was VERY close.

I ran into some local cubensis from a friend, and thought I'd try to astral project with this batch. Figured it never worked while I was sober, so shrooms might do the trick right? I split a quarter of shrooms with my fiance (both very experienced psychonauts) and we thought we'd try to AP together. It was her first time trying to AP and we were both excited.

I put on a guided hypnosis AP video for this new method I had found, called "fractionation". And holy balls did it blow my mind. 

About 20 min into the hypnosis, I could feel my astral body being pulled out of this physical shell. I heard almost like a zipping and popping (I guess?) Kinda sound as my body was being pulled through. The hypnosis video had prompted me to open my eyes, and what the fuck!!!!! 

Everything had a blue tinge!!! There were patterns everywhere on the walls, the floor, and I could no longer see my fiance lying next to me. I could definitely tell my astral body was elevating, but something just kept me anchored here in the physical world. It felt like something was keeping me here, as if it thought I wasn't ready yet.

It was bittersweet; the closest I'd ever gotten to breaking through, and yet, still no AP.

My question to you all, is have you used Psychedelics to induce AP? What do you think of the practice of psychedelics assisted AP? Pros and cons? 

Im gonna try it again next week and will report my findings, but if you've used psychedelics to successfully break through, please drop a comment! I'm damn tired of "almost" breaking through!

Peace and good vibes to everyone that actually takes the time to read this post!

Edit: here's the video! https://youtu.be/iJBXeWNYhgs•Is it possible to astral project just for the sake of going wherever you want, without any spiritual growth purposes?

•I read that you can time travel while out of the body. Has anyone seen any future events that came true, or any future events that are yet to happen?

•I read about some records that hold every answer to every question in the universe. Have any of you ever gone there? What questions have you answered? Could you possibly answer some questions of mine?

•Whats the strangest thing you’ve ever seen while out of the body?

•How do you know you’re not just dreaming?

•Have you ever gotten in a fight on the astral plane?

•Do you come in contact with demons and shit that try to kill you?

•How has astral projection affected your regular life?

•What secrets have you uncovered?

•Have you ever visited another planet?

•Have you ever been hurt out of the body?

•Has it ever gone wrong?

•If you went to those records, did you find out if aliens were real, how the universe came to be, or when you were going die? Or how you were going to die?

I’m considering trying it, but I’m also a Christian and I’m not sure if it’s considered a sin to do so. Maybe you guys can answer some of my questions?\*AAA I overslept\*

&#x200B;

I know you guys have heard about project stargate by now but have you seen these documents about people teleporting solid objects through other solid objects and other tests like this? This is a tad bit related but i wanna bring up some other points, too.

&#x200B;

Well, if this is true, why hasn't the public freaked out about it by now?

&#x200B;

Simple. They either don't believe or care, most likely the former. My hypothesis is that the CIA released such groundbreaking stuff, knowing that people won't believe it. They could release a doc about someone talking to an alien and no one would find it for like, 9 years or something.

But something is different.

&#x200B;

I'm sure that you've also heard of and maybe felt yourself the global spirituality shift that we're so lucky to be alive and experience (A phenomenon I like to call The Great Ascension). More and more people are becoming more open minded than ever before, and it is times like these that people like us need to act.

&#x200B;

But the last thing that we all know is that Ego is the biggest detriment to spiritual growth. It doesn't make us special that we're good, open minded people. My belief is that we were just souls that wanted to affect Earth in a good way so that it may affect the universe in a good way. The last thing we all want is for Earth to be remembered as a stain in the vast, black expanse.

&#x200B;

Back to my point:

Read some of it. It's 88 pages, but it's good stuff. **Page 55** is, in my opinion, where it gets good.Just to clarify, I do believe in astral projection and that it's much more than just your imagination. 

But you'd still have your imagination after learning astral projection, so how do you know the difference?

Like if you're trying to astral project, how do you know you succeeded and not just imagined it?I feel like it’s really effing me up since then. It’s like I keep mentally projecting myself somewhere and it really effs w me mentally. Been like this for a few years now and it’s starting to get annoying. There’s been few times tho I felt as if I was leaving my boys even while driving , pretty scary cause I thought I was going to wreck. At this point idk how to control this shi. Sometimes I’m chill and very present but doesn’t last for long. I hate it so much any advice?????


Edit: oh yeah this in hand has really been messing up my sleep, too I can sleep but I can’t sleep I still look tired af. Like wtf man. I don’t even look normal anymoreThe past year or so I’ve been entering completely arbitrary states of surreal realities in my sleep. There’s no pattern or timing to it but it just happens. It’s been becoming more frequent however, and it doesn’t feel like dreaming. 

The first time it happened, I had fallen asleep during a remote class and i started feeling these tingly vibrations around my body, burning and scorching me. This feeing slowly started ramping upward and it submerged me, and i felt like i was simultaneously under water and being viciously electrocuted. Then a very high noise pitch started blasting my ears and i was so scared. I felt like i was an ant in a giants hand being slowly picked up, and like an ant i was incapable of comprehending the nature of my surroundings. I saw flashing imagery of a foreign language that was spoken through vibrations and could be used to express consciousness and time, there was a certain mathematics to it, or a pattern that gave me clarity. There was the faint image of these energetic beings, but they communicated through emotion and telepathy rather than conventional forms of language. They did not claim to be gods or deities, rather they said they were close relatives and that I would one day understand life from their perspective. They showed me imagery from my life, repressed memories, it’s like i was strolling through a museum of every emotion in my life. I had asked for them to show me truth and show me reality, but the pitches had gotten so intense that when i looked into truth my mind rejected and blanketed it. I was transported to an empty abandoned apartment building with fucked up floorboards and I could feel that I wasn’t alone in there. It was nighttime and there were things in there that could sense my presence. The apartment had infinite rooms and floors and I eventually found my way back home by jumping into a black void that was the gate between these realities. 

I had more and more of these dreams over time, all with a similar theme of realizing that I’m living in an illusion. Another one stuck out however where I was in something called “the Grid”, where every tile represented an alternate reality and a different identity, it was through this experience i learned that these worlds can be manipulated once we let go of them, and that what we confuse to be ourselves is simply a temporary container for a grander more confusing consciousness. There were these faceless beings chasing after me and I had escaped into a tile that wasn’t my own and had witnessed reality crumble on itself.

The reason i’m posting this now, nearly a year later, is because of this one experience i had- and it was so terrifying that I can’t call them dreams anymore. It was 4:30 am and i had finally gotten tired enough to sleep, I had felt the pitch rising and knew what i was in for, and i was used to being able to look away or escape when things became too intense, but not this time. This time, when I saw truth, my mind could no longer blanket it. When i closed my eyes, I saw eyes looking back at me, and I could feel my body being grabbed and being forced to look at reality. I was in an empty world, where I could hear the tv playing in the background where my real body was, but this world was just like mine except everything was pure white and there was nobody there except for me, and like the first time, there were beings there looking for me. And I saw them. I wish I died there, because I don’t know what to make of this anymore. I don’t know where to continue and from the day I was born I wanted clarity and I wanted answers but I don’t know anything anymore. I wanted to find myself but not like this. I was wondering if anybody here has had similar experiences in any way because I don’t want to be alone with these things anymore. I just want insight or somebody to relate to. I’m fucking terrified.To anyone here who's been on the astral plane, have any of you came across any deities there and if so, what did they look like or appear as, and what were they like?I just discovered this sub two days ago, prior to that, I had no idea what astral projection was. I wanna go visit my two dogs who have passed away (they were my best friends) and I’m wondering if I can achieve this through astral projection? But I have another question, I killed someone once in a dream (this was a few weeks ago, before I heard of all this) and it really traumatized me once I read that dreams can be real. Also I’m not a violent person I’m 28/F and a bit of an alcoholic but I’m a really nice person and I would never hurt a fly, in fact I don’t even kill bugs or mice, I use humane traps to lure them out of my home without harming them, I literally would NOT hurt anything, that would break my heart! I’m a really kind person. Did I kill someone in another multiverse? Thank you!!I had an AP experience tonight, it was so real feeling that I thougjt I had awoken in another reality... which I was thrilled anout and careful to go along with the people and test it. I got to interact,  touch, speak with  both my husband and grandmother who are dead in this reality. My inner monologue the whole time was how much it seemed i was really there and not just dreaming. I even napped and was wary of opening my eyes lest i see my bedroom again. 

When the woman i was interacting with who seemed to be my roommate, told me my grandmother was there to visit me... i realized it meant it probably wasn't another reality but astra realm. She was younger and healthier, fitter. Around 40, looked like her but i remember thinking her eyes looked more like my aunts and feeling suspicious before realizing she was just younger than id ever seen her, and feeling the warmth and love from them and getting distracted by the food she brought me. 

I was in a different dream first, just in bed with my husband. I could actially feel him.in so much detail. I kept feeling his arm, astounded that he was really there in bed with me in the flesh and i could feel so much texture. He gotout of bed and I clung to his arm afraid for him to leave to the point he was dragging me along with him. The arm i was wrapped around turned to energy body and then dissipated and I woke up still in bed in a different home where the rest of the experience happened. I felt fully there,  not like a dream where you kind of phase in and out of places and find yourself in different rooms and things are strange. 

I felt the floor with my feet, i was fully physically  aware of each step i was taking between rooms and down the stairs to greet my grandmother and bring her in. The people knew me, and my husband. The only dream like thing that happened was i looked at a framed photo of my husband as i waited for him to come home from tthe clas je and his friend were at and he seemed to immediately be there after I focused on him. Also his cats face was weird,  kind of missing fur around the facial features like a monkey. 

Anyway,  im really astounded how normal and dense it felt.  I was convinced for half of it that I truly reality shifted.http://imgur.com/gallery/zl1XtdO

If this at all interests you, come join our 90+ members! We have lurkers, practitioners, teachers, chatters, and more! We are using [Discord](https://discord.gg/CnWKtb6) currently.I successfully astral projected, fully, twice! I also made it out of my house and traveled somewhere new. Or old. 

Before falling asleep, I set my intention to look into a mirror, eat something, and then to travel to Stonehenge at dawn (this did not happen, I was taken to Ireland instead). 

I woke up on my back, felt the vibrations, and immediately rolled out. I stood or kind of hovered beside my bed and body, absolutely thrilled but trying to control it. I found that I couldn't walk as I would with my physical body, so I focused my intent on finding the mirror in my hallway. I then felt myself kind of... Speed to the mirror. As tho I became wind, or like someone had hit the fast forward button.

I stared into it for a while, relieved that nothing terrifying was staring back. It was me, but younger, 16 or so, and I looked like a wet oil painting someone had dragged a flat edge through horizontally, in two places. It was really interesting. The more I focused on the reflection, the more clear it became. The drag marks were facinating. 

Next on my agenda was to eat something. I focused on the kitchen, which was joined to the hall. 

This part is a bit hazy. I can't remember how I got the yogurt out of the fridge, or how I obtained a spoon, but I found myself eating a container of raspberry yogurt. It was delicious! Far more delicious than it would be in the physical world. The texture was.. Incredible. I could taste every molecule. I didn't think to focus on my astral body, to see what it looked like. I don't remember seeing my hands at all. 

I was brought back into my body, and set my intentions on Stonehenge. 

I rolled out after I felt the vibrations, and focused on moving to my living room quickly, immediately forgetting all about Stonehenge. All I knew was that I wanted to go somewhere. Anywhere. I expressed my desire fervently.. out.. and suddenly I was in the sky, above what I thought to be the coast of Ireland. There were tall cliffs overlooking a vast sea, not a person in sight. It was morning (which makes sense as they are 5 hours ahead of me, tho I guess this could have been another time all together) and the sky was clear and blue. It felt crisp and cool. I'm not sure where in Ireland I was, or if it was truly Ireland, but I felt like it was. There along the cliff were two small cottage like structures, like forts with flat roofs, made of stacked stones. It was beautiful - the most beautiful place I'd ever seen. The ocean waves were crashing into the cliff walls, and the ground was covered with green moss, and small plants, and ivy, which climbed the stone walls in some places. I had the feeling someone I knew lived there. 

After circling the compound and seeing noone I decided to try and go through a wall. I only put my head through to look in. There were two giant dogs inside, who noticed me peeking. One was a large black hound who looked right at me, the other wasn't as clear, as I was focusing on the hound. They didn't growl or give off a menacing vibe, but I was startled and afraid, so I pulled myself back out and tried to go through another way. I went in through an opening and was going quickly around a corner, through a hall, and I had the feeling of being chased by... A pulling feeling. It's hard to describe. I was then brought back into my body.

I wanted to try again, but... I fell asleep. I had some trouble keeping my thoughts clear, and recalling everything in detail, but I read that this can happen. I'm a bit sleep deprived, so that's to be expected I guess. 

Happy trails!

Edit : I have APed a few times before, but it's never been this full or clean. I usually get my feet stuck, get stuck to the floor, am half blind, or still feeling the vibrations from my physical body. 

All in all, this was a pretty amazing experience.Hello everyone, I want to share my experience, that happened this morning. I'm no experienced astral traveler, but I had some spontaneus experiences in the past, and this morning an Astral Projection triggered. I woke up 7 A.M. and went for a glass of water, then returned to my bed. While I was falling asleep, I could feel my body relaxing and falling asleep, while my conciousness was still present and clear. Vibrations started, and I slowly began to turn around to free my self from my body. A matter of seconds and I was floating over my asleep body. I watched my hands and they were of a light blue inconsistent and floaty substance. I knew what it was happening and happiness invaded my being. I thought "Fly above" and in a second I was floating over my town. Aerial vision was strange and difficult to explain. I was seeing the scenery "pop up" in existence, like I was entering a world that wasn't completely generated; it was like the town was appearing piece by piece, and like a chessboard, blocks of the scenery were popping from nothingness while I was watching. Then I thought "Fly to the Sun". Suddenly Earth started to shrink away, with the moon following it, and I was transported in space, right in front of the Sun. It was majestic, I could see plasma swirling around, sunspot moving and electromagnetic burst of energy come out of the Sun, creating splendid arcs. Next, I wanted to see a planet, and Pluto popped to my mind. The far, distant Pluto and the extreme of the solar system. "Fly to Pluto" I thought. And at a superluminal velocity, there I was. But there was something wrong. As I approached the far little planet, far from the sun, terrible creatures lurked in the deep space, flying around the planet. They were strange and grotesque, they had wings that used to move in space, and tentacle limbs coming out of what I'd call an head. Other creatures lurked even far away than Pluto. I wasn't scared, but as I finished in this nightmarish place I could feel a sort of darkness permeating the deep space in that zone, and multiple scenery of unknown terrors were being shown to me. I thought "fly back to Earth" and there I was, back to my planet. I began concentrating and to say that I needed to "go up", I don't really know what that means but as I thought about that I felt strong vibrations, and then I was back in my bed, wide awake. This was terrifying to think back to, even If I was not scared during the experience. What do you think about this? How would you interpret it? Comments are welcome and I hope you take time for a chat!Astral projection takes time, effort, and concentration. It takes determination and pure will power. A lack of fear and curiosity. I'm gonna tell you how you can finally get to the other side.

falling asleep: This is a problem I've been struggling with for a while. This is due to a lack of concentration, and/or sleep deficit. Also, astral projecting at night time is not recommended. It is possible but not likely to be successful, especially for a beginner.

in order to fix this, you need to sleep off the deficit. When you astral project you need to be focused 100% Believe me, there is no room for distraction.

Staying awake: This is caused by excitement, substances like caffeine and sugar, or astral projecting with too much light in the room. People don't know this but you actually have to GO TO SLEEP before astral projecting. It's not uncommon for people to randomly lose consciousness and wake up outside of their bodies.

This can be fixed by calming down, cutting back on caffeine and sugar, and either black-out blinds or astral projecting in the morning.

Your subconscious and your intention are everything. The only time I've astral projected was due to my intention. If you do not have an intention, you will just fall asleep.

If you set the intention, and maintain that intention for only 2 minutes and then attempt to astral project, don't be disappointed when you wake up the next morning with no experience. You have an intention.

A technique that has worked for me, in the beginning, is called the wake back to bed method and is as follows:

Wake up 7 hours after going to bed.

Stay up 10  to 15 minutes. Do not look at your phone or read a book.

Tell yourself that you WILL astral project. Get excited about it, visualize it.

Lay on your back and relax. Maintain consciousness as you do so.

as you lay on your back, look at the back of your eyelids and just watch them.

watch your mind as it falls asleep. When you realize your mind is drifting, tell yourself "I allow my body to go to sleep and my mind to stay awake". This statement should be an intention in your mind to astral project.

looking at the back of your eyelids maintains focus and keeps you entertained. It also lets you know when you are in hypnagogia. In order to astral project, you need to get to the hypnogogic state.

You will know if you have reached hypnagogia if you are seeing random images, hearing sounds, hearing voices, etc.

This is where you astral project. There are many many methods on how to astral project, here are 50 techniques [https://obe4u.com/astral-projection-guide/](https://obe4u.com/astral-projection-guide/).

I recommend figuring out whether you're a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic person, Then adapt your technique accordingly.

This method is the most effective, if it doesn't work, just increase your intention/focus or change the projection technique. Please do research before attempting, you may be traumatized if you don't.

edit: I just remembered some effective things I did that really helped me succeed:

When you're relaxed enough, or you wake up in the middle of the night, look straight up (eyes closed) like trying to look at your forehead. You will either have instant vibrations, or you will instantly lucid dream.

Also, waking up in the middle of the night and not moving has caused many astral projections. Wake up naturally, but when you wake up, DO NOT MOVE! Don't even open your eyes! You will immediately start feeling vibrations and you will be able to astral project as long as you maintain consciousness.

I hope this helps. Good luck and enjoy!I’ll share with you how to easily astral project or change planes of consciousness first before sharing my experiences. 

All you have to do is become lucid while you’re dreaming, and while lucid, move your dream body UP or DOWN with your MIND. 
In other words, become aware that you’re dreaming while you’re dreaming, then use your MIND to move your dream body UP or DOWN. Don’t think about it too much, just do it.

What happens after that, is gonna be a different experience for everybody. 
By the way, when you do this, you might meet somebody, or something.. so don’t be scared!! I got taught about this in some spiritual group I forgot which one.  I did this successfully twice. 

First time I did this I became lucid in a dream then I moved my body up with my mind and the dream collapsed into itself, and for about two seconds I was staring at a all black screen that was doing this sort of tilting movement. Then I appeared in my room, where I met with a freaking demon that started attacking me as soon as I arrived. Let me explain something to help you imagine what exactly went down. Not too long before this event, I had a sleep paralysis experience where I woke up and seen black smoke. At first I was thinking the garbage was on fire or something cuz it was next to the heater sort of and I looked to the left and there’s a shadow entity floating by my bed she had no face no legs and it was scary as heck. So when I projected, I was getting attacked upon arrival before I even realized it was my room I was in feel me and how the attack went, it was like literally my point of view like my vision had a big crack in it to the left literally it was like seeing with a big crack in your line of view like you cracked a tv screen and my body was being dragged down on my bed constantly as I was trying to keep standing up straight but it kept just dragging me down but it wasn’t doing it physically it was just happening to me the thing is I seen the very same black smoke from the paralysis in the astral realm and I seen the body figure of the demon in my peripheral view but what was happening was so already terrifying I felt that if I turned and looked the demon in the face I was gonna die of a heart attack in my sleep because it was all VERY VERY scary. Also in my point of view I seen my left arm stuck in a weird position, one like if you were to flex your biceps with your fist pointed upward but the fist leaning more towards my head than pointed up like a regular flex. I tried to move it but it was stuck in this position and also felt stuck in the position. I couldn’t move it. Also the entire time from the beginning of the attack I heard a DEAFENING sound that was playing over and over again until I awoke. It sounded like sonic the hedgehog when he’s balling up getting ready to run real fast.. it was VERY VERY loud. But yes It was basically me just trying to just stand up against what the demon was doing to me, holding me down and stuff, without even touching me. it was just a struggle That was a very weird experience, I think about it every day of my life.

Second time I ever projected. I became lucid in a dream. I tried to move my body up with my mind but I guess I didn’t exert enough mental force, because I seen my body in the dream lift up in the air a little like in third person and I just fell on my face on the ground in the dream. Then I used ALOT of mental force to try again  then the whole dream collapsed into itself again. I seen the same black screen for like 7-8 seconds this time. Then I appeared in my room. I instantly felt like I was floating, and there were tiny stars everywhere. I think, dang, what should I do I didn’t even think about what I wanted to do once I got this far lol. Then the idea came to me. SPACE! I flew through the roof into the sky! I seen the dark streets under me and all!, then while flying towards space before even leaving earth, a random path just appeared out of no where. You ever play super Mario and at the end of the level you jump on those blocks and grab the flag? The path was made out of blocks that looked exactly like those, many of them! A Big 3D block path and the color of the blocks started out pale blue then as I followed the path I remember seeing like this 3D castle structure that looked like something from super Mario and I seen random VERY COLORFUL BRIGHT blocks jus like the path just started showing up out of no where and the path lead to some crazy 3D land with castles structures and a whole bunch of other stuff that was breathtakingly amazing but I just can’t seem to remember most of it! I remember going through the path for a long while though but once I stopped projecting I couldn’t remember after I started following the path at first and seeing that castle structure and the random bright blocks. My memory stops there but I definitely was going around that place for a good while and I remember it was too amazing it was literally like being in a real life super Mario world. That’s what it reminded me of. Also literally think about this experience every day.Hello all. I'm new here - let me know if I'm violating any rules or anything, I won't be offended.

I need some tips though. I've been practicing trying to astral project maybe once every couple nights for the past few months. So far, I haven't been able to fully project, but from what I've read, I think I've gotten really close.

Most times I try, I'm able to get to this state of deep, intense vibrations. I get to where my whole body is completely ringing and buzzing, my head, arms, legs, torso, heart, everything is all vibrating.

It's so intense that it's pretty uncomfortable, but after a lot of practice I am now able to lean into it, as well as induce it more easily. But I can't get any further than that. I am unable to visualize any sort of rope, or induce any sort of movement in my light-body. I get the vibrations, I exhale and make them more intense, it stays for a few seconds, then on the inhale it fades. 

Am I on the right track? What can I do to move past this stage? It's pretty hard for me to visualize things in my head, so the conventional advice about visualizing a rope or something doesn't work for me. Any advice is welcome!!! Thanks!

(edited for phrasing)Alright folks

I've been trying to AP for a while now. I have a crazy story from this morning thatll hopefully motivate those out there still trying, or entertain those who already have experience. Here's my history to give you context: 

1) I've reached the vibrational stage a few times. Twice I have experienced the feeling of shooting out of my body, just to get scared/exicted and ruin it. It feels like being sucked up by a vacuum but it's a very mental process if that makes sense. I also hear a loud ringing in my ears, which is was what scared me the most the first time. 

2) I meditate quite often and Im pretty spritual. I've done a lot of research on religion/meta-physics/spirituality the whole nine yards. I feel a very real connection to this stuff and have had a lot of signs (including my super close AP experiences) to keep me on this path knowing all this shit is real. I do believe awareness of this stuff could help you with projecting. 

3) Twice when trying to astral project, out of no where this face (hard to make out but it's a large alien looking face) shows up in my vision (eyes closed). Its scared me and stopped from attempting for a while cause I'm not sure what I'd do if I saw an entity standing at my bedside. I've been scared of the unknown I guess. I'm not sure if the visions were real (closed eye visuals can definitely be decieving and I see a lot of colors with my eyes closed) but they were enough to scare me for a while. If you have any advice about dealing with fear/entities, I would really appreciate them. 

ACTUAL AP EXPERIENCE HERE

OK with all that being said, this morning I was laying in my bed. I had recently woke up and felt kind of lethargic so I was just sitting there kind of meditating. No thought of AP projecting at all (still scared lol). I was kind of fading/dozing off and all of sudden (and I mean all of sudden) I start getting sucked out of my body (same sensation as when I normally tried to astral project in #1). My first thought is something/someone was pulling me out but I wasn't sure so I just decide to stay calm and wait it out. It gets crazier (and I hear the ringing noise) and eventually it subsides (felt like maybe 15 secs of getting sucked out). I now feel like I'm floating in blackness. I figure im in my bed and im like "oh yeah I gotta get up now." So I literally just try to sit up and I realize it's working so Im getting excited now. I kind of float out of my bed and slowly hit what I assume is the floor. So I get up and now i try to open my eyes (I didnt want to earlier cause trying to open my eyes too early ruined my last tries. So definitely wait till you KNOW you're out, and you'll know). 

So Opening my eyes WORKS and I'm in my room!! I'm geeked lol but I try not to get too excited. Everything feels super "lucid" (it really is an accurate word) almost like I'm on shrooms if you know how that feels. The weirdest thing is I'm in my room in a DIFFERENT TIME. My floor is really dirty and it's just not put together like before I projected. I don't really care tho. I don't look at my body cause I don't wanna ruin it, so I go to my bathroom but I think not to look at the mirror cause maybe that'll ruin it? So I'm like let's go outside!! Maybe we can fly or something lol. But (and this is funny) I feel like I don't have a shirt/shoes on, so I go back to my room and grab the first shirt on the shelf. Then I try to look for my slides (flip-flops) and I see one but the other one is lost in the mess on my floor I assume. I start looking for it but I can't find it and I start getting super fustrated and I come back to my body. Completely seamlessly, ALMOST instaeneously I'm lying in my bed, eyes closed, feeling way more energetic than before I projected. I open them and I'm just chilling in bed. 

Crazy experience. I'm guessing my fustration and anger woke me up, just like too much fear will wake you up from a dream. I'm cool with it though cause I'm not as scared and excited to try again. I have some theories about why it happened this way and some extra details I can give so feel free to ask questions. I appreciate this community and glad I can finally offer something. 

ALSO 
Again, If you have any advice about dealing with fear/entities, I would really appreciate them. Have you encountered "evil" entities? Have you had "scary" experiences that didn't harm you in the end? Is the fear something I just need to fight through? Im still kind of scared and I think some other experiences could help me calm down. Thank you in advance!!Not entirely sure, but I think I saw clips of my future by  accident. I’m not convinced that these were lucid dreams because it felt very physically real, nothing like I’ve ever experienced, and I’m also not sure I was even sleeping. The other night, laying in bed, I physically left my body and traveled through what felt like a wormhole, and ended up in 5 scenes where I was seeing them all from the first person. The projection was so palpable and so real, it would actually terrify me back in to my shaking body. It was a 360 degree experience, with smells and temperature in each projection. Each time I’d start to let myself drift back in, when I realized that it was going to keep happening, I tried to be less terrified of it, and try to stay longer. But it started showing me things I didn’t really want to see (like me holding a premature baby in my arms, when I’ve never wanted kids). But the projections were basically making me feel that these were real moments that hadn’t happened yet. That feeling felt more real than I can even explain. How should I attempt to stay in these realms longer? More meditation? Less fear? I’m honestly not even sure how I accessed it. It just happened to me.I’vs been trying to AP but im just curious what are your experiences with beings?? I love the idea of more things than us in this universeRecently I've started helping people out more on astral projecting after I started better understanding this reality and putting together the information I learned over the years, combined with my personal experiences along the ongoing journey of spiritual evolution. I created this technique myself; I'm calling it the Drayton Manifest Technique (intentionally named the DMT Method).

-----

In a nutshell:

1. Listen to white noise or binuraual beats on your back, fully clothed to stay awake

2. Do 4-7-8 breathing until you notice yourself naturally stop and start receiving random information. This is different from being distracted which happens in the beginning rounds of breathing so just refocus on the breathing until you feel this "shift" in your thoughts when relaxed deep enough. You'll be able to tell as this type of awareness will feel timeless and vast unlike the confines of looking at your closed eyelids.

3. When you notice you stopped doing the breathing pattern and feel lost in thought, remember what your intent was in the first place and essentially daydream what you'd do once separating. (what was today's goal after separating?)

------

This works because of the understanding that astral projection is a simple matter of a perspective switch, holding your focus on the nonphysical reality more than the physical reality; this fact is what determines whether you can project at will. To understand this better, what happens when you daydream in class, enter a dream during sleep, astral project, remote view, or imagine/visualize something? No matter the time it took, there was a moment in which your conscious mind was zeroed in and was completely immersed by what the mind was thinking. This is what is meant when it's stated that reality = your perception. It's how lucid dreaming occurs: You go to sleep and the subconscious forms a scenario based on your desires, fears, and takes account of your waking awareness level. Then as the dream progresses you focus more on the details of that reality, fully immersing you which keeps you in the dream longer while allowing you to change what happens within it (because you are on a thought responsive base-wave frequency this being specifically the 4th of what are called dimensions). It's also how manifesting and law of attraction on this base-wave frequency (our denser, 3rd dimension) works on a practical level, the things you chose to focus on and "immerse yourself with" are the things that will manifest into your reality in waking life, good or bad. This has even more weight when understood from a person that knows about the vibrational/sound/electromagnetic/fixed geometric nature of the universe and everything within it allowing everyone to tap into it as we are connected to everything ("As Above, So Below.")

What this technique will do is put you in the hypnagogic state/void state/Monroe's focus 10/mind awake body asleep which are all the same thing. It's the state of awareness that allows you to separate the consciousness from the physical body allowing you to experience a boundless form of being, only limited by what the individual can think of (the human body is a dense vessel to hold the individual's consciousness yet is still always connected to the source of what created the electromagnetic structure of the entire universe). I speculate that the emphasis on intent allows separation because the emotional attachment to a certain goal you want to acheive is the determining factor in whether you manifest that desire into reality, and is fundamentally the decision-maker in whether you can do something in life and is what the word intent means. This technique that I created is something we all do in various situations, but I had an epiphany 2/25/18 at 7pm allowing me to articulate how to consciously take control of this energy/vibrational state/conscious awareness/akashic records directly for self and spiritual development, astral projection, or even just bringing more positivity into your life by attracting similar resonant frequencies so I highly recommend giving this a try if other ap attempts were unsuccessful.

The Drayton Manifest Technique (DMT Method):

1. Listen to white noise, your environment, or binurual beats in a comfortable position that you know won't cause you to fall asleep (if using any type of audio, have it loud enough to make it hard to fall asleep to, but quiet enough to not make you deaf lol)

2. Do 4-7-8 Breathing, holding the tongue on the roof of the mouth near the teeth while inhaling through the nose for 4 seconds, holding for 7 seconds, and finally exhaling through the mouth making a "whoosh" sound. Repeat this until you notice yourself naturally return back to normal breathing. This is a balancing act as this will make you fall asleep, so the key is to stay aware long enough to reach the required state to project, which you'll get better at as well as induce the state quicker as a result of doing this method so see any failed separations as XP for your stats like a game. This is how some projectors mess up their practice; they'll change their breathing pattern abruptly after becoming aware of breathing automatically which causes you to dip in and out of the mind awake body asleep state. (because you keep refocusing on the physical instead of the nonphysical, which anchors you from separating so to fix this simply keep doing the 4-7-8 breathing until you breathe normal naturally.)

3. When you notice you stopped the breathing patterns, explore what your intent was in the first place (what was today's goal after separating?). Really take in consideration how awesome it would be to do that thing that made you wanna project in the place at this particular moment, immerse yourself by playing out what you'd do when separating essentially. It can be literally anything, as long as it's something you ACTUALLY wanna do whether it's insightful, emotional, sexual, or just really fun.

Good luck astralnauts, lemme know if you have any questions about anything. Also I have a question myself: I was seriously considering making a YouTube channel so I could articulate this info in a more visual manner and teaching this type of stuff in a way that could be practically applied for the masses so that people can achieve a higher quality of life by raising their consciousness level, should I make one?
From my experience with energy manipulation I have come to a conclusion, I believe that the soul, controls the body through the nervous system, when I use my energy I can feel it in my nervous system, I can move the energy throughout my body, and it's proven that we have bioelectricity in our nervous system, it is what makes the brain work.

 It's how all of the receptors communicate, and when you die this energy goes away, our souls pilot our body through the brain, and nervous system, that also explains possessions, because it's another soul taking the pilot seat in the body, using it's energy to control the body through the brain, and nervous system, and pushing your soul into a dormant state, we are spiritual beings having a spiritual experience, and our bodies are simply vehicles for our souls, we are the soul, not the body.To all of you who have been trying for days, weeks, months or years with little to no progress. Please dont give up. You got this, & it will be so worth it once you get Out of Body!!! 😁As of today, I can constantly reach the vibration stage, the only problem is that I usually have hypnagogic hallucinations and drift into sleep. 

Now that you know the potential downside, let's get back to the method. It's VERY simple: just go to bed without having a bloated or full stomach (eat early). Then, before going to bed, just drink like half a bottle of water (~250ml) and go to bed normally. Don't try anything at all, just drift into good old boring sleep.

Then, (at least for me) you'll wake up a couple of hours later and will got to take a leak. I go back to bed and my head still fuzzy with sleep. Then, I lay on my back and start meditating. I focus on my body's feels and the slight vibrations rising. I usually reach vibration and the visualization stage after only a couple of minutes (if not seconds?)

But the problem is that I'm TOO fuzzy with sleep and after a handful of (really cool, though) hallucinations, I drift into sleep and wake up in the morning.

Edit: now that I think about it, I kinda feel that sometimes, when I'm getting deep into the visualization stage, I just kinda 'choke' and drift to sleep. It's a bit hard to explain, but it's as if as I am about to get down to some serious business, I just say 'sike' and drift to sleep. I know it must sound ridiculous but it's true! Maybe I'm scared to do actual AP. It's frustrating.TitleI’ve been wondering if anyone has tried to do this to see if they could actually find anything.Wanted to see if y'all would know what happened.

Story Time:

&#x200B;

I went to bed Friday at the same time I go to bed every day, around 10 PM EST. I had a dream, I think, that lasted a lifetime. I remember most of it in detail. I've projected before, and I've gotten pretty good at it. This, however, didn't feel like a projection. It felt a little too real. I woke up in another bed, a smaller one. around me was a room that i didn't recognize. I sat up and walked out of the room. The house I was in had a different setup than mine. I found the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I wasn't me, I was someone else. I had black hair apart from my normal dirty blonde, and I was a different age. I later found out that I was just out of High School. I went through the house looking for anyone that lived there. I found a woman sleeping on the couch. She awoke as I came down the stairs. She greeted me as her son, and called me Timothy. I tried to act as normal as possible, but I couldn't figure out where I was or how this was happening. She reminded me of a job interview I had. I went to the interview and eventually was notified that I got the job a few days later. I lived this life dreaming almost every night. my dreams were mostly normal. A few years later, I met a girl named Katie. We dated and later married. I didn't live in America, and I didn't recognize any countries, or continents even, from my normal life. I lived in East Rapeni, A large country with similarities to The United States. I had no children. I lived this life for 40 years. I was around 60 when I died in a mugging attempt. I woke up in my real bed, sweating. I remembered everything about that life when i awoke, however, most of the insignificant events have faded at this point. I have spent the last few days feeling like my life is a lie. Everything in that other life felt so real. The pain from when I broke my arm from falling, the warmth of my wife's hand, and emotions I felt. I want to know what happened to me. Life feels like a lie at this point. I need feedback on this please. I feel like this is a good place for it.At yesterday morning around 6 am I was reading a book & I thought of taking a break so I put the book down reclined a bit, put my hands together on my belly and I was about to feel asleep but I stayed concious let my body fell asleep and all of sudden I felt like I dropped my body & was sucked out of it. Then my whole body started to vibrate very intensely & also heard loud weird noises. But I was concious the whole time (so concious that I remembered everything, even the goal the I'm working on these days) but wasn't able to move my body. But I was able to see with my eyes closed. After so many attempts to wake up I finally waked up.

I wasn't trying to do OBE or Astral Projection & honestly I not into these stuffs yet until now.

Does anyone have any idea what the heck happened with me?&#x200B;

About three weeks ago I had a lucid dream, I was fully aware that I was in a dream state, however I had no interest in controlling my surroundings, I knew I was in someone else's dream. I was confronted with a huge crystal building, it was rather like a library but it had a lot of prestige attached to it. I entered the building and found myself in a room surrounded by books, pillows and chairs with people sitting around them. The leader of the group, a man with cropped brown hair was congratulating me on my position, and telling me that I was now part of 'The Dream Council' and that all of them had been waiting for me to become Lucid during these meetings. He said that I've always been present at these meetings, but I've never been able to remember them as I haven't been 'Lucid'.

The people in the meeting all looked intensely familiar, but I couldn't recall their names when I awoken. We all spoke about many things, and I shared my concerns in my day to do life and everyone sat and listened to me and offered me love and sympathy. One such girl was a girl with long blonde hair (I've been dreaming about her for years) who told me that she "really liked my vibes" and that she was watching over me. It was explained to me that a lot of these people where people from around the world who can enter the 'Dream Council' when they are sleeping, and that when I'm Lucid I can come back and speak to them more. A lot of them where ordinary people like myself, but some of them told me that they where protectors, kind of like angels. This dream was awe inspiring, and I want to enter the Council again.

Has anyone else had any experience with the Dream Council through Lucid dreaming?

Thank you so much!So I was wondering has anyone here conducted tests to prove astral projection is Real. For yourselves or under scientific observation. 

I have an idea for a simple test that would be good conclusive evidence that we are in some way interacting with an external astral world rather than an internal world (which is the belief many lucid dreamers believe is the case)

All you need is a glass table and a deck of cards.

So the idea is that you shuffle the deck of cards and pull one card out without looking at its face. 
Then place the card face down on the glass table.
*it may be advisable to do this in a separate room  and leave the light on so that you can see the card easily if projecting at night.  
Then Astral project, go under the table and read the card, once back in your body check to see if your observations were correct. 

Now if you can do this correctly and consistently you have proof of a paranormal ability. 

James Randi (famous magician and sceptic) once offered a million dollars for anyone that could prove a paranormal ability. The prize remained unclaimed for 10 years before the money was reinvested in more worthy causes.For those APers who are used to heliospheric travel, please help us document what is happening on one of Saturn's moons, Titan. Something is going down!

I am part of a small group in Portland that regularly group APs with intentional focus on specific destinations. We aren't always spot on, but we're fairly good at getting there as a group... well, ~~most~~ some of us anyway.

Titan is one of our favorite destinations as it's desolate, dimly lit, and you can hang out on lakes where no one else has been before. Until now?

There's a massive-build up occurring of either astral beings or extraterrestrial beings. These are not Greys (check my post history for my experience w/ them), but something else.

~~Please let me know by PM or here in this thread if you can help. We can provide some guidance on how to travel heliospherically.~~

~~Edit: for any experienced APer in the PNW, also get in touch if you are interested in joining our group.~~

**Edit**: Thank you for all the private messages... can't handle anymore at the moment.I saw a lot of people saying that after you die and you go to the moon, you get recycled back into a human baby. Whats your opinion on that?I had a thought: the similarities between the Neverland place in adventures of Peter Pan and AP are huge. Think about it:

\-Peter Pan comes during the night to teach the kids to fly i.e. astral project (in some versions he rips off their shadow i.e. their astral body).

\-They can use the pixie dust to fly but it only works if they believe in it. meaning if you want to consciously astral project you have to believe it will happen

\-neverland is a place of immortality and kids never grow old - the astral body doesn't age and is eternal

\-there are different creatures in neverland: mermaids, fairies, etc. just like there are different beings in the astral dimension

So,

Neverland - Astral realm

immortality - immortality

shadow - astral body

flying - AP

believing you can fly - believing you can project

mystical creatures - multidimensional beings

Peter Pan - ???

Captain Hook - ???

You get my point.

&#x200B;

edit: Forgot to add one more point, to Neverland usually go kids. I think this is connected to AP, because kids are more likely to be free-minded and their chakras are open so AP can come more natural to them, opposed to adults.This subreddit has become a place of skeptics and repeated questions. It's been like this for a while now. You no longer hear about Shamanic experiences or Astral Gatherings like those of u/Morgoth37 . Instead for those stories we go to YouTube (Astral Club) or very rarely hear about an experience here.  But lets face it, this subreddit was meant for noob friendly tutorials. So I started thinking, what would the solution to this be? I've seen many many others post about this issue with no solution.

Ladies and Gentleman the solution is here: r/AstralStories

Please check it out. This sub is dedicated to the Spiritual experiences that have took place in the Astral. Read the Manifesto for more information.Now I've been blind since birth and so things may be different based on how long others have been, but I'm curious how it is from a blind person's perspective verses someone who sees as I am new to this. I have looked into it a little before but not too deeply. Do you see during astral projection even if not in dreams?
Probably most importantly is how hard was it to learn? Seems a lot of things are about seeing color or focusing on visual things. Could be wrong though. Any ways around that?I hear people talk about possibly proving astral projection scientifically by placing objects in a room and having an astral body name them. This is all well and good, but what about the vibrations? As someone who has only got to the vibrations stage, this is more than enough proof to me. How else can my body violently shaking and vibrating be explained? This was no illusion or trick of the mind, I was fully conscious and vibrating like crazy. Sciences please explain this?Can any one of you guys (or girls) pull me and the newbies in ap out of the body?

I've been trying for almost 2 years now with little to no success, almost gave up many times.
I'd really appreciate it if you could like pull out my astral form.
(Is it even possible?)Gamma Waves 40hz are magic frequency for generation of thoughts. Thoughts, Thought Constructs, Thought Superposition Architechture can help you in astral travels, setting up binds and spells help also. Listen to 40hz frequencies from sites like: [https://isochronic.io/](https://isochronic.io/) [https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/) [http://onlinetonegenerator.com/](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/) and focus on imbueing the sound with thoughts tied to it. The more you macro/bind/spell for Astral the better and more organized you and the astral beings that help you can be.I was dreaming and I was in a classroom, it looked identical to my math class except the tables were slightly rearranged. I look over to someone I'm sitting next to and ask them "Do you think any of this is real?". They said "Uhhh yeah?" I said "you know what? This is all fake" like an earthquake everything started shaking. 

My vision began fading and I was vibrating and of course I never left my body because I never can but the way I came about the vibrational stage is so different and I'm glad to be finding more and more ways to get there.This only happens to me maybe 4 or 5 times a year. Usually if I am woken in the night or just beginning to wake up, and my mind is still not very awake, I am still somewhat in dream land.

I look around the room around me with eyes closed and I don't even realize they are closed, I feel like my eyes are open because I can see the room around me. I don't realize I am doing this until after, so I don't question what I see, but I also don't focus on any of the items around me. The vision feels different, it's like I can see everything at once and don't focus on the center, the light/colour levels are different, almost a greenish colour to everything and no sharp contrast in items.

Does anyone else experience anything like this?Hey guys! I noticed there was a lot of people in this sub struggle to experience AP, LD, OBE’s, sleep paralysis, etc, so I figured I would try to really break it down for you guys. This is coming from someone who can AP multiple times a day if desired. I have Narcolepsy so I live every day fighting against REM stages that happen any time of day/night. Every tiny detail of these events could occur *every single day*. 

*You NEED to be in REM to accomplish any of these*

It’s best to temporarily forget any past steps that haven’t worked for you during this process. 


*************************

Gonna make this as concise as possible. Note that it make take more time to reach each step. 


Astral Projecting during Meditation 


1. Get in whatever position you meditate in. Get cozy. Make sure your spine in straight and your neck is aligned. *A couple small things to do once you’re completely relaxed and in meditation is to flex the muscles that are right behind your ears if you can (maybe work on this one during the day and try it later so you don’t mess up your focus), and importantly... RELAX YOUR BOTTOM JAW, let it drop completely. I tend to rest my tongue on the roof of my mouth, this is a KEY factor that occurs in REM— which is what you are striving for.*



2. If your body wants to sway or if your hands or eyes twitch, allow it. Don’t try to suppress any of this. Your nervous system needs to be firing, so it’s not a bad thing. 



3. Relax, and just honestly try not to overthink any step. Get comfortable in this position then let go! Feel any vibration and waves that come across. Again, overthinking will cause you to lose the “natural focus.” FEEL INSTEAD OF THINK!!!!!!



4. Once those vibrations hit you should be home free. You’ll find yourself traveling throughout the cosmos in no time. 



5. Don’t try to go to a specific place your first time— I would recommend going into it free of any intention. Your brain needs to get used to being in REM, don’t try to overdo this because it simply will not work. This is also vital. 



You may not AP your first few times. Just try to get as relaxed as you can as MUCH as you can. 



**********************

I will add more detailed instructions on LD, OBE and sleep paralysis later if anyone is interested. Honestly, it’s all about being in REM. Allow your body get used to it and you will surely progress in which direction you wish to go. 

I’m not sure if this is allowed (Mods take down if so) but I have two other posts that are extremely helpful with this— “Instant tap into third eye” and “food for thought.” 

And always. Keep those vibrations UP! Feel! Rock and roll, baby.  

So I astral projected and randomly ended up into space, I saw some energy thing that looked like the old Mac OS X Leopard wallpaper, I was talking to this neon purple ish energy in space, it told me I could not go further, it said I had to go back to earth.

Anyone know what this was about ? |The inside of the spiral space energy thing had a white light.I learned how to astral project quite by accident, and have had a few profound experiences, but this one has really stuck with me.  Succesfully getting past the vibrational stage, I often find myself sitting up in my bed, but I find myself in my old childhood bedroom as opposed to my current house; And from this bizzare circumstance, I know that I have shifted to the astral.

On this occasion, once I made sure I was 'dreaming', I went outside the house, ignoring my mother and sister.  I was suspicious that they were just projections, and didn't want to get distracted;  I wanted to go outside and fly around my old familiar neighborhood where I grew up (I'm 42 now).

I went outside to see my old street just the way it was, but there were some people walking down the road in the same direction.  It seemed like they were headed to a party.  They were really friendly.   I stopped this guy and asked them where they were going and he pointed down the road.

So I turned my head in the direction that he was indicating, and......  the landscape completely transformed right in front of my eyes...  As I turned my head, the suburban road turned into a Great Hall.  The ceiling was about 4 stories high.  Lots of greek architecture, crown molding, everything in a rich purple.

The hall ended abruptly with a big screen, which was showing what looked like a science fiction movie, there were spaceships in a dogfight, it looked like something from Star Wars.  Some people were watching the 'movie', but most people were just sitting in cushions on the floor, and chatting with each other.  There were servants who brought drinks and food to the people at the gathering.

I became curious as to where all of this was coming from (being lucid / conscious at the time).  There were doors on each side of the hall, where the servers came in and out from, but also a big doorman, or bodyguard.  I asked one of them what was behind the door.  He said nothing.  I had a distinct feeling that I was not allowed to go back there, as if......   someone where to peek behind the curtain at a play.  hmmm....

So instead of prying further, I went and sat down with some people at the party.  I ate some nuts but they tasted very bitter.  I struck up a conversation with this guys who was sitting next to me.  He said "You are a turtle, you always carry your home on your back"

It's true, too....  The statement summed up my style quite well.

Anyway, I started to "phase out" of the 'dream' when I was talking to this dude... tried to hold onto the place.... but soon found myself waking up (for real this time)  in my real, actual bed. Haha.  The whole experience was more real than my waking life.

What do you guys think?Although I’ve had many experiences since my third eye has opened up, including being in the vibrational stage every night, this last week has been the truly most shocking to me. 

I looked in the mirror one morning, and saw myself in “cloudy” form...I looked like a choppy computer program...not to mention there was green energy swirling around me and my pupils were moving around like crazy. The next morning there were lights shining from my fingertips! I’ve noticed that every day it looks a bit different, I’m assuming it varies upon what the energy level of my consciousness or body is during that time. I’m very aware that this is a hypnagogic hallucination, and that others cannot see it.

Nonetheless, It is absolutely fascinating to look at my arms as I’m laying in bed, and see purple energy swirling in them...with white energy waves around them. Not to mention, if I focus on my reflection enough any other time of the day, I can kind of see it too

Does anybody have an explanation for this phenomenon? And any advice? Today I wondered if it will be like this for the rest of my life...and how much it’s really changed my life. 

Thank you in advance.

Edit: For everyone who is wondering how I opened up my third eye, here’s my best explanation. After I started seeing shapes upon sleeping two years ago, I began to do some research. I had no idea what a 3rd eye was and went crazy for awhile to not have any explanation for seeing these shapes. Then I came across an article about this guy who could see shapes and also vortexes. He recommended massaging your third eye in 30 circle rotations, and imagining purple energy flowing into it while breathing in. I tried that once, and the experiences have been growing little by little since then. Each new experience equally as shocking as the last. Although, seeing myself in energy form has been the absolute most overwhelming and surprising. My mind has been racing for explanations.What is there to stop someone doing something wrong in the astral? What happens if someone uses it to rig the lottery or cheat on a test or sneak into someone's room at night?

I'm super uniformed about this, I've only been following this element of spirituality for a while, but I can't really find anything that tells me that immoral things can't be done?Ok, so here is my problem, I've been doing research on AP for a while now, I tried (think I was close but got scared) anyway after reading all these posts here I don't ever wanna try again. There are some pretty scary stories, dont' know if they are real or anything but now I'm definitely too scared to try. My whole life I thought that is amazing and wonderful experience and nothing really bad can happen. Like what if I try and some bad shit happens or I get stuck or who knows what. And if those stories are real can you protect yourself somehow?I never post on reddit, just a browser. 
last weekend I lost my sister to a heroin overdose, sadly. last night I fell asleep and I “woke up” in the room I was sleeping in and there was a guy who appeared to be about in his twenties who had a green orb of light which he threw and it came back to him, and as it came back I looked and my sister was next to him on the couch. (My sister was born in May, her birth stone is emerald and her favorite color was green) I looked and my sister looked at me, looked away, and seemed to vanish. 
then there was a young girl with very light whitish hair motioning at me to start pulling up, like climbing up a rope, so I did and I started flying (or projecting out of my body) 
we then appeared at a waterpark and I felt the water on my skin... then we flew out of there and I was flying in the air looking down at all of the houses and my goal was to get as high in the sky as I could to find my sister. but as soon as I got higher, I jolted and woke up. 
can someone tell me if my sister is trying to send a message? and were the girl and the boy my spirit guides? 
this was completely unintentional but it was astonishing to me. 
I wasn’t trying to project, I do have a vague knowledge on projection but I never do it. Did I do it?I’ve often wondered about this, I understand that anything is possible within the astral realm but there seems to be some hyperbole going in with some YouTube videos of people sharing their experiences.Serious question lol

This happened yesterday. I was asleep and i felt sleep paralysis settling in, but i kept calm. Suddenly it felt like i saw some shadowy figure was at my bedside, playing with my asshole - lets just say it feels like when your partner sticks a finger in there during experiments? Anyway my partner isn’t here so that rules her out, just me and some figures. I was practically laughing and wriggling my way out of this paralysis and finally i ‘woke’ up from the paralysis, moved my legs about and went back to sleep. 

Its at this time my body starts to vibrate and i just doze back off. Now im not sure if i was lucid dreaming or projecting, but in there i met these figures again and they were teaching me how to stay calm and shape the world where i was in (the dream? The plane?), think about what i wanna do. I started flying about in there and actually feeling the G force effect (if thats correct? Like when you’re on a roller coaster and you get that sinking feeling in your tummy when it goes down). But this was only for a short while as the world pretty much change back where i had to walk about. I remember walking up a flight of stairs after that, lol. Pretty wild night I’d say. Cant really remember anything else however! All i remember was the color palette of this realm, pretty much shades of black (black, dark grey, light grey) and dark green. Weird!Yesterday was my cake day, and this is the only Reddit community I truly care about. So, I felt like it was necessary to share it with y'all. 
Much love.I’ve astral projected many times and one thing I noticed is that I have to be very cold. I intentionally aim my fans and air on my body while I fall asleep and I found it to be a necessity for me to astral project. Also, it’s easier to project after you have woken up for a second and go back to sleep. Try waking up in the middle of the night and doing a minor chore like brushing your teeth. When you fall asleep you’ll be a lot more conscious whether you astral project or dream. 😅woke up yesterday super tired and groggy and probably shouldn't have immediately gone on my phone while still laying cozy in my bed, but that's What I was doing.  was watching vsauce and i started to get to the point of sleepiness where you go to scratch your arm or something but then it turns out you didnt actually scratch your arm (I don't know What it's called but everyone has had this experience) and eventually scratching my arm turned into me rolling out of bed and walking around my room.  because of this though, for a few minutes it was a constant cycle of me walking around my room for 5 or 6 seconds, gaining consciousness and realizing that im actually in bed, being sucked back into bed, then me losing consciousness and rolling back out of bed again.  after a certain amount of time I gained consciousness and thought "wait, is this AP?" and I was sucked back into my body.  

After I had this thought, the same thing happened where I exited my body, only I was completely conscious of this process and it was very intense and scary.  It felt like I was pulled towards the ceiling against my will like a marionette by a force greater than myself, and it felt just like a few times where I had previously gotten close to having a successful AP.  I was able to remain calm however, and after a few more times of being sucked back into my body and then exiting, the process was no longer as frightening.  After the second or third time of this, I reached a point where I rolled out of my body and was able to stay out for a good amount of time.

The first thing I noticed was that my bedroom in this state looked slightly different than it does in reality.  There was a random stack of boxes on my wall where a tapestry is supposed to be, my dads cat was vibin in my rocking chair, and when I ventured outside of my room there was a christmas tree up in the basement living area.

The second thing I noticed was how incredibly real everything looked and felt.  You guys are very much right, it is a similar but still significantly different experience than a lucid dream.  In a regular lucid dream, I can get the world to look super detailed and pretty if I demand it from the dream, but I'm never able to get it to feel like reality.  There will always be some kind of dreamy element overlaying everything.  This experience was totally different.  Everything was super life like and I could even read things too (with some difficulty) which you can not do in a regular lucid dream.

Once I was able to keep things stabilized I tried to spawn a person just so i could be like yo whats up boy and make a friend to hang out with me, but for some reason it pulled up twitter on my wall like a projection screen instead (???) and started showing me a bunch of random ass tweets flashing by really fast.  I wasn't able to spawn a person that I could talk to, but after a few minutes of just witnessing this and trying to read the tweets it came to me that I had my dads cat who was in my room for whatever reason to keep me company.

I decided to attempt to venture beyond my bedroom, but I was only able to get a few rooms down from mine.  Throughout this experience, there was a TV static-ish feeling throughout my whole body.  The further away I got from my bed, the more intense and overpowering this feeling became.  I got about a dozen yards or so from my room near the stairs to the ground floor of my house before the feeling became too much for me to handle.

All in all the experience only lasted about 20 minutes, but it felt like an hour and a half.  I woke up grinning ear to ear feeling so happy and much more energized and refreshed than I was earlier that morning.  Let me know your guys thoughts!  this was a truly mind expanding experience.If there is nothing, thats ok, if there is literally anything other than the casual dirt/lava/ores, it would be nice to know.

So, dandelions. First, in terms of the Great Depression, they're one of the generally disregarded products of the Columbian Exchange - there are some varieties of dandelion or closely related plants native to North America, but the ones you'd generally recognise are Old World imports. It's not clear whether they were intentionally imported or not, but given their seeding habits, the chances are good that they were accidental. They grow *anywhere*, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.

They're regarded as a food or medicinal plant through recorded history, though never as a particularly desirable one. Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, known in the west as Rhazes, wrote about them around 900CE, but only as a medicinal plant, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) reputedly devoted an entire chapter to them in one work a century later. As far as I can tell, though, they're not included by Al-Warraq in his cookery book in Baghdad, roughly contemporaneous with Ibn Sina (at least, I can't find any reference to them under the names I know, and the translator of the edition I have, Nawal Nasrallah, hasn't included them in the index of ingredients). They were almost certainly included in the range of green plants used by European medieval peasants in pottages, although, again, they're not actually included in any of the lists provided by Peter Brears in *Cooking and Dining in Medieval England*.

The Victorians seem to have made more use of the dandelion. E. Lewis Sturtevant, writing in 1886, notes it grown for the Boston market in 1836, and he says the seed is for sale in "various seed catalogues of 1885" in no less than 6 varieties. The first mention of dandelion as a vegetable he could find in England was 1846 in the Gardeners' Chronicle, where it's described as "a beautiful and delicate blanched salad". He also says "[t]he influence of rich soil and protected growth upon the dandelion is to give increased size and succulence to the plant, and to thicken the branching of the leaves", which is in line with most cultivated versions of wild plants. There was considerable interest in the Victorian era in new and exotic vegetables, much as there is now, and if they could be got by cultivating wild plants, so much the better.

However, dandelions, once grown, can be very hard to remove from a given location. The taproot - which is edible too - can go down a metre without much difficulty, and unless it's pulled out entirely, the plant will regrow from it. This is a feature if you're harvesting it, since it'll reappear within weeks, but if you're trying to clear it from a bed to make way for something else, it's a pain. This is probably one of the two reasons that it's not really grown for food anymore - the other being that it's not terribly good. Arugula, or rocket, is generally better tasting than the leaf. The flowers *can* be made into a hedgerow wine, but you generally need to add other things (lemons, for example) to get anything that tastes palatable. The root can be dried, roasted, and ground to make a drink that is claimed to be like coffee, presumably by people who have never had coffee - but actual coffee, or even chicory, is better. And so forth. By 1911, the Britannica says, somewhat delicately, "[f]or the purposes formerly recognized taraxacum is now never used". In addition, the difference between the cultivated and the wild dandelion isn't really enough to merit growing it deliberately.

They're not the only vegetable to disappear from modern use through inconvenience - there's one called skirrets, which resembles carrots and parsnips, but has a bunch of longer, thinner roots, which are obviously more difficult to peel and cook than their fatter cousins, so they've been left behind. Likewise, alexanders, a leafy green, is more bitter and requires more cooking than celery, its closest modern equivalent, so it's been abandoned as well. I haven't eaten skirrits (yet), but I can assure you that alexanders taste like freshly cut hedgerow smells.

They're not _completely_ absent from modern cuisine, although they always seem to come with caveats. Harold McGee notes that it's 'occasionally grown on a small scale'. They're used in a traditional English soft drink called Dandelion & Burdock, which is still made (a brand called Fentimans is the one I know). There is a claim in various articles that a local variety called 'koproradiko' or 'mari' is eaten in Crete as a salad ingredient, or boiled, but it occurs in so many places with exactly the same phrasing that I suspect it's copied from a single source, and I can't find anything to back it up. They're eaten in Greece in general, though, as one of many plants under the label 'horta', and are known there as 'radikia'. 'Horta vrasta', which seems to be literally 'boiled greens' is possibly the most authentically historical way to eat them. Blanched leaves (grown under cover) are sometimes seen in salads in vegetarian restaurants here in Ireland, too, and they're occasionally used in French cuisine.

Follow up question: I've heard that dandelions were originally introduced to North America by European colonists who intended to use them as food, and they were often used in Europe. Is this true?

Beyond the aesthetic issues, dandelions cause a number of actual financial problems for cultivation. They basically can grow abundantly in any type of field. They reduce crop yields, slow down the drying of hay and similar crops (due to high water content), act as host to a number of crop devastating pests such as the [boll weevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boll_weevil), bacteria, and viruses. Over use of it medically can shut down the liver. The pollen is an allergen that can contaminate honey. Along with affecting the honey, dandelions attract bees away from fruiting plants in orchards that need their services (however while perception of this impact is high, the effect is minimal). For lawns and grass courses, they have a higher water requirement than the grasses but can out compete, survive, and even kill nearby grasses. 

There are some positive things about the plant, such as medicinal value, soil enrichment, and animal feed; however there are better alternatives that have less negatives.

Now regarding the actual history in change of perception, I can only speculate and I won't.

**Were the most common hours in 1980 really from 9 am to 5 pm?**

9-to-5 was a catchphrase by that time. It had been a catchphrase for a very long time. It did not even represent an "average" job when the phrase was first coined.

Furthermore, the 9-to-5 phrase was introduced back when a six day workweek was common. So it wasn't even representing a 40-hour workweek, but a 48-hour one.

...

Let's start by jumping back a bit to the 1890s.

The average work-day for men was 10.2 hours a day and women 9.2 hours a day, out of a six-day workweek.

For men, the bottom decile worked an average of 10 hours a day while only the top decile made it to 8 hours a day. The top decile men got to start at 8 rather than 7 am, and took lunch for an hour rather than a half hour. Even the 70th-80th decile had an average of 10 hours a day.

In 1892, Massachusetts passed a law *limiting* the hours-per-week for women to 58 hours. So while the concept of an 8-hour workday was already around (most famously in 1886 where hundreds of thousands of workers went on strike to demand an 8-hour workday, and many got it) it was often not a thing in practice.

...

The earliest reference I've found regarding 9-to-5 used as the phrase is from 1918:

[1918](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trans_communicator/swI1AQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=9+to+5+job&pg=PA910&printsec=frontcover)

>Coe, when he returns from his vacation, will find he has graduated from the night force to a 9 to 5 job with the day regulars.

Let's follow up a bit through the years:

[1926, interviews with women who write](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Earning_a_Living_by_the_Pen/hK0OAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>You can't make a 9 to 5 job out of it and really get anywhere. And it's not a snap job. But the work is absolutely fascinating...

(For reference, the above quote is roughly when work started to change from six to five days a week, but it wasn't instant or universal.)

[1931](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Advertising_and_Selling/UzPmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>You will be helping to lick "the winter of our discontent" -- and maybe fitting your wife for a 9-to-5 job should she ever need it.

[1948](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Phi_Delta_Delta/_iYOAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>It is far from a 9-to-5 job, but it is a real challenge, and as law students are truly wonderful people...

[1949](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Program/V1AFAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>For five years he got up early enough to practice a couple of hours before the 9 to 5 job, practiced in the evenings, studied until 2 or 3 in the morning.

[1953](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Overseas_Information_Programs_of_the_Uni/ftxJAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>We know that we have a great responsibility when speaking to people who risk freedom and even life when they listen to us. We know ours can never be a 9-to-5 job from which one goes home and forgets.

[1956](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sunset/b7f67REBtx4C?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>His is no 9-to-5 job. Too much is at stake; the lifetime dreams of those he serves.

[1957](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hospital/z3QXAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

>Nursing does not appear to be all that was promised in the classroom. They feel inefficient, and long for a nice tidy '9 to 5 job' in an office or elsewhere.

Observations:

- There was a vague sense of 9-to-5 as a "women's work" stable job -- finding your wife a 9-to-5 -- but it wasn't universal; the phrase was more nebulous and could include both men and women.

- 9 to 5 was "low responsibility, low stakes"; you could "go home and forget".

- 9 to 5 was "nice and tidy".

My general point is that the exact hours of 9-to-5 were picked up as a catchphase *very early*.

The first quote is notable because it involves railroad workers. Railroads are where much of the early 8-hour day push happened. The Adamson Act of 1916 -- only two years earlier -- established an 8-hour workday for a certain subset of railway workers, and other workers soon demanded the same. Here's another quote from the same section:

>Bros. Martin, Lee, Umbaugh, Howard, and Lynch are still on the 12-hour grind. However, relief has been promised ... When these brothers first made heir request for an 8-hour day, before joining the O.R.T., it was almost ignored. Since their committee strolled down to see the boss man a new man is now posting on the job, with the promise to line up more extra men as soon as they can be secured, thus giving the boys their "eight-hour day".

(Also, notably, early railroads are the *only* instance I have been able to find where 9 am to 5 pm are regularly the actual exact hours; it is possible they were even the origin of the phrase, but there isn't enough evidence to tell.)

9-to-5 certainly did not describe a typical job. It described, in some sense, an *ideal* job.

I can find no point in the history of work where it was "the most common". For example, in 1937, in the District of Columbia, 2,892 women who worked in department stores were surveyed about their working hours. Only 7 worked 40 hours exactly and only 15 worked 48 hours exactly. Overwhelmingly, the most common number of hours was exactly 45 (9 hours a day for 5 days a week).

I unfortunately haven't been able to find any survey of an exact start time for 1980, a survey from 1991 gave 8 to 5 as the most common hours, and the general data on hours indicate very little change between the two. So, in summary: there is no missing hour: as a catchphrase that dated back more than hundred years; even though such hours have existed in the past and even still exist today, the phrase "9-to-5 job" hasn't meant the actual hours of 9 am to 5 pm for a very long time.

While there’s a place for an answer related to the history of the 40-hour-work week, unions, and fair labor practices, it misses the point of Parton's song to take the title literally. That is, instead of “9 to 5” being a literal marker of the limits of a work day, the song, the movie, and the organization of the same name used it to a way to evoke a particular kind of employment, and the related benefits and perks, that had historically been denied American women. The history behind your question isn't about the work day: it's about second-wave feminism and signaling.

Though the boundaries and even the moniker are debated among women’s history scholars, “first-wave feminism” is typically seen as the efforts of women in the late-1800s and first half of the 1900s to get the right to vote and create social safety nets for women and children. These early feminists (though, again, many didn’t see themselves as such) organized alongside male-led unions to establish safe work practices, including changing and eliminating laws established during the depression that allowed school districts to fire women who got married. “Second wave feminism”, then, was about building on the work of earlier advances towards equity. Whereas the first wave was about big moves, the feminists of the 1960s and 70s tried built on those big wins to build the future they wanted for themselves and their daughters. A popular framing device related to second wave feminism was the phrase “the personal is political” (Milkman & Walkowitz, 1985) and we see that in how second-wave feminists organized, campaigned, and communicated their messages. 

Ms. magazine provides one example of what that looks like in practice. The name speaks to the “personal” (a gender modifier before a woman’s name) and the contents were clearly political (the first issue listed the names of women who were not embarrassed they'd gotten abortions.) The name of the magazine served as a signal to its readers: there is more to being a woman than being a Miss (unmarried) or a Mrs (married.) *Identity politics*, a term coined by the Black women of the Combahee River Collective in the 1970s, was another way to signal a particular political message related to Black women’s activism. In a [recent interview](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/until-black-women-are-free-none-of-us-will-be-free), Barbara Smith, one of the founders of the collective explained:
>  “By ‘identity politics,’ we meant simply this: we have a right as Black women in the nineteen-seventies to formulate our own political agendas.” She went on, “We don’t have to leave out the fact that we are women, we do not have to leave out the fact that we are Black. We don’t have to do white feminism, we don’t have to do patriarchal Black nationalism—we don’t have to do those things. We can obviously create a politics that is absolutely aligned with our own experiences as Black women—in other words, with our identities. That’s what we meant by ‘identity politics,’ that we have a right. And, trust me, very few people agreed that we did have that right in the nineteen-seventies. So we asserted it anyway.”

Which leads us back to the phrase “9 to 5.” Regardless of what wave of feminism we’re talking about, advocates for women’s rights have had to reconcile the tension that in virtually all instances, men held the levers of power. In other words, a great deal of the work of feminists was about persuading men, mostly white, to change their minds. (Edit to add: this helps us understand why the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM were the norm for a particular kind of job, a job mostly held by middle to upper middle class men. Those are the hours that the men in power, which includes those who lead unions, wanted to work. Likewise, if your thinking is that 9 to 5 were the hours of the "typical" job, you're defining "typical" by the jobs held by a small segment of the American population.) This tension was what inspired Karen Nussbaum and Ellen Cassedy, two Boston-area office workers to create “9to5” (no spaces) in 1973, an organization committed to supporting women to speak up for what’s was rightfully theirs.

So, what did “9 to 5” signal? First, it was meant to signal a workplace free from harassment and subject to fair work rules, not the whims of a boss. One of the first protests that the organization 9to5 led involved an incident where a secretary was fired because she brought her boss a sandwich with rye bread, not white like he wanted. The women stood outside some of the largest office buildings in Boston (and later NYC and Chicago) and polled elderly office workers to collect names and data related to age discrimination and sexual harassment in the office. Second, it signaled a workplace that worked for all, not just men. In the 1980s, 9to5 partnered with medical centers to support studies of pregnancy hazards in the workplace and how the presence of computers (the machines, not [the women](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9dnvra/im_a_female_computer_someone_who_performs/e5kbmsw/)) in the workplace impacted the secretarial workforce. They pushed for flex schedules, a practice that is mentioned in the movie. 

Many of these details come from articles in Boston papers that covered the work of the 9to5 organization and in one editorial in 1985 refuting claims that the organization was shutting down, Nussbaum and Cassedy wrote: “Employers and office workers alike should be assured that 9to5 is still going strong. **The battle will not be over until fair pay and decent working conditions for office workers are the rule, not the exception.”**

Third, "9 to 5" signaled respect. In theory, it meant clocking in at a set time (meaning your morning was your own), and being able to leave when your day was over, not when your boss was done with you. However, in practice, "9 to 5" was a grind. Just working the set hours didn't guarantee a safe workplace. *[American Songwriter](https://americansongwriter.com/9-to-5-by-dolly-parton-behind-the-song/)* did a nice deep dive on the history of the song and spoke to one of the founders of 9to5 who describes that gap between the promise of a 9 to 5 job and the reality inside a capitalistic society: 
> "I think the song is brilliant. It starts with pride: ‘Pour myself a cup of ambition.’ It goes to grievances: ‘Barely getting by.’ It then goes to class conflict: ‘You’re just a step on the bossman’s ladder.’ And then it ends with collective power: ‘In the same boat with a lot of your friends.’ So in the space of this wildly popular song with a great beat, Dolly Parton just puts it all together by herself.”

It's difficult to tell if there was some retconning, but beginning shortly after the song and movie were released, Parton herself said she was inspired by the organization 9to5 when writing. Which is to say, the song isn't about the specific hours people worked - it's a way to signal the listener to a particular type of job - and the struggles of those workplaces - as she explains in the chorus:

* Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
* Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
* They just use your mind and you never get the credit
* It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
* 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
* There's a better life and you think about it don't you
* It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
* And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
* 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
* Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
* They just use your mind and they never give you credit
* It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

I wouldn't be surprised if there are more swimming events that Phelps competes in than ancient events as a whole. There were three fighting events: boxing, wrestling, and pankration (a combination of the two, maybe a bit like MMA). Two riding events: chariot and horeseracing. Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.

The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.

If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).

EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games.
[deleted]
Side question: Do many of the exact records in the ancient olympics still exist? For example: Leonidas ran X event in Y amount of time? And if so, how accurate would these records be?

Additional question: how 'common' was this practice? I have a hard time imagining the logistics of it. Was it really widespread or a PR thing?

(1/2) If you're interested in learning more about the BPP, I would recommend reading From The Bullet to the Ballot by Dr. Jakobi Williams. He is a civil rights activist and one of the leading BPP historians. Most of my information in this comment is sourced from primary/secondary sources that we utilized during a class I took with him about the history and development of the Black Panther Party. Bullet to the Ballot is an in depth look at the Chicago chapter specifically. My favorite overview is Black  Against Empire by Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin - comprehensive but accessible enough that I recommend it to my high school students. Kathleen Cleaver has also written a fantastic history of the BPP, titled Liberation, Imagination, and the Black Panther Party. Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, and Huey P. Newton have all written extensively. Their initial political writings laid the foundation for the BPP, and they have also all written autobiographies. The autobiographies should probably be taken with a grain of salt, particularly anything written by Newton as he was kind of a piece of shit, but the original writings are all really important for understanding the core of the BPP. The FBI has a "vault" of publicly accessible information regarding the BPP and COINTELPRO if anybody wants to view those, but the book The COINTELPRO Papers by Ward Churchill is much more informative. There are also quite a few breakdowns on the role of gender within the BPP. My favorite is Linda Lumsdens Good Mothers With Guns, but a lot of people really enjoy reading things from/about Afeni Shakur, as her son Tupac is...uh....fairly well known. 

The issue with our modern perception of the BPP is twofold. One, history is told by the victors, and the BPP did not win. Two, the actions of Huey Newton after the FBI systematically dismantled the BPP from within were uh...not great. As the BPP faded away, the last actions that were widely associated with the BPP was Huey Newton being shitty. That doesn't lend itself to a positive representation. This extra sucks because Huey Newtons initial role as a founding member, and then as a martyr, was key in uniting the community. He was an initial force behind community mobilization and dissemination of information, who was then accused/convicted of a murder that most believe he did not do. His consequential imprisonment led to Free Huey campaigns and protests that spread the ideals of the BPP further than they had before. This also meant that for the most important years of the party's activity, he was an imprisoned figurehead, a martyr, and more of a rallying cry than an actual leader. His return to the BPP and actions from about 1971 - onwards did a lot of harm to the party.

In order to see the positive impacts of the Panthers, you need to look not at their downfall but at their origins. The Panthers originated from a desire within black communities to take care of their own, in the ways that the federal government refused to do. Once the party was established, different chapters were loosely linked by a name and some shared beliefs, but they didn't have a significant overarching structure. There were a few leaders and thinkers (Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton primarily) that are commonly referenced as the leaders of the BPP, but it wasn't as strict of a hierarchy as most modern interpretations would have you believe. Chapters behaved relatively independently, as the main focus was on the communities within which members lived. Independence was also encouraged under the belief that it was safer for members. Actions and beliefs could vary widely from chapter to chapter, with the 10 Point Program and Platform as the foundation. It follows:

**What We Want Now!**

1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Black Community.
2. We want full employment for our people.
3. We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists of our black and oppressed communities.
4. We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.
5. We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.
6. We want all Black men to be exempt from military service.
7. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER of Black people.
8. We want freedom for all Black men held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails.
9. We want all Black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by the Constitution of the United States.
10. We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.

**What We Believe:**

1. We believe that Black People will not be free until we are able to determine our own destiny.
2. We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if the White American business men will not give full employment, the means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in the community so that the people of the community can organize and employ all of its people and give a high standard of living.
3. We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules was promised 100 years ago as redistribution for slave labor and mass murder of Black people. We will accept the payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities: the Germans are now aiding the Jews in Israel for genocide of the Jewish people. The Germans murdered 6,000,000 Jews. The American racist has taken part in the slaughter of over 50,000,000 Black people; therefore, we feel that this is a modest demand that we make.
4. We believe that if the White landlords will not give decent housing to our Black community, then the housing and the land should be made into cooperatives so that our community, with government aid, can build and make a decent housing for its people.
5. We believe in an educational system that will give our people a knowledge of self. If a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position in society and the world, then he has little chance to relate to anything else.
6. We believe that Black people should not be forced to fight in the military service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like Black people, are being victimized by the White racist government of America. We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.
7. We believe we can end police brutality in our Black community by organizing Black self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our Black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States gives us the right to bear arms. We therefore believe that all Black people should arm themselves for self-defense.
8. We believe that all Black people should be released from the many jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.
9. We believe that the courts should follow the United States Constitution so that Black people will receive fair trials. The 14th Amendment of the U.S Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peers. A peer is a persons from a similar economic, social, religious, geographical, environmental, historical, and racial background. To do this the court will be forced to select a jury from the Black community from which the Black defendant came. We have been, and are being tried by all-white juries that have no understanding of "the average reasoning man" of the Black community.
10. When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, and that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such a form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accused. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, and their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards of their future security

Really, your question answers another commonly asked question: why didn't the Fellowship fly to Mordor with the Eagles? Simple. They were writing and recording one of the greatest songs of all time. 

Gandalf was their manager at the time, and after meeting with the Eagles after Orthanc, he gave them the idea for the song. Hotel California is actually about Saruman imprisoning Gandalf. ("You can check out anytime...but you can never leave")

Rescuing Frodo and Sam was only a PR stunt orchestrated by Gandalf before the release of their album to gain publicity. In fact, some experts believe Hotel California would not have been as popular if the Eagles had not saved the ring bearer.

Off topic: This is now the top post of all time, right above "Thank you for this sub maintaining a high level of quality and professionalism". 

The irony could be palpable, but I'd like to think this is also indicative of a high level of quality and professionalism. Thank you, mods, for a wonderful April Fools.
Don'Henley, Son of CJ, Thane of Texas:  What a lot of people don't know is that we actually met on that mission. Before then, Glen and Randy and I would play with a few bards in Bree in pickup groups, and Joe Walsh was planning on doing a tour by himself in Harad, some USO thing for dismembered Orcs. Then this homeless guy who used to hang out by Linda Rondstadt's dressing room shows up and tells us that he'd pay us to go pick up two of his doofus friends who got stranded on top of a volcano. I didn't want to do it, but Glen said he could vouch for him... said his old college buddy Tom used to drop acid with him all the time and he was a pretty good guy. So, we did the gig and turned the two kids over to John and Robert and Jimmy and John, some weird folksingers over in Carouselambra or thereabouts, and, well, we got to talking, and one thing led to another. And so it goes.

EDIT:  Some NZ film geek recommended I add a bunch of CGI to my post but I took it out. What a Feeble.
I DON'T GET IT. -looks at Calendar- STILL DON'T GET IT.
Actually, the events are not entirely unconnected. The tale tells that the band wrote the initial draft in the air, after having inhaled copious mind-altering volcanic fumes. Whether or not this is true, or merely a pleasing yet apocryphal urban legend, is a subject much debated by musical scholars. I believe Marty DiBergi was considering doing a documentary (or 'rockumentary', if you will) about it at one point.
I'm going to propose an alternate theory: the Eagles merely transcribed the existing Hotel California Song from their memories of the Song of Iluvatar, specifically the Second Theme.

As is told in the Ainulindalë, the Song that the Ainur created held all that was, is, and will be in Arda. In addition, as Rúmil of Tirion has noted, the Ainur went into Arda as the Valar and Maiar. Manwë was the greatest of the Valar, and to him were the Eagles dear. It is no great leap to assume that the Eagles heard much of the Song during their time with Manwë.

Gwaihir was the vassal of Thorondor, eldest of Eagles, and with his brother Landroval, an important figure in the history of the First Age. That he heard snippets of the Song from Manwë is surely incontestable, even in this darkened age.

So, when the Eagles went to Mordor to retrieve Frodo and Sam, they were already humming the music of "Hotel California". It merely took Don Henley to write down the lyrics and melody at a later date.
The tales compiled by the man JRR Tolkien, as well as Frodo Baggins' own personal record, show that the two hobbits' journey to Mordor took several months- about 6 months, from September 23rd, TA3018, to March 25th, TA3019.  In the cover for *Hotel California*, it is revealed that the album took 6 months to record; therefore, even had the Eagles not began recording before Frodo even left Bag End, they would have been within the time parameters.
A reminder: This subreddit only allows sourced material directly related to the question. This is a discussion about an American football team that went from Valinor to Middle-earth to keep an eye on Vala Morgoth — taking time out from 1939 to 1942 to play in the Eastern Hockey League. All other comments will be deleted.
This is the thread that rules them all, will bring /r/AskHistorians into the shadow and **bind** them! I would not be surprised to find that OP has but one, gigantic flaming eye.
The eagles are a race.  They've had several acts throughout  the  ages.  They acted as messengers and spies for Manwe   in the First Age, they rescued Thorins party from goblins in the Third Age and they recorded  a hit album in  the Fourth Age.  



Doesn't this fall within the 20 century rule? Mods!
Follow-up question: if the eagles are the swiftest beings in Middle Earth, why do they only ever show up at the last minute?
The truth is this: The Eagles couldn't fly. Sure, Joe Walsh did buy a private jet but actually had no pilot experience whatsoever, let alone a license. On its maiden flight, he crashed it in the Sierra Nevadas. Glen Frey was dead on impact (leading to the breakup of the band). Don Henley lost his arm, the doctors were unable to reattach it... he can no longer play the drums.

Their dealer, nicknamed "Frodo" was left with a key of coke that he wasn't able to move, and ended up in custody. Thus never escaping "Mount Doom" (the Los Angeles FBI building). Tolkien changed the ending in his fictionalized account of the whole ordeal.

Hotel California is, of course, one of the most popular singles Steely Dan ever recorded. But don't feel bad, many young people get confused about which band sings which song nowdays ever since Spotify's patent lawsuit forced radio stations to stop identifying songs on the air.
Wikipedia states that Mt. Doom was conveniently located in a neighborhood near a recording studio.  I remember one time I was over in that neighborhood and saw for myself a couple of Eagles rescuing some Hobbits. They could have easily gone over to the recording studio. I have a few more tidbits but I need to research it.  I'll use this space to edit my answer later. 

I'll leave you with this bit of information that my pappy said the Eagles used to greet each other:

"- Farewell! wherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the journey's end!
- May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks."
A lot of people have proposed some good theories, and they all make sense. But… they are all wrong. Everyone seems to be confused, and the answer is rather simple.

They finished recording "Hotel California" *before* they rescued Frodo and Sam.
On a wing and a prayer.
The Eagles we a bardic super troupe formed by bardic college alumni looking to make a Smaug horde full of cash. They didn't write it, they lived it.

Don Giohenley(Lvl 20) and Lord o' the Glenn Frey(Lvl 20) combined for a +6 to lyrical composition. Donovan the Felder(Lvl19) and Joseph the Welsh(Lvl 21) added a +10 Lyre duel /jam. Lord William Sizemick(Lvl 18 Engineer) rolled a natural 20 on the production for a grand total of 36. This gave them plenty of time to pick up their roadies for the tour of the midlands.
[removed]
Follow up question: why couldn't Frodo have just taken an eagle to Mordor in the first place?
[removed]
[removed]
I have a related question: was the rescue of Frodo and Sam at Mt Doom the event that prevented the Eagles from becoming Linda Ronstadt's backing band after the Stone Poneys dissolved in the early 1970s ? 
[removed]

[removed]
The Eagles barely ever appeared because they were recording that album. If they put aside the music and helped save the world first, Frodo and Sam would have suffered less, Boromir would not have died, and "Hotel California" would have been much better.

They were using Chip Kelly's hurry-up offense.
Simply put one of the Eagles has a Maserati that does 185. Middle Earth is a pretty small place so they can get around very quickly. Unfortunately after the events of the Hobbit, Walsh lost his license and can no longer drive. This is why they were unable to aide the fellowship.

Focusing on the time period of your question and experience (late 1990's and early 2000's) and building off the fact that other comments have discussed the regional/local implications of differing standards.

Another comment mentioned specifically Virginia as their experience, and Virginia's Department of Education DOES have their past standards all posted in PDFS nicely organized on their website allowing us to make some direct comparisons of standards.  

For reference [Here](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/index.shtml) is the main page for the Virginia SOL's.  On this page are the most recent, adopted in 2008, as well as links at the bottom to previous iterations from 2001 and 1995.

Reading through the different history standards for the various grade levels did show some changes in their treatment of "legends" and "stories" in teaching history.

[The 1995 Kindergarten Standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/previous_years/1995/history_socialstudies/history95k-12.pdf) have as their first history standard:
>  The student will understand that history relates to events and people of other times and places by
>
•  identifying examples of past events in legends and historical accounts, including Paul Revere’s ride and
the  stories  of  Johnny  Appleseed,  Booker  T.  Washington, and Betsy Ross;
>
•  identifying  examples  of  interesting  Americans
through exposure to biographies of important people
of the past, including George Washington, Harriet
Tubman, Abraham Lincoln, and Davy Crocket

By 2001 [The standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/complete/stds_history.pdf) was edited to read:
> The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by 
>
a) identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of 
Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln

And [The current version](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_all_history.pdf) has:
> The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by 
>
a)   identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of Powhatan, 
Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln; 

Looking at the three versions we can see a clear shift in the 2001 standard removing what are considered the "popular myths" portion.  It is important to note that the two updated versions do still use the phrase "legends, stories, and historical accounts", which leaves a large room for error in the students not fully understanding the difference in the three.

The Virginia Department of Education also publishes a series of lesson plans for each of the grade level standards.  

In [The lesson plans for the standards US History Up to 1865](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/scope_sequence/history_socialscience_scope_sequence/2008/scopeseq_histsoc_ushist_to1865.pdf) there is a lesson (page 87 of the pdf) that covers the contributions of Thomas Paine and Patrick Henry.
The [corresponding standard](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_ushistory_to1865.pdf) is:
> c)   describing key events and the roles of key individuals in the American Revolution, with emphasis on George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry; 

In this lesson the students are given links to an excerpt of *Common Sense* and a transcript of Patrick Henry's "Give Me Liberty" speech.  They are then instructed:
>3.Have students read the excerpts individually or aloud as a class.
If some of the language is difficult for students to understand, have them look up unfamiliar vocabulary. After they have completed the readings, help them identify the main ideas, and have them complete their guided reading outlines.
>
4.Have students use the information from the readings and from the textbook to write a persuasive editorial for the local newspaper explaining why colonists should support the battle for independence. Show students examples of present-day editorials from the local paper to help them understand the format and purpose of an editorial.

As a lesson on its own there is nothing overtly wrong with this; however, if we compare this to a similar lesson published by the [University of Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/1775%20Give%20Me%20Liberty%20discussion.pdf) we can see that UT included in their lesson the statement:
>The speech you read was not recorded in contemporary sources, but was instead recounted from 
memory and reported to William Wirt (who was writing Henry’s biography) many years later in 1816.  Does the fact that Henry may not have actually said the famous words attributed to him “Give me liberty...” change the significance of this speech?  How does historical evidence change the impression we get of those who were the heroes of the American Founding?  Is it possible for the speech to be important even if we are not certain that it is accurate?  Why or why not?

The UT lesson includes an exploration into the possibility that the speech is apocryphal while the Virginia one does not; leading to students exploring the same idea with different levels of understanding.

If you explore the lesson plans for the lower grade level's on the Virginia DOE page many of the kindergarten lessons that accompany the standard listed above call on the teacher to find a text to read to their students that covers the event or person being discussed. As another comment already pointed out; most of the people teaching at these grade levels will not have taken many higher level history courses and may choose texts that perpetuate the myths without the teacher themselves realizing the inaccuracies.  

This issue is added to by the fact that in 2010 the Washington Post [published an article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/29/AR2010122903028.html) covering historical inaccuracies in textbooks being used in Virginia classrooms.  The texts and publisher being discussed in that article were (and still are) on the [approved textbook list](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/textbooks/history_social_science/index.shtml) published by the DOE.  The state is currently going through a new revision of textbooks but still on that site you can see that the books being discussed had to be updated to a second edition and re-approved (their works being approved in 2011) while all the other texts for the Virginia History and History to 1865 section were not put through the same process and still have their approvals from 2009.

So as a TLDR;

* Standards from when you went to school may have included such myths
* The lessons your teachers used may have omitted the historical complexity and/or possibility of the story being inaccurate
* The texts that your teachers used may have had incorrect information printed in them that your teacher was not educationally equipped to catch.

Also a big shout out to the Virginia Department of Education for putting all their standards in such an easy to navigate and locate website.  I tried Texas first to look at the transition from the TEAMS test to TAAS and then TAKS and STAAR but couldn't find anything like what the Virginia DOE has on the Texas DOE website.

Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context. 

Complicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the "apprenticeship of observation"). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.). 

Finally, these trends have been accelerated since 2001. With the passing of NCLB, a greater emphasis was put on success in standardized exams. In the NCLB framework, meeting proficiency in math and English language arts was what counted as "success."  And if it's not tested, it's not likely to be taught. I'll offer a personal example that exemplifies this trend: for four years I ran professional development around history education for elementary teachers in NY.  When NY decided to end the 5th grade Regents exam in history, principals immediately pulled their teachers from our program, a program they hitherto praised and were excited to send their teachers to.  We repurposed our program from "Teaching NY and US History" to "Teaching Non-fiction Texts" and our numbers went right back up. The Common Core is also a set of standards in math and English language arts, so these trends are likely to continue.

In summary: history in the elementary years is not prioritized by the educational bureaucracy, likely resulting in minimal history instruction (if at all). In addition, elementary teachers lack the requisite content knowledge and/or the confidence to spend a great deal of time on historical subjects. Thus when students get to the high school years they have likely learned a great deal of history at home, in movies, in video games, etc., much may not be reliably told.

I am not a historian per se, but I am a teacher, so hopefully I can answer this question in a way that the mods will allow to remain. If not, forgive me. 

Teachers in all states of the United States are required by law to teach certain standards (standards may vary). I'm based in the state of Texas and we are required to teach the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in our classrooms. You can find a comprehensive list of those skills here: https://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=6148

To be more specific, you requested information regarding why students in elementary schools are taught that Columbus discovered the earth was round, Ben Franklin and electricity, etc. In short, they aren't. Here is the link to the TEKS for Grade Level 6: http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter113/ch113b.html

Columbus isn't a topic for 6th graders in Texas, but if you scroll down to section 4, topic B, you'll see that the only mention of Benjamin Franklin refers to his role in the American Revolution. 

While I will admit that these requirements are simply a framework, there is also a system for teachers called the TEKS Resource System, which serves to clarify the TEKS for all Texas teachers. Some teachers will supplement lessons with the textbook, while others will use their own research conducted through college to decide which specific details they will teach.

It is worth nothing that these skills are updated and corrected over time, although I would have to assume that there was never a TEK that said, "Teach that Columbus discovered the world was round," since that fact has been well-known for decades prior to your own experience.

Hi, OP and readers,

Upon further review and reports from users, the mod team has elected to remove the major answer previously in this thread. Ultimately, it rested on the personal experience of one person and their friends, a violation of our rule about anecdotes. There is a *wealth* of research on teaching history/social studies in elementary and secondary education in the U.S.  Sources were requested out of this body of scholarship, but none were provided. If that changes (we've notified the user via PM in hopes that this will happen!), we'll review the post again in keeping with our standard practice.

It's especially important in this case because education and how-to-educate programs in the U.S. are so diverse and decentralized--one of the problems with "fixing" problems in history education has persistently been the reliance on one perspective at the policy level.

As a public history/outreach forum, AskHistorians is extremely invested in both the problems of history education and their proper solution. We hope you'll agree that a well-sourced, rigorous answer to this question is the best solution for all of us.

It's well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy's medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).

Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger's (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.

So the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy's medical-treatment drug useage extended to "drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.

The difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy's "off track betting" use of drugs comes from Jacobson's unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.

Journalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson's claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:

* The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
* Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late '62-'63, Mr. Kennedy's official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits)
* For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel
* A memo from Mrs. Kennedy's social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I'll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband's health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)

The Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.

As to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland's "boorish" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don't think that's the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a "stay tuned" topic for the future.

Hello everyone. A quick note to be made as this thread thread continues to get a lot of attention:

* You're welcome to disagree, as should already be clear from comments visible^[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6ohvp/) , but we expect it to be done civilly. We WILL remove comments which are rude.^[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_civility)
* Please make a contributive comment, regardless of what your opinion is.^[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_digression)
* You likely aren't the first to try and point out this breaks the 20 Year rule, which has already been answered (META thread and Historiography exception).^[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6uxp8/)
* You also aren't the first to claim you are shocked that a group of people passionate about making history accessible to people would advocate for programs that help to make history accessible to people.^[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df7d5at/?context=3)
* If you make the exact same point already made and responded (see above points), your comment may be removed^[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df7di8l/) as the thread is pretty cluttersome at this point^[7](http://imgur.com/a/2p68n). Please instead consider upvoting the earlier comment, and/or commenting within the existing chain as it adds little to have the same comment chain repeated a dozen times. This is not intended to suppress any views - plenty of contrary comments are visible here^[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6o9o7/) - but to keep discussions easy to follow, as there are already several repeats.
* Finally, if you are on the fence about the merits of what we are asking, please read through the thread before making up your mind. Many users have shared real examples of NEH grants and other worthwhile public funding.^[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6kuw)[10](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df68dn8/)[11](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6ysdb/)[12](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6ro5y/)[13](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd3sffh/)

Edit: Someone reported for lack sources. They have been added.
If you're making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you'll personally be impacted by it's loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you're a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It's a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America. 
It's worth restating just how small the combined budgets for the NEA and NEH are. 

Arithmetic was never my strong suit, but I thought it'd be useful to quantify it against Trump's proposed border wall. How much of the wall will cutting these programs pay for?

**Projected cost of border wall (midrange estimate):**
$15 Billion

**Approximate length of border:**
2 thousand miles

**Approximate cost per mile of border:**
$7.5 Million

**Approximate NEA and NEH budgets combined:**
$300 Million

**Length of wall built with NEA and NEH funds:**
40 miles: 2% of the overall border

Eliminating these programs isn't about wasteful government spending, it's an attack on our shared culture, intellectual curiosity and freedom of expression.
For a very long time I would read posts and statements and calls to action like this and never have it truly cross the threshold of action in me. These past few months have changed that.

I'd encourage you, if you haven't made the calls to your senators and representatives, to do so. It wasn't easy the first time I did it. I took half an hour to walk out of my workplace, find a park bench, think about what I wanted to say, call, and say it. Then call again and say it again to my other senator.

Learn to flex this muscle. I make the call about once a week on whatever thing I feel passionately about. Then I reward myself by wearing a patriotic little pin that means something to me for the rest of the day.

If you really don't want to talk to a human being, you can call outside of business hours and leave a voice mail. It doesn't have to be long, and the line is specifically for people to express their opinions. So do it!

202-224-3121, follow the prompts to be directed to your elected officials.
Hi, I'm in the UK (not American) so I can't do much to help, but I just wanted to let you all know that we're watching and supporting from over here. Good luck.
I thought it might be useful to help illustrate just what kinds of projects NEH grants go to fund. All grants are searchable on their [wbesite here](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx), but I did some searches to find a few examples, with a focus on smaller, rural areas:

[The L.C. Bates Museum](http://www.gwh.org/lcbates/LCBatesMuseum.aspx) in [Fairfield, ME, population 6,735](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_Maine)

>The museum includes amazing natural history exhibits, fun local history, Native American collections, rocks and minerals, fossils, outside nature trails, picnic tables, and an arboretum behind the museum.  The museum even has themed art exhibits from artists of New England each summer through fall. 

[They recieved a $5,990 grant to help with their preservation goals](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-251598-17):

>The project is designed to turn an unused room on the museum's second floor into appropriate storage space for humanities objects, purchase shelving and storage supplies, train staff in storage methods, store the project collections, and present a public workshop on Storage Management in a Small Museum.

----------------

[Appalshop, Inc.](https://www.appalshop.org/) in [Whitesburg, Kentucky, population 2,139](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesburg,_Kentucky):

>Since 1969, Appalshop has been enacting cultural organizing and place-based media, arts and education to document the life, celebrate the culture, and voice the concerns of people living in Appalachia and rural America.

They got a [$12,000 grant](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PY-253110-17) for a cultural history project titled "The Hills Remember: Preserving Heritage in an Appalachian Coal Community":

>Building on a sense of place that is deeper than its Appalachian coal seams while confronting the limits of a fossil fuel based economy, Letcher County, Kentucky, is in a moment of transition. The proposed project will build upon local efforts to increase sense of agency and appreciation for the community's heritage and assets. It will result in the digitization of vernacular photographic materials, artwork and  3-Dimensional objects, historical paper records and audiovisual materials provided by members of the public and gathered as a result of community engagement, public programming, and digitization events. By catalyzing the area's cultural assets, the project will increase local capacity through activities that safeguard and celebrate both the archival materials collected and the wellspring of community expression and traditions.

The [Town of Rockingham, Vermont, population 5,282](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockingham,_Vermont) recieved a $[6,000 grant](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-52475-15) for the [Public Library](http://www.rockinghamlibrary.org/)'s "Cataloged Photograph Collection Glass Plate Negative Rehousing Project":

>The Rockingham Free Public Library seeks to rehouse and properly store components of its extensive and popular Cataloged Photograph Collection. This collection contains photographic material from the 1860s-1970s and has provided visual information to support historic research on a broad range of topics of both local and national significance. Funds from The National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation Assistant Grant will support the rehousing training and purchase of archivally sound housing materials for the collection’s glass plate negatives and the purchase of a flat file to house larger format photographic prints. The furniture and rehousing activities would support the goal of a stable storage environment for the Library’s most popular local history collection.

---------

The [Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County](http://yellowstonegatewaymuseum.org/), in [Livingston, Montana, population 7,044](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana):

>The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County’s mission is to collect, preserve, and interpret the cultural and natural history of Park County, Montana and its relationship to Yellowstone Park for the education of everyone.  

They got [$5,102](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-52585-15) for "Archival/Photo Collection Preservation Project":

>The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County (YGM) holds numerous significant manuscript, archival and photograph collections. Collections are held to preserve Park County and Montana’s heritage. YGM honors the spirit of Montana’s history by accessioning, processing, and making accessible archival materials that reflect the state’s diverse cultural background. Currently a large majority of these collections are located in a storage building behind the museum. The building does not have any environmental controls such as heating or cooling. Historic documents and photographs received by donors are currently stored in acidic boxes. As with many small museums, a large amount of backlog exists from the early years of development. Our goal is to move the material to the HVAC-controlled museum and store significant photographs and documents in archival folders, boxes, and cabinets to ensure the stability of the items for current and future researchers.

Hopefully this helps to illustrate the kind of work that these grants can do. They are often very small, and they go to help small organizations which likely couldn't do the work that they aim to, or at least not on the same scale, without the help. All the grants are searchable [online](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx). I would certainly love to see people search through and share ones that have affected them!
Could you link us to where we can contact our representatives? At least a general contact page would be good. 
I'm not sure if this is the proper place to ask this but I think it's important that I ask somewhere

I'm an immigrant to the US and after 10 long years of effort, I'll finally be able to apply for my citizenship later this year. I now want to do what I never had the opportunity to do back in my home country: speak out and have a non-zero chance of being heard

There are a number of things I've wanted to speak up about but this post has been the tipping point for me. I'm educating myself on the proper way to contact my representative but I wanted advice from the more experienced among us on the best possible way so here are my questions:

- When I hear contact my congressman, does that mean I should contact my Representative, or Senator, or both? 

- Am I even eligible to contact my representative? I'm a permanent resident but as I mentioned there will still be some time before I can apply for citizenship. Should I wait? Should I mention my status on call?

- What is the best possible way of ensuring that you get heard? Online sources say email but this post says phone. Both?

- If I contact by phone, I face a new set of challanges. English is not my first language and although I'm pretty comfortable with it, I do notice I get stuck explaining myself properly in speech. I'm also pretty introverted by nature and I know that will make things difficult as well. I don't want to just read a prepared statement if I have to but any advice regarding length and depth of my call would be very helpful

- Can I call/email repeatedly and regularly? I wouldn't want to get blacklisted or anything?
A correction: The Trump budget doesn't cut PBS, but rather it cuts the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.   

The latest numbers I could easily find (2011) indicated that CPB's contribution to PBS and PBS stations (which are largely independent public TV stations that carry PBS programming, local programming, other public TV sources such as BBC, etc.) were $71 million and $210 million (distributed somehow over the 1400 or so public TV stations across the US).  During 2010, their revenue was around $570M, so assuming 2010 and 2011 are directly comparable, CPB was paying for about 12% of PBS's budget.  

Another big chunk of PBS's revenues would of course be fees from all the local stations so they can run PBS content.  

W/r/t NPR: NRP gets a very small portion of its annual revenue from CPB and it's not direct funding but grants, [per this page.](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances)

> On average, less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.

Like PBS, NPR gets fees from public radio stations who run their content, and that's a majority of their funding, so any cuts to the stations themselves (which are largely locally funded) would have secondary effect on the NPR organization itself, likely one large than the 1% in grants from CPB.
Oh boy an advocacy campaign. I know about these, I've helped run them and been on the receiving end of them.

**Here are some tips:**

**Be polite:** the offices of elected officials get a ton of communication, much of it nasty, hateful and mean. The fastest way to get ignored by an elected official is to be one of the folks being rude to their staff. They'll just write you off as someone to be ignored.

**Be clear about what you want:** Senators/Representatives get a lot of constituent (and advocate) contact on a lot of issues. It is easy for the details of who wants what to be confused. To that end one of the first things you should say, should be something along the lines of: “I'm calling to ask the Senator/Representative to support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.” 

Say it slowly and clearly so the person you are speaking with has time to write it all down. I'd recommend you say it again at the end of the phone call.

**Be clear about why you want it:** The best argument for a program, is to tell them why it matters to you. The more personal the better. Maybe the NEA sponsored a great art instillation in your city, maybe the National Endowment for Humanities put on a great program you went to. The point is to humanize these programs, these offices hear about an alphabet soup of programs and are drowning in data, the more you can make a program's value clear in immediate human terms, the better.

**Ask for a response:** Most of the time the person you talk to will be an intern or a staff assistant, they won't be able to give you a clear answer on the office's policy. Asking for a follow up ensures that your message will move up the food chain or at least force the office to actually have to deal with your ask.

**More advanced tip:** Look to see if your representative/senator serves on the Appropriations Committee in either chamber. The Appropriations Committee is the one that makes the decisions about funding. If your representative/senator serves on the committee, it is even more important to contact their offices. If they aren't ask them to contact their fellow representatives/senators who are.

The House Appropriations roster: http://appropriations.house.gov/about/members/

The Senate Appropriations roster: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/about/members

**Also more advanced tip:** the most effective way to get a message to an elected official is by personally asking them. Most representatives/senators hold either electronic or physical town halls. Attending one of these and asking your representative/senator personally, is the best way to get them to support your programs. 

**FAQ on the appropriations process for FY 2017 and 2018:**

**Question:** Just what is the President's Budget and why does it matter?

**Answer:** The president is required by law to submit a budget of his recommendations for the federal budget to Congress. Congress is not required to act on them, and often goes to great lengths to tell everyone how little they care about what the president thinks. However, like Gertrude in Hamlet they protest too much.

While dramatic programmatic changes and topline numbers in the president's budget often don't make it past the committee room, the president's budget also contains a ton of recommendations on what departments and agencies would like for their budgets. Those recommendations often do end up mattering. 

It's worth noting that there is also a political element to this. The current President is a Republican, so Congress may end up spending more time considering what he has to say than they did the previous president. 

**Q:** Wait, above there you listed both FY 2017 and 2018 up there. What gives?

**A:** Usually Congress handles only one year's worth of appropriations at a time. However, the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriation was never finished, so although we are like a third of the way through  FY 2017 (FY's run from October 1st to September 30th), Congress still needs to finish the FY 2017 appropriations.

**Q:** Yeah, about. Just how the hell does this all work?

**A:** I am so very sorry you asked. Basically annually Congress passes (or attempts to pass) 12 appropriations bills. Each funding a different set of agencies in the government. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees each have 12 subcommittees, each of which is responsible for one of the 12 bills. These bills are supposed to be passed annually before the fiscal year ends. 

**Q:** So where do these programs fit in?

**A:** the funding for NEA/NEH is controlled by the House and Senate Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittees funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are controlled by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. If you are fortunate to have a member on either subcommittee, it is vital that you reach out to them to ask that they support these programs. You can find out who is on the relevant appropriations subcommittees on the House and Senate Appropriations Committee websites.

Senate: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/

House: http://appropriations.house.gov/

**Q:** Do you have a source for the stuff you just said?

**A:** Of course, this is still /r/askhistorians

Check out the CRS report on this here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-721.pdf

This is such a brilliant response, but I expected nothing less from you guys. 
It only took like a minute to voice my concerns to the staffer on the line, but man it feels so good to do that.
Libertarian Republican here. Big fan of cutting waste. The NEA and NEH needs to be funded. This is our art our culture as a western nation. Have already called my reps. I am sure this will get full funding.
Could I suggest that we could make a point to cross post this with the guys in one of the art reddits for them to also make a second call for the History grants and visa versa. Make 2 calls, double the calls.
What sorts of metrics are used to measure the efficiency of organizations that receive this funding? I think one of the problems people have (when giving only a quick glance to such programs) is that there are no tangible end-items. I realize this isn't the case much of the time, but if I were auditing a beneficiary what would I be looking for? Am I racking their progress up against their stated goals?

And in that same vein, how are organizations chosen to receive funding? Are there boxes that need to be checked, like public benefit,  something along those lines? Who is the "decider?"

To be clear, I absolutely am not in favor of cutting these programs. The amount of money is trivial in the grand scheme of things and the cultural importance is invaluable. However, I don't think questioning government use of taxpayer funds should be anathema in any instance, ever. The amount of downvotes a handful of comments in this thread received seem to indicate some people would rather not have that type of conversation and I think that's a shame. Especially when you look at the stellar responses to many of those questions and realize what an opportunity it is to educate.
This is NOT wasted money, this enriches people's lives, directly improves public education, and benefits our culture. 
Just called Senator Shelby (Alabama) to inform him someone in Southwest Alabama cares about NEA/NEH funding. 
I see a lot of arguments put forth for the NEH, but where are the arguments for the NEA?

Whom do I call if I'm military stationed out of my state of residence? I assume it's my state of residence rep, but just making sure.
Calls matter, but voting matters even more.  Vote in every election at every level for a candidate who supports public funding for good causes.  
CANADA SUPPORTS YOU!!!


Serious question:

Can these organizations exist without federal funding?  Do they receive enough money from private donors to be able to operate without federal funds?
 I wish you all the best. I no doubt that us here across the pond (UK) will have our own issues like this in the near future when people start to realise how much cultural and historical funding came from the EU.

 I really hope the cut gets overturned as these services you are trying to save are great and the work you guys do here is amazing.
I called Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio but got directed to voicemail on Nelson after being on hold for ten minutes and the option to leave a message on Rubio's, which I took. Is this sufficient? Do you think someone will listen to the message and mark down two votes (respectively) for supporting these three programs, or do I need to call back until I get somebody?
Just placed a couple calls. If nothing else, TIL how messed up [Maryland's Congressional districts are.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%27s_congressional_districts#/media/File:Maryland_Congressional_Districts,_113th_Congress.tif)
What can I do if I live in a "Blue" house and senate district whose representatives will vote against it? 
Being in a country under dictatorship, I always envy your American way of participation in politics. You can call to your representatives and state your opinion on the matter affecting you, which we have none, all we can do here is pray that those dictatorial board have our best interest at heart. Yep, tough luck.

So, yeah, exercise all your right while you can. If you don't it would be such a shame I would recommend you to come and live under the rock here with us.

Called both my senators, although in Ca they are both seriously against these cuts.  


Thanks for the post!
Can I request someone make this information available in a way that is easily shareable on social media? I know that might be a lot to ask, maybe just some of the vital components could be in their own images so we can saturate social media. It's very important information, and social media is one of the big battlegrounds for information. 

My apologies if this kind of request isn't allowed. 
Just called Senator Reed for Rhode Islanders. He [just spoke out against Trump's defunding efforts](https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-risca-make-the-case-for-keeping-arts-humanities-museum-and-library-funding-alive) so I'm sure he'll be receptive to some support.
Wonderful post, keep up the pressure! As one of them foreigners I will once again make sure that my American friends, acquaintances and enemies (don't know of any....yet) know about this. To the social media machine!
Upvoting as a Canadian, not sure if I have much of a say in effecting your politics, but I sure hope that those critical services stay in effect rather than building a stupid wall.
I will of course be in contact with my representatives, but since I am in Utah and with the likes of Hatch, Chaffetz, and Lee I don't see it going anywhere on my front sadly.
So if this passes, you guys will all be out of a job and get to spend even more time sharing awesome knowledge on Reddit?!

All kidding aside it's sad to see such brutal and sweeping cuts without seemingly any public engagement or debate. Who do they think they work for?
Done! I voiced my opinion on all three issues. I gained my love of history and science from PBS, and am working towards being a science teacher in a Title I school. These programs are absolutely necessary for students without access to preschool, and expand everyone's knowledge. 
Thank you for bringing this to light. I've been apolitical much of my adult life. The past eight years or so I have taken a more involved role. I've left both my senators a message. Thanks again.
[I found this great guide for reaching your local representatives.] (https://callthehallsguide.com) I only paid a dollar for it and it's very easy to follow. Yesterday was my first time ever calling and I was very nervous but I'm glad I did it. Just talking to an assistant made me feel that much closer to the president and made me realize that all the news I hear about have a serious impact. 
I made the call and tried to keep it short and sweet. I sincerely hope it helps.
This post and the comments underneath are restoring my faith in the beauty that is WITHIN the US and honestly around the world. Especially hearing other countries giving us support and knowing we don't stand for many of the divisive statements of our government.

Hi, im not a historian or even directly affected by a defunding of American institutions since im european, but the way I see it this can have a huge knock on effect for the rest of us as well. If the humanities and arts get defunded now the question is what's next? Anyone who relies on grants even partially could be the next target if budgets are cut again. So for those of us who rely on grants in other fields, for me it will hopefully be support for my PhD in law, give it a thought because not only can you support something you are interest in (or else you wouldn't be here) but also potentially support the future of your own line of work.
i wish you luck on this one my friends, not living in america but can relate to your struggles.
I salute you guys, honestly. This post is going to cause some degree of controversy, but I know that this is the right call.
Woooow, I read the whole thing and I was seriously, to my mistake, expecting it to be an anti trump campaign and I'm so happy it wasn't. Not the point though! I agree with this cause even being a Trump Supporter, meaning I disagree with the Trump Administration's plan for taking away these things. Let's get our voices out there and give our opinions as the American people love it! 
Just texted my Congressman because he gives his cell phone number out to anyone at his meetings. He also has his office in the public library downtown and definitely supports the NEA and NEH but hopefully more of us being involved will encourage him to be more outspoken on the matter and in congress.
Thank you for this. 
I'm trying to organize a letter/petition to be sent from my college. Does anyone know the deadline/voting on this and when it needs to be in by? I have to get this by a board and they'll want that kind of info, especially since this'll probably have to be a fast tracked deal.
Is there anyway I can help from australia to help the nea and neh I donate to npr.
My representative is Kevin McCarthy :( His office ignores us.
If you go through my post history you will see that I am not very active on this sub since my field of study is niche and often never gets asked about.

But I have the following questions for the moderation team since this thread seems to be open season.

1) How many of you are americans?

2) How many of you receive part or all of your income from grants or other funding that may be cut under the new budget proposal?

3) How many other (non-american) national historical societies are for or against these cuts in solidarity with the AHA or with the current United States government respectively?

>The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.

>For all the NEH does, that's a good deal. 

As long as you want to go down this route, [fine](http://www.campbellcompany.com/news/giving-usa-research-arts-culture-humanities-philanthropy).

>In 2014, charitable giving to nonprofit organizations in the arts, culture, and humanities sector reached a total of **$17.23 billion** – a total of 5 percent of all donations received by charities in 2014, according to Giving USA 2015: The Annual Report on Philanthropy. When assessing charitable giving to the arts, culture, and humanities sector these past few years, we are seeing that there is a steady growth in contributions. Between the years of 2013 and 2014, giving to arts, culture, and humanities increased by 9.2 percent.

$143 million is just 0.83 percent of $17.23 billion. If we're going to pretend that these skewed comparisons are meaningful, then the NEH is a minor consideration if you're going to claim that things like the humanities are under threat without government funding.

Additionally, the 9.2% increase from one year to the next in philanthropy for the humanities, arts and cultures represents approximately $1.5 billion, approximately **10 times** the amount of the NEH's funding for a year.

I'm not arguing against the NEH. I'm arguing against meaningless comparisons to bolster such arguments.

edit: It's really a shame that the Reddit reputation for groupthink permeates even a sub that values objectivity such as this one. If you handle criticism with downvotes instead of responses, you show a shallowness of principle.
What if we think there are better and more efficient ways to fund these initiatives, should we just sit quietly and not mess with status quo?

What if you support Trump's initiatives?

>We don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view.

You're advocating for a government program that is universally lauded by the left and despised by the right. How is that not getting political for a particular point of view?
>(which helps fund PBS and NPR stations).

It is less than 1% of NPR's revenue and less than 7% of PBS'

So no it doesn't help fund either of those two...

Rest I don't care about but just from the misconstruing of the Public Broadcasting grant I am quite sure you are off base for the rest of your post.

"Having free time to comment on Reddit" isn't a good reason to demand already strapped middle class taxpayers to pony up for this. Gobs and gobs of historical work happens regardless of these programs. And if the amounts are so tiny, then it can easily be funded through private foundations. So they are either inconsequential or entirely superfluous. I have yet to hear any kind of justification for federal funding of this type beyond "It does stuff I personally like and keeps me and people I know employed." 

So thank you for the information on who to call, but I will be calling to reduce or eliminate unnecessary federal programs.

Thank you!
Wow! I can finally provide some help with a question on /r/AskHistorians as a lawyer who does some labor, employment, and wage work, and as a big fan of the show. I can at least give some background on what we know about the show and about the wages Al earned while joking with Griff and [taking jabs at the rotund customers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRCHBi0DRFg&t=126s)

Let's rock:

Some basics on this for those who don't know: The show ran from 1987 to 1997 on Fox, and was (along with The Simpsons) the first hit for the fledgling network.

First, the income analysis. We can look at this in two ways: How much did shoe salesmen earn around that time, and how much Al Bundy actually earned.

We actually know a great deal about how much Al earned. Al earned a base salary plus commission at the store. We know from "My Mom, the Mom" (S03E12) Al earns that way, because he states he earns a 10% commission on each sale. I would say this really tells us how great of a salesman he is, considering how many customers he can insult and still earn those bonuses. 

Even better, we actually know Al's base salary! In ['Tis Time to Smell the Roses, S07E23](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0642200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl), Al is offered "a year's salary" for an early retirement. How much? $12,000. At 40 hours a week that breaks down to about $5.77/hour. Or $231/week. Of course, Peg spent Al's retirement bonus in a single day, as she is known to do, and Al returned to work the very next day. :-(

How realistic was that for retail employees in general during that time? I found data from [1993 Chicago](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924071730059&view=image&seq=238), showing that retail clerks at that time had a mean weekly salary of $278. So, when you add in Al's commissions, it seems entirely realistic!

Just to add in general: The minimum wage of Illinois in 1991 increased to $4.25/hour. So, again, Al's compensation on the show is very realistic. Jefferson approves!

Now, the matter of the family living arrangements. We know that the Bundy family lives in a "Chicago suburb". The actual exterior shot of the Bundy house is taken from [641 Castlewood Ln, in Deerfield, Illinois](https://www.complex.com/style/2014/09/the-real-world-locations-of-iconic-tv-homes/married-with-children). That home sold in 1998, a year after the show went off the air, for $320,000. What's more, we know from 1990 Census data that average home costs for Deerfield, Illinois, were between $1400-$1500 per month for homeowners with a mortgage. So, unless scoring 4 touchdowns in a single game at Polk High came with a big cash bonus (and BTW that fact is extremely relevant at all times), Al wasn't mortgaging a home in Deerfield (using 30% monthly income as the "affordability" figure like most banks).

Uh oh. Not looking good we would realistically see The Dodge parked in that driveway. Historical home values from the county clerk's office suggest that was not a huge sudden increase, either. 

So we know Al couldn't swing that particular house, but what about in general? The median home price in 1990 Illinois was $80,100 based on the 1990 Census. But Al didn't BUY the house in 1990. He bought the house sometime before 1987. 

Assuming Kelly was a child and Bud was a toddler when they bought the house, which would make sense, they could have purchased it around 1980. In 1980, the average home price in Illinois was $50,004, again using [Census data from 1980](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html). [Freddie Mac data](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) says the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 13.74% that year (oof). That makes the mortgage payment $466, figuring Al scraped up a 20% down payment. We can reasonably estimate $500 with taxes and insurance.

So now, in terms of a median home price and the Bundy family's likely situation, the show makes some sense. In 1987-1997, Al would maybe be able to "afford" that median house he purchased in 1980, as in, make payments, but (especially if he drove most customers away with his fat jokes, and had less commission), it would be a real struggle. The struggle often portrayed by Al's frustration on the show. And why shouldn't he be frustrated? All he wants is to sit on the couch and possibly read the occasional issue of Big Uns (or potentially the special issue with 120 pages - that's 240 "Uns"!).

Pointedly, then, the show's realisticness in terms of their home and arrangements might depend on whether Al drew any income as the founder and President of the National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood.

Further reading? Kelly says reading is for girls who aren't hot. Instead, I suggest watching the show, which is available on Hulu. Grandmaster B approves.
The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of wages for specific occupations in the country including geographic breakdowns.  We can use their data to answer your question.

Looking in the `NAICS 448200 - Shoe Stores` category the closest match to "shoe salesman" looks to me to be [41-2031 Retail Salespersons](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412031.htm) but we can also look at some adjacent jobs like `First-Line Supervisors of Sales Workers` and `Sales Managers` to get a range depending on how loosely you want to interpret the results.

Before 1997 (the last year the show was on the air) wage data is not available on a per occupation basis through the BLS.  Reference here: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm

So let's start with 1997:

Segment | Title | Total Employment | Annual Mean Wage | Annual Median Wage
---|---|----|----|----|----
Shoe Stores | Salespersons, Retail | 129,670 | $14,144 | $12,646

Screenshot of the report [here](https://i.imgur.com/aeq7uYX.png).

Sales Management positions can rise to $28,000 in the report.

Of course, that's national data so we need to scope it to the Chicago area.  

The Chicago area report for that occupation code gives the mean value as slightly higher: $18,350 (Screenshot [here](https://i.imgur.com/vwwPQP0.png))

**So it is reasonable to assume that in 1997 Al's salary would be around $18,000 +/- $5,000 depending on his specific title and how successful he personally was**.

After taxes that would be about $13,500 / year.

Given that this is a fictional show I'm comfortable moving forward with that estimate.

Now let's figure out what kind of lifestyle that yearly income would afford.

The University of Missouri has a variety of resources that are helpful [here](https://libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1990-1999#location) from historical rents to fuel and food prices.

Based on this data and making some assumptions a reasonable guess is that Al would have paid $450 a month for his house, about $5,400 /year.  We can say that his transportation costs in car maintenance and gas would be about $2,000 / year and that the cost of feeding his family (assuming a relatively modest diet) would be about $4,000 / year. 

Already we're up to about $11,000 a year.

And then, of course, there's utility costs, clothing, entertainment, etc.

_Tl;Dr: Things would have been tight in the Bundy household but passes the 'at all realistic' test if you make some very favorable assumptions about Al's spending habits, the location of his home, and his exact title and productivity at work._
I'd like to respond to this question from the opposite angle, which is: is it realistic that a Chicago homeowner family where the man is a retail worker would have a homemaker wife in the 1980s/1990s. The answer-- as others have pointed out-- is no. But it's interesting to look at why in the early 1990s that might have been a popular choice for a sitcom family dynamic and how Peg Bundy differed from other sitcom women of her era and those who came before her.

Let's look at the original sitcom woman: Lucy. She managed to live in an apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and fresh drapes while living on a single-income non-white entertainer's salary in the 1950s and maintaining a friendship with her landlord and his wife. Was that realistic? Probably not. But the show didn't get into the details of how they paid the bills. It presented the normalized idea that men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home and had lots of spare time to get into crazy schemes. Her schemes-- even when they were purely economical ones-- were always motivated internally. Lucy wanted fame: on television, or in the club, or in Hollywood. She never tried to advance herself to make money. Because that's not the sort of thing a (successful?) woman did.

The next relevant sitcom wife of the era was Laura Pietrie (Mary Tyler Moore on the Dick Van Dyke show). Again, here was a pretty domestic wife, now in a New York suburb instead of the city. On a few occasions she did go after money opportunities-- like appearing on a game show-- but the premise of the episode was never that the family's economic security was in doubt. Instead, the woman grasping after success was characterized as reaching at "even more" economic success for "already successful" households.

In reality, in this era, the work situation was anything but rosy or optional. Firms like Manpower and Kelly Girl were discovering the power of the female "temp" workforce. Why pay a full-time (male) clerk (who would expect benefits and a pension) when you could just as easily hire a Kelly Girl "temp" who was "just doing this for some extra money" and didn't have to be paid-- even thought of-- if she were sick, unavailable, or anything else. You were paying Kelly Girl, and if your usual Kelly Girl was unavailable, they'd just send a different one.

These details of women entering the workplace are detailed in TEMP by Louis Hyman, who is a labor economist at Cornell. In his book, he makes the point that in the post-war 20th Century, women were essential in establishing the idea of "temp" labor, and once big corporate management consultancy firms (McKinsey being the big one) figured out how much more profitable it was to hire only temp workers-- the economy was forever changed.

But the real changes in the economy were light-years ahead of what we saw on TV. In 1977 we saw the release of The Mary Tyler Moore Show: a big deal because it featured a single woman renting an apartment and holding a newspaper job on her own: contrasted by Phyllis, of course, a "normal" woman with a child and husband. But there was also Rhoda, Mary's "weird" neighbor who washed her own windows and wore trousers. Fifty years ago, these details were groundshaking.

Anyway, fast forward through the series of spinoffs from the MGM TV world and Norman Lear's universe to pause briefly on Edith Bunker. Here again-- 25 years after Lucy-- was a homemaker wife who would never even DREAM of holding a job other than taking care of her husband. And suddenly-- magically-- that's what makes her ridiculous. Edith is always portrayed as the voice of... well-- if not reason-- common sense maybe. And although Archie Bunker's household is still living as if it's the 1950s... they're certainly not living as well as Lucy did in the 1950s... Meathead is not afraid to point this out. Edith is.

Moving on further: the pilot of Cheers. 1980s now. Diane enters Cheers to enjoy a toast: she's just gotten engaged. But her fiancé runs off to be with his ex wife so suddenly... she needs a job? What an unusual and unexpected position for an educated white woman to be in!? She takes the job but immediately the stakes turn into a sexual ping-pong match between her and her boss. I guess the idea that she was even at the table was considered revolutionary.

Later, there was Murphy Brown. She was the opposite of all these sitcom wives: married to her career. Sexless. But a woman! And hot! The writers couldn't resist and eventually a pregnancy story got built into the show, which Dan Quayle-- Vice-President-at-the-Time who once spelled potato wrong and for a brief period of time that's the stupidest we thought Republicans could ever be-- took great offense to. Anyway he tried to burn Murphy Brown but historically speaking he was too stupid to and failed. The show carried on for several seasons including Murphy once stealing the 'T' off TRUMP Tower but the point was always that she was some sort of exceptional, outsize woman, not anybody normal. A woman, but not a wife. This was new and revolutionary.

So we've reached Peg Bundy. After generations where the hits had sterling, strong wives: why was she a bon-bon eating, stay at home manicurist? And why was it so successful? Well... in a weird way... because it was new. As much as these outsider perspectives on women in television had on women making advancements in the field of women's equality, there were still lots of places in America (and then later, the rest of the world) where women had NOT seen the sort of economic and labor equalizing forces that defined the 20th Century. 

Married With Children became a huge international hit. In Russia it aired five nights a week: they recreated the entire English language series, then commissioned the original American writing staff to write an entire extra season that would air in Russia (and then get re-broadcast in Ukraine, Poland, etc.). 

My point is that since there was such a social incentive to make the point that your wife didn't "need" to work, she just did to "get out of the house" or whatever, the idea of working women wasn't normalized on television until the late 90s, when Al Bundy: supporter of a decadent wife and even more decadent children became the face of "enough is enough". Men saw-- through Al Bundy-- an economy that had long ceased to exist (a single male breadwinner; no education but the expectation is to put the kids through college) and didn't get the joke. You're out here checking Chicago real estate prices instead of asking the bigger question: were single-income retail families viable in the 1990s? No. They were not. 

What this meant for women was especially tough. There was a tacit understanding that going to work was something "everyone was doing" but was also "not normal". That can't hold for long. In the  late 90s and early 00s we see and justify women working (in general) with them excelling in female-driven careers: Monica is a chef; Rachel is a personal shopper at Bloomingdales. We've since moved on from a family dynamic in the Chicago suburbs and are looking at a sitcom area dominated by childless attractive people unstressed by the worries that 9/11 might convey.

And we've been carrying forward our unwillingness to confront those troubles for 20 years now. 

I am struggling to imagine a broadly successful sitcom pilot in which we don't ask the question, "but why does the wife have a job?" The best answer might be Modern Family. That pilot aired in 2009, and still, the answer was *because she works for her dad*. 

The good question isn't 'why doesn't Peg Bundy have a job in the early 90's'. The good question is "why, in the early 90's, would we look at Peg Bundy and assume she's real?" That question has everything to do with a calculated effort to denormalize women as equal contributors to the household and hypernormalize the male breadwinner at a time when it was so anti-normal that we were there to laugh at it. As we're seeing now: people adhere to old visions of society until a big impact occasion forces them to change focus.

Piggybacking off this a bit, how long after his death was the autopsy performed? As that may well affect the coroner's observations. Imagine, for instance, if Charles II laid in state for a period of time after his death without any embalming (I don't know what the Spanish monarchy's customs were in this respect), that would give a decent amount of time for all those lovely bacteria inside of us to start going to town on his innards. 

I think I remember, for instance, that (yes, this was a few centuries prior) William the Conqueror wasn't embalmed before his funeral procession and got tremendously bloated as a result, so I'm curious if that might be what happened to Charles II.
EDIT: Okay -- the FOUR part answer is all done. I might have done a little bit crazy. A couple people messaged me about Foucault -- I wrote a response in Part 4 below  (and about how, despite finding him influential, I largely agree with the mods policy on him).

&#x200B;

What a wonderful question! I'm going to answer this in three parts -- the first talking about autopsies and medical perception, the second about Charles II, and the third to generally talk about my approach to paleopathology and medical history.

&#x200B;

So here is my "mod alert" -- I am going to talk about the ever-controversial Michel Foucault (though very early Foucault). Foucault, of course, is always a controversial reference on r/AskHistorians (and in history in general). If you want to rustle some jimmies, try citing "Discipline and Punish" in this forum. That being said, it's more or less impossible to talk about pathological anatomy and the Paris Clinical School before referencing a very early Foucault book "The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception". As far as I'm aware, this is the first serious study of medical perception and the postmodern concept of "the gaze" (Foucault used the French phase "le regard", which is usually translated as "clinical gaze," but the term "medical perception" used most commonly in his title I think fits bette). Foucault is interested in the dawning of the Paris Clinical School, starting in the waning days of the Ancien Regime and lasting through the Revolution and the next several decades. I'll actually defend Foucault's historiography in this case (of course, the man himself would hate that I used the word history of describe anything he did) -- the work is very well referenced, and mostly concerned with the discourse of physicians themselves. That being said, while he's been very influential, his historiography is overly reliant on these physicians' own interpretations, and modern historiography (Erwin Ackerknecht, and more recently La Berge and Hannaway) has unsurprisingly revealed a far subtler picture. For example, where Foucault sees a sharp break between the classical and hypothetical curriculum of the Ancien Regime faculty and new hands-on "hospital medicine," scholars have actually looked at notes from students studying in both these regimes, and notes a more gradual shift.

&#x200B;

That was quite a caveat -- but I actually take Foucault's philosophy of science quite seriously. So one of Foucault's central theses in Birth of the Clinic (expounded more in The Order of Things) is that medical perception is largely driven by unconscious assumptions about what constitutes disease and man's relationship to it. This is in contrast to the traditional scientific narrative that medical understanding happens gradually as more knowledge is slowly added. He would argue that these collections of unconscious assumptions (he would later label this an "episteme") in fact are not additive but replace one another.

&#x200B;

So I want to talk about three different epistemes before I get to Charles II. The first is what I would call traditional Western medicine, dating back to the ancients. Simplifying quite a bit, this is the idea that human health and disease is caused by balances and imbalances in the four constituent body fluids -- blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. These body fluids are directly affected by the natural environment. Food, weather, altitude, close contacts, the alignment of the stars and planets -- all could cause changes in humors, and therefore cause disease. These has some important underlying assumptions. For example, a human organism cannot be separated from its environment. Diseases are not unique entities, but have similar causes. Treatments need to be focused on "rebalance". The psychological and the physical are fundamentally interlinked. This is the context in which the tradition of anatomy emerged -- spreading from Vesalius to become an important part of both medical education and Western art. However, there's no sense that DISEASE can be determined from autopsy (or even variants within humans, which is very common).  Disease, after all, lies in the four humors, and the life-bringing pneuma, both of which are obscured by death.

&#x200B;

Starting in roughly the late 17th century, and dominating the 18th, you have the episteme of nosology. Think Sydenham, Cullen, Pinel. They rejected humoral explanations, which didn't line up with the observations they were making. Instead they reclassified human disease based on symptomology and similarity to one another. The big comparison is botany -- just like Linnaeus attempted to classify all life within a hierarchy, doctors did the same, carving out orders, classes, genus, and species (and they carved out a LOT of them). Anatomy by this time was widespread, both in medical education, and after death. The biggest example would be Morgagni, who started to notice that there were different changes after death in oragans associated with different disease states (Auenbrugger is in this tradition too, though he's most often associated with the next episteme).

&#x200B;

Which takes us to the third episteme -- that of pathological anatomy. I could go on forever about this, but essentially doctors started to realize that certain diseases had specific changes associated with tissue types -- and that what had been thought to be multiple diseases, might be just a single disease with multi-system effects. Think Bayle, Laennec (and Auenbrugger, even though he's writing in the 1760s -- an example of how this is more of a framework rather than a hard and fast rule). This episteme has largely survived to the present day, though with considerable modification -- Virchow readjusted to show that the CELL, rather than tissues, was the fundamental unit of disease, and germ theory gave an incredibly important etiologic factor, and the 20th and 21st century has revealed even smaller units, such as CML, caused by the BCR-ABL translocation.

&#x200B;

However, for the most part, our modern noslogy outside of psychiatry (these days the ICD-10) largely operates on these assumptions. And there are important assumptions. For example, close examination of the patient, in ways they cannot access, are now of extreme importance (back then this meant percussion and a stethoscope; now it means MRIs, PET scans, biopsies, &c). These has had important implications in removing patients from their own state of health. Disease is also now freed from the metaphysical (France no longer employs astrologers and meteorologists to track outbreaks, like in the Ancien Regime). It turns out that it's also a fairly effective way to target treatments, hence its dominance.

This is a question of obvious contemporary political importance so I will endeavor to answer it cautiously and with respect to the emotions it no doubt raises.

The logic here is best found in some of the signatory nations’ legal interpretations and internal Law of Armed Conflict manuals,[neatly summarized by the Red Cross here. ](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule75). The Dutch manual of 2005, for instance, tells us the following:

>Riot control agents such as tear gas may not be used as a method of warfare (Chemical Weapons Convention Article 1). Use as a means of maintaining order, including the control of internal unrest, is not prohibited. Military use must be distinguished from this. **This conceals the danger that the use of a relatively harmless chemical may unleash the use of some other, more lethal one by the adversary**...\[M\]ilitary use of a non-lethal weapon may pose the danger that the adversary perceives it as a forbidden means, which may induce the adversary to use other, more lethal means. One example is the use of tear gas, mentioned above.

Chemical weapons pose particular problems on the battlefield as weapons of mass destruction. In the case of tear gas and other riot control agents, which do not pose major concerns in terms of environmental persistence, excessive painfulness, persistence of pain after the victim is removed from exposure to the gas, and potential for permanent injury, the problem posed is one of *escalation.* Consider two armies locked in combat, let’s call them Red and Blue. Each side is a signatory to the same chemical weapons treaties, each side has a robust no-first-use policy, but each side has a stockpile of lethal chemical weapons including nerve agents as a deterrent to the enemy’s use of chemical weapons. Neither side adheres to the 1993 rule on riot agents. A low-level Blue commander, Major Indigo, is having a hell of a time getting a Red battalion off an important hill. Major Indigo requests permission to fire tear gas onto the hill to dislodge the Red forces. It’s an important hill, taking it could turn the tide of battle, and so his boss Colonel Cyan authorizes it. Meanwhile, the Red forces under Major Crimson are taking no chances. They’ve been sweating in their gas masks and chemical suits all day, just in case. The call comes down the line - *gas, gas, gas!* \- and Red’s soldiers hunker down nervously, safe but uneasy in their protective gear. None of them are exposed, so it’s hard to tell immediately just *what* chemical they got hit with. Major Crimson calls *his* boss, General Ruby. General Ruby knows **one** thing: when weapons of mass destruction are in play, you *have to* maintain the credibility of your deterrence. Blue has to be shown immediately that use of chemical weapons will not go unpunished. With staff academy lectures on “escalation dominance” echoing in the back of his mind, General Ruby signs the paperwork authorizing a limited but punishing chemical weapon retaliation. Three short-ranged ballistic missiles loaded with nerve gas are fired at Blue’s position. Colonel Cyan, Major Indigo and their subalterns die a horrific, gasping death. An hour later, as Blue’s *own* bombers and missiles loaded with mustard and VX begin to launch, the battlefield lab analysis lands on General Ruby’s desk. Just tear gas.

The above scenario seems perhaps melodramatic or overwrought, but it highlights the stakes involved with weapons of mass destruction and the *extreme* consequences of incomplete information. The presence of nonlethal chemical agents on the battlefield creates a risk far out of proportion to the actual severity of the weapons themselves.

As for sourcing, in addition to the link given above, my perspective on deterrence, escalation risks, and the consequences for uncautious behavior with WMDs is heavily informed by Larsen and Karchtner’s *On Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century* and the opinions on so-called “battlefield” nuclear weapons expressed by Michael Kofman in several of his CSIS presentations. These both do not directly connect to chemical weapons, but many of the concepts of deterrence are similar across categories of WMD; there is simply more literature on nuclear weapons than chemical.

EDIT FOR SOURCING: Savoy, Sagan, and Wirtz’s 2000 *Planning the Unthinkable: How New Powers Will Use Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons* was also at the back of my mind when I was chewing on this question.

OBLIGATORY MORNING-AFTER EDIT: Folks, please stop giving me gold. I appreciate the gesture, but giving money to reddit is probably the least useful thing you could be doing with that money. There are a massive number of nonprofits that need that money *far* more than reddit does.

The idea that a weapon would be banned in war but allowed domestically does come across as rather absurd. But like with many things, there is more nuance than might appear on the surface. 

Under the CWC tear gas falls into the category of "harassing agents" also known as Riot Control Agents or RCAs. During the long process that lead to the CWC RCAs were something that was subject to a fair bit of negotiation and debate. The main debate centered not so much around law enforcement, but on military use outside of warfare. For example when rescuing personnel from a downed aircraft when hostile civilians are present or dealing with hostile crowds at bases or embassies. There were countries that pushed for more strict bans or regulations, but the US took a hard line pushing for their use and even the modest restrictions in the CWC would be a sticking point in it's ratification in the Senate.

The final draft stated that “Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare." and contained a specific exemption for law enforcement. 

There were a few main justifications given for this discrepancy. 

The first is that in war things like tear gas are often used to increase effectiveness of other weapons i.e. a force multiplier. For example, you might use it to flush people out of a bunker so you can attack them. Or to force them into an area where they might be surrounded or encounter mines or other risks. This is, or ideally is, less of a concern when used domestically or in non-warfare situations. Dispersing a crowd is often an alternative to more lethal means, not an attempt to lead them into fire or harm. Without RCAs, the only option may be to use lethal force. 

RCA programs and delivery systems can also be used to cover for other chemical weapons. There is no easy way to tell if a projectile contains an RCA or a deadly gas or what a factory might be able to produce. This can lead to confusion or provide cover for more nefarious weapon development. If one combatant sees the other preparing chemical shells, they would have no way of knowing if it is tear gas or something like mustard gas. Warring parties are not exactly going to trust each other or assume the best.  In contexts outside of warfare this is less of a concern. 

The method of use is also much different. Law enforcement and non warfare use often involves small scale delivery systems. Even if they fell into the wrong hands, the harm they cause is limited. The use of RCAs in warfare often involves delivery systems that can spread it over a very wide area. A tear gas canister being fired into a crowd is going to cause some pain and discomfort, but people can generally get away to fresh air. A wide area weapon could blanket a city in gas giving people nowhere to go. Not allowing their use in warfare ideally would discourage the development of these systems. 

There is also concern that their use would lead to further escalation. This is basically what happened in WW1. The use of tear gas lead to more toxic gases and eventually to a horrific chemical arms race. This was despite a ban on poison gases in the 1899 Hague Convention. By banning all chemical weapons in war, the idea was to prevent such an escalation from beginning in the first place. Again, outside of warfare this is not really a concern.

In addition to the answer by /u/jon_beveryman, I can give you some insight into the legal history elements of your question. This is a particularly difficult question to answer from a purely historic perspective because although international law can be found in state practice, that's more often found in the form of footnotes in a textbook than it is in the form of a comprehensive historic account. 

The short answer is that chemical weapons violate the long-standing basic rules of warfare, and the prohibition on them needed to be total. If there was any room to use even tear gas, it risked eroding the prohibition on the use of chemical warfare. In addition, States jealously guard their sovereignty over domestic matters.

Your question crosses between international humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict), international disarmament law, and the principle of sovereignty. 

**International humanitarian law**

In IHL, we apply a set of basic principles including the principles of humanity, distinction, proportionality and military necessity. The key issue for your question is the principle of distinction, but we should consider it alongside the principle of ~~proportionality~~ *military necessity*.

Distinction is one of the most important concepts for your question. It is the principle that civilians cannot and must not be the intentional target of attacks. This principle is [extraordinarily well established in historic State Practice](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule1), and was expressed as early as the St Petersburg Declaration in 1868. The principle is often violated, but is almost universally affirmed by States and was at the core of the drafting of the Geneva Conventions after WW2. At a basic level, the principle recognises that there is nothing to gain and everything to lose from attacking civilians and other non-combatants. 

Military necessity is the principle that you should only take actions that are necessary to achieve a military objective. In particular, if an action will harm civilian populations that harm must be proportionate to the military advantage it gains. This principle also gives us the rule prohibiting weapons which cause unnecessary suffering and superfluous injury.

**Superfluous injury, unnecessary suffering, chemical weapons and disarmament law**

[The prohibition on weapons designed to cause nothing but suffering is well established in the history of State practice, and also can be seen as early as 1868 in the St Petersburg Declaration](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule70). That declaration prohibited the use of expanding bullets in warfare (directly relevant to your question, since those are also allowed for domestic law enforcement). The prohibition was on the basis that their sole purpose, during a war, is to make injuries harder to treat. Chemical weapons are the same: they're honestly a pretty awful weapon in war. You can't control where they blow in the wind, they risk leaving toxic remnants behind (or worse still, poisoning your own soldiers), and some of them are more likely to disable than they are to kill. Most importantly, they cannot distinguish between civilians and combatants in any meaningful way. Their sole use case is intimidation. 

Asphyxiating gases were first prohibited in 1899, and after the use of chemical weapons in WW1 Germany was explicitly banned from their production or use by article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1925, States more broadly prohibited their use in the Geneva Gas Protocol. [On the whole, the consistent historic practice of most States establishes this as a rule of customary international law](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule74)

After World War 2, the establishment of the UN also brought with it a push for international disarmament. For the UN system to achieve its fundamental purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, there was a need to pursue general disarmament. As you can probably imagine, this idea is enormously slow-moving (if moving at all), and the most meaningful progress in the disarmament conferences has been made on weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons included. The CWC was concluded in 1992 at the end of the cold war, but it took 17 years of negotiation to end up with the treaty we have today.
 
**Law enforcement**

The CWC expressly excludes law enforcement using certain chemical agents from its scope (article 2(9)(d)). 

During the CWC negotiations, most States agreed that riot control agents should be banned during armed conflict. There was a very real concern that if even something as comparatively innocuous as tear gas was used during a war, it could lead to States attempting to push boundaries by asserting that their chemical weapons weren't technically chemical weapons, undermining the purpose of the Convention. The prohibition on chemical weapons in warfare had to be absolute, or it might as well not exist.

That said, a ban on the use of tear gas domestically was simply never on the negotiating table. The closest I can find in the negotiation commentaries is that Germany, Switzerland, the UK and the Netherlands, among others, supported a proposal to prohibit the domestic use of incapacitating chemical agents by law enforcement. This would have limited States to only using riot control agents (i.e. tear gas) in law enforcement.  That proposal was never voted on, but probably reflects the state of the law today.

So why was the use of tear gas by law enforcement excluded? The simple answer is that this was a disarmament treaty, not a treaty regulating domestic law enforcement, and that outside of an armed conflict the risk of confusion between lethal and non or less-lethal chemical agents isn't so serious. The contextual framework surrounding their use is different, and this was recognised throughout the negotiation of the CWC. This is the same as for expanding bullets, which are banned in war because they cause superfluous harm and can be hard to differentiate until one is fired, but permitted in law enforcement because that consideration isn't relevant and they have decent stopping power. 

In addition, domestic non-interference (as an element of sovereignty) is presently and historically of great importance to States and enshrined in the UN Charter. States have considerable leeway in how they organise their internal affairs.

That's not to say there aren't rules concerning when and how tear gas can be used domestically that we can take from the CWC – there definitely are – but those rules fall outside of a historic analysis and into the realm of treaty interpretation. 

I hope that somewhat answers your question: basically, it's not a matter of being too bad for war. It's that the risks associated with the use of *any* chemical in warfare are so severe that the drafters of the CWC decided to ban their use as a weapon entirely, rather than to create a grey area that would encourage creative interpretation of the law.

"The Chemical Weapons Convention: A Commentary" edited By: Walter Krutzsch, Eric Myjer, Ralf Trapp
You are referring to Article 1 paragraph 5 \[1\].

The answer is in The Projected Chemical Weapons Convention: A Guide to the Negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament \[2\]. Essentially it was a compromise to ensure that less-than-lethal effects were permitted to conduct internal civil control actions while maintaining adherence to the CWC.

It's helpful to keep in mind the context of these conventions, they are written as a committee by the states they will apply too. It is therefore in their best interests to ensure that they don't remove their ability to maintain effective control over their interests. In this situation we can clearly see the thought process in the quote below. The states in negotiation didn't want to reduce their ability to conduct harassing and control actions internally. 

>Irritants and herbicides are widely used for domestic purposes (e.g. riot control and agriculture). Consequently, questions such as whether to ban the use of these substances altogether or whether to prohibit their use for war purposes only, and how to include such a ban in the treaty without affecting their peaceful domestic use, have to be solved. If irritants and herbicides were covered by the definition of CW, the unconditional ban on the use of CW (not only in war) as contained in Article I of the rolling text would prohibit their employment altogether. Most delegations do not consider this a practical solution. Therefore, these chemicals may have to be handled outside the definition of CW, or the ban on use of  CW as contained in Article I may have to be modified to make the permitted use (however defined) of these substances possible.\[2\]

This was at odds to the desire to eliminate chemical warfare as even less-than-lethal chemicals could have longer term effects, and change the strategic risk profiles, as indicated below.

>It has also been argued that the use of irritants and herbicides in war might lead to the use of other chemicals and therefore to an escalation of chemical warfare. In addition, the massive use of herbicides can have long term effects on human health and the environment as the Indochina case may have shown. \[2\]

As a result:

>The use of irritants or herbicides would therefore be prohibited unless the quantities involved were strictly limited and justified for purposes permitted by the CWC. Riot control, for example, is to be explicitly permitted by a provision included in Article II of the rolling text\[2\]

This determination did not result in a free for all though. Restrictions and further agreements were established to ensure that signatory states could monitor and approve of harassing agents and irritants.

>Proposals have also been made to deal with irritants used for law enforcement and riot control purposes, and chemicals to enhance the effectiveness of chemical weapons.   
>  
>(a) It was proposed that irritants could be handled outside the definition of chemical weapons if this would result in better definition. It was also proposed that the term chemical weapon apply not to chemicals which are not "super-toxic lethal" or "other lethal" (as defined in the Annex on Chemicals) and which have been approved by the "Conference of the States Parties" (a body of the international organization to be established under the treaty) for use by a party for domestic law enforcement and riot control purposes. This would exclude approved irritants from the definition of CW, and therefore from the ban on use as provided for in Article I of the rolling text. \[2\]

For context I have a Masters in Military Technology Management and specialise in Artillery Systems. This is a bit out of my field but chemical weapons are strongly associated. I also apologise for my writing style, I haven't written academically for years, instead I've been writing briefs so my stile is more conversational than it should be.

I think is also a political science question, which is more of my area of knowledge - so I will answer from that perspective instead.

Also, I noticed many typos on re-read, sorry for fat thumbs :(

International law is inherently beholden to the willingness of individual member states to participate in it. Therefore most agreements do not strongly concern domestic affairs, and those that do are not often ratified or participated in by the United States. The US is however eager to participate in agreements concerning instruments of war specifically because it wishes to restrict other nations from using those weapons against it (and is capable of enforcing those demands militarily). The restrictions on chemical warfare especially have a long-standing history of restriction, going back to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.

The CWC built upon this precedent (and several other landmark agreements in the roughly century thereafter), and came to be specifically as a result of several high profile incidents especially in Iraqi Kurdistan including the 1988 Anfal Genocide where as many as 500,00 Kurds were killed. In 1991, immediately before the Convention was first prepared, chemical weapons were also claimed to have been used against Kurds while the U.S. was criticized for it's non-intervention in a series of devastating popular uprisings across Iraq. The CWC played a role in helping to efface the US' public condemnation over its lack of action in Iraq.

Why didn't the treaty concern riot control? From the United States' perspective, why would it?

Pragmatically, the US - a few other obstinate nations, especially the ones you would expect like Russia, the UK, China and Israel - are wont to ratify international law which encroaches on domestic affairs. The Rome Statue, for example, which concerns the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and is meant to be the judicial body responsible for the prosecution of war criminals, has not been ratified by the US or Israel. The International Convenants on Civil & Political (ICCPR), and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) have either been ratified with significant exceptions or signed but not ratified, respectively, by the United States. Even when there are disputed between nations not concerning domestic affairs, which are settled at the International Court of Justice, the U.S. has unilaterally rejected the jurisdictional authority of the international body on repeated occasions (which is codified as an allowable option in determining jurisdictiom in the Articles of the ICJ).

At the same general time period the United States was experiencing the tail-end of the 'crack epidemic' and its associated police violence, including the riots and corresponding crackdown in Los Angeles in 1992 as a result of the acquittal of the murderers of Rodney King. Many more can and have written at length about the history of abusive tactics as tools for the subjugation of black people and people of colo, including the pinned post on this sub.

In short, the United States would *never* ratify an agreement that allowed its domestic actions to be governed by international jurisprudence. However, the CWC was advanced specifically as an instrument of strengthening the US' moral and political position against Saddam Hussein. There is so much more history to get into that I am only partially equipped to explain so I will leave it to others.

I will add, however generally, that the rationale behind this is evident from a realpolitik perspective. Nation-states wish to the utilize the power of international bodies in favorable ways while minimizing their encroachment on sovereign action - and nations more able to project their economic and military influence are more impactful in the enforcement of international law insofar as it is inherently participatory and therefore contingent on the strength of its respective members.

While international bodies often play a very valuable role in domestic affairs - through, for example, UNESCO or UNRWA - that role is often extremely limited in the application of international law. Typically it is only applied to domestic affairs when: (1) All parties have consented to the international body's review; (2) The International body is able to enforce itself as a result of a military conflict (e.g. the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia). As a result, many theoretical agreements targeting domestic affairs are simply not enforceable and therefore not proposed, signed, or ratified.

Another way to say it is that the United States' government wanted to preserve the full range of internal suppression options available to it without subjecting it's choices to the approval and evaluation of an external body.

Stephen Krasner's On Sovereignty is a great read though outdated for modern events

Edit: I wrote this very late last night and realized I need to add a few qualifiers:

(1) I wrote specifically about the US because of its relationship with Iraq and it's specific relevance to today. But this risks overstating the US' role in the creation and enforcement of international law -- many agreements, including the ones I mention in this post -- have been enforced to various degrees of efficacy in outcomes even when the US has opted not to participate.

(2) I had originally written a long definition of Sovereignty as my post and then deleted it, but conceptually it's really important, because it extends to the thinking of nearly all national actors in the international arena. What I mean by "from the US perspective, why would it?" could be extrapolated more generally -- another commenter put it best, "the CWC was effectively a disarmament treaty" -- and if I speak about it precisely from the perspective of one state then we risk *uniquely* moralizing the decision to exempt domestic action from international review as the choice of a single "bad/immoral" government. Principally, the concept of the sovereign / sovereignty is the underpinning of international bodies and law and is not inherently associated with a "good/ethical" state or an "immoral/corrupt" state -- it just a globally accepted principle that facilitates international action, and the determination of whether or not a state contributes or harms global peace / the advancement of human rights / etc is not intrinsically related to their respect or disrespect for the sovereignty principle.
I have a follow up question:

Is the use of tear gas and similar nonlethal agents allowed by military police?

On the one hand, they are a police force and thus might have legitimate allowance for tear gas in riot control etc. On the other, they are a military force and might be expected to be bound under the CWC. 

Does it depend on country?

Thank you!
First off, I'm not sure if your exact premise based on sitcoms quite pans out. There *is* some noticeable change in family dynamics in sitcoms starting in 1970 and going through 1990, but it's not as simple as mutual spousal animosity. I trudged through
a number of lists and came up with prominent 80s sitcoms with married
couples:

The Cosby Show (84-92)

Family Ties (82-89)

Diff'rent Strokes (78-86)

Webster (83-89)

ALF (86-90)

Small Wonder (85-89)

Out of This World (87-91)

None of these seem to be premised around parents that loathe each other.
Two of them involve aliens (ALF and Out of This World) and one
involves a robot (Small Wonder).

Maybe you're thinking of Married... with Children, which
ran from 1987 to 1997, so perhaps counts as 80s? Or The
Simpsons which started in 1989 so *just touched* the 80s, but
I don't think anyone would describe as a 1980s show? (We'll get back to both of those.) Or if you're shooting for deep
cuts, Unhappily Ever After, which Ron Leavitt (who co-created Married...
with Children) worked on, but that's not way out until 1995 to 1999? Or Family Guy, which started in 1999, so starting a year before Malcolm and the Middle?

If you're going back in time, maybe you mean All in the Family (1971-1979),
featuring bigoted father Archie Bunker. In one of the most famous episodes, Edith's Problem, Edith goes through menopause.

>Mike Stivic [son-in-law of Archie]: What did the doctor say?

>Archie Bunker: He just said that menopause is a pretty tough time to be going through; especially for nervous types.

>Mike Stivic: So?

>Archie Bunker: So he prescribed these here pills.

>Mike Stivic: Oh, good.

>Archie Bunker: I gotta take three of 'em a day.

Archie is certainly insensitive (and can't handle Edith's problem interfering with a trip to Florida) but it still doesn't quite match the "boomers hate their wife" thing you're going for. (And menopause in 1972 would likely indicate someone from the "Greatest Generation" -- boomers are two generations away.) While All in the Family's massive success (Archie was called "the most expensive racist on television") led to something of a television revolution, it was more in the framing of complex themes (like *Maude*, an *All in the Family* spinoff) as opposed to simply including more aggressive characters.

So, let's reformulate the question to something that might give a satisfying answer:

**Did the family dynamics depicted in sitcoms deteriorate between 1950 and 1990, and does this reflect what happened to US culture at large?**

This ends up hitting close to what I think the original question meant, and there's a fair amount of literature about it. Of course, one argument is what "deteriorate" means. On the more "conservative" end, Popenoe wrote in length during the 1990s about how

>Recent family decline is more serious than any decline in the past because what is breaking up is the nuclear family . . .

and traced this same decline across various sitcoms. Other media theorists in the "deteriorate" camp are Buck, Fields, and Hoffman. However, some from the 1990s simply argued that there was a simple change in family structure and diversity, like Cantor and Moore.

The "diversity" part certainly is true -- while the 1950s families were nearly all "intact" (the "nuclear" form Popenoe wanted) that's not the case by the late 80s; here's a list of "intact" vs. "non-intact" vs. "mixed" families for television shows shown the week of March 9-15 in 1987:

**Intact**: Cosby Show, Family Ties, Growing Pains, 227, Newhart, Webster, Jack & Mike

**Nonintact**: Who's the Boss, Kate & Allie, Carvanaughs, My Sister Sam, Sidekicks, Nothing Easy, Rags to Riches, Our House, Starman

**Mixed**: Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, Knot's Landing, Colby's

(Incidentally, The first time a divorced woman was on television was 1962 -- *The Lucy Show*, with Lucy Carmichael -- a widow -- sharing a house with Vivian Bagley, a divorced mother. Lucy Carmichael was played by Lucielle Ball of *I Love Lucy* and Vivian Bagley was played by Vivian Vance, who was Ethel Mertz on *I Love Lucy*. This doesn't mean every single family was "nuclear"; the show *Bachelor Father*, with a premise right in the title, ran from 1957-1962.)

What the question is really asking about, though, is negative interaction between spouses. To make the question easier I'll consider family interactions in general. A mammoth 1980 study analyzed three seasons of television (75-76, 76-77, 77-78) and counted interactions that

"go against" (attack, oppose, ignore)

"go away" (evade, withdraw)

"go toward" (offer information, seek information, contribute, support, show concern, petition, direct, accept support, accept direction)

The first two categories (essentially, what I'll call the "negative" ones) had 13% to 16% of interactions, while the remainder fell into the "go toward" category, the majority being in "offers information" (35% to 37%).

A 1992 study used the exact same categories, with the 1989-1990 season. This time things were broken down by show; the negative percentages again:

>Cosby Show: 16%

>Full House: 10%

>Growing Pains: 33%

>Married with Children: 37%

>Simpsons: 20.7%

Note that the fairly "traditional" shows were in line with the mid-1970s, but Growing Pains and Married with Children raise the conflict significantly. However, this can simply indicate more drama and variation. Notably, the sitcoms still followed the "everything resolves" model -- as Cantor concludes in a paper:

>If we watch the news, the game shows, and adventure programs on television, we know there
is a greedy, hostile, violent world out there. But the domestic dramas present a different message. Here
human virtues prevail. While we may not be able to have an impact on political or economic conditions,
in the family, through love and sensitivity solutions of conflicts are still possible, and the world is
still manageable.
Gosh, what a great question! It's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)

Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.

What's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.

At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt). 

At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. That would come later.

It's also important to remember that the June break-in — for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon's backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**

But that doesn't get to your key question: "What were the burglars after?"

There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and "The Aviator" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by "60 Minutes,"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at Nixon's Key Biscayne home.

[E. Howard Hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gJQAh80uFV_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.

“What we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *Herald*. “That was the rationale for going in there. We’d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. It didn’t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. But you know, I didn’t have skilled people.”

In 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring. 

Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.

[Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799. 

Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of "dirty tricks" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up. 

That's something worth remembering.
[removed]

It probably helps to split the question up: Why would the Nixon team do *something like that* and why would they do *exactly that*? 

------------

The first question isn't that difficult to answer when you look at the operations that immediately before that. There was the break-in into the office of Daniel Ellsbergs psychiatrist, the attempt to dig up (more) dirt on the
Chappaquidick incident, the forged Diem cables to further damage the Kennedy government and more *dirty tricks*. 

That was driven by two factors: a) the belief that the democrats were playing as dirty as they were and that such tricks had cost Nixon the presidency in 1960 and b) the general conviction that *looks* mattered more *issues* when it came to politics. There are many examples for both points on the Watergate tapes. Nixon was convinced that the Democrats had bugged his campaign in 1960 and employed Ex-FBI agents to sweep his hotel rooms and offices when he ran in 1968. And there are many quotes by Bob Haldemann, Nixons Chief of Staff and Ex-advertisment executive that show how focused the White House was with      the public opinion:

*We failed to move on to the PR stage. We should have been able to make the PR case, at least, even though we couldn’t carry the legal case. [...] We need a strong offense. The question is – can we sell it [...]. Our whole concern now  must be the public aspects of this. The morality issue is moot because the papers are already out.*

(Haldemann Action Paper: The New York Times Papers. June 15, 1971, in: Bruce Oudes: From the President. Richard Nixon's secret files. New York 1990, 271.)

The explanation that the Watergate break-in was in character for the Nixon administration is probably not very *sexy* argument, but it is the approach to understand it. Nixon and his closest advisers fostered a siege mentality in the White House and sincerely believed that it was *them* vs the *corrupt Eastern establishment.* This deep mistrust to the established institutions led directly to the absurd secrecy and clandestine projects that brought his administration down.

-----------------

Now, why did they target the Watergate and the DNC? That's way more difficult to answer. There are tons of stupid conspiracy theories about this. One says that the wife of Nixon advisor John Dean had been working as an escort. Larry O'Brian, the DNC chairman had evidence of that in his files, so John Dean ordered the break-in to get these photos. There's no good evidence for that and all those other theories that say the Nixon team was searching for some specific informations in O'Brian's files: Evidence of bribes to Nixon from Howard Hughes, explosive information concerning the Kennedy assassination, ...

Here, again, the best explanation is rather boring: Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy went (kinda) rogue and organized the break-in on their own. It's like the assassination of Thomas Becket: *Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?*

Hunt and Liddy were hired because the White House was very dissatisfied by the recent work of the FBI. Hoover was old and ailing, and the FBI saw itself as a weapon against communist agents and traitors; most of its agents didn't care or understood the political infighting in Washington.

Nixon repeatedly railed against disloyal government employees and officials that had been appointed by the JFK and LBJ administrations. The antiwar movement was undermining the government, the media was completely controlled by these forces, and the FBI was just worried about foreign agents directly controlled by Moscow. Gordon Liddy wrote several memos that directly attack the wrong focus of Hoover and the FBI:

*Today it is the Ellsbergs in sensitive positions in Government we must contend with. The past 15-20 years have witnessed the evolution of a new breed of fanatics.*

(Memorandum Re: Organizational Survey, July 23, 1971, in: WHSF-SMOF: David Young, Box 13, Folder: Office Chron File of G. Gordon Libby, RNPL)

The Nixon administration had tried to integrate the FBI in the White House (the infamous *Huston Plan*) but Hoover had prevented that and kept the Bureau independent. So Nixon's advisers created their own team for *domestic intelligence operations*, the *Plumbers*. One of their founding members, Egil Krogh, wrote later:

*Liddy’s report to us about [the] deficiency [of the FBI] was an important factor in the self-help mentality that then began to emerge in the unit. Rather than questioning the Bureau’s lack of support, we resolved to go forward on our own with this investigation.*

(Egil Krogh: Integrity. Good People, Bad Choices, and Life Lessons from the White House. New York 2007.)

This *self-help mentality* is important to understand the actions of the Plumbers. 

I think it's save to say that Nixon didn't know about the break-in and hadn't ordered it. Hunt and Liddy hadn't thought the operation through, there was no direct goal and specific plan to follow. It was born out of the general belief that *something* had to be done. That the upcoming election was looking bright wasn't the point: Nixon and his advisers worked under the perception that the general public, the political establishment and the officials in Washington were against them. You can't govern efficiently under these conditions, which the next election won't change. So you gotta help yourself.

Nixon didn't knew about the Ellsberg break-in beforehand, but approved it afterwards. The general goal was to find evidence that would damage Ellsbergs reputation in the public. But the Plumbers found nothing, because psychiatrist usually don't keep their notes in these office files. The whole burglary was poorly planed, so-so executed, and yieled absolutly nothing of value at all. It was done by the same personal that a couple of weeks later got caught inside the Watergate, so it's probably save to draw a few conclusions from that.

Several people (Haldemann, Ehrlichman, Coulson) wrote in their memoirs that they pretty quickly recognized Watergate as the foolish third rate burglary that it was. I think that's written with the benefit of hindsight. Would they've come to the same conclusion if Liddy and Hunt didn't get caught? I don't think so. Watergate was too much in character for the Nixon administration. Limited upside, a lack of clear goal and not fully thought through plans hadn't stopped their other operations either.

If you've come to the thread and are wondering why there's no answer yet, [we have found](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/) that it takes an average of 9 hours for a good answer to appear on a popular thread - properly researching and writing an answer takes time. Additionally, it's midnight on the East Coast of the US right now, which means that plenty of the historians interested in this topic might already be asleep and it may take longer. Please be patient! If you want to be reminded of this thread in 24 hours, [please see here for information on how to send a private message to RemindMeBot](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/) to remind you about this thread.

If you're wondering what's in the 135 (!) removed comments at the time of writing, the huge majority of it is variations on 'Where all the comments at' or 'Nixon was really paranoid, of course he'd do that kind of thing' or 'I'm not a historian but I remember my teacher saying...'.

All of these comments get removed on /r/AskHistorians because the huge majority of our subscribers really do want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources - the kind of thing that an actual historian might write. It's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers (if you see it, report it!) 

Please see [our subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) for more information on how to write an answer up to our standards. On /r/AskHistorians, we want people answering questions to be able to explain not just what the basic facts are, [but why we know that these basic facts are right, and to put those basic facts into context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). This is why we encourage [the use of primary and secondary sources in answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), rather than tertiary sources like Wikipedia, podcasts and textbooks.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By removing the short, quick, bad answers that would otherwise crowd them out, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen ([see this graph for more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/#)). The downside to this is that we have to remove a lot of shitposts and comments wondering what happened to the removed comments. The upside is that our contributors consistently post amazing stuff to /r/AskHistorians (which we collate the best of every week in our [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)).

Best that I can find, there wasn't much call for this. A *little*, which I'll touch on, but it seems to have been quite muted. Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to /u/ducatimechanic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8w6pie/the_statue_of_liberty_is_now_green_but_it_used_to/e1u0s6v/), this is a [guide](https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif) to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, *important* that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the '80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop. 

Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn't until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting. 

Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue's arrival, decried this, but it doesn't seem to be about the color. As already noted, the patina plays an important role in preservation, and the only articles I could find from the time which makes reference to any calls to strip the patina are focused on explaining why it would be a bad idea! There were *some* people saying it should happen, but one author, writing in 1910, makes it fairly clear it was a proposal that was ignored:

>The patina is the rust on bronze, which, however, does not, like the rust on iron, corrode the metal. It is green in color, the exact shade depending on the amount of alloy used with the copper to form the bronze. It is formed by the statue gathering from the atmosphere carbon and sulpher, and in the formation of nitrate copper crystals on the surface.

>"In the case of the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe's Island" said Mr. [Gutzon] Borglum, "the continuous washing of the wain and the spray keeps it clean. I should have gone to Washington, if necessary, if the proposal to take away its patina had been likely to be adopted a year or so ago. People said then that it was eating into the metal, and that in certain placed the bronze was rent away. All I can say is, if there are any thin places they are the result of flaws in the original casting."

So again, as this suggests, there was clearly *some people* calling for the patina to be stripped, but from the start, experts were making clear that it was not needed, and a bad idea. An earlier article, from 1903, is even further in praise of the green, noting that of burgeoning hue at that point:

>Kindly nature has been spinning for her a fine cobwebby outer raiment or verdanlique, deeper in one place, lighter in another. Snows and stinging hail, fogs and rainstorms have been gently removing the repulsive newness of her bronze and streaking cheek and uplifted arm, draperies and crown with tender shades or green such as the cleverest bronze rounders try to produce with chemicals on their new 'castings, but never quite succeed in simulating.

The author further warns against any voices which might "*shriek wildly for scrubbing brush and Putz-powder"*, not just for the writer's aesthetic tastes, but also again for the protective covering the patina offers. The editorial also calls for the appointment of a 'keeper of public monuments', specifically to ensure ignorance doesn't result in the destruction of monuments, not just 'Lady Liberty', a position which seems to have at least somewhat come about by 1910, as that seems to be the role Gutzon Borglum was assisting in by then. Additionally, as before, this suggests the existence of those who desired a de-greening, but again that despite their existence, it was a call which experts pushed back against.

One related thing I did find, which I would also make mention of, was a call not for a stripping down to the natural copper color, but instead to paint it! An article in 1906 makes mention of such a proposal, and again the author instead favors the "marvelous harmony of blended colors" from the "varying shades of light green, delicate white, and a subtle dash of yellow" which by that point have almost entirely overtaken the bronzed hues. The proposal had been written up in several papers, but at least as presented in this article, but was clearly not in an advanced stage of planning. Capt. George Burnell, in command on the island for the War Department, mentioned to the author the "bushels of letters", almost all of which were aghast at the proposal - which additionally helps to point to the acceptance of the green quite quickly - and additionally talks to copper experts who find the idea not only unnecessary, but quite ludicrous. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original announcement, but it is certainly clear enough that it all came to naught.

Anyways though, to continue with this more general over view of restoration, during the Wilson Administration, a Public-Private partnership with the *World* newspaper saw another $30,000 from the government, but again, it was a one time expenditure, and this time for installing flood-lights. Lights which, lacking maintenance funds, had mostly ceased working by 1930.

This funding morass continued through the 1930s, when it finally was moved to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, as part of a larger push under the FDR administration, in step with the New Deal, to give 'Lady Liberty' her due as a symbol of the country. Unable to get the funds solely on its own, between 1937 and 1941 the NPS worked in conjunction with the PWA and WPA to give the statue its first real overhaul, a $1.5 million dollar makeover which involved clearing the entire island of buildings to start fresh, building a seawall, a new dock, walkways, and most importantly much needed maintenance of the internal iron structure - although not quite extensive enough - which was becoming quite rusted at points, thanks to the salty seawater surrounding it. Much was done, but of course the outbreak of war in late 1941 brought it to a halt. Work would resume again in 1946 to wrap up work unfinished in '41, but over the next decade or so, the real focus with funding was on the creation of an American Museum of Immigration, which would eventually open in 1972 after a long and fraught 'battle'.

By 1981, even the work done by the NPS decades earlier was showing its age, and spurred by an analysis by French architects, a renewed focus on a *thorough* overhaul of the statue, especially in light of the upcoming centennial, began to be planned, perhaps most famously with American Express donating a penny for every purchase made with their card to the endeavor, resulting in $1.7 million dollars. Closed to the public in 1984 for the work - and as noted above, careful not to disturb the green! - the work was completed in time for the "Liberty Weekend" centennial celebration in 1986, with President Reagan turning on the floodlights the night of July 3rd, and the statue officially reopened on the 5th.

Edit 2: Unfortunately it has to be pointed out, but **there is nothing wrong, historically, with the premise of the question here**. This is a question about history, not the 2018 election. Responses that try to discuss modern politics will be removed, and we are not feeling particularly stingy with our ban-hammers either, as we are putting this **blanket warning** here. There have been many examples of anti-immigration campaigns throughout American history, such as the Know-Nothings and other Nativist groups of the mid-1800s, anti-Italian sentiments at the turn of the century, or the anti-Irish/'Catholic' movements that sadly spanned both periods.

Edit: Cause you're of course wondering, and I have a few minutes, what has been removed so far?

Of the 8 top-level comments removed when I posted this, 7 were at most 4 sentences long - not that that means they were correct in any case, such as the one that still fit in "can't remember exactly" twice. The 8th, and longest, removed comment still only clocked in at 8 sentences, and was certainly far too vague and imprecise to be close to the standards that we expect here, as the evolution of this theme in American society is *not* one that can be summarized so briefly. 
I cannot answer your first question, but I can provide insights on the second.

The idea that America was built on multiculturalism appeared very early. By the 1780s, the term "melting together" was a widespread metaphor in use that was meant to positively portray incoming immigrants. Of course, America had just ousted a foreign power from their backs, so nationalism was running high.  Hamilton, an immigrant from  Nevis, argued vehemently against immigration, arguing that immigrants brought pro-monarchy and ethnic views that would undermine their new, fragile country. He also argued that America's bountiful resources and exploding population meant that America didn't need to rely on newcomers. From the Hamilton Papers,  Examination Number VIII, Jan 12th, 1802:

*In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement.*

At first, the two dominant parties of the time (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) mostly agreed on keeping out immigrants. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his *Notes on the State of Virginia* in 1781 that foreigners would be anti-Democracy. However, by the turn of the 19th century, the Democratic-Republicans viewed pro-immigration policies as a great way to undermine the Federalists.

See, Hamilton and the Federalists were afraid of the French, who were at the time being led by Napoleon after the bloody French Revolution. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans pursued pro-French policy—and more proactive foreign relations with other countries—which included immigration. Jefferson saw immigrants as future voters for the Democratic-Republican party. As with many of these social issues, divisions in public opinion came from the very top, so voters tended to side with their party's views. So pro-immigration stances tended to saturate more educated Democratic-Republicans. The election of 1800 was a particularly nasty affair, as the battle lines between both sides slung serious vitriol to get their candidates elected. John Adams, the Federalist incumbent, faced off a challenge against Jefferson. Adams was pro-class and cultural hierarchy, while Jefferson wanted to model the country's Democracy on the new post-revolution French model.

It should be pointed out that both Adams and Jefferson saw the 1800 election as a fight over America's soul—that the election would set in stone the standards for how America would treat the subject of immigration for the rest of time. Jefferson would later write: *The revolution of 1800... was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form.*

Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies would use the melting together metaphor extensively in their campaigning, making 1800 probably the biggest pivot on pro-immigrant sentiment for the general public as self-identified D-R party members adopted Jefferson's messages.

Finally, the D-R party wasn't free from bias, and fought internally (and extensively) over what type of immigration was considered acceptable by them:

*The meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation of the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: 'Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, Mayflower descendants and Sicilians, Ashkenazi and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?* (Baofu, 21-22)

The term "melting together," and other various close iterations of the same idea, was solidified in the public's vernacular as "melting pot" in 1908, when the play *The Melting Pot* by Israel Zangwill was released and became popular.

Edit: Thank you for correctly pointing out that Hamilton was from  Nevis, not Puerto Rico.

Follow-up question: at the time of the American Revolution, was there a social distinction between *recent* immigrants to the colonies compared to those having been there much longer (say, descendants of early Virginia Company or Plymouth/Massachusetts Bay Colony settlers)? In other words, was there a distinction between "locals" and "the British"?
The earliest exclusion and laws that occurred were focused mainly on the Chinese in the form of the Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850.  The rise of this was due to the post gold rush economy.   

Many of California's new gold rush prospectors arrived to find out there wasn't much in the way left for them to make their fortunes.  So while the first arrivals didn't mind the Chinese when there was enough gold to go around for everyone--when it started to run dry, the resentment began to build.  The Miners Tax ended up failing and led to the dying of Chinese gold camps which led to an influx of low cost Chinese laborers in cities.  

California Governor John Bigler saw political value in attacking the “coolie” laborers and reinstated the failed tax.  The term "coolie" was supposed to imply these were low skilled and low wage slave laborers who are taking American jobs for their "master" back in China but these people were actually free.  The word itself comes from two Chinese words, “koo” meaning to rent, and “lee” meaning muscle.

This was a tough economic period in part due to the discovery of Australian gold.  In 1854 the California Supreme Court declared that the 1850 statute prohibiting Negroes and Indians from testifying for or against a White person applied also to Chinese for the reason that in the days of Columbus all of the countries washed by Chinese waters had been called “Indian.”

Most of the Chinese came on an arrangement similar to some of the first settlers where they pay back the trip fees plus interest with the wages from their first job.  Unfortunately, this led to many of them not being able to afford to bring their wives and created an enormous prostitution industry for Asian women and comments by Americans heroes like this.  

>While this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil--the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.

Ulysses S. Grant 

The Page Act of 1875  was the first federal anti immigration law that intended to ban all "Coolie labor".  Only the restrictions on female Asians were heavily enforced. 

Things got economically bad after 1877 and led to Chinese establishments being sacked and burned and Chinese being shot and hung.  They saw that the Chinese had monopolized multiple manual labor industries like laundry, construction and landscaping for wages they couldn't beat and reacted poorly.  

In 1882 the government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act that banned all Chinese immigration for ten years. 

One of the common themes of these acts and laws that were passed is economic climate.  In harsher times people seemed far more likely to lash out at those deemed different enough.

In the next two decades and in the early 1900's we started to see more of a rise of anti immigration sentiment towards southern and eastern European groups like the Catholics (Irish, Polish, Italians) as well as Jewish people though it would continue to increase after the great depression and around WW2.

That's when the fun happened and their white neighbors lost their minds at the sight of white babies adopted by Mexican-Americans.

The answer to the question is very related to the follow up question from u/JustZisGuy. No, not all immigrants were the same, and there were lots of tension between immigrants from different countries, different times, different classes, and different religions.


America didn’t really start off as an Immigrant country. The first colonies that were formed at Virginia and Massachusetts were formed in 1607 and 1620 respectively. Given that the modern-day USA was born in 1776, that’s 156 years of life in the continent, and enough for your grandchildren to naturalize in any country by today’s standards. Even by 1770 when Massachusetts was declared under martial law instead of more lenient taxing, most of the colonial leaders hoped to “reconcile with the British Government” rather than declare independence. By this time, the colonists weren’t colonists or immigrants anymore, but the people who were born on the east coast who built this country from almost scratch, including all the good and bad things that has happened.


These original colonists didn’t come here for no reason at all though. Catholicism was restricting freedoms throughout Europe and some immigrants came to escape this religious persecution to practice Puritanism (This is a completely different subject that requires a different research). Most of them came as indentured servants, slaves for pay for a predetermined amount of time, because the price to sail was too steep. These servants ranged from white Europeans to black West Africans. By the time of the Civil War, there were a continuous influx of people from across the Atlantic to the states, which all came either as slaves or indentured servants from all walks of life. 


All the way until the declaration of independence and the civil war, the US was known in the world as a place with “class mobility”, where you can work your way into the upper class and become rich and elite. The US promised freedom to practice your own religion, your own language. The colonial Pennsylvania is a good example of how it’s founder, William Penn envisioned a utopian society where diversity would beget tolerance. 


Migration was a part of the colonial American life. Americans themselves migrated every 10 years to different colonies, including people like Bejamin Franklin, so up until the beginning of the 18th century, immigration was considered a part of American life, and even the naturalized born and raised Americans were migrating. As the number of people who came to America on their own slowly diminished, and the slaves and indentured workers were transported accordingly, the states delved into more important matters, like declaring independence and fighting for it, and the age of colonialism in North America came to an end as a baby nation with all the turmoils of making one arose in its stead, full of Protestant and Puritans who were promised liberty and riches, but received varying levels of these promises. These people were in a time where immigration didn’t have the connotations it had today. An immigrant was a self-made man who fought for what he wanted and didn’t take no for an answer. An immigrant was an opportunist, a hard worker, a strongman who took care of his family in the most ideal fashion. 


Years of life in the states slowly eroded this image of the immigrant as the settlers settled, cities grew and the economy and jobs expanded. With the constitution came law, but not yet order. Americans owned and ran American properties, and new slaves and workers shipped across the Atlantic did the blue collar work. 


This was the type of country the US was when the conditions across Europe worsened as the US’s economy grew. Shipment of people to the states were around 60000 for more than 50 years until the famine in Ireland and political turmoil in Germany, which boosted these numbers dramatically. In 1851, there were 380000 people in the US ports of entry, a very dramatic increase in the consistent influx of humans. 2.7 million new prospective citizens entered the country in the next 7 years, and most of these people were Catholic in a time where Catholicism was hated in the US. There were stark opposition to Catholic churches and schools, but these immigrants had bigger problems. They drew hostility because of the diseases they brought with them from the old world. They were poor, just like the original immigrants but instead of improving the forests of Massachusetts into a sprawling city, they diminished its features with the slum housing they stayed in, the increase in crime rates, alcoholism and other misdemeanors. The American-Born protestants thought their English heritage was true Americanism and despised the Irish and the German. These people were called “nativists”, who believed opposition to the Catholics was necessary to protect America. The Know-Nothings, a political organization that was created by these nativists managed to become the second most powerful political organization in the nation, electing 5 senators and 43 representatives. After the civil war, nativist activity declined dramatically.


So to finally answer your question, anti-immigration sentiment arose from immigrants themselves because they viewed new immigrants as fundamentally different from themselves or their families. America undoubtedly was a melting pot, but this did not exclude people from making the distinction between cultures. Blacks were slaves, Irish were poor, Brits were true Americans etc. and anti-immigration is a very broad term for everyone who came to the US. Immigrants were slaves, immigrants were cheap labor, immigrants were Catholics, Immigrants were nation builders, and different groups had different expectations from these immigrants. Given all of these distinctions, it isn’t inherently illogical to say that immigrants are anti-immigration without including themselves. It is important to realize that actions have different consequences in different contexts, and some immigration is inherently more useful than others.


America, for most people, is the melting pot of the “correct” cultures. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________



Just as an extra, here are some examples of anti-immigration that happened in the US throughout its history:


“Yet as industrial revolution transformed the United States in the postwar years and attracted a vast new influx of immigrants, the antialien animus rose again. In the 1870s more than 2.7 million newcomers arrived at U.S. ports.”


“more than eighty thousand immigrants from China arrived between 1870 and 1875, brought to America by companies that had contracted to supply cheap labor to mines, railways, and other enterprises needing unskilled labor. With 30 percent of California’s workforce unemployed following the panic of 1873, many workers attacked these newcomers as “coolies” willing to work for slave wages. Outbreaks of violence against the Chinese spread throughout the West, from Los Angeles to Seattle to Denver. In 1882, Congress responded to anti-Asian nativism with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended immigration from China for ten years.”


“A striking number of new nativist fraternal groups were formed, the most important being the American Protective Association (APA). Founded in Iowa in 1887, the APA had attracted a membership of 500,000 by 1895.”


“By the end of the nineteenth century, the APA had disappeared. Nativist activism did not flourish in the first decades of the twentieth century, the years of the Progressive Era. It rose again in the form of the post-World War I Red Scare in 1919, and in the powerful but short-lived Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. It was in the nineteenth century that antialien movements had their greatest impact in American history.”

I am on break so I will give an answer quickly and will have to generalize a bit but I will leave a couple sources for further reading that I feel do this question justice.

> How did anti-immigration sentiment arise from a literal nation of immigrants?

By the 20th century, the United States was culturally monopolized by the descendants of the Anglo-Saxon, Western European "Old Stock" originators and immigrants alike. The idea of the "Melting Pot" was created as a a way to promote their version of "American" culture. They viewed themselves as the progenitors of "being American" so all who came after should conform to their form of "American" and basically give up the ethnic culture from where they came from. The anti-immigrant sentiment wasn't so much anti *immigrant* so much as it was fear of others who are different. The Melting Pot meant that this diversity would accumulate into one distinct culture, which according to people like Horace Kallen and Randolph Bourne, is just a ridiculous idea. America to them should be a dynamic place that used its diversity (in the rise of a growing nationalism in Europe at the time) as a strength, placing American values above any one culture or ethnicity.

Horace Kallen in his work *Democracy Versus the Melting Pot (1915)* describes the ethnic makeup and its evolution *at length* and does not shy away from calling this "Old Stock" group out for its hypocrisy. Combined with Randolph Bourne's *Trans-Nationalism*, both are great reads, delving into the idea of "American," not as an ethnicity, but as a way of being. That being 'American" was to follow a set of ideals and that retaining ones own culture (cultural pluralism) was not at odds with this. This was directly countering the idea that being "American" should be homogeneous culturally. 

> How did the idea of America as a melting pot of different cultures develop in spite anti-immigrant sentiment?

People tend to live near like groups. As more and more immigrants came to the United States, large communities formed. In Kallen's *Democracy Versus the Melting Pot*, he explains that immigrants ultimately had to conform out of economic necessity (learning English, etc) so of course a base American culture was adhered to, but in the end, it actually allowed for cultural diversity to flourish as all of these new groups interacted and brought their norms to the US and their children and grandchildren became more culturally homogenous.

An example of this Anglo-Saxon stock forced Melting Pot was Henry Ford. [I'll just leave this here.](http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/FordEnglishSchool.htm)

Overall, the answer to your question is that there was a general disdain of other cultures as inferior or foreign to a large group of people who had been relatively culturally homogeneous with themselves and with western Europe until about the 1880s when America began to industrialize in earnest attracting the masses.

Children's culture in history can be difficult to study. Adult observers tend to reflect more formal types of play and practice; memoirs reflect the haze of memory and *desired* memory; it's sometimes difficult to tell whether schoolbook exercises represent an individual experience or a standard trope. In this case, fortunately, a look at the broader culture of children's wargaming in early modern Europe can help answer the question.

Children's play often imitates the adult world for two reasons: first, children mirror what they see; second, adults encourage it to help prepare children for the future. The encouragement of martial play among boys (only boys) in the late Middle Ages and early modern era is a good illustration of these. We have stories from hagiography of the future saint who stepped aside from the mock swordfighting to play at being a priest dispensing the Eucharist, and proverbs observing that when children play at swords, war is in the air. From the adult encouragement angle, with the rise of a visible toymaking industry from the fourteenth century, hobby-horses and swords were among the most popular items.

Although toy guns start to appear from the later half of the sixteenth century, it's really in the seventeenth that guns displace the swords of knighthood as boys' wargame toy of choice. This is in conjunction with the encouraged realism of militaristic play. Memoirs of noblemen raised at a royal court, like Louis Henri with Louis XIV, stress the popularity of fully organized "armies" of boys marching and drilling under their "commander," the king. And this was in no way limited to the elite of the elite. Army-style drills were not just a major component of the all-around education of boys at grammar and secondary school--school sponsorship of these types of exercise actually served as a *marketing appeal*. The Lincoln Grammar School stressed the realism of its schoolyard play in opposition to "childish games": *its* students "exercised in all their military postures, and in assaults and
defenses."  And from the 17th century, assaults and defenses meant guns.

With princes and high nobles, it seems that the guns and cannons would be smaller, boy-sized versions, but real. Louis Henri describes learning how to shoot with a harquebus that then-Prince Louis gave him, and mentions how he and the other boys (which is to say, their fathers) lavished the future king with many and diverse shooting weapons.

But moving down the social ladder to the urban middle classes (presumably), actual toy guns were *exceedingly* popular among boys. Actual records are scanty, of course, but archaeological digs and trawls of the Thames (where worn out or unneeded toys might be disposed of, or make their way there through a sewer or settlement) turn up toy guns and cannons as among the most numerous survivals. And for the most part, these toys appear to have been designed for mock shooting, including packing with powder and pellets to fire.

But children playing with toy guns in the manner they were designed to be used by adults is not yet the same as children making the leap themselves. For *that*, we turn to disciplinary and legal records of situations where boys improvised. One student of the Bodwin School participated in wargaming exercises not just by carrying a dummy gun. He actually got a candle, hollowed it out, and packed it with powder. This isn't a mock stick, but it's pretty close.

There are plenty of tragic events where children did not realize a gun was loaded, went to play with it, and killed a playmate or bystander by accident. But one case from turn of the 18th century London demonstrates the realism that permeates surviving accounts of boys' wargaming. A twelve-year-old apprentice came across his master's gun and wanted to play with it. But he wasn't content to point and cock and click, like plenty of boys did in the cases where the gun proved to be loaded. No, for this boy, playing with guns started with inserting the stick and packing it with powder.

Some caution is of course warranted. These aren't cases of boys pointing sticks at each other and making exploding noises with their mouths. And surviving sources, as I've discussed, are going to be biased towards more realistic types of games. Nevertheless, the combination of being so steeped in militaristic "play" and the general tendency to learn adulting by observation led our two improvisers to want "toy guns" that mirrored the real thing at every step except the very last. It seems likely, therefore, that just like we can all remember a range of ways we "played pretend" with "guns" when we were little, 17th and 18th century boys also scaled up towards imitating the real thing with whatever they had.

Great question! Unfortunately (or fortunately), it straddles different topics, eras, and historiography which makes it an adventure to answer and difficult to give you a single answer. This doesn't mean it can't be done, but in the spirit of Ask Historians, an answer about the layers of history in your question. And then an attempt at an answer.

First, there's the matter of what we can infer from children’s behavior centuries ago based on what adults put down in writing and which writing endured. There’s the use of your word “toddler” which is a fairly modernish term (usage dates to the late 1700) that describes a human in a particular stage of development distinct from previous or subsequent stages; and this notion of distinct stages has its own history. Then there's the specificity in your question around the “terrible twos” which is a very short window of time in a human’s life about which an adult may or may not write. (I feel comfortable saying two-year-olds medieval toddlers weren't keeping food and behavior journals.) Finally, there’s how the adults around the child constructed boundaries for behaviors and how they vary in terms of what’s considered an inappropriate tantrum or an appropriate expression of independence. These boundaries are shaped by a society’s – be it modern or medieval – thinking about gender, disability status, race, religion, class, the nature of childhood itself, the expectation of children, and in the case of your question, dietary habits. 

It's helpful to spend a bit more time thinking about one of the challenges in your question: your precision. It's a great detail, but alas, it makes it a bit harder to answer as a historian of the medieval era can probably shed some light on the eating habits of toddlers but likely won’t be able to explicitly say “yes, this thing happened” because the adults who wrote about children wouldn’t have used your level of precision. 

I often experience similar tensions in American education history, I can rattle off anecdotes I've come across from teacher journals from the mid-1800s where a child is described as misbehaving (her words), but the child’s age is often not noted (“the youngest Smith boy”) or is described in the context of when they attended school (“winter session.”) However, I also know that her journal writing is informed by the social pressure she experienced related to how well she did her job. So, it's difficult to know for sure if what she's describing as "misbehavior" was the sort of thing children did because they're children or truly something dangerous or harmful. And to complicate it, the same teacher might write home that the same child was an absolute hellion to her but through sheer force of will and motherly instincts, she was able to calm him down and teach him his letters. And of by the way, if the school board was interested in buying new books for the school, she knows this particular boy simply loves to read. Which is to say, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator with regards to the things children in her charge did. So, if you asked, "have 7-year-old boys always hated school?" I couldn't say for sure. I could tell you there are instances of teachers reporting boys around age 7 or so did not like doing the thing they asked them to do. 

Although related in historiography and themes to the history of education, there is a separate branch of historians who study the history of childhood and youth. It's their work that can help us understand the imprecision regarding age I described above is not a universal trait. As an example, Berner (2014) looked at the rituals in the lives of Ashkenazic Jews in the 1700s and could describe down to particular years how children were treated because a child's age played a role in the rituals of the community. From her 2014 article: "very young infants were often brought to the synagogue, bringing toddlers and children under the age of three or five was usually discouraged." So it's possible a historian of Ashkenazic Jewish childhood could speculate how two-year-olds might have responded to food they disliked, but it's difficult for us to extrapolate from one community to the broad category of human two-year-olds across an entire extended era. 

Finally, there's the issue of taste. That is, this idea we wouldn't eat something - or allow a toddler to pick and choose - because of the taste or flavor has its own complicated history that I dipped my toe in and promptly turned around. Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time. 

That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of "doing" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, "yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion." I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.

It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name ("tantrum") emerged from the idea that there is "typical" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed. 

I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, "[What is the history behind "What is your favorite color?"](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hng4kq/what_is_the_history_behind_what_is_your_favorite/)" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior. 

While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's "tantrum" ran the gauntlet from "their mother gave them too much attention as a baby" to "their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby." Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did. 

Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.

While we wait for a genuine expert in medieval history to show up, I will mention first that there is a fantastic 2009 publication that speaks somewhat to this query, edited by Kathleen Ashley and Mark Johnston, entitled Medieval Conduct Literature: An Anthology of Vernacular Guides to Conduct for Youths.

As a non-specialist in medieval history, I do note three things in reading over the introduction to this book. First, that the genre of "conduct literature" was well-established by the late medieval period and had its roots in late antiquity, and often consisted of advice from a parental figure or elder to a putative child (though frequently a teenager on the verge of leaving the household). Second, that the oldest and best-established sub-genre within conduct literature concerned table manners--but it focused on the nobility and gentry. Third, no matter what your field of speciality, any historian would be instantly alert to a difficult problem of interpretation, namely, whether these guides were prescriptive ideals that bore little resemblance to actual manners, or whether they can safely be used as a window into everyday behavior. Anyone familiar with etiquette guides in a more contemporary idiom has doubtless noticed that sometimes they are a reasonable enough guide to common manners and other times seem basically like fictions with very little resemblance to actual practice. In any event, these guides will likely provide very little help for answering the OP's question if the OP is interested in everyday life outside of the late medieval nobility. There we will need the full methodological skills of an expert in medieval social and cultural history to have any hope of an answer.
As a side question, if this is reasonably answerable, can anyone tell me how common it was to simply not like certain foods? As a child, but also as an adult? Or was the sometimes scarcity of food enough to ensure not-picky eaters would tend to be the ones that survived and continued passing their genes forward?

To add on this if I'm allowed... what is an example of native American food. I know it likely varied by region. We all know the stereotypes of plain dwellers eating buffalo and the early settlers learning how to grow corn from the local natives. But does anyone know if there is any native cuisine? 
Founder/mod of /r/IndianCountry reporting in. 

The questions as parsed by OP and labeled by this mod team focus on the modern period, which is often neglected when discussing Native Americans. 
 We've aggregated a few stories about this found by searching for "[food](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=food&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)" or "[cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=cooking&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)" or "[chef](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=chef&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)." You'll likely find a few examples of Native American restaurants offering interpretations of specific regional cuisine among the searches and other submissions here you may see.

#Mainstream Examples Hidden in Plain Sight

The *glib* answer to both questions is "[We call it Famous Dave's](https://www.famousdaves.com/), given that its founder, David W. Anderson is Choctaw and Ojibiwe, formerly AS-IA of DOI (2004-5). 

Going more local as to Washington, DC, there's the [Mitsitam Cafe](http://nmai.si.edu/visit/washington/mitsitam-cafe/) at the National Museum of the American Indian. It's the most ostensibly Native American restaurant in the city, offering a variety of cuisine. The fry bread was a problem until Executive Chef Freddie Bitsoie (Diné [Navajo]) began his tenure.

Going deeper, people often do not consider the deep Native American roots in Soul Food and Southern Cooking generally, which borrows staples and dishes from Southeastern Tribal Nations. 

#A Local Example Hidden in Plain Sight

This will be as granular I can make it and I hope it doesn't result in loss of appetite.

My Tribal Community is Pamunkey, known as "Pocahontas' people" by mainstream references, recently acknowledged by the US in 2016. Our most recent treaty is the 1677 Treaty of Middle Plantation (modern Williamsburg) and the Pamunkey Reservation was established by treaty, prior to 1658. However, despite my family maintaining their ties to Pamunkey, mine is largely an Urban Indian experience in the DMV (DC/MD/VA region), shaped by the Jim Crow South, segregation, and the post-segregation periods. Save for a few families who remained exclusively on either Pamunkey or Mattaponi Reservations, the vast majority of the regional "Indian Experience" has been a combination of rural and urban for the past 200 years. 

Some of us have opened restaurants and many of us have attempted to blend in by not being explicit about race; we are deeply in the minority and, frankly, it's often a political and economic liability to declare indigeneity in this long, insistently racially binary region. It's not entirely by free personal choice, as the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 criminalized off-reservation Indian identity in Virginia until *Loving v. Virginia* and regional state-sponsored document genocide efforts continued afterwards, arguably to this day in weaker forms. Long contact means varying degrees of mixture with other communities. Racial purity is a unrealistic and unhealthy luxury that we could not and cannot afford, but local Indians have a good idea of what other local Indian families look like, our surnames, our hometowns, and our ancestral holdings.  Some of us don't have the option of passing for White or Black and sometimes we personally pay a kind of "blood price" for the the Tribal Communities we are born into, be it at the altar, on the street, or whether our employer has a strong opinion about local Indians (as opposed to people from non-local Tribes).  

The local Native American scene in the DMV is split by State, Tribal Nation, Federal Acknowledgment status, Family, Employer, and Organization; it's rather segregated, despite areas of overlap. Southern Maryland had a particularly active local indigenous community along Route 301, which included a nightlife that the older generation might tell you about when their wives aren't in earshot.

*This is a long-winded way of saying that there is a non-zero chance of eating at a Native American restaurant in the DMV without knowing it*.

[The "World Famous" Florida Avenue Grill](http://floridaavenuegrill.com/), which bills itself as the "Oldest Soul Food Restaurant in the World" is undeniably a historical and popular establishment, and also arguably the best known *Native American* restaurant in DC that you've never heard or thought of as such.

Its founders, the Wilson family, are Occaneechi (now recognized by North Carolina as the Occaneechi Band of Saponi) and I've never heard Lacey C. Wilson, Jr. describe himself in any other way. He's bled for that, but you wouldn't know it unless you were one of the local families. My mother conducted interviews with him, but she has exclusive control of the material, which will *hopefully* not pass into my possession any time soon. The food is fantastic, although I haven't eaten there in years.
I previously worked on cultural resources (gathering historic research, identifying culturally-sensitive plants and natural resources, and communicating with local tribal representatives) for military installations in the Pacific Northwest. Just moved to the Southeast where I helped with an intertribal powwow, but I'm still learning about the local history and tribes here. When I use the word "American" or "Native/Native American" I refer to North American or North American Indigenous, respectively, though again my expertise is more from the PNW. 

Much of what is currently, regularly eaten by many Native Americans is not the same as what their ancestors traditionally ate and prepared. Communities on some reservations sometimes face the same sort of food deserts that many non-Native American neighborhoods suffer from--cheap junk food and limited fresh produce. Access to traditional ingredients or food knowledge can be very limited. For example, on a lot of the Army training grounds in WA, the military is supposed to immediately cease training to allow (some, depending) tribes to forage for native plants needed for traditional food preparations and ceremonies, though I've personally never met anyone who said they recall them actually exercising that right. These plants don't exactly grow on the most accessible terrain. And when I was gathering information on native plants for signage, I discovered that much of it had traditionally been eaten--but were often regarded as famine foods, or had challenging preparations (such as [Chinook acorns, which required curing in urine](https://books.google.com/books?id=IQdpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT80&lpg=PT80&dq=chinook+olives&source=bl&ots=FkXAZj039c&sig=GLx_W6oReHa1VQaNwZqxonHbUUA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjR1KGYxKrXAhVH8WMKHVAYDf0Q6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&q=chinook%20olives&f=false)). So it would be difficult to open a commercially viable restaurant based on either current Native eating habits or using some of the more hard-to-access or prepare foods.

We do, however, eat and prepare plenty of foods that stem from traditional Native American cuisine in much of what we regard as wider "American" cuisine. The use of green chili in the Southwest, cornbread/corn pone ([the word pone itself comes from Eastern Algonquian languages](http://www.talk-lenape.org/results?query=ahp%C3%B2n&lang=lenape)), succotash, the use of filé powder in gumbo, and of course smoked salmon and jerkey are examples. The pit-style form of barbeque is believed to derive from a traditional style of cooking meat observed in the Amerindians from the Caribbean up to as far as New York. So you could say that restaurants serving uniquely American fare already have some native cuisine incorporated into them. As far as whether a Native American restaurant "was ever popular in the US" in the past, prior to say the 2000s, this might be the closest you'll get. 

There is definitely growing interest in reviving Native cuisine in the PNW, Canada, and Mid-West US, I believe in part due to increased curriculum focusing on native plants and food preparation at some of the local colleges (like Evergreen State) and Northwest Indian College. Indian Colleges especially seem to be finding creative ways to connect students with their heritage such as in their food science and culinary arts departments. Sources for what they teach include documents like [The Ethnobotany of Western Washington](https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vo3lD_V9JUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ethnobotany+of+western+washington&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj97t3Qy6rXAhUP-GMKHbzMDHIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false), in which the food and cultural values of various native plants were recorded for various PNW tribes (interestingly the interviewer tried to discuss each plant with both a man and woman from each tribe, since women were often more familiar with the culinary and medicinal uses and men tended to be more familiar with the plant's value for nets or woodworking), and [Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/buffalo/garden/garden.html), which is a direct recounting of a Hidatsa Indian woman's descriptions of her village life, food preparation, and agriculture at Like-a-fishhook village prior to 1885. Lots of descriptions of food in that, and it's now being used by chefs such as Sean Sherman to recreate native cuisine. His consulting company, [The Souix Chef](http://sioux-chef.com), has been working on this sort of research and promoting healthy native cuisine. Ever since around 2010 there has been increased attempts at Native American restaurants, though because the genre of "Native" fine cuisine is still attempting to define itself, it's been challenging for some of the restaurants. Landlords know that it's not exactly a Yelp category that most customers will be searching for, so business loans and securing space [can be more challenging than when starting restaurants of other cuisines](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/why-its-hard-for-successful-native-american-restaurants-to-expand/489449/). There are debates as to how closely Native American cuisine should stick to its historic roots. And items such as the frybread at the National Museum has been [controversial](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/frybread-79191/?no-ist) due to its origins as an essentially non-nutritious survival staple on reservations--a last resort when they were denied access to traditional ingredients, and a reminder of the injustice. And different tribes, and sometimes each family, has their own way of making and serving it, so it's difficult to say whose recipe (if any) should be a representative of a whole continent's traditional food, especially since that one Native restaurant might be the only direct experience with Native food that most folks might experience. Still, there's increasing research and education on traditional Native American cuisine, as well as increasing public awareness (somewhat, at least in some places) and demand for more unique restaurants, so there's all the factors that could hopefully lead to a flourishing new restaurant category. 

As an add-on question, how were things such as vegetables prepared among natives? Did they fry or bake anything? Were the culinary talented recognized for their 'dishes' like chefs in the western world are?
As a follow up question, what about cookbooks?  I know that cookbooks from the middle ages Europe and early America are studied and occasionally the recipes are made, but I've never heard of Native American cook books.  Do any exist?  Was there a time in US history where they became popular?  And what common foods today are influenced by Native American foods and techniques?

What an interesting question, thanks OP.

Edit: I asked my wife about this and I posted her answer in another top comment.
Don't be fooled by myths of "the first Thanksgiving." Traditionally, white Americans have been far more interested in ignoring or eradicating Native foodways than embracing them. Since this question asks about "Native American" restaurants specifically, I'll focus on a couple of moments in restaurant history where food perspectives of various Native peoples were cut out of wider American fine and family dining. However, an integral part of the story is indeed the targeted destruction of Native food cultures by white Americans - especially since, archaeologists and oral tradition tell us, adoption and modification of foodways rather than wholesale switchover had been the result of intertribal contact before 1500. 

The corn/squash/beans agriculture of the Southwest nations had spread east and then north up the Mississippi and tributaries. But the Algonquians and Iroquois, like other Eastern Woodlands nations, would spend the winter in their permanent towns and villages through the spring planting season, then move to waterlines (rivers, lakes, ocean) for a few months. They would catch and preserve fish for the present and for the rest of the year, and return home when the crops needed taking care of and harvest. The foraging and hunting seems to have been traditional to the Eastern Woodlands people before the addition of agriculture--the Algonquians only added farming in the 16th century, it seems, later than the Iroquois. The introduction of new technology and even new foods, in other words, did not have to destroy foodways. Unfortunately, that would become a major reason for the scarcity of Native American or specific Native nations' restaurant cuisine today.

The first stage in American restaurant history I want to look at is the mid-19th century. The rise of "dining establishments" had happened quickly from the age of the smalltime colonial tavern - a skyrocketing American economy drew international businessmen to glittering urban hotels, whose dining rooms became well-known and catered to an audienced used to, above all, French and English food. It was the needs of business that, in America, detached food service places from sleeping, as workers in the earlier 19th century needed lunch on the job.

Why this mattered was the creation of highly "ethnic" communities in cities and rural/township regions through immigration, settlement, and employment patterns. From the 1840s, as midday food service places proliferated and eventually broadened their service, immigrant groups built their own ethnic food places to serve their own communities - the innumerable *Biergarten* of St. Louis, Missouri, for example. (Budweiser beer was born out of one such - failing! - establishment after the Civil War). For the most part, ethnic restaurants continued to target only their linguistic/cultural community. But it's significant for our overall story because it marks the foundational establishment of ethnic cuisine at a time that explicitly excluded Native nations.

Because, for those of you keeping score at home, that era that America was beginning to host ethnic restaurants was the same period that white America doubled down on its endless campaign of cultural genocide against Indians.

The deportation and exile of Indigenous people to typically isolated reservations - the areas white people didn't want to live! - by logic removed them from the opportunity to plant restaurants in bustling towns and thriving cities. But more importantly, the forced moves inherently ruined existing foodways in a lot of cases (you can't fish for salmon in the richest waters if you don't have access to the richest waters) and white American policies took care of the rest. The kidnapping of Native children and compulsory acquisition of Anglo-American cookery skills at boarding schools and mission schools went a long way towards wiping out traditional patterns.

In some cases, Indian cultures had the ability to adapt traditional foodways to new technology and ideas the same way white Americans were adopting their traditional cuisine. The Objibwa method of drying blueberries was superseded by canning technology and processed sugars, but they nevertheless continued (and continue today) to keep berries as a major part of their diet. (On the other hand, pressure from outside meant the berries were increasingly used in very European pies and European-style puddings, not ones thickened by corn as had been prepared for centuries.) In other cases, though, traditional knowledge was lost - actively destroyed - altogether.

Back on the restaurant scene: American xenophobia and (ironically) nativism in the early 19th century kept the ethnic restaurants and ethnic food - above all the "spicy" dishes of Italians and Chinese and other not-white-enough immigrants - somewhat sequestered in their own communities. However, one should note that the increasingly shrill anti-flavor voices were probably reacting to an increased broader public acceptance of said edible food. Some of the early cracks in the shell came through the World's Fairs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where Americans could dine on the "cuisine of foreign countries". Of course, this meant largely foreign *white* countries. The World's Fairs were rather better known for showing off the technological and cultural achievements of one set of countries and peoples, and showing off *individual, living human beings* of another set of countries and peoples as curiosities in and of themselves. So again, Native Americans - and here we should note also the scarcity of sub-Saharan nations' ethnic restaurants in the U.S. - were left out of the broadening of the white American palate.

The explosion in cookbooks and preserved foodstuffs in the early/mid-nineteenth century was actually a time Native women, in particular, tried to capture and assert the strength of their cultural foodways. In 1933, the Indian Women's Club of Tulsa, Oklahoma produced the first Native cookbook. You can read [one recipe](https://books.google.com/books?id=JTBSpuCkl9AC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22indian+cook+book%22+oklahoma+1933&source=bl&ots=R7lh_cIgFv&sig=ycw8WBSieKkEqT5MW-YQb7UdOoo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiszbyC36rXAhWH1IMKHQvyBXMQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&q=%22indian%20cook%20book%22%20oklahoma%201933&f=false), from Creek Indian and club president Lilah Lindsay, on Google Books! Amanda Amanda's *Choctaw Indian Dishes* in 1935 seems to have been the first professional cookbook promoting one tribe's foodways.

Native women's efforts in the cookbook scene went further towards *preserving* various cultures' foodways for themselves and for each other, than promoting it to a broader American public with more money and more desire to "eat out" for entertainment and family socializing. The 1940s seem to have been the era when "dining *ethnic*" took off as a popular social act. Especially in major cities, immigrants began to establish restaurants outside their country-of-origin neighborhood. 

However, once again, the foodways that became popular with white people were most often associated with Europe - in particular France, at this time, actually. (AskHistorians has some experts on Asian-American food cultures who will know more about that particular evolution). And once again, Native Americans were systematically excluded from this development, with the endurance of the reservation system and the difficulties or impossibilities of living an explicitly and marked Native life *as a community* outside. 

Native nations were also excluded from the rise of "American regional" dining, which is generally considered to have been born with the Four Seasons in 1959. "Regional" did not include the Native map of America.

Every history of Native foodways will end with a spot of hope for the future. The tradition of cookbooks established by Lilah Lindsay and the Indian Women's Club of Tulsa, to which we probably owe a sizeable debt for preservation of traditional recipes through the mid/late-20th century rise of TV dinners and standardized fast food fare, flourishes; maybe you *have* had the chance to be a guest at a powwow or attend a restaurant featuring traditional local Native foods as opposed to simply appropriating the name.

I hope that a lot of you really interested in the question of why most of us *don't* have much exposure to Native American foods today will head over to /r/IndianCountry and read or ask a little about how to *get* that exposure. :)

Hey all,

If you frequent the sub, you know the drill. If you're here from /r/all, or browse only occasionally, please be aware we have strict rules here intended to enforce the very high bar we expect from comments, so before posting, please read our [rules](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules). We remove comments which don't comply, and consider everyone forewarned. Trust me, you aren't the first person to point out that the NMAI has a cafeteria with 'Native American' cuisine. We've removed several comments stating that, but in a vacuum, that does nothing to answer the question as posed. If you have feedback or commentary about how things are run here, please don't post it in this thread. We'll just remove it. We love to hear thoughtful, constructive feedback via [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians&subject=Question%20Regarding%20Rules) however.

It can take time for [an answer to show up](/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/), so we thank you for your patience. We know you're here because the question sounds interesting, and we eagerly await an answer just like you! While you wait though, there is tons of great content already written, which you can find through our [Twitter](http://twitter.com/askhistorians), the [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), the [Monthly "Best Of"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/bestof) feature, and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/askhistorians/).

Again though, please remember the rules, and keep them in mind while you browse. If you don't like how this subreddit is run, keep in mind that this method has seen us continue to succeed and grow for years, and isn't going to change, so at least try and make your complaint original. /r/AskHistory exists, so complaining about the rules to us is like going into a fancy restaurant to complain they don't sell chicken nuggets, even though Chick-fil-A is nextdoor.

Edit: **Seriously**, stop just posting the menu for the NMAI cafeteria. We're handing out temp bans for people who do that. (2) To answer what someone asked me via PM, yes, it can be *part* of an answer if you want to provide an easily accessible illustration, but it needs to be a) contextualized and b) presented in a way that answers the actual question, as a *single* restaurant in a museum about that very culture doesn't speak to popularity, or larger trends in Native American cuisine vis-a-vis the general public. Additionally, we would expect to see at least some explanation of how the food served there compares to the originals that they represent.

>Finally, two F-16s, those of Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney, took off from Andrews Air Force Base at 1042. Their task was to intercept and destroy any hijacked airliner that might attempt to enter DC airspace. The rapidity of the order, however, meant that the F-16s were sent out unarmed. As a result, both pilots were acutely aware that their orders were, essentially, to commit suicide.

On the 10 year memorial of 9/11 CSPAN aired an interview with Lieutenant Penney where she discusses their plan. It was haunting to hear her discuss what she was prepared do.
First off, a *massive* thanks to you and /u/tlumacz for working on this. It is no small feat!

It really has been quite interesting to see 9/11 tick closer to the sub's scope, for any number of reasons. On the personal level of course, it doesn't *feel* like history. It seems *so* recent, and I have such vivid memories of hearing about it and the ensuing day. 

For the sub though, the '21 Year Rule' now has to retire as a joke, but it also is interesting, I think, so see how the rule and 9/11 have interacted up to now. We used to get quite frequent questions about it, but as a few mods have observed in our own chats on the topic, it is actually a lot *less* frequent these days, and it likely speaks to the *strength* of the 20 Year Rule, however arbitrary it might be in the specific cut-off that we chose. For myself and the older mods, 9/11 remains a critical, defining point of our lifetime, but we now have mods who barely were even aware of the world around them when it happened, and its only a matter of time before the first mod *born after* joins the team. 

The purpose of the rule has always been a function of our format, a way to ensure there is some distance between ourselves and the events being written about, and 9/11 has simply been emblematic of that in the past given his place in collective memory... but we really are now moving to the point where is truly *is* history for a decent amount of our readership, or at least hazy events of childhood that were hard to fully grasp at the time.

*Because* of my own personal perspective, it is hard to really know what the 'Next 9/11' is in these terms, that is to say, what the next culturally defining point is that we're going to darkly joke about eventually fielding questions for, and I'm not even sure there is one of that magnitude. Certainly contentious topics continue to await us on the horizon... the Invasion of Iraq is now two years away, and certainly promises to be big, but not in this way. The Obama years becoming fair game are going to be a *fun time* too, and certainly I don't envy whoever is modding in 2036 (wait, will that still be me!?) and has to start dealing with the Presidential campaign and the Trump Presidency, but is 2040, and COVID, going to be the biggest cultural touchstone we now await? Hard to really say...

But in any case, 2021 *is here*, and I think that the 20 Year Rule has done its job shepherding us there. Hopefully, of course, I won't regret saying that...
I never knew the invasion led to such a quick downfall of the Taliban,or at least took out quickly so many strongholds. My knowledge is quite lacking I admit on the subject so thank you for writing this!
This is an excellent recap. Thank you to those who put it together. As someone who was on the runway on a flight out of Newark to the West Coast when the first tower was hit, this hit home for me all too much.

Much appreciation for the time and effort it took you to put this together.
>The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania. The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit. The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground. 

Is there information on what was the target of Flight 93?
I'm old enough to remember both 9/11 and the 1993 WTC bombing. I know that Al-Queda was involved in both and they were planned by the same man. Did the failure of the 1993 bombing have any impact on the plan for 9/11? Was Bin-Laden involved in the 1993 bombing as well?
I'm glad you guys are so prepared for this. I had totally forgotten until I saw this thread that we're now in that territory. I was 7 years old and remember the day very well. They didn't show it to us in school, but I vividly remember walking to the car with my dad when he said, "Something very bad happened in New York today." My uncle was working in the city and my grandma was living in Staten Island, so we were all very worried. A relative whom I'd never met, my cousin's brother-in-law, died in the WTC that day. I find it quite upsetting having to wade through 9/11 content because of this so I am a) glad that we have loads of other flairs who are on top of this and b) going to try to distract myself by thinking of non-9/11 topics that are now fair game... The best part of 2001 was definitely when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in theatres, a much happier memory. :D
Excellent writeup. It's very clear that this has still been on the mind of many in the sub even after so long. Zhukov's comment about how it still feels very recent captures exactly what I, and likely several others, feel.

A few questions: 

- > leaving behind 56 children

  May I ask for elaboration on how such a thing came about? Was this a common occurrence in the given circumstances?

- Additionally, a common "fact" that comes up in the lead up to the attacks is the breakdown of communication between the CIA and the FBI. Is there any truth to the idea?

-----

Meta: Given how thorough mods/flaired users seem to be with a given topic such as this one, have they ever considered asking questions (preemptively) and answering them themselves akin to something like StackOverflow?
I would like to ask for some similar overviews of the social environment after the attacks.  Thing like people saying 1) "I know we're in bumfuck, idaho, but we're just 30 mins away from the capital, we could be a target", 2) the color code terror alert system that increased the fear, and 3) high school students being prepped on what to do if their school was hit by a terror attack, all had a huge impact on the american psyche, and are a huge part of understanding that year.

In all seriousness, i'm surprised how good the 20 year rule is. 5 years ago i feel like it would still end up being a prime topic for political discussions of Obama versus Bush, the state of the middle east, etc. Yet today it feels more like a 'historic' event rather than a 'political' event.
I never knew about the assassination plot against  Bill Clinton in Manila, nor the fact the fighter jets were scrambled without weapons and that the pilots were prepared for a suicide mission. It's just a little fact that really puts that day in a bit of a different perspective.

If I may, I remember 9/11 vividly. I was 18, kinda rootless, and had just been let go from a commitment to join the USMC a few months before (which should tell you how different a time it was, they just let me walk, no reason to keep pushing on a dude to join a peacetime military). I woke up early because I'd fallen asleep early the night before, so turned on ESPN to see Monday Night Football highlights, and they were talking about the first plane to hit the tower. As I was watching, the second plane hit. 

It was surreal, and, I think, if you weren't really around before it, I don't think you can understand how jarring it was. Now we're locked in the forever 'War on Terror', so the mindset is different, but back then it was shocking. It truly changed so much about America, easily the biggest crossroads of the millennium for us.

I remember hearing about the plane that went down in PA, how crazy that story sounded. So much tragedy, but how those people, and the first responders in NYC and DC reacted, a lot of heroes too.

In my opinion, 9/11 isn't the only reason America is where we are today, but it might be the biggest. 

Sorry for the digression, this just had me thinking a lot, really excellent work as always by AH.
As we start pushing into "shit I remember happening", I'm really looking forward to how much of what I remember happening was either inaccurate, forgotten, or deemed unimportant enough to have made it into official records. 9/11 is forever seared into my memory, as a teenager living in New York at the time. For me it has never and will never feel like "history", it's a deeply personal event, forever changing the skyline of my city, and the lives of countless friends and family (including someone who was orphaned at my school).

Will users here ask about, or remember the rumors of 8 planes being hijacked? Rumors of bombs on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges? The evacuation march across the Queensboro Bridge that I flashbacked to during The Dark Knight Rises? "Ghost" people, covered in ash and dust, on the trains? Do those things even matter?

Can we truly capture just how different the mood in the country was between 2000 and 2002?

What a long strange trip it has been.
>(Note: The United States, though the CIA, was funding the Afhgan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992.)

My understanding is that the US funded specifically the Mujahideen groups in Afghanistan that were comprised of native Afghanis, not the groups comprised of foreign fighters. Is there any evidence that US funds did end up going toward Bin Laden and the group he was affiliated with in Afghanistan?
I'd like to thank you both for putting this together, as well as the whole mod team for making this such a good and informative subreddit.  I consider it an important part of history to learn, for us who weren't there to experience it. Now, I've got one piece of barely related trivia, and one question too.

1 I remember being told by my mum about how she sat in my grandparents living room, seeing how the television changed to show what was happening, how a reporter pointed at a tower and said it had fallen, while it still was on screen. Today I assume it's greenscreen. But that living room, and it's the same living room I've been sitting in while reading this, it feels fitting.

2 You said one of the planes only had four hijackers, which one was that? Was it the one hitting pentagon, was it the one hitting the southern or northern tower? Or was it, as I suspect, the one which was landed mostly safely?

Once again, thanks for putting this together, and thanks in advance for answering my question.
>Earlier that same year, the CIA established a special unit, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia,specifically for tracking Osama bin Laden

How come they didn't have at least hints of an operation of such magnitude? Were they disbanded before?
Great write up. It may be worth noting the scrambled jets took off from Langley AFB in Hampton, VA, not from Langley, VA (the home of the CIA).
Fantastic write-up on this, thank you both!

Though I just wanted to point out something I had noticed while reading and I wanted to clear it up,

>(Note: The United States, though the CIA, was funding the Afghan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992.)

While this is most certainly true, it needs to be pointed out that the CIA sent the majority of funds through intermediaries (most often Pakistan's intelligence service, the ISI)  before they ended up with the Mujahedeen groups in Afghanistan. Steve Coll goes over this quite a bit in *Ghost Wars* if you want more of an understanding of how specifically the US supplied funds and arms to groups fighting the Soviets and Soviet backed forces in Afghanistan.

For added clarity, it should also be pointed out that Bin Laden and his group was never funded by the CIA, either directly or indirectly. This is a claim that is often made with no evidence backing it up, and even Coll himself has had to point out many times in interviews throughout the years that the claim is baseless. At the end of the day, there were dozens if not hundreds of independent Mujahedeen groups fighting in Afghanistan at one point or another during the Soviet Occupation. While many of them did see some funding or arms shipments sourced from the US, not all of them did, and that includes Bin Laden's group. His group was primarily self-funded through Bin Laden's own wealth as well as other sources. Having said that however, I want to also point out that this doesn't necessarily mean that the CIA or the US did not play a rather large role in creating the conditions in Afghanistan that allowed Bin Laden to return after the war and use the country as his base of operations.
I've waited for this year because, oddly enough, I've always wanted perspective on the conspiracies themselves! 

The question: What are the most prominent conspiracy theories to come from 9/11? And why and how did they develop?
My contribution to the reading list is the graphic novel version of the 9/11 Commission Report. Highly abbreviated, more pathos-laden, but also much more accessible than the full text. 

https://us.macmillan.com/tradebooksforcourses/academictrade/9780809057399/the911report-1
I have a simple question that I’m not seeing an answer to so far: Was there a clear intended outcome of the attacks? Simply to spread fear and paranoia in the US? I understand bin Laden declared Jihad, but he also must’ve predicted that the US would retaliate, risking a worse outcome for himself and his people.
I have a question about the function of your overview. You mentioned Osama escaping from US forces on December 16, 2001, but left out Donald Rumsfeld refusing to give the order to move in. (Source: Tora Bora Revisited, https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Tora_Bora_Report.pdf ) The question is this: was this done to keep the overview as nonpartisan as possible, or was it seen as irrelevant to the historical overview? 

Context: In May, I'm going to be starting my history undergrad work, and am curious as to the process.
My father survived the Pentagon attack. Still gets PTSD flair ups if he’s at an airport and smells jet fuel. 

Thank you to all of the mods for meeting this head on.
Thank you very much for that writeup ! It is very interesting but I have two questions regarding it, from the book *Les Guerriers de l'Ombre* (2017, Editions Tallandier) from Jean-Christophe Notin, where he make several claims which I had difficulty to find corroborating works. In this book, he interviews former French DGSE officers (DGSE is the French foreign intelligence service).

His first claim is about the Talibans' welcome of bin-Laden [pages 215-223], the author states that bin-Laden was welcome as a former brother of arms (from the Soviet-Afghan war) but generally disliked (J.-C. Notin also claims the Arab volunteers were not liked during the war either, but welcomed as the Afghans needed men to fight). According to the interviews, bin-Laden was much closer to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar than the Taliban. The book goes on to state that the Taliban started to support bin-Laden following the missile strikes from [Operation Infinite Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Infinite_Reach#Attack_on_Afghan_camps), which were supposed to kill bin-Laden while he was present at a *Loya Jirga*, but he was warned by the Pakistani ISI and the missiles only killed Afghan leaders (angering the Taliban).

The second claim is in regard to the period between 9/11 and the coalition's attack on Afghanistan on 9/23/2001. The author states that an assembly of around 600 ulamas (Sunni scholars) petitionned Mullah Omar to kick bin-Laden out in order to protect the country from destruction in the war as they stated the Taliban were not involved in the preparation of the 9/11 attacks but merely hosted former brother of arms [pages 232-233].

What is the validity of those claims ?
[deleted]
Thank you for this write up. I wasn't born till November of 01 and 9/11 was still a taboo subject at my school by the time I graduated. This was more in depth than our actual course on the event was.
Having read Ghost Wars I find the omission of Massoud and his Northern Alliances near complete control of afghanistan pre 9/11 a strange omission. I suppose that's the trick of any historical post, keeping what's important while not expanding too much.

Not mentioning Osama having him assassinated two days before 9/11 is a big oversight imo and was the biggest revelation in ghost wars.
Great write-up.

For a first-hand perspective from the aircrews who were scrambled that terrible day, I highly recommend these three sources:

It's part of a larger documentary, but @ 2:50 they feature some interviews from a couple of Canadian CF-18 pilots who were scrambled to intercept suspect aircraft. They talk about what is was like having to face the prospect of having to do the unthinkable:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnt_6FGdcK8

This one is a longer interview with a Massachusetts Air National Guard F-15 pilot who was scrambled from an airbase on the east coast and ended up becoming one of the first armed jets to arrive over Manhattan:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3GWEtze_Co

There's also the chilling interview with Major Heather Penny u/AB1908 posted, where she describes having to potentially use her own aircraft to bring down a hijacked airliner:
https://www.c-span.org/video/?300959-1/major-heather-penney-september-11-2001
Wonderful write up; I learned a lot. Respectfully, might it be wise to alter the wording here:

>The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit. The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground.

To clarify that while no lives were lost on the ground, the 44 people on the plane were killed in the crash? The phrase 'took no lives' may be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story of flight 93.
Thank you team for this great write up! Like many people I can certainly remember where I was on September 11th as it all happened. (Distinctly, I can remember coming downstairs to find my mum crying as the tv was one.)

That said, I think the parts that most impacted me was the quickly expanding Afghanistan war. I knew people who went off to fight, and some who didn't come back, and that really impacted young me. 

I'm also really interested to see how this impacts the sub over the next year or so. Let's make it an extra special year, and celebrate this extra special community!
Wonderful work, and something I'm sure we're going to be pointing people to over and over - probably for 20 more years to come!

Also, since it's a television adaptation and thus won't be on the reference list, I'll second the recommendation by /u/theghostofme for the 10 part miniseries *The Looming Tower*, which combines much of the excellent Wright book of the same title with the Soufan memoir.  Soufan certainly isn't shy about using the series to settle scores as he takes a hatchet to the CIA, but given the massive policy and intelligence failures involved, can't say I particularly disagree with his choice.  Definitely worth a watch regardless of whether or not you've read the books.
I think it's worth mentioning, since it's such a common myth online and the mujahideen are mentioned here: the dedication at the end of Rambo III is said to have originally been to "the brave Mujahideen fighters", and after 9/11 was changed to "the gallant people of Afghanistan". This is untrue, and the dedication never mentioned mujahideen-the commonly circulated image featuring that is photoshop. Good video of someone meticulously checking this [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4ey-EmLm4).
This was a FANTASTIC telling.  Thank you guys.
Thank you. 

9/11 happened when I was in 4th grade. I was raised to ask questions and think critically, but we know what can happen when skepticism goes too far. For many years, I read deeply into the conspiracy theories surrounding this event and ate it all up. There is a certain power that comes with "knowing the truth" (at least, thinking you know something others don't), and people don't want to give up that feeling; I didn't want to give up that feeling. For many years I said it was all a cover-up and instead of seeking out dissenting opinions, I only looked for information that confirmed my beliefs. Well, it's been nearly 20 years and my zeal for conspiracies has waned. I hadn't really even thought about 9/11 for a long time until I just saw this post. Although short and simple, it actually very plainly outlines some facts that I had remained willingly ignorant of for many years. The main point that always bugged me was that there didn't seem to be any formal acknowledgement that the perpetrators were Saudis. Knowing that, I always found it suspicious that Saudi men attacked us on 9/11, but as a result we attacked Iraq and Afghanistan? But this makes it clearer. The attackers may have been Saudis, but they were Saudi *rebels*. They hated their own government, much like many Americans. They were terrorists and they were not aligned with the Saudi government, because the Saudi government are allies to the United States. It makes total sense. 

Let it be known, people can change their minds about things. 9/11 was just the result of some global politics and religious zealotry gone wrong.
I have a couple questions, prefaced that the attacks were obviously a scary and uncertain time:

1) How many people were in the planes that had hit? I know of people that had missed their flight. 

2) What safety precautions have been had to preventhigh jackings? (If this breaks the rules skip it)

3) Prior to 9/11 and the aftermath how common was Islamaphobia? Such as in the 70s-90’s? 

Also for the mods or anyone interested the one class I wish I was able to take at my university was called The History of Terrorism, taught by Professor John A. Lynn II, he has a great resource knowledge and authorship regarding further information to dig into historical context and origins of terrorism.
I was too young to remember 9/11 and I’m not American, so any information I’ve tried to find has been laced with conspiracy, so I really loved this! Thank you so much. 


I do have a question though: when Kofi Annan said “new threats make no distinction between races, nations or regions,” was he talking about 9/11 specifically? Because that made a clear distinction in nationality- it specifically targeted the US. Or am I misunderstanding the quote?
Thank you for doing this. Twenty years. Still so vivid in my mind. Tears in my eyes. It was a hell of a time to live in the tristate area.
One terrific validation of the 20 year rule is that one of the single best volumes I’ve read about 9/11 only came out in 2019: *The Only Plane In The Sky: An Oral History of 9/11* by Garrett M. Graff. The bibliography includes an amazing roundup of the many, many, many oral history projects conducted around 9/11, big and small.

I know there are a lot of younger members of this subreddit who don’t personally remember 9/11 or may even have been born after it occurred. A lot of the major literature on the subject presupposes an understanding of the actual day’s events and seeks to put them into a larger context. However, if you DO want to understand more about the actual day’s events - what happened, where, when, in what order, what was the reaction at the moment it took place - you cannot do better than that book. It’s a time capsule.
\> While “fog of war” was certainly a factor, and the FAA’s failure to  communicate with NORAD exacerbated the chaos, the timeline of events  later published by NORAD contradicted established facts and existing  records and became a paramount example of a government agency trying to  avoid blame for their errors throughout the sequence of events described  here. Members of the 9/11 Commission identified these contradictions  and falsehoods as a leading cause of conspiracy theories regarding the  attacks. 

&#x200B;

To clarrify, on which organisations part was the cover-up occouring? NORAD? FAA? Both?

Secondly, was this cover up damaging enough that it spawned concequences for those involved?
Blindspot: The Road to 9/11 is a great NPR podcast about what led to 9/11. It is based on a History channel series, which I haven't seen, but is probably good as well.
I was in AIT when the USS Cole happened, I knew then that my time in the military would be spent fighting terrorism. Prior to that we were all told it would be a vacation and that the worst thing we would have to worry about was being deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina. I still ended up spending much time at Eagle Base in Bosnia. 

When 9/11 happened I was already a trained HUMINT Collector. I deployed to AFG in November 2001. I would spend the next 10+ years strictly focused on counterterrorism, amazing how one event was so profound that it fundamentally changed the lives and course of history for millions around the globe.
Great write up as always. Very informative. As a 50 year old, I may be slightly on the older side of the demographics for this sub if I remember the yearly polls correctly. I was in New Orleans at the time getting ready to head out for work at my IBM job in a high rise. I mention that because after watching the strikes, I went to work and they quickly let us go for the day because they had no idea if our building or any high rise in the United States was the next target. I think we closed the whole Central Business District for a few days. It was surreal driving into work thinking the building I was going to might be targeted. Planes were still being forced to land everywhere so we didn't know if some rogue jet might be out there heading towards us.
Well done! Special thanks for the brief but effective pre-emptive strikes against conspiracy theories (e.g. steel beams and and missile strikes on the pentagon). Thanks for doing this.

Can you talk about how much involvement Bin Laden had with the actual planning/execution of the 9/11 attacks?
I was in 9th grade Spanish class when I saw the 2nd plane hit live on television.

Has there been much research done on the effects of us seeing it live on tv like that as a generation?
Thank you for the hard work you put into this sub. It is a true gem.

A question regarding bin Laden’s early life as written in the post. It is mentioned that, during the time of his exile from Saudi Arabia, he ‘kept close contact with various terrorist groups’. 

Only mujahideen and al-Qaeda had been mentioned to that point. Are we to take away that these groups, at that time, were terrorist organizations? Or were there other groups with which he was involved?
I remember the day vividly, even though I experienced it on the other side of the world in NZ. 

The country stood still, people were glued to the TV watching it all unfold, the world changed that day.

My boss bought in his TV and we all just watched in shock, customers would come in and stand in front of the TV with us, not a lot of work was done that day.


just a small question since it was not covered above, was the intended target for Flight 93 ever discovered?
I haven't read all the comments but I'd like to point out that while Bin Laden was angry about US troops being based in Saudi Arabia, US troops don't occupy Islamic holy sites. The Saudi government itself protects the Islamic holy sites (that being one of the primary titles of the Saudi king), although they did call in (hastily converted) French commandos when the Masjid al-Haram (surrounding the Ka'aba) was taken over by Islamic militants in 1979. As far as I understand, US troops are located in bases in Saudi Arabia, just as they are located in bases in Germany, Japan, South Korea, etc. There are, of course, other reasons why Bin Laden might have grievances against the US policy in the Middle East: the US being aligned with Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians, US support for the Egyptian military, which repressed the Muslim Brotherhood, etc.
> In return, he offered details about organizational charts and most  importantly, a way to connect Osama to  the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu in 1993. The CIA was working to gather enough evidence such that if the opportunity presented itself, he could be taken into custody for conspiring to attack the United States.

Was evidence of his (presumably relatively peripheral and indirect) involvement in the Black Hawk Down incident really necessary for taking him into custody? Wouldn’t there have been much stronger evidence for his more direct involvement in the East Africa embassy bombings?
Thank you so much ! For many years I had strongly believed it was an inside job, but you can't beat this facts and events that lead up to it. I feel cleansed and refreshed
Thank you for doing this for all of us. I was 7 months pregnant and watched this on the tv with family members. I live in San Diego and lived under the airports flight path. There is always a 757 fedex airplane that I would go outside and watch as it would fly over. The fear and unknowing during that morning was horrendous. I came from a military family. Marines who fought in Vietnam and the gulf so you can be assured I came from a very right leaning political family. I started college in 2006 and of course my very liberal English professor would have us watch documentaries and follow it with a paper each week. The documentary that stood out the most was Taxi of the Dark Side. Our policies that created Bin Ladens hate for the US should not be ignored. I’m not agreeing with anything that he did but when you start looking closely would the United States have been attacked if it wasn’t for our need of oil?
9/11 - The Naudet brothers documentary from 2002, it really puts the firefighters story in perspective. It’s tough to watch at points as they were following the crew from Firehouse 1. Battalion chief Joseph Pfeifer was the first to call in the plane crash into the North Tower, as he saw it happen from where he was standing on Church and Lispenard street. One of only 3 known video footage of the plane crashing, and some of the only footage from inside the towers as the NYFD were attempting to coordinate the rescue efforts. They were also filming the collapse as it happened from the inside. Highly recommended watching.
[For anyone interested in a live reaction thread on the morning of 9/11 - here's a copy of the Something Awful thread from that morning.](http://www.truegamer.net/SA_911/911%20SATHREAD/)
Is the War in Afghanistan (at least the overthrowing the Taliban part) also fair game to ask on this sub? It's difficult to talk about 9/11 without mentioning the War in Afghanistan (and Iraq); which you did cover on the OP. This is an ongoing conflict and I believe this may push the 20 year rule on a wall for this reason.
Just wanted to say thank you to the writer and editor of this post. It was extremely interesting to read, I’m excited to learn more. Maybe i will pick up one of the books at the end as some reading for 2021.
Great write up. I would suggest reference to Shah Masoud and the Northern alliance not just “rebels” as they were significant factors in the battle against Taliban and Al Qaeda doing most of the fighting. So much so Osama targeted Masoud for assassination 9/10.
How was bin Laden’s citizenship revoked? Was he a dual national or did Saudi Arabia simply forgo international law by making him stateless?
Thank you for posting this.  Been lurking AskHistorians for a long time.

Thought I'd chip in this excellent article from Politico which chronicles Where Air Force One was all day for September 11th, as told by journalists who were on board travelling with President Bush.
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/were-the-only-plane-in-the-sky-214230

It's a really great window into how the "Fog of War" manifested itself that day.
I have a question on the use of "freedom fighters" to describe Mujahideen. I certainly don't mean to impose a relativism, but I am wondering if there is a historical agreement and consensus on their nature and whether this term is objective to describe them as a whole. I see elsewhere in this thread that the groups that received US aid are distinguished from bin Laden's groups. However, I recall in the '80s that in the Cold War in Central America, the language used by the Reagan Administration seemed hyperbolic and propagandistic, almost Orwellian, comparing the Nicaraguan contras to the Founding Fathers of the US, for example. These groups in Afghanistan were certainly fighting a puppet government imposed through military force, but how many would have been fighting to establish something like the Taliban that we in the West would not consider on the side of "freedom"? Would they not be consequential without support of Saudi outsiders? How different would this situation be considered from the Viet Cong in Vietnam fighting the US?
>Controversy surrounds the immediate response of the US military to the attacks, with questions about why the airliners were not shot down (or, conversely, could they have legally been shot down.)

*Could* they legally have been shot down?
Thanks for the excellent write up! There's one more conspiracy theory that always puzzled me: the "presence of thermite" in the debris, suggesting that the structural columns had explosives pre-installed and created progressive collapse. It's an insane theory. But was there actually thermite? And how would it have gotten there? I've never found a good source on it.
Thank you for this great write-up. I have a question about one sentence...
>The group al-Qaeda intended as a more global organization than the mujahideen, was founded in 1988 in order to further Islamic causes....

I don't know anything about the goals of al-Qaeda in 1988, but I've always associated them with Islamist causes, but never as a group dedicated to Islamic causes in general.

**My question** is whether it's actually true that al-Qaeda started as a group dedicated to Islamic causes generally? Or would it have been more accurate to use the word 'Islamist" in that sentence instead of "Islamic"?
Thanks for this wonderful write-up! I remember September 11 so vividly, and the months afterwards, it really changed everything overnight. And now I have to wonder... we’re experiencing more than 3,000 deaths per day from Covid, yet it somehow felt like Sept 11 was a more decisive event in our history. Reminds one of the Spanish Flu, which killed more people than WWI yet is merely a footnote to the war in most tellings. Why do attacks and wars bring so much more change than natural events that kill far more people?
I’d like to ask a question around the 9/11 response. I was 13 at the time of 9/11 and I remember it spawned the concept of freedom fries. Could anyone speak to the history of how that developed? It seems quite puerile now. Did any other foodstuffs or cultural items change names because of 9/11?
This was a fantastic write-up.  Thank you.

My dorm was 4 blocks from the WTC on 9/11 and I can still vividly recall every minute of that day.  It’s always interesting for me to see what others remember (or don’t) because this was the day that changed my life.  At first for worse and then, as years ticked by, for the better.

My 1 year old daughter wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for 9/11 (a story for a different sub).  I look forward to teaching her about my experiences from that day, as painful as it may be, since it is such a significant day of US history.
Great writeup, thanks! Question: How long did it take the U.S. to figure out that bin Laden was responsible for the attack? IIRC, bin Laden took credit for the attack afterwards, but how did they confirm that he wasn't just lying for attention/fundraising?
How did the 1993 WTC attack influence the planning process of 9/11? Obviously, a switch from bombs to planes took place but do we have insights into why and when that plan was made? You spoke briefly about target selection: was the renewed targetting of the WTC just "coincidence" or were both attacks tied together more strongly then by just the attacking organization? Did the WTC seem like a target hard to reach (and save) for first responders?
I think most people around at that time, and old enough to process what was happening, have a, "before 9/11" and "after 9/11" view of American history and the world, it being such a scarring demarcation point for all of us. There hadn't been another moment similar in scope, at least in my mind, until the pandemic.
Thank you so much for this write-up and for keeping the community open to difficult topics like this!

It’s still getting to me how the moments I have and continue to live through are the history of the future and the now. If I’ve learned anything from this sub, it is how much the survival of sources determine how we continue to remember the past. 

While I’m helpless to stop the tragedies that have already occurred when I was little more than an egg, I want to do my part to hold institutional and civilian actors accountable for what happened and what has spiraled into larger ongoing tragedies. (This includes myself, for whatever my part is in all this.) I also want to see those who suffered leading up to and following the attacks to be represented as they are in the future, even though many are barely represented as they are now. 

So... is there anything that I, random person, can do in terms of preserving primary sources about 9/11 and its continued hold on events/movements for future historians? 

I guess I’m also curious about what “holes” are forming in terms of our record on these events. I mean this less in terms of “poking holes” into a narrative and more in terms of “what voices could be better represented in oral history collections on the topic?” or “what does digital decay mean for the future study of online patterns of behavior/belief surround 9/11?” What are some interview projects or other archiving efforts to which you may recommend I contribute?

Many thanks, and Happy New Year!
Oh cool. Since we're on this topic, I just wanted to talk about a recent documentary I watched called the "power of nightmare" in which the documentary maker assert that Al Qaeda was not a terrorist network but rather a loose group of people who received funding from Osama and went to carry out their own terrorist attacks. The assertion is that the neo-Conservative wanted to create a common enemy to combat the decay brought about by the Liberal policies, and thus the enemy they had created was "imaginary" and that the attack was an act carried out only by Osama money, but otherwise was not a vast terrorist network. 

How grounded in truth is that? Also, was it really a neo-Conservative agenda to build a country foundation myth as asserted by the documentary? While I'm not a conspiracy nuts, "the power of nightmare" felt like the first time I'm witnessing conspiracy theories first hand...
>(Note: The United States, though the CIA, was funding the Afhgan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992.)

Did you mean "through the CIA"? Otherwise great writeup thanks for the information!
Thanks for the awesome summary, it was very informative!

I got a couple follow up questions, let me know if any of them would work better as a standalone post:

* What was airport security like before 9/11?

* How was Rudy Giuliani viewed before the attacks?

* I heard that several tv stations showed footage of Palestinians celebrating on the day, have any historians studied the Palestinian reaction to 9/11 in more detail? Is there even enough material for a historian to study this topic?

* What was the conspiracy theory community like in 2001 and how quickly did it react to the attacks? Did new conspiracy minded groups appear in relative separation from the earlier ones or was there continuity in general?
> He objected to the US occupying Islam’s holy places (which included the Gulf War occupation), and had specific grievance with the US's continued support of Israel and the Saudi royals. For him, it was clearly not just a religious matter, but also personal and political.


Why did American occupation continue after the first Gulf War?


I've heard a lot, constantly, about how 9/11 was basically America's fault for its interventionism. That America "made a mess of the region." How much truth is there to that and how much did that have an effect on bin Laden's motivations?


Did any of the terrorists who the CIA fund in that area turn around and attack America or is that a myth?
Thanks for the amazing write-up. I was still a kid when the attacks happened, so it's quite interesting to hear details about the world before-hand. A few follow-up questions:

1. I remember a common reaction after the attacks (especially among kids) was why didn't the passengers overwhelm/fight the hijackers, and being told that prior to 9/11 the general expectation was that passengers would survive a hijacking (Because it was a fugitive trying to escape or get hostages). Would you say that's true? Was there any real precedent for this kind of all-out suicidal hijacking?

2. Hunter S Thompson wrote a now quite famous essay the day after the attacks where he predicted that this would be the start of a never-ending war. I know the general consensus was definitely that some form of war was inevitable, but how "out there" was the idea that the US would end up in a never-ending series of war and terrorist attacks? Were any more "mainstream" commentators predicting this sort of thing?

3. Bin Laden was very quickly identified in the Press as the potential mastermind of the attacks (even the Thompson essay from the next day mentions him), he was clearly well-known to the intelligence services and the White House, but how well-known was he to the American public? Was he a known figure from the news?

Thanks again!
This is a question for mods and historians. How accurate is the book Looming Tower?
I think it is an excellent idea to go ahead and let it pass into the sub now. Many users will not even have been born when it happened and frankly, schools are not that great at addressing it so it is a positive thing for people to have this as a resource
Thank you. Was there more about Osama’s disdain for the US? IIRC, he shared a video and a letter addressed the the US that mentions his reasonings. I believe at least one reason had to due with destruction the US military had caused including the burning and collapse of a tower that may have had women and children occupying it.
Who do I complain to about things I experienced now being r/askhistorians fodder? 🤣
I think this is a good write up that gives a pretty basic outline of the timeline of events. But there is an obvious question here that I've been actually wondering since this happened.

During the "what happened after"  section, it gives a quote and then goes right into how the US/British forces were fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Prior to this point, there is no mention of the Taliban at all, and any mention to the opposing faction references Al-Quaeda. 

Who are the Taliban, why are they important to this scenario, and why are they seemingly interchangeable with Al-Quaeda in regards to 9/11?
I hope there are more questions about Salvador Allende this September as well. 

Also because this is a meta thread and we can express opinions, war is bad and every war is based on lies. 

A motto for AskHistorians 2023: ["If it's a lie, then we fight on that lie."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHol7WW2A8g)
How did other countries respond to the 9/11 attacks? Did the US have to convince other leaders to go on the Osama man hunt or did they extend a hand for help?
Thank you for this.   A lot of contextual pieces of information that had been missing from the cacophony of ‘news’ while we lived through this time.   

Some points I disagree with regarding the events of the day, but I have learned to live with the few things I believe and do not try argue my position anymore.   I will say some of what was written did soften a few of my beliefs and for that, thank you.
[removed]
Was their ever any investigation or cause to investigate stock sales immediately prior to 9/11?

I remember a lot of people believing there was smoke but not if there was any fire.
[removed]
Great write-up. I was in middle school on Long Island on 9/11 and remember a commercial airliner crashing near Far Rockaway two months after the attacks. People assumed the worst. And the anthrax chapter. Scary times
I will NEVER forget Sept. 9th 2001...

https://www.npr.org/2011/09/09/140328019/a-decade-ago-massouds-assassination-preceded-sept-11

I distinctly remember seeing the news of his killing on the nightly news and thinking, 'Oh shit'

BTW his dead was due to  a fake 2 man  TV crew that blew up a bomb hidden in a  camera...."Massoud was assassinated at the instigation of al-Qaeda and the Taliban in a suicide bombing on September 9, 2001."
Has there ever been any factual evidence of what the 4th target was supposed to be?
Just want to say thank you to you all for posting this. So much valuable information that I believe a majority of the population does not even remotely know about. I think it is so important to have at least some of the facts and keep this history alive. I have actually married into a family who lost a father in the North tower who was working at one of the firms above the impact and they have reminders of him all over the house just to keep him alive. Growing up distant from the city and then moving to the area are two completely different experiences. Here in Long Island there are memorials in every town because so many were lost and it brings home the human connection. Every year we go to a ceremony and I have noticed the crowd is slowly dwindling. I’m sure this year will be large because of it being the 20th anniversary but after it is so crucial to keep their memories alive because of how much impact this date has had on our nation and the world in so many ways. I know this was a little bit of a rambling but if anyone has any questions on what  it’s like to be part of a large Irish-American family that has lost someone please message me. Have a safe and healthy 2021
Thank you for that thorough recap.

I was quite interested in the towers collapsed as ran into a misleading documentary in 2006 pushing the conspiracy theory for their controlled demolition.

I will be looking forward associated threads that, I hope, will help me debunk what I still feel as "too big not to have been planned either side". Thank you for upcoming insights !

Edit: maybe my post needs to contain a question so here's what it'd be : **What are today the best factual source that could debunk the controlled demolition of the WTC towers ?**
This is a great read, it is really delighted for me as I was born on 2002, around one year after the event (miss a few date till the 1 year anniversary). However, base on my parents' stories, the emotion was quite mixed in Vietnam. Many feels sorry for the victims while many think USA deserved it. It is quite a common belief that USA themselves created the terrorists to get punished by themselves. This reading however give me many new POV from the events that is rarely mention in VN media.
>Their task was to intercept and destroy any hijacked airliner that might attempt to enter DC airspace. The rapidity of the order, however, meant that the F-16s were sent out unarmed. As a result, both pilots were acutely aware that their orders were, essentially, to commit suicide. They would have had to ram the incoming B757, with Sasseville ordering Penney to strike the tail while he would strike the nose. The chances of a successful ejection would have been minuscule.

This is interesting to me, as I have not heard about this kamikaze-style order being given. Was this a top down order or something Sasserville came up with "on the fly"?

Has either pilot commented since about whether he would have followed through with this plan had they arrived in time?

Does US military code/law allow for orders of this nature? Have there been similar "suicide orders" given in the past, and were they carried out?
I find it fascinating to read the comments here, where people are describing how they feel about 9/11. I was technically alive during that day, but was so young that I have no memory of the event, and to me it is most certainly history. I think even just having lived through it makes people perceive the media around it differently than I do. I find I rarely even hear about 9/11 anymore outside of wacko conspiracy theorists (and Rudy Giuliani, although six of one...) although I suspect the history side of 9/11 becoming more prominent will change that, at least for me.
I remember in PA primary schools we had a small memorial every 9/11 until roughly 2011.
Fantastic write-up. I remember the movie Zeitgeist talking at length about how 9/11 was orchestrated and there's a particular claim it made that I'd like to ask about, to separate the fact from fiction.

According to the author and the people interviewed, there were training exercises with the exact same scenario - hijacked commercial flights - happening at the exact same time as the attacks, which confused the response. A cursory check on Wikipedia says these were Global Guardian and Vigilant Guardian. Apparently the author Michael Ruppert claimed that

> General Arnold, Tech. Sgt. W. Powel and Lt. Col. Dwane Deskins have stated that when they first were informed about hijacked airliners they thought it was "part of the exercise".

Anyway thanks for the great read!
So three buildings fell in NYC that day? WTC 7 collapsed due to fire?
I was eleven when President John Kennedy was assassinated. I remember it clearly, through television coverage. The same with the assassination of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. 

The murders of students at Kent State. The police riots at the Chicago Democratic Convention. 

9/11. That horrible day. I still have to turn away at the sight of those planes crashing into WTC buildings.

BLM beatings, police shooting people. 

I've left out a lot of horrible events, naturally. Wars, starvation, pandemics.

I have no magic wand to make it all vanish. But my thanks to historians who bring facts, context and an educated perspective. I will share this post with my grandchildren who are too young to remember, but old enough to understand.
Where does the 20 year rule come from? I understand the reason why people would use it, but to think you can teach history without applying it to the present seems absurd
Why isn't Operation Infinite Reach mentioned in this summary? That seems like a pretty big hole in the narrative.
Can there please be a special flair for posts about 9/11? My father was there and things about it, especially close to the anniversary, give me panic attacks.
Thanks. 9/11 Truthers must be permablocked.
Good luck fending off the truthers.
Thank you so much for this post!

Two questions:

Firstly, is it possible to estimate when we will get a comprehensive history of 9/11 that deals with the background, the events of the day and the aftermath? Something like Midnight in Chernobyl? Is it even possible or fair to expect such a history given that the US government may simply keep a huge number of relevant documents classified?

Secondly, would it be possible for someone to review some of the "oral histories" about 9/11 that are already available? I was thinking of books like [The Only Plane in the Sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43821581-the-only-plane-in-the-sky) I quite liked the book, but since it presents only some eyewitness testimonies, I am not sure about the completeness of the picture presented.
There's no question that the prevalence of myopia (nearsightedness) was much lower in the Middle Ages than today. No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there's been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn't itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I'll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on *visuality* in some pretty basic ways I'm not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn't see their own shoes. "Art is the book of the illiterate" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.

But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between "impairment" and "disability." Impairment *in this sense* is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone's functioning in the world. Here, I'm going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.


This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that's "not quite blindness," although we should keep in mind that "blind" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.

Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary's miracles concerns a girl who, it's clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can't even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval "roads" could just be a trampled line through fields). There's a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (*macula*, stains) and similarly couldn't find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it. 

In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being "led" to shrines. That's probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.

With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn't see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke's household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!

The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin's in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted:

> I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I was
already an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, the
stars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything at
a distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.

The first "glasses", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). [Here's a photo](https://imgur.com/a/7KRHt) I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)

Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that *do* involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes. 

That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. *Twice in a row* he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)

But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said "I got u, fam" and *negotiated* his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn't about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn't rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.

But then, of course, there's the ultimate solution. Can't fight like a knight, can't hunt as well as you want to?

Write a book about it.

And Frederick did.
Hi there! If you're wondering where all of the comments are, you should know that we ask that answers in this subreddit be in-depth and comprehensive, and remove ones that fail to meet this standard. If you're new here and want to contribute, please take the time to familiarize yourself with [the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer), and be sure that your answer demonstrates these four key points:

* [Do I have the expertise needed to answer this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jsabs/what_it_means_to_post_a_good_answer_in/)
* [Have I done research on this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4kngwh/rules_roundtable_no_11_no_speculation/)
* [Can I cite academic quality primary and secondary sources?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3wn71y/rules_roundtable_1_explaining_the_rules_about/)
* Can I answer follow-up questions?

The good news is that popular questions like this [almost always get a good answer](/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/) - it just takes some time. While waiting, please do not post just to say that you can't see any comments - *11* of the 25 removed here at the time I wrote this comment were on this subject, driving up the count and making everyone else even more curious.

In the meantime, you might want to check out [our Twitter](http://twitter.com/askhistorians), where we post links to great answers every day, or our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/askhistorians/).

Thank you for your patience!

I sometimes worry our kindly mods get worn down from getting pushback sometimes and having to delete so many comments of people not following the rules. Even if the silent majority of us are silent because the rules dictate it as such, know that you are appreciated!
I agree completely. Mods make it great, but let me also say that this community gives me constant reminders that there are people who want to learn, are flexible in their beliefs, and who are kind and appreciative of others. It is absolutely a place to restore faith in humanity.
I think this sub is really important beyond just learning history, since it shows how to critically think about questions that don't have easily verifiable answers, or where all the facts aren't clear. I did Computer Science, and the amount of incorrect information that gets thrown around online is relatively small (by internet standards of course, though it does happen!), because it's comparatively straightforward to verify if something is true or not (run the program!).

With history, the information about the event can be incomplete, or there can be conflicting accounts, or accounts that have significant bias, or people can just make stuff up because their priority is to sell books anyways.

This sub shows, through really high quality answers, how to sift through all that and still present a useful answer, even if the answer is "we don't really know very well, here's why".
I am a little disappointed when I open the 28 comments for an interesting question, and find only a sea of [deleted]. But far more than that, I remain deeply impressed by the mods' tireless war against low effort posting, so that the door remains open for another great answer.
[deleted]
I want to take this opportunity to throw in my own "thank you!" to the mods.
Best sub on reddit 10/10
I completely agree. Even though the rules mean the silent majority can’t post, I still love being a part of this community
 My favourite sub hands down. Always exciting for the subjects that are covered. Recently enjoyed with the topic being a murderer in middle ages in London, even spoke with friends about it.
I spend a solid amount of my reddit time scrolling through this sub and discovering new questions that I'd never think to ask on my own. I save the unanswered ones to read later, and time after time I return to treasure troves of information. Thank you to everyone who keeps this place a bright spot on a too-often dark site.
And thank you so much to everyone who takes the time to write long, multi-paragraph answers that are easily digestible for all of us to understand!! Also the to people who come up with amazingly interesting questions that never seem to cross my mind! Thank you!!
This is awesome to read. This sub is an excellent example of the internet working as intended; the sharing of knowledge. Hats off to the mods. I don't know where they get the energy to fight the good fight but I damn well appreciate them doing it.

Thanks for saying what a lot of us (I assume) are thinking OP.
As a huge prolific lover of history, while I have contributed only a few times I keep coming back and loving many times. Great job
Agreed, 100%.

This is not just my favourite subreddit, but also one of my favourite places on the internet. I've been following for years and this opinion hasn't changed one bit.
I actually was thinking of making a thank you message similar to this. The historians haven't answered some of my really dumb questions (which is fair cause some of my questions are usually answerable via Google)but they present such a wealth of knowledge that an idiot like me who at one point thought I was a history god because I played games like CIv, total war and paradox games become more humble. They avoid bias as much as possible and always provide a huge amount of sources. Then there's the mods who deal with weird comments and idiots like me who comment before reading the rules. Both thank you for being patient with guys like me and sorry for being annoying. And lastly I think a huge thanks is deserved for the people who ask the questions. I've had a very eurocentric education and a lot of the questions are of things I would have never even heard of happening before. This is all around just an amazing sub
I'm another 'never comment, always enjoy' member. Thank you!
Yes!! Thank you to both the mods and all the writers. The quality of information in the answers that make it through moderation is just amazing and inspiring. Even more than that, they tend to be so incredibly entertaining, it is clear every day that the commenters care so deeply about their fields and about sharing what they know with whoever asks. It makes me so happy!
This subreddit has been beyond helpful for finding quality responses to questions that linger in my head after watching a movie or just in the middle of the day. The first day I joined this sub, I opened the FAQ and opened all the ones I was interested into new tabs. Needless to say, it took probably a full week before I cleared my browser. The mods and people who are so passionate about answering thoughtfully and footnotes that have aided in my own research are unsung heroes. Thank you all to making this my favorite slice of the internet.
Believe it or not, this sub is the reason I switched my major from accounting to history
Shoutout to the amazing mods, for keeping this sub safe and sound !
I'm honestly amazed how fair the mods are around here. Some... less specialized reddits are sometimes more power-hungry and delete posts left and right. Here, mods seem to understand that our knowledge doesn't come with sources attached and is rather a collection of experiences we had, so as long as we form our comments in a proper way, and provide useful information - even if at times it's flawed - it is easy to communicate.

I'm no historian, but I learn history (specifically up to 16th century) as a hobby (well, partially for work, but shh) every day, and sometimes get the flash "oh, I know this one!". My comments were never straight-out removed, as we all know - people will correct ya if you're wrong.

On the contrary, on some subs that are in my professional field, I've been asked to add sources to my posts. Like... my entire career?

So, yeah, thank you for being human and treating us as such. Y'all doing great job.
I'm blown away at level of effort put forth in responses sometimes.  I'm pretty sure y'all have jobs (at least pre corona and summer) and have explained the same things 100 times, but you just keep going.

Big thanks to all the mods and actual historians.
I'm fairly new to this sub but it is of my favourite places on Reddit and the web in general. Thank you to the mods who are incredible, and thank you to questioners and all the people who answer. A fantastic community.
I once asked why pop songs are ~3 minutes long on this sub and got the most [thorough answer imaginable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6v1jtj/when_and_how_did_3_minutes_become_the_standard/). Fantastic sub, and thanks /u/hillsonghoods for putting in the work.
I highly respect this sub for sticking to its method or criteria. It also makes me think critically about my personal sources of information. 

Which is a question I would like to ask here to you guys, my fellow readers, as well: I believe (correct me if I’m wrong) that the responses here need to demonstrate to have followed a scientific method, citing sources, etc. 

However, for some, especially in the Middle East, a lot of the sources are oral. Now Im not debating that there is a flaw in the rationale of oral sources, we are all aware that information does not pass 100% well through oral alone, but written works can get destroyed, altered, etc. Just as easily.  

My point is: instead of saying personal experiences (ie, heard from my grandpa that it was this and this) are not valid responses, why not have a set up in which we clearly state the context, of said oral response. It is then up to the readers to debate the veracity / likeliness, etc. 

My point being that all responses have a degree of validity that can be debated. So of someone asks, who built the pyramids? And I answer: according to Islamic folk lore it was built by Djinn (or demons?) that were under the control of King Solomon and this is mostly believed in areas XXX and YYY and country ZZZ has this variant to that same response, etc. It should still be a valid response because throughout history people believed it and maybe still do. 

I know it didn’t answer the OP question, what Im trying to say is we should have a way to provide answers that are not academically valid, but in an academic way to promote discussion and analysis.
Completely agree! Don't think I've went a day on Reddit without learning something from this sub. And a shout-out to the moderators for keeping the quality of responses so top-notch.

The one thing I would like changed however is make sources mandatory in replies. There's been many times when an answer has had something to do with an essay I'm writing and I'm wanting the source so I can read more about it and hopefully it helps me with my essay, but on older comments it's often too late to ask for a source.

But that's only a minor pretty niche thing. A big thank you to everyone who asks the questions and answers them!
Thank you for sending me down rabbit holes of research into topics that have puzzled me for decades. I had a poor education and this sub has changed my life. There is a deep personal richness in discovery. The historians here have made me a rich old lady. I much appreciate all your work.
You said it! 

And just while we're allowed to real briefly. Massive thank you to the mods from me too. You guys rock!
I also want to add my thank you. Every time I visit my Reddit feed I hope to find an r/AskHistorians post(and I usually do). After reading a comprehensive answer on this sub I feel as if I didn't just visit reddit to quench my boredom but to learn something as well.

Thank you, squad of moderators, for your voluntary time and effort to bring us, millions of readers, the joy of being well informed on various topics of history!
I love this sub. Whenever I read a question I know the answer of, I immediately ask myself: "yes, but can I answer properly?"  And usually I skip:) it's a great exercise in self restraint.
I consider this sub an indispensable resource. It's a magical thing to have a direct line to professionals on this stuff. I've especially learned a lot about historiography here and how to make good choices on proper learning materials. Thank you all who run this place for all you do!
I want to add my "thank you" to this community. AskHistorians is a precious source on Reddit and internet. Thank you!
This place is a diamond in the rough, balanced discussion is a rare thing on the Internet nowadays. Best sub on reddit hands down, never difficult to learn something new and interesting ❤️
Defibitely agree. I'll take this occasion to also thank the mods for the hard work. You are very appreciated.
I'm new here, and I'm no historian, but I do love reading your answers and learning new things -- so much so that you're now my default "what to do when I have nothing to do" page. Thank you all!
I've always (less than two years on Reddit) wanted to say something like this, but never have because I thought it would get deleted. Thank you for posting, thanks to the Mods for keeping this sub on the straight and narrow and a huge thanks to all the amazing people who have responded to all of these great questions with amazing and well written answers. I'm sure some of you get tired of the same questions getting asked, but for someone who hasn't seen them, they are new to me!

Thanks so much, I love this sub!
This is an incredible community here that I love and adore. Perfect timing to! Interested lurkers and community members should check out yesterdays [Rules Roundtable XXIV: What Can a Non-Flair Do to Help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i6b2l7/rules_roundtable_xxiv_what_can_a_nonflair_do_to/)
Nothing better than finding a thread asking a question you never knew you wanted the answer to. Fantastic community
Although all the mods and answerers on here do an amazing job I'd like to say special thanks to /u/EnclavedMicrostate - their answers on Chinese history are always absolutely fascinating, detailed and easy to read but it seems the posts rarely get upvotes so the answers don't get as much exposure. But I always enjoy coming across one.
It is amazing to me that so many people here have enough knowlege, but mostly time, to write this stuff up.  Thank you all
My favorite thing about this sub is reading a super in depth answer and like ten minutes in being like "why do I care about [insert random super specific topic]?" And then I keep reading until I finish because it's strangely fascinating. So many things I didn't even know were a thing and I love it.
Just want to chime in to agree. Most heavy-handedly moderated sub is also most even-handedly moderated sub, with best content-to-click ratio.

Thanks you magnificent bastards. You guys are like the Past in my Al Pastor.
I have learned sooo much from this subreddit, I can not thank you all enough. I actually hated learning about history until I got here and now I can't get enough. The professionalism and knowledge that you all display is astounding. Keep up the good work!
Thank you mods, we like this sub a lot!
I absolutely love this sub but I'll admit. I will see a brilliantly written question that paints an amazing picture only to realize it hadn't been answered. Depressing! But that's a testament to the idea that quality is above just filling a blank spot. So thank you for the hard work the mods put in and also the historians enlightening all of us.
> I don’t think a day has gone by without my learning something.

I just had a shower thought that I learn a lot just from reading the questions on /r/AskHistorians , much less the answers. While it's disappointing to see empty answers, it's still fun to read and consider the interesting questions that pop up.
This is pretty much the only sub where I don't say anything unless I have something substantial and informative to say. A lot of times I just upvote posts with no comnents so they're more likely to get answers. But when I find something that has been answered it such a treat! The fact that most comments are by professionals in the field makes this qualitatively one of the best subs on Reddit.
Yes! This sub is incredible and so, so interesting. And it's entirely due to the moderators and contributors! Thank you all so much for the immense amount of work that you put into this place to make it so great.
Not my usual type of comment but
"share the love"
Another person saying thanks you
Hear, hear!
Highest quality subreddit hands down and you can't argue.
Best mods on reddit
Thank you mods !!
What they said. This is my favorite place on the internet.
Best sub on reddit
Howcome so many comments are deleted on other posts? They just talking out their ass or what?
I never post here, but lurk. Thank you so much for the contributors to this sub-reddit as I have learned so much.

Thank you.
This sub is straight up education. The mods do a fantastic job and the overall knowledge here is inspiring and humbling.
Hear hear! Excellent moderation, excellent questions, and a highly knowledgable group of members who dedicate their precious time to informing and educating us all.
you guys are awesome. thank you
Thank you!
The only time this sub disappoints me is when I see a question I'm eager to learn about, see that it has several replies, but then when I open the thread they're all deleted.  


But hell that tiny minute of disappointment is a price I gladly pay for knowing this place is well moderated and keeps to its rules. I said this before in a moderator-related thread, but hell its worth repeating: The mods foster a positive learning environment here, it is welcoming to all, as it should be. It's a small thing, but I appreciate it a lot. Thankyou AskHistorians mods!
I go to sleep with Ask Historians every night. I figure if I haven’t learned anything all day (not common), I still have a chance at night.
I do worry about this subreddit though. I have seen some questions asked here which are down voted to the point they're marked as controversial. There's nothing inflammatory in those questions. Certainly a great sub for learning something new, I just wonder what else we would see if not for user votes.
Your timing of this post is uncanny to me because I quite literally *just* told a friend whom hasn't been on reddit long that he should check this sub out, how much I learn from it and that I wanted to read through the rules for posting because I would love to thank the whole community of the sub for that. 

Cool coincidence!
This sub is a wonder of the world. All my respect to the mods and contributors.
Hi I'm a russian bot, fite me irl
>I actually come here to learn

This is why I wish it wouldn't show up on my front page.

OMG Awesome question, 100 comments ... all deleted

I guess that's why it's such a great place though, only the relevant stuff makes it through.
This is what the internet should be used for.
Dear mods- your harsh enforcement of the rules is what allows this quality to flourish.
Thank You
I love this sub because of the high quality answers. I appreciate the hard work that the mods do to make sure that the answers are up to standards.
I think it is my favorite sub ever! Thank you mods
I follow r/history only because it reminds me of how extraordinarily good this is by comparison. Also, this thread is moderated with a professionalism that most corporations would be envious of. I've had questions I've posted in the past be removed, and never felt irritated or resentful because it's always been justified by the existence of a well thought out and longstanding policy, rather than being removed arbitrarily - and where a question has had merit, moderators have helped suggest ways to rephrase the question to be acceptable
I particularly enjoy the references to further reading that are often given for answers here, it has made major contributions to my reading list!
While this thread is active, I'll just toss in one more accolade. I love the professionalism here. I love the experts who take the time to craft outstanding and often lengthy replies to a multitude of topics. I love how much I learn here. None of this would be possible if not for the excellent framework for this sub, and the excellent (strict, fair and always keeping the sub on focus) moderation. Thanks guys!
Absolutely! I did as the mods suggested and signed up for the subreddit summary bot to get a weekly digest, instead of hoping to find answers to questions the day they were posted. I always really look forward to my weekly dose of history!
Agreed! This is the one subreddit I can count on for informed answers, & I read it every day! I'm also very thankful for the mods & contributers who make it incredible!
I gotta hand it to the mods, they work tirelessly and usually with little thanks. But I know if I read an answer in here it's true.
Thanks for all the fantastic posts here! It's a team effort but that's a hell yeah to the mods!
Best sub on reddit,  by far
> highest return subreddit on the internet

yeah kinda weird that only Reddit has subreddits
This subreddit is great if you're not the one asking questions
This sub has gone down hill for me for the sheer amount of questions that get highly upvoted, yet have ZERO comments, and the ones that just have [deleted] all the way through.

Everything I care about has nothing, yet the most boring mundane questions get a 10 paragraph report.
Unpopular opinion.  I don't like this subreddit at all.  I get all excited about a subject, and even check ... 60 comments.  Open it up.  Nothing.  Comment deleted.  Comment deleted. Of  20 posts on this subreddit,  1 might have a response good enough.  

I can't tell you how many times I open up a thread, curiosity aroused, only to be crushed by nothing.  Another thread with nothing.  What percentage of threads actually ever have a discussion?  Very few.  The perfect certainly gets in the way of the good.

AskHistorians is where good questions go to die.

I wish we had a sub for AskHistoryQuestions, then.  It would be much more interesting and informative.

So, no thanks from me.  This thread does more to discourage interest in learning about history than any place on reddit.  So, sit on your academic thrones, mods, doing your great work of crushing interest and discussion about history.  Nothing but empty threads.  Yeah, I need to unsubscribe,
I just wish that all answers in this subreddit would always include a TL;DR
I still wish the mods would implement something to indicate when a post has gotten a reply that isn't going to be deleted. I don't particularly care what people call it.

I realize the argument is "but, contributors don't want that!", I still want it as a person who reads things here.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians) if you have any questions or concerns.*
I have to start with: I don't know, exactly. I'm not entirely sure whether anyone knows. The unfortunate thing about studying historical material culture is that people in the past often failed to record very commonplace practices because they never felt the need to. Imagine being a person in the future who only knows doors with magnetic key cards and automatic locks, trying to figure out how we today decide when to lock doors and how keys physically work. The Duc de Saint-Simon noted in his memoir of life at Louis XIV's court in the early eighteenth century that the king did have a "little short wig" that he wore when he "appeared" in bed, but that likely means that he had it on by the time he performed the *lever* rising ceremony - not necessarily that he wore it the entire time he was in bed.

One thing we do know, however, is that men didn't typically wear wigs at all times. When relaxing or going to bed, men customarily removed them and replaced them with embroidered caps [such as this one owned by the Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18474003/). These caps actually predated the fashion of wigs - they were worn as replacements for hats during the sixteenth century as well.

[White linen cap embroidered with black and silver acorns, 1550-1600](https://collections.lacma.org/node/2110101)

[White linen cap embroidered with metallic and black floral vines, 16th century](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/116887)

[White linen cap embroidered with white linen, ca. 1550](https://www.photo.rmn.fr/archive/00-009349-2C6NU04T1AWV.html)

[White linen cap embroidered with black and silver leafy vines, 1580-1620](https://collections.lacma.org/node/2092825)

[White linen cap embroidered with silver and colored trees and flowers, 1600-1624](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O73335/nightcap-unknown/)

[White linen cap embroidered with silver, gold, colored silk, and spangles, 1600-1624](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O15344/nightcap-unknown/)

In terms of both materials and embroidery designs, these are actually quite similar to women's coifs and informal jackets of the period, interestingly enough.

By the end of the century, when men tended to wear them as replacements for wigs rather than hats, it was more common for men's caps to be made of a colored fabric and embroidered with larger motifs.

[Yellow silk cap embroidered with flowers, 1675-1725](https://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/39595.html)

[Yellow and blue silk cap embroidered with flowers, 1680-1720](https://manchesterartgallery.org/collections/title/?mag-object-14671)

[Brocaded silk cap, 1700-1750](https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4134229)

These caps were usually worn while men were partially dressed, with their doublets or coats off and with a dressing gown (called at the time a morning gown, wrapping gown, banyan, or other terms) on. Despite their extremely basic construction during this period - made in the shape of a T, typically with no fastenings, although they could be belted with a sash - they were symbols of wealth and leisure, usually made out of silk or imported cotton calico, which at the time was somewhat exotic. In the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, it's noted that Louis XIV had dressing gowns, and that he even wore them to dine in front of courtiers toward the very end of his life.

As I noted in an earlier answer to [a question about how people had sex in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9m5t8o/what_was_having_sex_like_in_the_18th_and_19th/e7cu1fk/),

>But how often would married couples go from zero to sex? While premarital sex happened in all kinds of places depending on when couples could get alone time, marital activities seem to have generally been done in the marital bed. It's hard to find direct evidence of this, at least in the sources I have to hand, but the fact that women who wanted to avoid their husband asserting his conjugal rights (i.e. marital rape) often achieved this by avoiding the bed - by having their own bedroom, by staying up late with work, by sleeping with the children - implies that most sexual activity would be expected to happen there. (Separate bedchambers were the norm for the upper and upper-middle classes, with the wealthiest even having attached dressing rooms. I can't say exactly how far down the social scale they continued, but the working classes definitely shared beds and bedrooms.) In these cases, women and men would have already undressed and be in nightclothes, so the point is rather moot.

The majority of the sex that Louis XIV had was outside of his marriage, but the point likely still stands. Television spices up sexuality in order to titillate the viewers, but there's no reason to think that he typically went directly from full dress to sex. He had no need to be secretive, and could arrange to visit his mistresses in their official apartments or have them come to his own at his leisure, when he was in relaxed dress, probably after the *coucher* ceremony where he was put to bed. In which case, the day's wig would most likely have been on its stand and a cap on his head, although it's possible that he would have tried to wear his short bed-wig (though it seems unlikely, since there would have been nothing to hold it on during vigorous movement).
The short answer to this question is, *possibly* wig-off, but it's a little more complex than that.

Louis XIV wore his own, natural hair long as a young man, but allegedly made the move to wigs at some point in his late 20s or early 30s, to cover baldness. The exact date is disputed - I've found two secondary sources, one of which states [c. 1660](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LsX69fpZOTAC&pg=PA45&dq=%22louis+xiv%22+wigs&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22louis%20xiv%22%20wigs&f=false), the other [1672](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=682uCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=%22louis+xiv%22+wigs&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22louis%20xiv%22%20wigs&f=false). However, we can be certain that Louis is wearing wigs from about the age of 30 onwards, if not earlier.

[This portrait](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg) by Charles LeBrun, dated c.1661 when Louis would have been 23, is ambiguous - the hair is very full, but the style is meant to appear natural. [Another portrait](http://collections.chateauversailles.fr/#3e830341-9e66-4bb6-8bb2-24bac34e7007) of that period, in pastel, shows the young king with shorter hair, but again with a natural appearance. For contrast, this later portrait, probably painted after 1671, shows a more obviously 'wiggy' appearance, in terms of the volume and shape of the hairstyle. From this period onwards, Louis' wigs get more and more stylised and artificial in shape, with the crown of the hair puffed higher and higher, so by the time you get to the 1680s and 90s, you're dealing with [this](http://collections.chateauversailles.fr/#f1db155b-873c-4f23-b586-bf3e59b86e60).

Anyway, let's assume we're dealing with Louis in a wiggy period of his life - and, just for info, it would have been referred to as a *perruque*, which makes its way into English as 'periwig', from which: wig. Although you do see occasional English references to 'perukes' being worn in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The full wig of this period was not an easy thing to wear. Aside from being large and heavy, there was no apparatus to ensure that it was anchored to the head, particularly as the natural hair underneath was normally worn cropped short. Of course, a man of Louis' wealth and prestige could call upon the expertise of the very best *perruquiers*, or wigmakers, and would have enjoyed a bespoke service that included fitting the wigs to the dimensions of his head. Nonetheless, they were unwieldy. When being fitted for his first wig in 1663, the London diarist Samuel Pepys records his dislike of the fashion, on account of the '[trouble](https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/05/09/)' it entails. He also records several incidents in which gentlemen of the court had their [wigs pulled off](https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/05/09/) in arguments.

A wig was a marker of status and prestige, and by the late 17th century it was an essential part of men's formal dress. By the mid-18th century, most men bar the poorest, and a few holdouts who preferred their own hair, wore wigs, at least for formal occasions if not every day. The deliberate artificiality of Louis XIV's court at Versailles, and the importance of dress and deportment in demarcating social hierarchy, meant that the King was no more likely to go without his wig in public, than without his shirt or shoes. This [secondary source](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXHCAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA111&ots=CLVmbJux7W&dq=louis%20xiv%20wig%20burned&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=louis%20xiv%20wig%20burned&f=false) claims that only the King's barber was permitted to see him without a wig on - despite the fact that his daily dressing and undressing (the *lever* and *coucher*) were ritual events attended by favoured courtiers.

To work out whether this extreme degree of formality extended to the bedroom, we need a sense of how 17th and 18th century Europeans approached heterosexual sex. Vic Gatrell observes, in [City of Laughter](https://atlantic-books.co.uk/book/city-of-laughter/), that if satirical and erotic prints of the period are remotely accurate, people were far more likely to remain at least partially dressed during sex, and to do it sitting or standing up, rather than horizontal. Allowing for some artistic license, there are visual clues which suggest that the wig would have been worn during sex. A slightly later, but still useful, example, is William Hogarth's [Before and After](https://www.princeton.edu/~graphicarts/2011/04/before_and_after.html). This pair of images show the scene leading up to, and after, an ambiguous sexual encounter in which the question of consent is not entirely clear. Either way, the male protagonist is still wearing his wig in the second, 'after' image.

There were precedents for men appearing without their wig in a public setting, as those with the means to have their portraits painted could choose to appear in a soft cap or turban covering the head, or even with the hair short and natural, usually worn with a robe or dressing gown. However, this mode signified informality and scholarship, and would not have been appropriate for the image of kingly grandeur which Louis wished to project. It's something you find in Sir Godfrey Kneller's portraits of people like [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Kneller#/media/File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg) and the philosopher [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Kneller#/media/File:JohnLocke.png) \- not a royal image.

So, without being able to offer you a definitive answer, it is at least plausible that Louis XIV kept his wig on for at least some of his sexual encounters. It's fun to speculate that, with his mistresses of many years' standing - Madame de Montespan, for example - he might have permitted a greater degree of intimacy, but we have no proof either way. I'd like to think that he gave himself a break from the wig while in bed, because all the evidence points to there being a very real risk of it falling off in the middle of things, which honestly sounds like a passion-killer, even from a 21st century perspective.
Wasn't the main reason they wore wigs was to hide syphilis?

Unfortunately, your question is based on an incorrect assumption.  The Spanish Flu of 1918 did not stop spreading.  It became one of the seasonal flu variants that circulated in the population[1].

The question is why did the subsequent seasons result in much fewer deaths.  The dominant hypothesis is that there was a rapid mutation to a less deadly strain after the second wave.  It is a recognized tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal over time as the deadlier strains die out, though pathogenic viruses can always mutate into a deadlier strains.  In 1952-1953 there was an influenza epidemic of the H1N1 variant that had a peculiar mortality curve, affecting the young more then the old, because the older people had some immunity due to having been exposed to the earlier 1918 variant[2].

The 1957 H2N2 pandemic, followed by the H3N2 pandemic largely crowded out the H1N1 1918 Spanish Flu from the seasonal circulation in the human population.  H1N1 variants still did circulate, but they were not the dominant strain and they were not a significant contributor to the flu seasons after 1957.  However, the 1970 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix was an example that the Spanish Flu virus descendants were still endemic to swine and could jump back into human hosts.  This was reinforced by the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which was a re-assortment of four different H1N1 virus, and where it was noted that people born before 1950 who had exposure to the 1918 Spanish Flu virus (or its descendants) had protection from the "new" flu pandemic[3].  It is also an example of a less-lethal endemic virus mutating into a more deadly strain.  Since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the seasonal trivalent inactivated flu vaccine that protects against the Swine Flu descendents also protects against the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus[4].

The normal mortality curve for flu outbreaks is usually causing higher deaths in the very young and very old.  The Spanish Flu, similar to the 1952 epidemic and to some extent the 2009 Swine pandemic had an unusual mortality curve where it affected young adults more then elderly. One theory is that the Spanish Flu caused cytokine storms which caused the higher death rates of young adults.  A 2007 study of journals of the period of time of the Spanish Flu Pandemic finds that the the flu infection was no more aggressive than other previous influenza strains.  Among the different theories on why the Spanish Flu affected young adults more is the possibility that the Spanish Flu is itself a descendent of a previous H1N1 flu that had swept through the world earlier, but was removed from the yearly circulating strains by the 1889 flu pandemic[5].

In summary, the 1918 Spanish Flu never stopped spreading.  The human population (and swine population) never achieved a herd immunity.  The strain probably evolved to be less deadly and humans have learned to live with the seasonal flu (in all its different subtypes, not just the 1918 H1N1 subtype) in a way that it "only" kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year [6] globally through treatment (better nursing and treatment to manage downstream effects like bacterial infection of the lungs, cytokine storms and also through development of medicines like antivirals) and prevention (better awareness and hygiene, and the massive effort each year to develop and distribute the appropriate yearly flu vaccine).

The Spanish Influenza was honestly an utterly fascinating pandemic, in part because it was one of the best-documented pandemics of the early 20th century. The 1918 Influenza, better known in America as the Spanish Influenza, changed the landscape of the western world. However, this response shall focus mainly on the effects it had on America to limit the scope of the answer. Answer why the 1918 Flu stopped spreading, it must be broken down into three parts: what it was, why it spread, and how it died out.

So, what was the 1918 Flu? In short, it is a highly contagious viral mutation of the illness best known as the flu. Infecting between 3-11% of Americans every year, it usually is not very deadly, primarily killing the elderly, the very young, or anyone else with a comprised immune system. The virus, which mutates and changes often, has various strains with varying levels of severity, in part because it often hops between species. The 1918 influenza was remarkable because of how deadly it was and how quickly it spread. The most popular theory right now is it was an avian virus that mutated to infect swine, and then onto humans (Nelson, Worobey 2018, p. 2498). Of course, this is not definitive due to the difficulty in studying such an infectious disease, especially considering the limited number of viable samples. However, assuming this is true, it can begin to explain why it had a higher mortality rate than most recorded influenza strains. There were other factors at play as well, which also merits consideration.

From 1914 to 1918, the first world war ravaged the western world, causing around 40 million casualties (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). While movies portray the World Wars as glorious and bloody, with young men dying bravely for king and country, the fact is disease killed more people than the fighting ever did (*Diseases in World War I - World War I Centennial*, n.d.). Soldiers lived in squalid conditions, that are frankly unimaginable to the modern American. Dead bodies left to rot and fester where they lay, near the trenches that so many soldiers spent months in, knee-deep in mud, little food, and very tight quarters; it was a petri dish of disease and death.

Of course, military hospitals and training camps were barely better. After all, not even a century beforehand, doctors had barely considered handwashing, and it took decades before it caught on in the greater medical community (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2009). It should be no surprise then that the first recorded case of the 1918 influenza case was in an American military base in Kansas (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The first wave of the disease was in the spring of 1918, where over the next six months, it spread in small bursts.

However, the virus changed around the fall of 1918 when the disease suddenly became markedly more infectious and deadly. As noted above, influenza viruses are volatile, mutating frequently, which is why there is a new vaccine every year. The virus likely would not have been half as deadly, had it not been for the war. People who would ordinarily never travel farther than a few towns away from where they were born were suddenly going to countries they would otherwise never have seen, the virus their invisible passenger. October alone saw almost 200,000 Americans dead, terrifyingly high number. Nurse and doctors were falling like flies; fighting was slowing down in Europe, partly because the soldiers there were too sick or dead to fight  (Holmes), and it was getting harder and harder to get new soldiers out on the battlefield- they kept dying in transit. November saw the end of the bloodiest war the world had seen at that point because there were not enough men healthy enough left to fight.

So the Spanish Influenza reigned for the next year or so, leaving piles of bodies in its wake.  With our background in hand, now the question at hand can be answered: why exactly did the 1918 pandemic fizzle out? Well, there are three main reasons. First, the end of the first world war had a significant impact on restricting the spread of the disease and freeing up the doctors and nurses who had been serving on the front lines. While it would be easy to assume that the Americans returning home after the armistice would infect those around them, soldiers often remained in military care until recovered from the flu, partly because those afflicted were usually too sick to transport.

Secondly, public health education programs were profoundly effective, in combination with new laws. Many of the hygienic habits we have today stem from work during the pandemic to promote personal sanitation (Marisam, 2007, p. 279.2).  The National Institue of Health, or NIH (which was founded to fight the 1918 Flu), promoted, along with local efforts, things like handwashing, wearing masks, social distancing, and not spitting in public. There is a heap of pictures from the period that show the posters, signs, and flyers that tell citizens to practice what is now basic hygiene (\[\[Collection of photos from 1918\]\], 1918).

Finally, the biggest reason the pandemic died out was that the virus mutated. While it is easy to assume the deadlier the virus, the better it is doing for itself, which simply isn't true. However, if a virus kills all of its hosts, then it no longer has any viable hosts. Instead, the most successive virus is the one that can chill in a host long enough to spread. There is also the fact that virus mutation is luck of the draw. Sometimes the mutation is efficient for survival, and other times not so much, just like humans are sometimes born with harmful genetic mutations. 

It also be noted while the exact strain which killed so many during the fall 1918, the flu, and even H1N1 are rarely fully eradicated. u/TheNthMan did a really good job of explaining the actual science behind it, so go read his answer. My response, however, really focuses on the historical part of it. 

&#x200B;

So, in TL;DR? It burned itself out too fast, and when it mutated, it could not survive against the public health measures people had taken. If there are any questions or anything that needs a citation, please let me know, and I shall do what I can. I hope y'all are doing all right and staying safe <3

EDIT: Just wanted to make a note explaining why I answered the way I did. I admit most of my response doesn't answer the question directly, I was trying to write this in such a way that if all you knew nothing at all about the topic, you could still follow along. If anyone would like a more detailed answer, particularly on the science of it, or at least, what the popular theories currently are, I would be happy to. It's really interesting, but I figured as a history sub it would be better to focus on the historical facets of the question in an accessible way. Thank you ♡♡♡

EDIT 2: So, as some very helpful (and nice!) people have pointed out, there are a few issues. So I'm adding a source to paragraph 7, and changing a sentence for clarity. I'm also fixing some weird word choices.

This is a matter of knowing versus comprehension. It's also a matter of practicality. Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It's doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It's just not relevant to their lives.

Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it's another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.

Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin' assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I'm not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)

All this is attested to by multiple sources who tell the same broad story with only a few minor contradictions or unverified reports. One aide, for example, recalls Yeltsin planned to open his own chain of grocery stores on this model, and spoke about grocery stores as the fundament of the modern world. While this is not mentioned in other reports, it doesn't really introduce ambiguity into the narrative. It broadly agrees with the other accounts and doesn't contradict them in a meaningful way.

But let's pull back a little. Because this incident didn't come out of nowhere. The Soviet Union and the United States had been competing on the standards of living for decades, going back to the '50s. Before Yeltsin visited the supermarket there were multiple incidents like the Kitchen Debates and other displays where both sides tried to outdo each other in living standards. In reality, the United States was always ahead but the Soviet Union was willing to lie to make it seem otherwise. From time to time, someone would expose this and embarrass the Soviets.

By making a surprise visit and comparing conditions, Yeltsin was acting in a tradition that would have been familiar both at home and in the United States. The surprise was that Yeltsin openly admitted his side wasn't winning. *That* had never happened before.

Why did he do that? Well, he says in part because it was true. And it certainly was true. But, and I have no citation for this, politicians lie. And (I do have a citation for this) the Soviets lied all the time to make themselves look better. Why the reversal?

The pat little story is that Yeltsin saw this grocery store and decided to fight Communism. This has no historical evidence: the reforms began in 1986 (three years before) and Gorbachev explicitly wanted to preserve Communism. Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist. The context was instead of a world where Gorbachev was trying to thaw relations with the United States and reform/revitalize the Soviet Union. He was a reformer doing battle with hardliners at home while trying to keep liberals from tearing the Soviet Union apart. And Yeltsin was a reformer.

By losing one of these 'kitchen debates' (for lack of a better term) he was damaging the conservatives who didn't want to admit the Soviet Union was behind while encouraging his own reformists. It was an attempt to show he was willing to break with previous policy and tradition to force the Soviet system to be examined and reformed. At the same time, hardliners would be put in the awkward position of having to lie without the support of the Soviet government (as a result of Gorbachev's reforms). And without that support, their lies would be much more apparent. It would also warm relations with the west at a time when the Soviet Union was vulnerable (and where Gorbachev was trying to warm the relations).

But none of this answers the more personal question. This is more an explanation of why friendliness to the West fit well into his general program. *Why* did the visit affect him like this? Yeltsin undoubtedly had more power, prestige, and luxuries than anyone else in that store.

In short, because Yeltsin was a Soviet.

It's easy to dismiss people with different belief systems as either secretly believing what we believe or believing in some more base philosophy. For example, saying that Stalin's actions were not *really* about Communism but about power. No one could *really* believe that, could they? Well, usually, yes. They could and did. And Yeltsin's autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism. But he believed it in a specific way: he believed it was *right*, that it was better for the working class. And this was blatant, empirical proof that the United States was beating them in providing for the working class. This is what he tells us himself.

And that genuinely shocked him.

Skiosmagus does quite a nice job contextualizing the anecdote and how it has become mythologized in the USSR's own self-image. It would be really great if we had someone come along who could contextualize Yeltsin's own account of it in his autobiography (how trustworthy is he? what images of himself, the USSR, and Russia was he using his life narrative to project? &c).

First I am not a historian, I apologize if that is not allowed I am just a Dietitian with a passion for the history of food. I would defer to an answer from a historian on this topic. 

Much of my information will come from the article "Making a global sensation: Vanilla flavor, synthetic chemistry, and the meanings of purity" by Nadia Berenstein. 

A large part of why we enjoy the flavors that we do is hard to quantify, but the vanilla beans were used in the cuisine of many cultures in the region notably in the drink chocolatl which was served to Cortez by Montezuma.  Many of our spices that now are common were a rarity across the world. While vanilla was incredibly saught across the world, it wasn't until it was artificially created that the ubiquity of vanilla became solidified.

The early days of its use in European cuisine were primarily as a component of chocolate which enjoyed popularity in the seventeenth century. Though botanists throughout Europe attained specimens they found their efforts fruitless without the "Melipona" bee that pollinates the flowers. The stubborn plant was eventually transplanted to the French island of Bourbon. 

 The transplanted vanilla orchid would remain fruitless until Charles Morren a professor of Botany first successfully pollinated the orchid artificially. A method of hand pollination was also developed by a slave named Edmond Albius on a plantation in Bourbon. As demand increased in France for delicacies like vanilla chocolate and vanilla ice French colonies began to expand cultivation in the Indian Ocean, West Indies, and Tahiti, as well as Dutch plantations in Java and German East Africa. 

Vanilla requires a labor-intensive process that requires beans to be dried, sweated, and cured which that sometimes may require months of daily work and close attention. Fortunately, the decades of *vanilla planifolias* colonization of the globe coincided with rapid advances in synthetic organic chemistry.

Vanilla was not the first synthetic flavor (this belongs to various fruit flavors), but it was the first luxury flavor to be produced synthetically. In 1874 German Chemists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann synthesized vanillin from coniferin. This discovery was widely reported and confirmed by Karl Reimer who derived it from creosote tar. Vanillin did not enter the market cheap listed at $1,500 a kilogram considerably more than the cost of an equivalent amount of vanilla beans. New innovations in the production of synthetic vanillin lead to a drop in costs. New manufacturers across the United States and Europe challenged French and German companies' dominance of the market caused the price to plummet from 560DM in 1896 to 126DM in 1897. 

By 1900 the US saw a rapid increase in the sale of both vanilla beans and synthetic vanilla corresponding to the expanding role of sweet foods in American life. Technological innovations created the ability to manufacture ice creams, chocolates, and other confectionary items on a large scale at a low price. Both artificial vanilla and vanilla beans prices continued to decrease throughout the early 20th century. Sugary vanilla flavored treats became everyday indulgences due to the wide availability of cheap sugar and artificial vanilla. 

Today over 95% of the vanilla products on the market come from artificially produced vanillin.

A reasonable trawl through the Internet will inform you that American universities borrowed the terminology from Oxford and Cambridge, where they had come to describe different levels of "sophester" or sophist--someone who *thinks they are* wise. (Sophomore adds on either a simple Latin -or 'operator' ending, or *possibly* Greek *moros*/fool--either way, the meaning is clear; the adjective "sophomoric" means immature). In the sixteenth century, *sophister* sometimes had an additional connotation of someone who takes money for teaching wisdom instead of ~~being an exploited adjunct~~ living a pure life of the mind or something--basically, a philosopher who sold out. This would track with the use of more advanced students employed to tutor earlier ones.

What the OED and blog posts *won't* tell you, on the other hand, is why the labels for students are inherently *insults*.

Medieval universities incubated a tradition that early modern ones would carry on with pride: periodically awful student behavior. (Also, you know, excellent academics & drool-worthy libraries & the foundation for modern scientific research &c &c.) Most infamous is student violence, of course--right along with universities' determination to shelter their own from charges of murder and rape.

But more to the point with the classifications is that university students also had a reputation for living up to a somewhat lower standard than what Robert Lowth wanted to see in Oxford:

> [A place] where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedom
of thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward by
example, by commendation, and by authority

and somewhat more along the lines of what Edward Gibbon (yes, [our Edward Gibbon!](https://books.google.com/books?id=9fELAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA26&lpg=RA2-PA26&dq=To+the+university+of+Oxford+I+acknowledge+no+obligation;+and+she+will+as+cheerfully+renounce+me+for+a+son&source=bl&ots=Uzr90PgSM5&sig=X1F1rSTQayQuESXUUz9fTxZzfug&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI7_21xt3YAhVPA6wKHXg2DSYQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=To%20the%20university%20of%20Oxford%20I%20acknowledge%20no%20obligation%3B%20and%20she%20will%20as%20cheerfully%20renounce%20me%20for%20a%20son&f=false)) remembered:

> To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation;
and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months
at Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months the
most idle and unprofitable of my whole life...

> In the
university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors
have for these many years given up altogether even the
pretence of teaching.

> As
a gentleman commoner, I was admitted to the society of the
fellows, and fondly expected that some questions of literature
would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse.
Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business,
Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal...The names of Wenman and Dashwood were more frequently
pronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.

The point isn't that there were no deeply studious students making serious academic gains of their own and scientific progress overall, it's the *reputation* they had for being--well, *sophists*: more concerned with the social life of debate and politics and looking/acting smart to each other, than living up to some lofty ideal. Oxford opened its first coffeehouse in 1650. And by early modern coffeehouse, we should mean something like a literary salon--a place where the literati would gather to discuss intellectual topics and current events.

Of course, to contemporary eyes, this was a great deficit from what it should be. A 1901 investigation of Oxford in the 18th century summed up its findings in this description of freshman, freshly-minted college men:

> We see the public schoolman, just freed from the rod of
Busby’s successors, strutting about town for a week or so
before entrance, courting his schoolfellows’ envy...swaggering
at coffee-houses, and giving himself a scholar’s airs at the
bookshops.

and things did not improve over the years:

> A month or two sees them metamorphosed into complete smarts...The "smart's" breakfast is scarcely over by ten.

It's important to keep in mind that these attitudes were not only *external* in the sense of town-gown relations or alumni making a point about the quality of English universities compared to continental ones. Student university hazing could be absolutely brutal. Internal university hierarchy, built upon the idea that students with less experience were complete no-nothing fools, reigned supreme.

Most infamously, there's a late medieval sort of "Latin textbook" for university students that consists of a series of dialogues we think were meant to teach students useful Latin vocabulary for surviving uni daily life. One of the settings is a violent and humiliating initiation ritual in which the freshman or *beanus* is made into an animal that must be tamed. Well, scholars will continue to dispute whether in the 15th century this was a literary fantasy that drew on a solid tradition of hazing. On the other hand, there seems to be fairly solid evidence that early modern students at some universities took the *description* as *prescription*--and performed the hazing ceremony.

The straightforward etymologies of sophomore, junior (sophister), and senior (sophister) from Greek *sophia* and Greek/Latin *sophister*, in other words, aren't really the interesting part of the story--and a much funnier one for those of us who never attended college or have already graduated.
A brief supplement to /u/sunagainstgold's answer and to /u/no-tea and /u/andrewwm's questions about how American HS and universities adopted the designations.

In an [1898 address](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25104305?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to The Bar Association, Simeon E. Baldwin provided an overview of the history of legal education in America, and included a section on Harvard and Yale. He explained to the group that John Harvard was a graduate of Cambridge University, and organized his college like his alma mater: three terms a year for three years, students grouped into Freshmen, Junior Sophisters, and Senior Sophisters. 15 years later, a "Sophimore" year was added after the first year.

Cambridge University, does in fact, claims the term Sophisters as [jargon unique to them](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/about-the-college/university/the-jargon) and an 1841 history of the university references a 1726 report by three tutors from the university in which they describe students' courses [1]: 
>While the students are Freshmen, they commonly recite the Grammars....
 > The Sophomores recite Burgersdicius's Logic....
 >The Junior Sophisters recite Heereboord's Meletemata... 
 >The Senior Sophisters, besides Arithmetic, recite Allsted's Geometry .....

A report filed in 1766 used the same categories for the four classes. Likewise, the laws of Yale University in [1800](https://books.google.com/books?id=TEMbAAAAYAAJ&dq=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&f=false) required students be organized into four distinct classes: Freshmen, Sophomores, Junior Sophisters, and Senior Sophisters. 

By [1833](https://books.google.com/books?id=dt8TAAAAIAAJ&dq=1833%20Harvard%20tutor%20report&pg=RA2-PA6#v=onepage&q=Freshmen&f=false), Harvard had dropped the word "Sophisters" and referred to the four levels as Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. Yale dropped it by 1843. It doesn't appear as if the modifier caught on at New York State colleges such as King's College (later Columbia) or Barnard. The earliest annual reports to the Regents reported only college names, not enrollment, but when the report did begin to breakout emrollment by years, the [1845 report](https://books.google.com/books?id=X0UFAAAAQAAJ&dq=new%20york%20board%20of%20regents%20report%201825&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false) authors used the four familiar monikers. Eventually, like the mortarboard and lecture hall, the names for students in each of the four years became part of the ether and culture of American colleges. 

Tracing the labels use in American high schools is a bit more complicated. While there were some academies and private schools that modeled themselves after colleges in the 1700's and 1800's, students didn't typically complete four years of secondary school immediately following 8 years of grammar school. Instead, young men typically attended two years of secondary school or just long enough to acquire the knowledge necessary to pass college admissions tests. Four-year public high schools did exist, but they were mostly in cities and more frequently attended by girls than boys. It wasn't until the 1890's that the more familiar four-year structure of American high schools began to spread and take form.

The work of the National Education Association's Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies reflected a growing desire to create a cohesive look for secondary public education in America. Their final reports, issued in [1894](https://books.google.com/books?id=PfcBAAAAYAAJ&num=13), mapped out various paths students could take and referred to the four years as: 1st Secondary School Year, 2nd Secondary School Year, 3rd Secondary School Year, and 4th Secondary School Year. The Committee was advocating for an 8 + 4 model (8 years of grammar school plus 4 years of secondary school) and their word choice reflects that proposal.

However, there are multiple examples of schools using the labels before high school became common. An 1772 article in the Virginia Gazette, includes the following dispatch from Princeton, New Jersey:
> On Monday the 28th, the Grammar School at Nassau Hall was examined, and the Scholars acquitted themselves greatly to the Satisfaction of the Gentlemen who were pleased to attend. The Senior Class [from the Grammar School], ten in number, were admitted into the Freshmen class in the College.

Additoinally, Philadelphia's Central High School, the country's second oldest public high school, has described its student bodies by Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, Senior seemingly since its founding in 1836. Finally, Lahainaluna High School in Hawaii, the oldest American high school founded west of the Mississippi, was mentioned in an article in 1888 that described students from the freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior classes. Lahainaluna was founded by William Richards and Lorrin Andrews, missionaries from New England who advocated for an American education for Hawaiian children, which suggests that through acculturation and familiarity, the grade-level titles had become firmly entrenched in the American conscious for both colleges and high schools.

Hey everyone. /u/hillsonghoods [already provided everyone with our standard overview of the sub earlier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/72voae/til_that_tsar_nicholas_ii_asked_his_first_cousin/dnm2e98/) For you regulars, you know how this sub works. For you new visitors from /r/All, this sub is heavily moderated and we remove all comments which don't conform to our rather high expectations for quality. You can find a summary of the rules on the sidebar, and an in-depth explanation of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules). Please read them before you post. 

Now, for everyone wondering *what* got removed. I can assure, you, we don't remove things for shits and giggles! We are just as disappointed when an answer doesn't materialize as everyone else, if not more so since *we* have to deal with the complainers. But we don't go relaxing the rules simply to make our lives easier. We enforce them as best that we can. Simple as that. There are other subreddits *on this very site* which provide a similar service to ours without those rules, such as /r/AskHistory, so we don't understand these complaints, to be frank. Why would we get rid of the one thing that sets us apart from other subs? Coming in here and complaining about the rules is kind of like going into a fancy restaurant known for its high-end menu, and complaining that you can't get chicken nuggets. Despite the fact that 'Chick Fil A' is right next door. Why are you throwing a tantrum here when you can just go over there? There is a sub on this site for everyone, but not every sub caters to everyone.

I digress though. The main reason I'm updating my colleagues post, and talking about how it is illogical to complain about removed comments is because, well, here you go. For those interested, I did a tally of the Removed Comments, accurate as of 8:45 am Eastern Time.

Of the 68 top level comments:

* 1 was a top level Mod Comment, which included a link to a previous thread which was related and thus possibly of interest.
* 1 was a user linking to that same thread as well, which was left up.
* 5 more comments additionally linked to the same thread, but were removed, as we don't see any sense in allowing a flood of the same link dominating the thread.
* 1 comment was a copy-paste job from another site. In line with our rules, this was removed and the user banned for plagiarism.
* 5 comments were attempts to answer that were no longer than 2 sentences.
* 4 comments were longer than 2 sentences, but either in no way answered the question, or just didn't make any sense at all. None were longer than a paragraph in any case.
* 1 was a full paragraph, but only a summary of the Wikipedia article they linked.
* 2 were jokes.
* 3 were nothing more than links and/or quotations from other sources with no attempt to expand or contextualize. 
* 1 follow up question was left up.
* 2 people pinged the 'Remind Me" bot (Please note we *encourage* people to use the Bot, but do ask you PM the bot instead of comment to summon him).

But (drumroll please), **42 comments are asking where the removed comments are, or complaining about removal of comments and so on**. That is over 60 percent of the top level comments in this thread!! So you want to know what the removed comments are? They are mostly *"What are the removed comments?"* (Or else "*Go fuck yourself you fascist mods. Let the upvotes decide!!!!!1!!!"*

For the record, *most of those users recieved a Temp Ban*. There has been a top-level warning explaining exactly why comments get removed for 9 hours, and if you post after that comment was posted, we consider you prewarned. So please, stop asking, and please, if removed comments offend you, save everyone the time and just jump over to /r/AskHistory.

Follow-up question: Though definitely not a democracy by modern standards, turn-of-the-century Britain was certainly not nearly as autocratic as turn-of-the-century Russia. Were George's fears legitimate?
/u/kieslowskifan answered a similar question to this [quite recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6hf14o/why_did_george_v_oppose_asylum_for_tsar_nicholas/diyls2m/)

Hi there! 

You've probably reading this page hoping for an answer to this really interesting question! If that's you, do check out this reply from 3 months ago to a similar question by our Top Quality Contributor /u/kieslowskifan: [Why did George V oppose asylum for Tsar Nicholas II? Did he regret it after the Tsar's murder?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6hf14o/why_did_george_v_oppose_asylum_for_tsar_nicholas/diyls2m/)

And if you're wondering why there's so many removed comments: the reason for that is that a) /r/AskHistorians has high standards, and b) the subreddit is not a place for free discussion, even below the top-level. If your post starts with things like "I don't have a specific answer for you, but...", chances are we will probably remove your comment. If it's only a paragraph long, we will probably remove your comment. If your post is complaining about there being no answer yet or wondering what happened to the removed comments, we will definitely remove your comment. For better or worse, Reddit is set up to show you the amount of comments, including removed comments: as a moderator who can see the removed comments, you're mostly missing posts like 'This is the meanest, most stuck up sub ever', 'Why is every answer removed?' and 'Eagerly awaiting response', along with people replying with about three sentences.

Our readers want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources (it's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers!) On /r/AskHistorians, we want people answering questions to be able to explain not just what the basic facts are, [but why we know that these basic facts are right, and to put those basic facts into context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). This is why we encourage [the use of primary and secondary sources in answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), rather than tertiary sources like Wikipedia, podcasts and textbooks.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By deleting short, quick, bad answers, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen. In general, on Reddit, [the early answers get the bulk of the karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/#) regardless of quality. On /r/AskHistorians we want to make sure that the things that people likely actually read - the top post on a thread - are accurate. We want that top post to have the depth that a good understanding of history requires (people are complex, and so history is complex). Thus we remove answers that are not up to standard in order to reward the posters who - in their own free time, let's not forget - go to the effort of doing the research and writing up a quality response (which often takes *hours*). 

As you can see from [this post on the statistics of AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/) by /u/georgy_k_zhukov, 90%+ of popular threads like this will get an answer. That answer usually appears, on average, about 9 hours into the life of the thread. So while this thread does not yet have a suitable answer in it, if you are patient, something awesome will hopefully be here if you come back before too long. And if you want to read some awesome answers while you're waiting, might I suggest [the answers we link to on our Twitter](http://twitter.com/askhistorians), or [our weekly Sunday Digest feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) that links to overlooked posts that never got to /r/all but are often incredible?

Alternatively, if you want to discuss history or ask historical questions without these constraints, /r/history or /r/AskHistory might be a more appropriate subreddit for you than /r/AskHistorians.

Expanding from an earlier answer of mine:

-----------

The image and idea of Columbus has gone through several phases, historically, but the focus here is going to be on the current epoch, and the rise of Columbus Day, as that plays the most important part in your question and the current perception and how we got there.

Columbus Day is very closely tied to Italian-American identity, originating almost exclusively as a holiday celebrated by Italian Immigrants, who wanted to celebrate their early ties to the 'New World', and stake their claim to being part of the idea of America (it is interesting to note, also, that Italian immigrant communities formed a unified idea of their *Italianness* in a way that wasn't quite as present in Italy itself although it quickly expanded to be more broadly embraced by immigrant Catholic communities generally in the period. This was a time when immigrants, especially Catholics and those from Southern Europe, were looked down upon and excluded by the many within the dominant White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant culture of the United States - something I've written about previously specifically with an eye on the KKK in the 1910s-1920s, [so may be of interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4uus/italians_were_considered_nonwhites_until_1945_did/e75k1dv/).

It expanded from Italian / Catholics communities into the wider American public over time and by the turn of the century was a somewhat popular celebration, having been designated a time for national celebration in 1892, and celebrating "American unity" in the words of one historian, as Columbus made for a great time to celebrate the 'melting pot' concept of which was becoming important to the mythos of the American identity

Angelo Noce, an Italian immigrant, was the big proponent of making it a Federal Holiday, with the stated goal of celebrating Italian Heritage through it, as they had been celebrating it for some decades before everyone else, and considered it "their" holiday. The Knights of Columbus were also a big supporter. Being predominantly Irish-Catholic, they likewise saw promise the elevation of a Catholic figure into the highest pantheon of American history, since, as noted, Catholic communities were likewise looked down upon, and seen as at best half American, with dual loyalties not only to their country, but the Pontiff in Rome.

Mass parades on Columbus Day quickly became a way for Catholic groups to demonstrate their civic pride and patriotism, and make the public spectacle of their *Americanness*. Kubal quotes one journalist who, writing about the parade and speeches given by Catholic organizations in in the 1890s, noted how "*if any doubt existed in the minds of any that Catholics are Americans in every fiber of their being, it ought to vanish in the light of the addresses made everywhere yesterday*". 

Similarly, drives to put up Columbus statues were spearheaded by Italian-American fraternal groups such as the Columbian Federation or the Order of Sons of Italy in America (although as with the parades, some statues were pushed for by non-Italian Catholic groups). The statues were seen as important, visual symbols of their acceptance into American society, and also the growing ability for Italian-Americans to have political power. The very act of placing the statue in a public place by the government was an important reflection on what the Italian-American community was able to lobby for.

All of this lobbying and parading about saw real progress. In 1905, Colorado (Where Noce lived and had been strenuously pushing for this) became the first to recognize the day as an official holiday, dedicated as:

>created for Catholics, particularly immigrant Catholics, and their children, the special Catholic holiday of the year [...] Christmas and Thanksgiving are religious or family holidays for all the people; Columbus Day belongs to our Catholic people.

Other states such as New York and California soon following suit. It would become a Federal Holiday in 1937, although by that point Noce had passed away so did not see his idea reach culmination.

And for the most part, there wasn't any of the controversy around him we now have. Regressive ideas about the indigenous peoples of the Americas, seen by far too many people as savage heathens for whom the introduction of Christianity and "Civilization" was a clear and important good for them (or at least the ones who survived the waves of genocide over the next few centuries...), Columbus and what he brought about was a clear and unambiguous positive for many. To quote one example given from the period:

>Columbus was fired by the noblest motive that can guide the action of man. Every page of his life is teaming with evidence that he went forth on his perilous voyage to carry the Gospel to debased and erring savages, and to pass it to them with the torch of true Christian Civilization... Where shall we find a character worthy to be compared to with him? [...] Columbus was in a measure divine [....] Write his name beside no human hero.

Put plainly, that wouldn't have been to controversial in the 1890s when it was written. Columbus was a hero. He brought civilization to the virgin land of savages barely eking out an existence in the stone age, and made it a place where white people could put that land, which was being wasted by the backwards natives, to good use, and allow a great nation to flourish [ /s]. Italians, and Catholics, were pleased as punch to have this hero that they could point to as *theirs*, and stake their claim as being foundational to the American pageant.

Now, I need hardly point out that as time passed through the past century, attitudes changed *significantly* towards Columbus, and by the 1992 anniversary, Columbus was a very controversial figure, and has only gotten more so since then, as anyone looking at the news this week is clearly aware! Due to the 20 year rule, I'm not going to discuss the *current* stuff in-depth, and whether we should be destro**y**ing th**e**se **s**tatues but the indigenous peoples of the Americas are, unsurprisingly, the leader in opposition to the continuing celebration of a man who more and more are coming to recognize as the kickstarter of a mass genocide (and don't miss /u/Snapshot52 who [covers the this angle here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h7l1nv/christopher_columbus_was_arrested_and_ostracised/fumak0w/)); and as perspectives change, the Italian-American lobby has been at the forefront of holding onto what they consider to be their national holiday.

To add a bit more to what's already been explained by /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov and /u/Snapshot52, it is worth stressing that American schools have a fair amount of responsibility for his prominence. 

The American common school movement used a number of Protestant touchstones as it took shape in the mid-1800s. This included things like having boys and girls in class together, religious texts in early primers and readers, and routines and celebrations. 

While some schools started off the day with prayers and religious songs, others moved into more secular celebrations of holidays, seasons, and Americana (a term that refers to songs, texts, ideas, and people associated with the United States. It includes things like Franklin an his key and the mnemonic ditty, "In fourteen-hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.") Early history textbooks would give lip service to the Indigenous people on this soil before colonizers arrived, but generally stated the timeline of America in 1492 and the arrival of Columbus and his ships. (That he didn't really land in the states and where he thought he was often deliberately left out of the narrative. A key feature of Americana is simple narratives and ideas that can be communicated easily to children.) 

From an older response of mine:
> Americana can best be thought of as the packaging of American history and touchstones for the next generation. It's a framework that led to the Washington and the cherry tree genre of stories, generations of school children memorizing the preamble to the Constitution, learning Christopher Columbus "discovered" American and mass dislocation and genocide of Indigenous people was simply "manifest destiny", and other broad strokes about what happened on this soil. This simplistic approach to American history was embedded in the texts children read and the way teachers talked about history. ... This meant that the 400th anniversary [of his landing] was everything. Schools across the country were planning celebrations, not because they coordinated, but because celebrations of events related to Americana was something you did in American schools. 

In 1892, a poet to put to paper and created a special poem to commemorate Columbus' landing. His "pledge" was taken by children around the country and forever entwined the name of Columbus with this notion of America. In [my response](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/eztjvl/when_did_american_schools_start_saying_the_pledge/fgso4nu/) to the question, *When did American schools start saying the pledge every day?* I go into more depth about the relationship between Columbus and the pledge.

All of which is to say, Americana - as disseminated in American schools - stripped Columbus of his context, put him at the front of the list of Great American men, and let history and collective memory do the rest.
As a follow-up question- though jailed and stripped of his position as governor, he was acquitted of his crimes by the Spanish crown despite the documentary evidence against him. How did Columbus manage to get off relatively scot free and even get funding for a fourth and final voyage? Crimes such as the mutilation of -Spanish- colonists seem like they would be fairly difficult for Ferdinand and Isabella to overlook.

In addition to the answer provided by /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov, I wrote a [Monday Methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/758vqt/monday_methods_indigenous_peoples_day_and/) piece awhile back that delves into some of the history behind Indigenous Peoples' Day--formally Columbus Day--and how this historical narrative fits into contemporary studies today. Here it is in full:

##Part 1

##Christopher Columbus and Columbus Day

Considering the above, I believe we have our answer. Is replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day revisionist? Answer: maybe. What historical record or account is being revised if we change the name of a recognized day? History books remain the same, with whatever book you pick up on any given day. Classroom curriculum remains the same unless note of this was already built into it or a special amendment is made. However, what has changed is the optics of the situation - how the public is perceiving the commemoration of Columbus and how they reflect on his actions of the past. Really, the change of the day reflects an already occurring change in society and societal structures. We are now delving into what our fellow flair and moderator, /u/commiespaceinvader, spoke about roughly a month ago: [collective memory!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6v1yj5/monday_methods_collective_memory_or_lets_talk/) Here are a few good excerpts (bold mine):

>First, a distinction: Historians tend to distinguish between several levels here. The past, meaning the sum of all things that happened before now; history, the way we reconstruct things about the past and what stories we tell from this effort; **and commemoration, which uses history in the form of narratives, symbols, and other singifiers to express something about us right now.**

>**Commemoration is not solely about the history, it is about how history informs who we As Americans, Germans, French, Catholics, Protestants, Atheists and so on and so forth are and want to be.** It stands at the intersection between history and identity and thus alwayWho s relates to contemporary debates because its goal is to tell a historic story about who we are and who we want to be. So when we talk about commemoration and practices of commemoration, **we always talk about how history relates to the contemporary.**

>German historian Aleida Assmann expands upon this concept in her writing on cultural and collective memory: Collective memory is not like individual memory. Institutions, societies, etc. have no memory akin to the individual memory because they obviously lack any sort of biological or naturally arisen base for it. Instead institutions like a state, a nation, a society, a church or even a company create their own memory using signifiers, signs, texts, symbols, rites, practices, places and monuments. **These creations are not like a fragmented individual memory but are done willfully, based on thought out choice, and also unlike individual memory not subject to subconscious change but rather told with a specific story in mind that is supposed to represent an essential part of the identity of the institution and to be passed on and generalized beyond its immediate historical context.** It's intentional and constructed symbolically.

Thus, the recognition of Columbus by giving him a day that recognizes his accomplishments is a result of collective memory, for it symbolically frames his supposed discovery of the New World. So where is the issue? [Surely we are all aware of the atrocities committed by and under Columbus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6x88wm/my_history_professor_stated_today_that_columbus/dmetkv1/) But if those atrocities are not being framed into the collective memory of this day, why do they matter?

Even though these symbols, these manifestations of history, purposely ignore historical context to achieve a certain meaning, this doesn't mean they are completely void of such context. And as noted, this collective memory forms and influences the collective identity of the communities consenting and approving of said symbols. This includes the historical context **regardless** if it is intended or not with the original symbol. This is because context, not necessarily of the all encompassing past, but of the contemporary meaning of when said symbols were recognized is carried with the symbol, a sort of meta-context, I would say.

For example, the development of Columbus Day, really the veneration of Columbus as a whole, has an interesting past. Thomas J. Schlereth (1992) reports this (bold mine):

>In **1777,** American poet Philip Freneau personified his country as "Columbia, America as sometimes so called from Columbus, the first discoverer." In **1846,** shortly after the declaration of war with Mexico, Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton told his Senate colleagues of "the grand idea of Columbus" who in "going west to Asia" provided America with her true course of empire, a predestined "American Road to India." In **1882,** Thomas Cummings said to fellow members of the newly formed Knights of Columbus, "Under the inspiration of Him whose name we bear, and with the story of Columbus's life as exemplified in our beautiful ritual, we have the broadest kind of basis for patriotism and true love of country."^1

>Christopher Columbus has proven to be a malleable and durable American symbol. He has been interpreted and reinterpreted as we have constructed and reconstructed our own national character. He was ignored in the colonial era: **"The year 1692 passed without a single word or deed of recorded commemoration."^2 Americans first discovered the discoverer during their quest for independence and nationhood;** successive generations molded Columbus into a multipurpose [American] hero, a national symbol to be used variously in the quest for a collective identity (p. 937).

For the last 500 years, the myth of Columbus has gone through several transformations, as the above cited text shows. While his exulting went silent for quite a while, the revival of his legacy happened at a time when Americans wanted to craft a more collective, national identity. This happened by linking the "discoveries" made by Columbus with one of the most influential ideologies ever birthed in the United States: expansionism, later known as Manifest Destiny. Schlereth (1992) further details this :

>In the early republic, Americans began using Columbia as an eponym in their expanding geography. In 1791, for example, the Territory of Columbia, later the District of Columbia, was established as the permanent location of the federal government. A year later Capt. Robert Grant, in a ship named Columbia, made a territorial claim on a mighty western river (calling it the Columbia) for the United States in a region (later Oregon, Washington, Idaho) then disputed with the British. Britain eventually named its part of the contested terrain British Columbia. The ship Columbia in 1792 became the first American vessel to circumnavigate the globe, foreshadowing imperial voyages of a century later.

>Use of the adjective Columbian became a commonplace shorthand by which one could declare public allegiance to the country's cultural pursuits and civic virtue. It was used in the titles of sixteen periodicals and eighteen books published in the United States between 1792 and 1825 -for example, The Columbian Arithmetician, A New System of Math by an American (1811).^9 Columbian school readers, spellers, and geographies abounded, as did scholarly, literary, and professional societies -for example, the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of the Arts and Sciences, which later evolved into the Smithsonian Institution.

It is this connection to expansionism that Americans identified with Columbus. This very same expansionism is what led to the genocides of American Indians and other Indigenous peoples of the Americas. I can sit here and provide quote after quote from American politicians, military officials, statesmen, scientists, professionals, and even the public about American sentiments toward Native Americans, but I believe we are well past that kind of nicety in this case. What we know is that expansion was on the minds of Americans for centuries and they identified [The Doctrine of Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/4sk1ta/series_federal_indian_policy_the_papal_bulls_and/) and the man who initiated the flood waves of Europeans coming to the Americas for the purpose of God, gold, and glory, AKA: colonization. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz (2014) makes comment by informing us how ingrained this link with Columbus is when 1798 hymn "Hail, Columbia" is played "whenever the vice president of the United States makes a public appearance, and Columbus Day is still a federal holiday despite Columbus never having set foot on the continent claimed by the United States" (p. 4).
Not to deter new answers, but what /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov posted [on the origins of Columbus Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2md0ta/even_acknowledging_his_worldchanging_discoveries/cm37fcz/) should speak to your question.
A follow up: where can I read what those "long and well-documented list of brutal and tyrannical acts" were? In school they teach you he was an explorer in the age of discovery and little else.

Hi, friends,

AskHistorians is a subreddit where people with questions about *history* can get answers from those with expert-level knowledge in the subject at hand.

Please keep in mind that OP has asked about the 20th century history of evangelical/conservative Christianity and political involvement, not for a Sunday School lesson. Direct your answers accordingly.

Thanks!
I see questions about modern fundamentalism (which I assume are a part of the 'some sects' your refering to) come up here from time to time - some of them get almost no (good) responses, some generate some good discussions (even if some are conflicting). 

I hope this generates some good responses as I'd love to hear them as well - if not, here's a related (but different) question from a couple of years ago I had saved in case it helps you find your own way:

[How accurate is the statement, "Christian Fundamentalism is only about a couple hundred years old and creationism and biblical literalism are both very new ideas."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2el0uz/how_accurate_is_the_statement_christian/) 
I can talk about several denominations within Christianity in Canada from the 50s onwards. These denominations (spec. Baptists, Mennonites, and CMA/CAMA, tended to be, and still tend to be, more conservative than other groups with Canada, including the RC church, Anglicans, and so on--though the latter are not my area of expertise). Please note that when I refer to "Baptists", I'm not referring to the Southern Baptist movement within the United States. ~~Rather, I'm talking about Canadian descendants of the Anabaptist movement in 16C. They may have similar roots but frankly I don't know.~~

Putting aside dietary restrictions for a moment, in the third quarter of the 20th century (so 1950-1975) there were strong taboos against men with long hair (1 Cor 11.14) and tattoos (Lev 19.28) in mainstream Baptist, Mennonite, and CMA congregations in Western Canada. Sermons were preached about it in many churches over many years. The same goes for tattoos, which were seen as unacceptable unless a church member were an adult convert. While the taboo against long hair grew less influential in the 80s, the taboo against tattoos lasted longer. 

The question is, to what extent did existing religious norms influence society as a whole, as long hair, certainly, was seen to be a part of youthful rebellion. In smaller communities within AB, BC, and SK (and even larger centres such as Lethbridge), many businesses were simply closed on Sundays during this quarter. I would argue that, the more religious the community, the more influence that the church had upon individual towns, to the extent that Biblical precepts against working on the Sabbath influenced the culture as a greater whole. (Some of those restrictions, closures on Sunday in particular, still have ramifications today, but that's beyond the scope of this subreddit.)

Homosexuality within these groups was simply not tolerated, and abortion... well, that's an interesting topic, as the laws on abortion in Canada were loosened in 1967 as a result of Pierre Trudeau, himself influenced by the Quiet Revolution in the 60s (which saw a shift in societal values away from the Roman Catholic church and towards secularism). While abortion was quasi-legal at that time, it was still largely decried by many Christian churches within Canada, including Baptists and Mennonite groups, and CAMA/CMA (The Christian and Missionary Alliance). 

There may be individual congregations with exceptions to the above rule, but looking at statements of belief from this era (and God help me but I can't find any of my old textbooks in which this was discussed... we're talking about mimeograph copies from provincial assemblies of the aforementioned groups, and I have no idea where they are), the above is by and large true.

So: the above groups largely condemned homosexuality (let alone gay marriage) and abortion, as well as tattoos, working on Sundays, and long hair for men. Consistent so far. Back to dietary restrictions: speaking of Christianity, there are no longer any dietary restrictions, period. In Acts 10 & 11, Peter has a vision in which God essentially tells him that it's okay to eat anything, that the old dietary laws of the Old Testament no longer applied. This is why Christians in general have no issue with eating anything, and that's a blanket statement that applies worldwide (with a few minor exceptions, such as Messianic Jews). 

I understand that this is a very limited answer from a very limited geographical area within North America. I apologise for my lack of sources, but little on this can be found online outside of regional paper archives, and those are spread out and difficult to access on a Sunday afternoon (heh). The texts to which I have access, including *Readings in Baptist History: Four Centuries of Selected Documents* by Joseph Early and *Tracks and Traces: Baptist Identity in Church and Theology* by Paul Fiddes are broader and the former *does* talk about Southern Baptists; this would be a useful resource to look at belief statements from larger organising bodies. My post is related more towards *a posteriori* experiences in individual congregations in the latter part of the 20th century in W. Canada.
Follow-up/related question: were these other issues (tattoos, working on Sundays etc) ever politically important to Christians? When did they stop being important (politically at least)?
[1/2]

I know, I know, reddit gloms onto anything that smells of religion and hypocrisy. But bear with me, because the intellectual and political developments in play are important to *understanding*, beyond any gut jerk condemnation or automatic acceptance.

The story that Christians tell themselves, passed down in the Book of Acts and some of the New Testament epistles, is that Jesus came and fulfilled the Law, that is, the Old Testament. It's pretty clear in context that the critical issue was nascent Christianity's built in mission (evangelization) imperative juxtaposed with Jewish prescriptions, most importantly circumcision, although kosher laws also feature prominently in the biblical discussion.

But while what is depicted by Christian tradition as a battle between "Jewish Christians" and "Gentile Christians" ultimately comes down on the side of God apparently no longer requiring circumcision in the "new covenant," this hardly means that developing Christianity shed its Jewish roots including the Old Testament, or the Hellenized Roman culture in which it incubated. Everyone's favorite example here is abortion, so let's roll with it. Early and medieval Christians recognized abortion as a moral question, connected to infanticide. But perspectives differed-and would continue to differ-on when abortion began to be a problem. Was it always immoral? Or was it only immoral after the infusion of the soul into the body? And when was that, and was it different for boys and girls? As John Riddle points out, even as one tradition that would become canon law condemned contraception and abortion, some theologians continued to repeat earlier ideas and even mention recipes for contraceptives.

The complicating and complicated, but crucial, factor is sex. Christianity inherits a deep skepticism towards sex and the human body from Greek philosophy, to the extent that Jerome (who gave us the Vulgate Bible) argues that virgins should kill themselves to avoid the pollution of *being raped*. Of course, a society without sex is self-eradicating, and Christians quickly come up with the longstanding view that sex is okay if it is in accord with nature, that is, can lead to procreation. And the wonderfully spicy Song of Songs is reinscribed as an allegory: the love song between Christ and his Church or Christ and the soul (or, because he Middle Ages love you and want you to be happy, Christ and Mary, his virgin mother).

The spread and entrenchment of thhe Latin Church as a landed power over the early high Middle Ages introduced a new wrinkle to the concept of moral authority: legal authority, and the desire to shepherd and augment it for the salvation of as many people as possible. Christians have a harder task in the establishment of religious law than Jews and Muslims, since the NT works mightily hard to reject legalism as a principle. So canon (Church) law ends up cobbled together out of the Bible, philosophers, practical situations.  It's in the efforts to codify canon law in 11-12C that theolgians start to pay attention to sodomy with a definition of (male, primarily) homosexuality. Although it is still just one form of the "sin against nature", and there are no signs of active persecution from Latin Christians. But the codification of canon law reflects a long term trend in the west towards social order, hierarchy, purity, playing out above all on religious (anti-Semitism) and gender policing lines (misogyny, patriarchal families, strict gender roles and gender expression norms). Homosexual sex acts stack up poorly here, as you can imagine, and by the fifteenth century it can be and sometimes was punishable by death.

So what is the Bible doing in all this? As suggested by the multivalent interpretations of the Song of Songs (totally ripped from rabbinic readings of the love been God and his chosen people, by the way), medieval biblical interpretation was majestically flexible. This could lead to things like understanding the story of Jonah as a prophecy of Christ, descending into hell for three days, as well as being the story of a man who tried to say no to God and got eaten by a fish. Or it       could mean trying to apply the "sons of Noah"-Shem, Japheth, Ham-as a paradigm to understand the peoples of an expanding (in Latin consciousness) world. The most famous medieval permutation here is the use of the curse of Ham to justify the existence of Latin, Christian serfdom. It often took on geographic origin meanings, however, which were as varied as the peoples of the Mediterranean world. In the early modern era, the western interpretation will harden into the "curse of Ham" that morally justifies the enslavement of black Africans by white Europeans and colonial descendants.

But that development, and even more its entrenchment, are somewhat of a departure in the evolution of European intellectual culture. Even as the Protestant reformers and the Catholic reaction supposedly streamline and "harden" biblical interpretation methods (don't worry, the Song of Songs lives on in all its meanings), first the influence of humanism and then the evolution of natural philosophy into science never quite allowed the Bible to be Clarissa Explains It All.

Well, nineteenth century coming at you to change all that.

An important evolution that is actually played out in interpretations of the curse of Ham story is a growing sense that slavery is a moral issue. Not just related to religious in-group-ism, but ownership of humans in light of humanity, period. Now, it's crucial to recognize the mutually reinforcing and guiding nature of religious beliefs/morality and other circumstances, be they political, economic, environmental, what have you. Mark Noll's *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis* (which is to some extent the point towards which so much of career oriented him) lays out cleanly that the split between Christians opposed to slavery and Christians supporting it broke down along the geographic lines you would expect, but also that both sides made religion the basis for securing popular support. Abolitionists appealed to the ideals of "liberal theology" (not in the modern US political sense) and biblical exegesis, favoring holistic readings and the "sense" of scripture. Slavery's defenders huddled down into what we call proof-texting: if you can find it in the Bible, somehow someway, it's God's inerrant word. Even if there are contradictory texts. This principle-fundamentalism, literalism, inerrancy-is a 19C invention. But so is the abolitionists' holistic reading. So is Luther's the Old Testament through the cross hermeneutic. So is medieval and patristic fourfold senses (historical and three allegorical forms).

All of these developments that I've talked about-sex, literalism, holistic/critical exegesis, race, moral politics, the role of religion in galvanizing political opinion and vice versa, tumble into the 20C. If anything, the Victorian and then Progressive era and its emphasis on "middle class values" (an adjusted vision of rightly ordered, moral society) demonstrated even more firmly the power of religion in spurring people's political activism as well as introducing new dimensions of concern over the policing of sex and, now, "sexuality." This period also saw a critical social invention in America: widespread, mandatory public education.

This was inseparable from religion, please understand. Apart from the Catholic Church's long leadership role in all levels of education and nuns as THE champions of educating girls, late 19/early 29C Catholics often perceived public schools as a covert Protestant indoctrination, hence the longstanding tradition of Catholic schools in many American cities. This is a vital precedent. Because when the US finally gets its head temporarily out of the racist sand and makes school segregation illegal, it's southern Christians in the same "biblical inerrancy" tradition who defended slavery, who lack qualms about expressing their racism.

I choose my word carefully here. Because you can certainly cherry pick quotes from the odd Protestant leader or Southern politician who explicitly links the rise of religious (Protestant, PLEASE) schools, mainly in the south, to a desire to prolong segregation. That's not the dominant narrative, you understand. Religious freedom! Need to secure the morality of our good sons and daughters! Gosh, and don't those race based admissions requirements make it a safer environment for the children. When the segregation policies were challenged in court (Green v. Connally; Coit v. Green), it was easy to sell this as religious persecution, not the government's rightful enforcement of due civil rights. And to be clear: the issue here wasn't about the closure of the schools. What got conservative Christians crying persecution! was the threat of revoking the schools' tax-exempt status. America, y'all.

The lesson, going forwards, would be the power of evangelical Protestant Christianity as a political force-to motivate its believers, and the vitality of the consenting-to-legal-racism white voter as a target bloc.
> some sects of Christianity

That's a really, really broad question. Instead, I'm just going to talk about abortion as viewed by Evangelical Christianity in the United States. This issue has not always been a priority, and much of the focus on and politicization of it started in the 1980s. My comment is based on chapter 2 of _Broken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics_ by Jonathan Dudley (which is impeccably sourced; nearly a quarter of the book is citations). See [this summary of the relevant chapter](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/02/18/the-biblical-view-thats-younger-than-the-happy-meal/) for more. 

The bible itself is very wishy-washy on abortion: it's not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament, and the Old Testament is pretty permissive of it (hence why it's not uncommon for Jews to be pro-choice). If someone injures a pregnant woman and kills her, it's a crime punishable by death, but if the injury merely causes her to miscarry, the offender shall just pay a fine (Exodus 21; I'm quoting chapter but not verse so that you have to look at the surrounding verses before claiming I'm taking anything out of context). God commanded Moses to take a census but no one under 1 month old counted as a person (Numbers 3). Numbers 5 contains instructions on how to make a potion that is harmless when drunk by faithful women but causes miscarriages when drunk by adulterers. There are other verses, but those three hit home for me.

Early Christians had varied and conflicting views on when ensoulment took place and when abortion counted as murder. Tertullian and Calvin would today be considered pro-life, while Augustine and Aquinas would be considered pro-choice. The Catholic church became strictly anti-abortion in the 1800s, though I don't have a good understanding of why that happened. In contrast, Protestants were largely pro-choice. This continued for over a century, as the Catholics started passing anti-abortion statutes in various states. 

Evangelicals were somewhere between ambivalent and opposed to banning abortion. In 1968, _Christianity Today_ magazine and the Christian Medical Society wrote [A Protestant Affirmation on the Control of Human Reproduction,](http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1970/JASA6-70Christian.html) which states that "when principles conflict, the preservation of fetal life... may have to be abandoned in order to maintain full and secure family life." The Southern Baptist Convention of 1971 resolved to "work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the **emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.**" They reiterated this position in 1974 and 1976 (note that _Roe v. Wade_ was in 1973). 

As for how this flipped, Francis Schaeffer, Jerry Falwell, Ed Dobson, and other folks like that were trying to turn Evangelicals into a political force, reasoning that there are a whole lot of Evangelicals and they'd be able to have a massive influence if they just got everyone organized and pointing in the same direction. This started with a wide variety of issues: segregation, the Equal Rights Amendment, feminism, etc. They found that by coming down squarely on the anti-abortion side, they could increase their influence on Catholics, and draw in a larger crowd of people. By the 1980s, they had a sense of which issues drew people in, and discarded all the other issues that didn't have the same effect (so, abortion stayed on their agenda, while mandatory school prayer was dropped). They then went full force on these issues, which convinced a receptive audience that these were biblical stances, and the religious right grew in strength and influence. 
I’ll start by saying that I don’t feel I have the knowledge necessary to comment on why gay marriage in particular seems to be a bigger political issue than other Biblical mandates; I’ll leave that question to someone more qualified. Instead, I’ll focus my efforts mainly on the history of the alignment between the Republican party and conservative Christianity. It’s easy to see that today conservative Republican ideology and Christian ideology go hand-in-hand. But your question is specifically about the *history* of this issue, and you ask if its always been that way. The answer appears to be yes, for at least the last 50 years.

A 2015 Gallup poll found that 40% of those polled would not vote for a candidate who was an atheist, and 24% would not vote for a gay/lesbian candidate. Below is their exact wording of the question:
> Between now and the 2016 election, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates - their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be (fill-in-the-blank), would you vote for that person? (McCarthy, 2015)

In general, Gallup polls is a wonderful resource for determining how political attitudes in the US have changed over time, because they ask the same questions (although sometimes the wording changes slightly) year after year. With specific reference to this question, it has been asked of people since 1937, although at that time the only identities asked about were female, Jewish, or Catholic. The earliest data Gallup offers about gay/lesbian candidates is from 1978, when just 26% of respondents said they would vote for such a candidate, compared to 68% in 2012. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Republicans are less likely to vote for a gay/lesbian candidate than either Democrats or Independents. In 2016, 85% of Democrats said they would vote for a gay/lesbian candidate, compared to 61% of Republicans (McCarthy, 2015; Jones, 2012).

The data from Gallup suggests that Republicans’ fixation with homosexuality dates back to at least the late 1970s. Other sources provide different avenues of information and trace the origins of the alignment of Republicans and conservative Christians back even further. In 1968, Pope Paul VI issued the encyclical *Humanae Vitae*, establishing the position of the Catholic Church as anti-abortion and anti-contraceptive:
>We are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children^(14). Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of the woman, whether permanent or temporary^(15) (Paul VI, 1969).

The reference footnotes in the above quote are:

Because of this addition to the Catholic dogma, many Catholics felt compelled to adjust their voting habits accordingly. In the late 1960s, the Republican party had already established itself as having anti-abortion leanings, so the alignment came quite naturally. A 1980 study looking at abortion trends found that roughly 41% of respondents supported abortion. Respondents were given six reasons and asked if they would support a woman getting an abortion due to that reason. In 1977, a seventh item was added, asking if respondents would support a woman getting an abortion “for any reason.” The reason with the most support was “If the woman's health is seriously endangered” with 73 percent, and the reason with the least support was “If the woman is married and does not want any more children” with 16 percent (Granberg and Granberg, 1980; Guttmatcher Institute, 1983).

In addition to the Papal element, the Republicans had also set themselves up to favor the white vote, particularly the racist whites who opposed the Civil Rights Act and racial integration. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, and a pervasive legend has him as saying some variant of “There goes the South for a generation,” or “We [Democrats] have lost the South for a generation” (Green, 2014). However, Dr. Steven J. Allen (2014) cites a wide body of research, all of which finds no evidence of Johnson having ever said that. But regardless of if Johnson said those words, there appears to have been an element of truth behind them. Kevin Phillips, an aide to Richard Nixon, is quoted as saying:
>All the talk about Republicans making inroads into the Negro vote is persiflage […] From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don’t need any more than that. […] The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That’s where the votes are (Boyd, 1970).

Returning to the aforementioned Gallup polls which asked if people would vote for a candidate of a specific identity, they found that support was low for black candidates in the 1950s and 1960s. Support reached a majority level for the first time in 1965 with 59%. It’s worth noting that, prior to 1978, the question asked about “a negro” man rather than “a black” person, although the trend of gradually increasing support for black candidates was evident from 1958 on (Jones, 2012). The Washington post compiled data showing that, in 1940, black Americans were about equally likely to vote Democrat as Republican, but they’ve since skewed heavily Democrat beginning in 1948. The article cites Jay Cost of Real Clear Politics as crediting the huge spike to Harry Truman’s policies, including “a federal ban on lynching and bolstering existing civil rights laws” (Bump, 2015).

This skewing of Black voters away from the Republican party also fit well with the existing trends of many white evangelicals as being opposed to racial integration. There’s some debate as to the degree to which this opposition was motivated by out-and-out racism, but the level of support is fairly clear (Taylor, 2016). Because many conservative Christians were opposed to racial segregation, and the Republican party had publicly espoused similar ideals, it only made sense that they’d align.

**TL;DR**: In the 1960s, conservative Christians were opposed to abortion, birth control, and racial integration, as was the Republican party. Alignment of their causes naturally followed.

I would say they are the two remainders because they are the last two in an age of reason and enlightenment that could really be given time in an ethical debate..

To expound, fundamentalism falls into several denominations, but is particularly strong in the US, because the country was settled by one of the most fundamentalist Christian sects that have(*still) exist..These quakers and puritans were offshoots of the Church of England, which was an offshoot the the Roman Catholic church..each schism asking that the bible be taken more literally and the power decentralized..If you were to go back to 1680,I'd imagine you would find many more hot topics than the two you describe..Furthermore,an anti- gay marriage stance(being gay at all) and abortion WAS A POPULIST OPINION, because of the role religion played in society..It wasn't even on the table..I mean, the original schism from the Roman Catholic church was over bread actually turned into holy flesh in your gut. Many will probably disagree, but these two issues are some of the last grips that the church has over ethical conunundrums... Religion is always changing to meet the modern day circumstances of its patrons, albeit some slower than others..We need only look at offenses punishable by death 500 years ago..the two you listed are some of the last.

So I have no memory of seeing this movie, though my wife says we saw it in the theaters, but in any case: it's not likely Jack would have been to Singapore, because during the early 1700s, ish, when the movie is set, Singapore wasn't really a thing. It was the property of the ~~Sultan of Malacca~~ Sultanate of Johor, and it wasn't until 1819 with the arrival of the British East India company that the islands started to grow in prosperity. 

That said, though, there's no reason not to think Jack may have been to East Asia in general, or visited/traded with the Dutch settlements in Indonesia. I believe that the character was involved with John Company in some way before becoming a pirate, and the company had trade interests in East Asia during that time period. Many sailors of the time would have taken posts in merchant ships regardless of nationality, so it wouldn't be out of the range of possibility for Jack to have sailed there in a Dutch hull. Or he could have served on a voyage of exploration -- the English mariner and sometime privateer William Dampier made several voyages of exploration to East Asia and Australia, starting originally as a privateer in Virginia then in the Caribbean, around the time of _POTC_. 

**Edited to add:** A lot of the removed comments (which I can see because I'm a moderator) are really confusing the distinction between a pirate and a privateer. A privateer was a ship captain or master who had a letter of marque from a government, allowing them as a private citizen to legally prey on enemy shipping without being subject to the issuing government's laws regarding piracy. (The more rare letter of reprisal was issued to a captain whose goods may have been stolen by a representative of a foreign nation, allowing them to do the same in reprisal.) The US Constitution allows Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal, though the Paris Declaration of 1856 legally renounced privateering; the US is not a signatory to that treaty, but hasn't commissioned any privateers since 1815 anyhow. 

Unsurprisingly, may nations regarded foreign privateers as pirates in any case, but there is a distinction in law. Captain William Kidd, for example, sailed under protection of a letter of marque, though he exceeded its authority and was convicted of murder and five counts of piracy in what was essentially a political trial. 

**Edit the Second:** So I probably shouldn't try to answer a popular thread like this while also trying to be at the park with my 5-year-old, because I thought I wrote this a bit more clearly. The example above of Dampier is what I had in mind as a direct analogy to Captain Jack: William Dampier was a privateer captain and later commissioned officer born in Somerset in 1651, who joined a privateer crew in the Caribbean in 1679; he was part of raids on Spanish possessions on the west coast of New Spain (now Mexico), then was part of an expedition that crossed the Pacific to the East Indies and returned eventually to England, having circumnavigated the globe. 

I'm sourcing this mainly from *The Social History of English Seamen, 1485-1649*, edited by Cheryl A. Fury, and *Royal Tars: The Lower Deck of the Royal Navy, 875-1850* by Brian Lavery. Sorry it's vague, but there's not a lot to be said about the accuracy of what is after all a fictional (and over-the-top) series of pirate movies that are based on a theme park ride.

Thank you!
There's an adage in education that is basically, "we measure what matters." Which is to say, we can get a sense of what a community or society values based on the knowledge, skills, or dispositions that are assessed in schools. (There's often a disconnect between the things adults claim to value and the things we ask children to learn but that's a different conversation for a different subreddit.)

So, given that rule of thumb and an understanding of American education history, I feel comfortable saying that yes, "dinner with the boss" was a thing that actually happened - or teachers thought *might* happen - and the main reason is that the New York State Regents Examinations in Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking routinely asked the young women taking the exam about entertaining, including for their husband's boss. 

First, some quick context setting. NYS has the oldest formal system of education in the United States, dating back to the 1780s. This headstart meant NY policymakers and educators were experimenting with different structures long before some other states were even considering the possibility of public education. After a few different approaches to funding and curriculum, the structure that NYS fell into, and stuck with to the present day, was based on the idea that in order to ensure consistency across the state, there needed to a common measure of student learning. This measure, which was first given in the mid-1800s is colloquially known as The Regents Exams. I won't subject you to a history of the exams (as fascinating as I think it is) but basically, they're a series of exams given to high school students across the state as a way to document their mastery of content the state deems necessary before they'll award a high school diploma with a Regents endorsement.

For the purpose of your question, the most important feature was the feedback loop between NYS teachers and the exams. (At one point in the early 1900s, there were upwards of 90 different Regents exams. Schools/students could pick and choose which ones to take.) Teachers across the state determined the content for the exams and then went back to their classrooms and taught students the content that would appear on the exams. Teachers who did not participate in the writing process were given guides on what would appear (AKA standards.) They didn't know the exact questions on the exams but, for example, the teachers who taught bookkeeping knew there would be several questions where students had to solve long arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. So they taught their students how to solve complicated arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. Etc.

This doesn't mean Homemaking was offered at every NYS high school or that all girls had to take the course, but rather, there were NYS HS teachers who wanted to offer the course and felt their course content was worthy of inclusion in the pool of knowledge students learned as part of obtaining a diploma. At some point in the early 1930s, a group of NYS educators proposed courses and a corresponding exam called Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking. Their rationale and the exact year is several hundred miles away from me in the state's archive, but I know from other research that the time between proposal and exam administration was typically 1-3 years. Students then needed 3 years of courses to sit for the exam (hence "Comprehensive.")

It's my understanding that the first administration was in June 1937 and included the note:
> The minimum time requirement [for taking this exam] is 10 periods a week for three school years with outside preparation and home project work. These three years of work must include homemaking B and D.

The exam was broken into multiple parts and the first question on Part I, section III of the 1937 exam question read:
> Suppose that you intend to invite five friends for supper, and the evening on Sunday, July 7.

> a. Write your part of a telephone conversation inviting one of these friends. [3 points] .

> b You have decided to serve a buffet supper. Write the menu for it. [5 points]

> c State your plan for the entertainment of the guests. [2 points]

So we know that from the beginning, Homemaking teachers thought teaching young women how to entertain was important. However, the exams weren't just about entertaining - there were questions about taxes (*T/F: Assessments for taxation purposes are divided equally among all the houses in a locality.*) child safety *(T/F: Instinct teaches a mother how to care for her baby*. False. FYI.), food safety (*The growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds cause the ___ of food.*), etc. 

I don't have access to any of the exams from the 1940s but questions about entertaining appear on the 1950 exam:
> Part II, Question 1: 
> Part of a home experience might be assuming responsibility for preparing dinner for a family of four and two guests. A girl might choose the following menu:

> * tomato juice
> * broiled steak
> * mashed potatoes
> * buttered peas
> * molded fruit salad
> * baking-powder biscuits
> * butter
> * chocolate cake 
> * coffee 
> * milk 

> A. Consider all duties involved in preparing this meal. List four duties which might be done the night before, showing good management of time.

While I cannot confidently speak to what happened in other states (there's [a book coming out](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324004493) in May on the topic that I'm very much looking forward to) but it's safe to say that the heteronormative idea that a husband would go off in the morning to an office job ([more on the history of "9-5" if you're so inclined](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/id2cfp/dolly_parton_had_a_famous_song_9_to_5_yet_every/g27rs9a/)) while the wife stayed home as a homemaker and at some point, "dinner with the boss" would happen.

Which is to say: if the calendar in the kitchen is to be believed, Mr. Hart, Vision's boss was coming for dinner on Wednesday, August 23, 1950, 1961, or 1967. I can't say it's common - hopefully, someone familiar with the history of workplace etiquette from the era will chime in - and I'm not sure when Wanda would have graduated high school or if she went to school in NYS but odds are good that if she attended a suburban white high school and was interested in obtaining a Regents diploma, she likely took a high school course that prepared her to expect the homemaking responsibility of hosting her husband's boss (or conversely be the boss' wife.) She would have been taught the content needed to answer questions like (all from Homemaker exams between 1950 and 1961):

> A homemaker on a limited budget, with only one hour to prepare dinner ... could include in the menu (1) rib roast of beef (2) stuffed onions (3) angel food cake (4) gingerbread with applesauce

~~
> Which indicates formal balance in a living room? (1) candlesticks placed at one end of a mantle and a clock near the center (2) similar chairs placed on either side of a window (3) a grouping of a desk, a chair and a wastebasket (4) a grouping of a reading lamp, a few books and a bowl of flowers on an end table

~~
> A girl's appearance is affected by her ability to choose clothes wisely and to keep them attractive. 

> A. For each of the following, give two characteristics which would indicate good workmanship, (1) a hem (2) a dart (3) a zipper

> B. Explain two ways in which the construction of a garment can affect its durability. 

> C. For each of the following undesirable characteristics of a dress, suggest one type of alteration or remodeling to make the dress wearable. (1) neckline too low (2) bustline too tight (3) stained underarm area

~~
> A person is developing emotional maturity when he (1) controls his reactions (2) requires frequent praise (3) forms many intimate friendships (4) laughs at awkward social situations

~~

> A father's change in jobs makes it necessary for his family to move to a different locality. In this family, there are the father, the mother, a sixteen-year-old girl, a thirteen-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy and a two-year-old boy.
> 
> A. The family must first decide whether to live in the large city where the father will be working or in one of the small surrounding communities. Suggest four questions the family will need to consider in making this choice. [4]

~~

> The following is a dinner menu for a married couple entertaining the husband's supervisor. Dinner is to be served at 6 PM. Roast beef, mashed potatoes, fresh spinach, bread, gravy, (canned) buttered beets, butter, chocolate cornstarch pudding,  coffee, or milk.
> 
> List four items from the following plan which indicate good timing in preparing the meal described above. Give reason for each answer.

> Night before - make chocolate pudding and place in serving dishes.

> * 2 PM: Wash and peel potatoes and place in cold water.
> * 3:15: Place 5 lb. roast in oven at 325 °.
> * 3:30: Wash spinach and place in cool water 
> * 3:40: Set table and fill water glasses
> * 5:00: Put potatoes, spinach, and beets on stove to cook
> * 5:30: Drain and mash potatoes and place on top of a double boiler
> * 5:45: Measure coffee into pot and set water on to boil
> * 5:50: Get serving dishes from cupboard.
> * 5:55: Place meat and vegetables on serving dishes.

> Make a seating chart and diagram of one place setting for this dinner. 

(Postscript: It's fairly easy for us in 2021 to read such questions and pass judgment on the teachers who wrote the exams and the young women who took the courses. However, it's worth stressing again that the exams also included questions about negotiating a lease, first aid, disaster management, pursuing professional goals, and pulling together a sharp outfit. Also, question 48 on the 1957 exam read: *The ideal family pattern toward which most young couples strive today is (1) autocratic (2) matriarchal (3) patriarchal (4) democratic*. The correct answer was 4.)
This isn't just a common scenario in sitcoms, but "dinner with the boss" pops up a lot in personal essays written by women in the 1950's. Humorists Erma Bombeck and Teresa Bloomingdale, as well as humorist/playwright Jean Kerr all have several essays about entertaining their husband's boss at dinner at their home, or about having a dinner party at their bosses home (Jean Kerr writes about attending a dinner party at her husband's boss's home, only to discover her dress is made of the same material as the drapes). There are other examples I've come across, but those women's essays stick out the most to me, as they all wrote about mishaps, and had livelier writing than domestic personal essays from magazines of the period. Cookbooks of the period occasionally throw in a comment about "impressing a boss" with their "Special Occasion" recipes. There are also special sections about entertaining bosses in etiquette and domestic guides of the period, going into the 70's. Emily Post and Miss Manners both give advice as to not being a boor at such a dinner party and polite topics of conversation.  


There seems to be less "My promotion hinges on my wife impressing the boss" than there is in sitcoms - but it is also the nature of a sitcom plot to exaggerate the stakes for extra humor. However, based on writing at the time, it was common that an employer would visit a private home and spend an evening with the family of a prospective promotee. The inclusion in domestic writing, humor primarily written for women (most of these essays that were later gathered into books were first published in women's magazines), and in books intended to help women in preparation all make mention of it as established fact, rather than as an extraordinary circumstance.   


Actually, going back, there are mentions of husbands bringing their bosses home for dinner in books well before the 1950's, or bosses inviting employees over for dinner to discuss their careers. Maud Hart Lovelace, who was writing in the 1950's about the 1910's, wrote a dinner party her boss threw to discuss her career, where she met her husband (she had replaced him for the duration).

In 1801, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](http://onlygold.com/Info/Historical-Gold-Prices.asp), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. ["Tea Clipper" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers).

Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:

>French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount. 

I hope this answers your question sufficiently!

Tsk tsk, please. This is the *real* Emperor of Europe speaking. I fought the French, Moors, and Heretics all simultaneously at the same time. You couldn't even handle the English. When you are ready to graduate from your boring and linear warfare, call me. 
There is one here every week, isn't there? 

*Mods, I know that you frown on personal anecdotes, but please bear with me here.*


So, OP. I'm quite sure you won't believe me, but if you invade Russia, *you will have a bad time*. Don't believe me? Well, if you try to grab that bear by the nose ring, you're going to have to face the following:

* Your baggage train is going to be *long*. You think you know a thing or two about baggage trains? You know squat once you try to stretch one to there and back, and I started off a lot closer than you did. You should be happy if you even have it when you get there, which you won't. 
* That said, since you'll be living without a supply chain, you'll be living off the land. This will *not* make the general populace happy where you pass through, not to mention the raping and killing that your horde will commit on the march. That walk home is going to be a lot longer when you have gangs of roving partisans picking your army to pieces. 
* *"Oh, but I won't need a long baggage train, I'll win a decisive battle!"* I hear you say? No, you won't, that's not how the Russians roll. They'll fight you when they're good and ready. 
* Do you even have an escape plan? I was lucky and had a buddy down south I could hide out with for a few years when everything went pear shaped. 
* Not sure from your post if you're planning on hiring any Cossacks. My tip: don't. Using Cossacks always ends badly. Cossacks suck. 

So to summarize, I know you've just spanked a ton of Germans, you've routed the Russians a bit, you have the finest infantry there ever was, your army fancies you a minor deity, and you're feeling like the king of the world. I know, because I've been there, done that, ate the Semla. Literally all of it. I can see the road you're headed down though, and unless you change course, reality is going to hit you like a bullet to the side of the head. 
Would it kill you to wait, I dunno, 5 or 6 years? You're emperor for life, your people love you, you should let them get busy and get your numbers back up. No need to keep going endlessly.
Look, I don't mean to alarm you but you may not have noticed that Russia is **FAR**.  I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the apothecary but that's just peanuts to Russia.  Listen, it's nearly 2500 kilometers from Paris to Moscow.  That's a long walk, doubly so in the mud, triply so lugging a cannon.  

My advice: leave Russia to the Russians.  What are you gonna get out of Russia anyway?  Serfs?  Frozen ports?  Nuts to that noise, your Majesty.  What you need to do is cut your losses in San Domingo, make nice with the Americans, set up a permanent French agricultural colony up the Mississippi, and convince the Russians that they need to worry about the Chinese.
A word of warning, noble sir. I believe your intentions with regard to the Cimmerians and Scythians are just - they need to feel the yoke of civilization. But when the topic of invading their land is raised, there is reference only to the attempts of peoples like the Swedes and the Germans. These were not the first to try their hand at it. Many centuries earlier, Cyrus, Great King, King of Babylon, King of the Four Corners of the Earth, King of the Universe, also invaded the land of the Scythians, but he came to a bad end, and his expedition floundered. Then a few generations later, my lord and uncle, Darius, invaded again, marching through Thrace and across the Danube with all the peoples over which he ruled. But the Scythians - uncivilised liars all - refused to engage him in battle. They left their land desolate and retreated, again and again, until my lord Darius' supplies were depleted, and he was forced to withdraw.^1 Many were killed in the retreat, preyed upon by the mounted archers of the enemy. While Darius obviously conquered the place, since no one resisted him, it was a bit harder to enforce the demands of the Great King once the army had left their lands. This was a blemish on the otherwise glorious career of Darius, conqueror of Thrace and Naxos and Euboea and vanquisher of the rebellious cities of the Yauna that dwell by the sea.

I would strongly recommend against it.
The tricky thing about the Russian Steppes that you have to remember, my Emperor, is that in the spring when the snow melts they become an impassable bog.  From Germinal to Prairial this vast morass will swallow cannons, men, and horses up to their withers in its sticky grasp.  As you yourself have observed,  "God fights on the side with the best artillery." Getting our cannons stuck in this mud would be a disaster that could spell the end of our second campaign against the Polish.

It is far preferable, in our humble opinion, to confine the fighting to the summer, autumn, or even winter months (where the ground is frozen and makes for especially fast going for our heavy cannons) and wrap up the campaign before our Grande Armée must fight the fearsome Russian spring as well as the forces of the Tsar.
Emperor please, I beg that you heed my advice...

The Russians are expecting you to attack St. Petersburg and Moscow, it would be suicide to attack that way. I recommend that at once you send your armies to the lands of Panama and build a canal there, for funzies. After completing this venture I recommend sailing directly to Vladivostok and begin marching *west*. The Russians will never expect it, you will have the element of surprise. Victory will be assured!
No, mon dieu no. That "nation" is a wasteland, deprived of culture, food, weather, and any sort of sustenance that could keep an army moving. When I invaded Russia, it was barren, a wasteland of technology that would have been better suited back in the dark ages of Gaul than the 19th century!

And the roads! You would presume the Russian language doesn't even have a word for road! Dirt roads that turned to mud with such ease that you would presume that they produced mud rather than grain.

And the people, superstitious and dull minded, distrusting any sort of intelligence that isn't gotten or given by their masters who hold them in servitude. These people aren't even free and yet they willingly serve despotic masters.

Worse are those that exist within their service, within her borders. Barbarians that ride as if they were with Genghis Khan rather than that wannabe Alexander! They still use bows and arrows, riding with raw meat in their hamper sack. Pulled from the most barbaric of lands, only the Greeks facing the Persians.

And the winter. One should think that the Russians are barely human for being able to exist in such weather. Sadly I had to leave to put down a plot about my supposed death before I even experienced the worst... and Berthier had to go and mess up my army...

No, don't invade Russia.

Edit: Needed to smash Berthier's head against a wall for making a mistake. It has been corrected now that he's conscious.

Second Edit: HOW DARE YOU IMPERSONATE ME! ARE YOU IN LEAGUE WITH THAT COWARD MALET THAT ESCAPED FROM PRISON! ONE MOMENT WHILE I SUMMON THE GENDARME!
[removed]
Yes you should. But don't overstep my friend. This will be your most challenging campaign. Your enemies have learned much from you.

Winter in Smolensk as you have planned and take Moscow and St. Petersburg the next year. You need both to enforce the Continental System, not just Moscow. Alexander won't surrender unless you hold both his 'capitals'. Maybe not even then.

You can't live off their land. They'll go scorched earth, so when they start to retreat, chill the fuck out and don't try to finish them off. You can't catch them and you'll only seperate yourself from the baggage train.

I have to say this again. When they retreat, **do not** try to catch them. I know, you're Napoleon and you think you're an invincible god king. You've beaten Europe time and again by marching faster then your enemies. But if you go too fast in this invasion, you will lose.

TL;DR Just ignore your massive ego and you'll be fine. You're fucking Napoleon.

I took a political science class called Modern Weapons and International Relations. The professor once said "If you only remember one thing from this class, let it be to never invade Russia"

So no. 
Mon Empereur, Russia is barely worth looking at! You have already proven you can best their armies in combat, you stand to gain little for what you have the potential of losing if, by some miracle, you do not succeed. In your time you have already beaten the finest armies Europe has to offer in the Hasburgs and Prussia, you have forced the scum English to hide on their little island and attempt to slander your *height* of all things, you took Egypt from the heathens barely breaking a sweat and you have dismantled the Holy Roman Empire! Take your victories, rule over the glorious empire that is mother Francia, make friends with the Americans and you will set up your family to rule Europe for many years to come!
Go for it, it's a fun time. My recommandation is to start allying yourself to the local tribes NOW. Russia is filled with a multitude of rival factions, a lot of them would love to see you kick their neighbor's asses. If you can't get them to send soldiers, at least ask them to stay neutral. Once that's established, set the bait and lure them away from their supply lines. Set the feint and flank. It's best to do this over winter so that pesky things like rivers and lakes don't get in your way. 
Semi serious question:  Would Russia maybe be more invade-able from the South or the East?  I mean, the mongols took that area but anything involving the mongols doesn't really require standard military logic anyways.
One has to ask, why invade Russia? There is a lot of it and it tends away from civilization, the more you go East. 

How about forgetting Moscow (full of crooks anyway) and turn north after Smolensk heading for the capital, St. Petersburg? It is a port city after all and even a sliver of land and Polish Russia would be a lot of new territory with a supply route. Moscow would remain Russian for the time being to be taken later. As a side effect unless the Russians were very quick, you may have a chance to mop up some of their units in the North. You do not pursue an enemy army over such a long distance as eventually you may be drawn into a trap.

You will be chasing them for a while. Your supply train will get longer and longer, your troops morale will be lower, and the cold will take a toll on your men. Once Russia is ready they will fight. You may have defeated the Germans and fought some Russians in the past but you're on their territory now. They have thousands of miles of the steppe and tundra to fall back into. Your trains will only make it so far and then, when you're at your lowest and furthest away from your supply lines they will attack and defeat you.
[removed]
You need to keep the Brits under control first. Get a bigger Navy, build up your manpower and seek land across the channel. Russia can wait, and travelling through Prussian/Austro-Hungarian territory to get there might yield devastating results.

You need to try new tactics to, to potentially get better results. The Brits are renowned for their order and consistency in combat. They rely on travelling in a line, firing in a line and dying in a line. And you do too. Spread out, hit the bushes and break their lines before they even hit yours using "disorderly", orderly, combat. 

Experiment a bit with the way you fight. Lines are great, but you should try new things that work well *with* your lines.

You're spot on about artillery though. That stuff is important, you can never have enough.

It's really important that after you return with what little is left of your army, starving and cold, that you don't eat a ton of food.

No, in medieval Europe,  there were no restrictions on common soldiers killing a king or any other aristocrats. If soldiers were able to identify a particularly important individual, there would probably have been a mad scramble to capture him rather than kill him outright, both for political purposes and for the potential for ransom profits. This happened to the French king Jean II at Poitiers, who was taken prisoner in a furious melee where other high-ranking French aristocrats, who ordinarily would have made excellent ransoms, were killed (possibly by accident as English troops swarmed to grab Jean specifically). When kings were killed outright in combat, it does not seem to have been a particular mark of controversy. John the Blind, King of Bohemia, died at Crecy but his killer was not specifically identified in accounts of the battle and the story of his death is conveyed merely as an illustration of John's bravery and valiant nature. Kings who fought did so in the full knowledge that they were at risk of being killed or captured at the battlefield.

English military contracts from the Hundred Years War suggest that there was no stigma attached to a common soldier capturing important aristocrats; they often contained clauses saying that any particular important prisoners (like a prince or something) would be handed over to the king in exchange for a cash payment. This worked to both parties'  advantage: common soldiers would probably not be be financially able to house and feed a prisoner (especially a royal prisoner) during the period in which the ransom was negotiated and paid. If there was any limitation on killing aristocrats, it would be that troops wanted to maximize their profit by taking nobles alive for ransom. This is most apparent in the hesitation of some English troops to kill their prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt. This incident is often taken as some kind of commentary on class relations, but in reality is just a reflection of soldiers looking out for their bottom line. 
Do you have a “where” or “when” to your question? You’re much more likely to get a satisfying answer if you include that in your post. 
As a follow up, how did the nobility fit into this hierarchy? It is my understanding that hostage/ransoming took place, but how extensive was this and how did one's social status fit into the realities of battle?

[Plutarch](http://www.bostonleadershipbuilders.com/plutarch/artaxerxes.htm) reported that two soldiers were executed in gruesome fashion after taking credit for killing Cyrus.

I've wondered, however, whether this was officially stated as for fraudulently claiming to have killed someone that Artaxerxes did, or merely for saying anything to the detriment of his reputation? Or did Artaxerxes not bother to give a reason? It doesn't seem from the way it's written that there was supposed to be anything wrong with them having killed Cyrus, just that Artaxerxes didn't want to give credit (and was this because it was "proper" for him to have done it, or just generally desiring glory?).  Was this story known at the time? Plutarch says no one saw his death but seems strongly to credit the account of Ctesias.

I am not a trained historian, but rather a Political Science guy, but I feel qualified to answer this. The 2000 election for those of us too young to remember was a shitshow. In fact, news stations had to recall their initial projections twice. Following the election night drama, the election continued on for almost a month before ending in a controversial supreme court decision.

Let us start with election night itself. Early in the night, major networks called Florida for Al Gore. NBC was the first network to call it at 7:50 p.m. EST, but quickly the other major networks called it as well. However, as the night grew older more and more data came out of Florida that implied the calls were too early. Two hours later, CNN retracted their call after noticing a change between what the polling data they based their call on, and the actual results that was streaming on. Following the CNN call, the other major stations withdrew their decisions as well. 

Then early the next morning a little after 2 am, most of the major networks (CNN, FOX, CBS, etc.) called Florida for Bush (AP being the only exception). However, this devision would also be recalled around two hours later, as more votes came in which favored Gore. The final results on election night showed Bush up by 1,784 votes which triggered an automatic recount. 

The automatic recount brought up a lot of questions. Because of the way Florida conducted its ballots in 2000, there were some ballots that had trouble being counted. Florida used a ballot similar to a push-pin, where you pushed out a dangling (or chad as they became known) to vote for a candidate Occasionally, the chads so to speak on these ballots would not be fully disconnected resulting in a hanging chad, which the voting machines could not accurately read. This lead to even further confusion in the counting. 

After conducting the first recount, the new official total showed Bush with a 537 vote lead. Because of how close this margin was, both the Bush and Gore campaigns filed legal briefs and cases to try and get support. Although Gore won at the Florida Supreme Court, ultimately, the United States Supreme Court ruling in favor of Bush in Bush v. Gore. This ended the recount and was decided on partisan lines (i.e. the five conservatives on the court voted in favor of Bush and the four liberals for Gore). 

Now comes the ultimate question, was the election stolen. First off, there is no concrete evidence that Gore would have won the election. A group of media organizations conducted an extensive review of the disputed ballots that were ruled on in Bush v. Gore and found it would not have decided the election in favor of Gore. However, they also didn’t claim that Bush certainly won the total vote. Besides the over 43,000 votes that were at stake during Bush v. Gore, there was an even broader group of 175,010 ballots that was rejected in other counties. 

The election of 2000 in Florida was basically a statistical tie. The votes that were counted under Florida Law resulted in Bush winning by 537 votes. Either candidate could probably have claimed victory under this close of a race, but the systems favored George Bush (the Florida Secretary of State was Republican and the Supreme Court of the US was controlled by Republicans). So in my mind, it was not a stolen election just an uber close election where the system benefited Bush.

Edit: slight correction of the ideology of the judges (I changed democrat to liberal, and republican to conservative) because as u/overzealoustoddler pointed out it was not technically accurate.
Obviously, the answer to this question is no from a legal perspective. Bush was legally the winner of the 2000 election, and he attained the presidency by victory in the electoral college as required by the Constitution. However, one could argue, and I am trying to choose my words very carefully, that Bush's election was a failure of democracy as it appears he should not have won.

So, the big deal is the Bush v Gore case and specifically the presidential vote in Florida. So, if you understand the way American presidential elections work, then you already know you need to receive the majority of electoral college votes to win. Not many foreigners understand that each state decides how these electors are distributed, but most of them, Florida included, awards all of its electoral college votes to whichever candidate has the simple ~~majority~~ plurality. In the 2000 election, Florida's 29 electoral college votes were enough to give either candidate the win as the other states were tied. The first official tally of the votes was called as a victory for George W. Bush. Also, the difference in votes in Florida was less than 1% that year. Florida has an election law that automatically recounts when the difference is less than 1% which was triggered in this case. Now, most of the dispute came over these recounts.

So, Florida at the time used a punch card system for voting which has since been replaced. One of the reasons is that there was a chance (I will simplify) of hardware failure that could make a vote uncountable by the machine reader, and since the final vote difference between each candidate was actually less than 0.1%, the hardware failure rate could actually change the result. Specifically, since the problem seemed to have to do with how hard you punched the card making unclear marks on the ballot, and it was postulated this could affect senior populations very much which are a large part of the Florida constituency. So, the Gore campaign specifically filed for hand recounts of the ballots in specific counties (those favorable to him) at the Florida Supreme Court because a human could more accurately count ballots because of the hardware failure issue though some saw this as a political ploy to try and magic more votes since his supporters may be inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt on unclear ballots. Still, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gore and ordered the recount including the counts by hand as requested in accordance with Florida statutes. Now, another part of this is that the Florida Law for recounts also has a time limit to produce those results before electors are decided upon. So, Florida polling stations only had a limited time to perform this recount, but it got underway.

Now, Bush not wanting to have his initial victory overturned sued in the Federal Supreme Court in the case [Bush v. Gore](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html). His argument was generally that because each polling location was counting votes based on different criteria (which was true, each polling place was just trying to do their best on a short schedule) that this violated the   Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Basically, treating and counting different peoples votes under different criteria was unconstitutional and the supreme court agreed. The federal supreme court ordered the recount to stop, and, most importantly, there was now no more time left under Florida Law for a recount before that elector designation as I mentioned earlier. So, the clock just ran out, and the initial call for Bush was upheld. Now, this meant that the election really fell apart because of the Florida Division of Elections not producing an effective, fair, uniform criteria for the recount which the Supreme Court ruled could have been done legally. If they had, the recount might not have been stopped, and if there wasn't a time limit, the Division of Elections could have created criteria and had a full recount, but the law was what the law was.

Now after all that was over. Several groups were able to study the ballots and do a review of the recounts based on specific criteria the state could have utilized for these ballots. The results were mixed in that different criteria produced different results for either Bush or Gore which gives some validity to the federal Supreme Court Arguments. However, one of the most comprehensive studies was the [Florida Ballots Project](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36207) which compared a great many ballots from the entire state that were both considered illegible for counting as well as some that were recounted which accounted for about 3% of the total vote. Their findings were pretty damning in that their review from almost every criteria would have given Gore the election had these ballots not been considered invalid due to those hardware failures I mentioned earlier.

TL;DR - Bush won legally, but Gore lost because of voting machine errors and the fact that Florida had a time limit on recounts and failed to establish statewide uniform criteria for hand recounts.

Edit: just a quick thank you for the gold
One issue most people consistently leave out when addressing this question is the voter suppression efforts of the Florida G.O.P.  in 2000. " **More than 12,000** eligible voters – a number twenty-two times larger than George W. Bush’s 537 vote triumph over Al Gore – were wrongly denied their right to vote in Florida," according to the Brennan Center for Justice.[2]  

These voter suppression efforts were led by Katherine Harris, Florida’s secretary of state, charged with overseeing an impartial election; she was a Republican who served as co-chair of Florida’s Bush for President election committee and appointed by Florida’s governor at the time: J.E.B. Bush, George W. Bush’s younger brother.


Due to the controversy surrounding the Florida election results in the year 2000, "The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conducted an extensive public investigation of allegations of voting irregularities during the 2000 presidential election in Florida. The investigation, utilizing the Commission’s subpoena power, included three days of hearings, more than 30 hours of testimony, 100 witnesses, and a systematic review of more than 118,000 pages of pertinent documents state that statistical data, reinforced by credible anecdotal evidence, point to widespread disenfranchisement and denial of voting rights." [1]   

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that:  

* This disenfranchisement of Florida voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of African Americans. Statewide, based on county-level statistical estimates, African American voters were nearly 10 times more likely than white voters to have their ballots rejected in the November 2000 election.

* Poorer counties, particularly those with large minority populations, were more likely to use voting systems with higher spoilage rates than more affluent counties with significant white populations. For example, in Gadsden County, the only county in the state with an African American majority, approximately one in eight voters was disenfranchised. In Leon County, on the other hand, which is home to the prosperous state capital and two state universities, fewer than two votes in 1,000 were not counted. In Florida, of the 100 precincts with the highest numbers of disqualified ballots, 83 of them are majority-black precincts. 

* Even in counties where the same voting technology was used, blacks were far more likely to have their votes rejected than whites.

**Now, while it is impossible to say what percentage of the people denied the franchise in Florida in the 2000 election would have voted for Gore rather than Bush, the groups this disenfranchisement fell on most harshly significantly favored Gore over Bush, which is at least suggestive that without the Florida G.O.P. putting their thumb on the scale, Gore would have beaten Bush.** It is also important to point out that this does not implicate Bush in the cheating, but rather some of the highest ranking members of the Florida G.O.P. most notably, Katherine Harris - it also does not directly implicate JEB Bush either, however his position and responsibility in appointing Harris may be taken as somewhat suggestive as to his culpability.

There's a lot to this election, but let's focus on your question - Did George W. Bush(GWB) steal the election through some nefarious means?  The answer there from a legal standpoint is "no, he did not".  He exercised his ability to challenge decisions in court, and the court ruled in his favor.  This is no different than literally thousands of other court cases.  There has never been any realistic evidence that GWB cheated or did anything illegal to gain his win.

First, to set the stage, let's talk about how the USA elects presidents.  The USA does not elect presidents by popular vote.  Rather, we elect presidents through use of an "electoral college".  There are 538 electors, and each state gets a number of electors that is equivalent to its number of elected senators and representatives.  The fewest a state can have is three.  There are also three given to the District of Columbia.  Each state decides how to apportion their electors.  The most common method(48/50 states) is all-or-nothing, majority wins.  This means that the candidate who wins a popular vote in a particular state gets **all** of that state's electors, regardless of how close the vote is. 

So let's go back to 2000.  At the end of Election Night, GWB had 246 electoral college votes and Al Gore had 250.  270 electoral college votes is the majority, and whoever gets 270(or more) wins.  There were three states outstanding, but Florida had 25 electoral college votes and thus was the lynchpin.  Whoever won Florida won the race.

As Election Night wore on, the state was called for Gore and GWB at different times by the media.  It's worth noting that this carries no legal or electoral weight of any kind.  By the time the count was finished, the margin between GWB and Gore in Florida was 1,784 votes, with GWB up.  Under Florida law this triggered a mandatory **machine** recount.  This meant feeding all of the ballots back into automated counting machines.  That recount narrowed the gap to approximately 300 votes, still in GWB's favor.    

Over the next several days there was a lot of argument over recounts, what kind of recount(manual or machine), and where recounts would be held.  In general, Gore wanted manual recounts in specific counties, where GWB argued that a recount had to be statewide or it was invalid.  

Eventually, this argument reached the US Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.  I need to digress for a moment to explain a few things about the construction of the US legal system.  In summary, we have a federal system and 50 individual state systems.  Each state decides how they vote, how they accept ballots, what counts, et cetera.  The US federal government **does not** tell states how to run elections, even for federal races.  There's one giant exception here, though - state elections not violate the US federal Constitution.  The federal courts can step into virtually any state-level matter if it violates the Constitution.

GWB sued to stop the recount, arguing that it was in violation of the US Constitution.  The argument was made on two grounds: first, that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution, and second, that earlier decisions made to allow the recounts violated Article II of the US Constitution.  The Article II argument did not stick, but the Equal Protection argument did.

Each Florida county was recounting independently, using **their own** criteria for manually judging ballots.  This would mean that two identical ballots could be counted differently in two separate counties.  By a 7-2 majority, the US Supreme Court agreed that this was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and thus the current recount could not continue as it was unconstitutional.  Of note, the 7-2 majority included both conservative and liberal justices(both sides) and it was really an 8-1 decision, as Justice Souter agreed that it was unconstitutional but disagreed on the reasoning.  Only Ginsburg thought this was constitutional.

The bigger issue was what to do about this.  The general agreement was that a state-set process, that was the same county-to-county, would suffice to overcome this ruling.  However, there was a timing problem.  State certification of electoral votes was due on December 12, and a certification done by December 12 in accordance with state law was automatically Constitutional.  Florida had already stated that they **would** be done with the certification by December 12.  The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on December 11 and issued their ruling on December 12.  

The more controversial decision here is the 5-4 decision, along ideological lines, that the issue be remanded to the Florida Supreme Court for "or further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion".  Given the prior Florida rulings, this effectively ended the recount, although it was not ordered as such.
 
Both decisions were controversial, the second more than the first.  The controversy around the second stems primarily around whether the USSC should have ordered Florida to proceed with a recount and to miss the deadline.  There's also an argument that the USSC could **not** do that as the lack of recount does not constitute a Constitutional violation that the USSC could repair.

In short, while the final answer(no more recounts) was controversial, the declaration that Florida's planned recount was much less so.

To win the Presidential election you need 270 electoral votes. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes they can award a candidate (based on population of the state). In the 2000 Election, whoever won FL would win the states 29 electoral votes and achieve the required 270 votes and be the President of the United States.

Background: the governor of FL at the time was Jeb Bush (George Bush’s younger brother) and the FL Secretary of State was Katie Harris (a republican, same as Bush). 

FL voting system: they used a butterfly ballot which means you essentially punch a hole in a ballot to select your choice for president. This voting style was confusing to many people and not every hole punched went completely through the ballot. Because the ballot was confusing, a third party candidate Pat Buchanan received an abnormal amount of votes. Specifically, he received 3,500 votes from a very left leaning county even tho he was an ultra conservative. 

So with that background knowledge, on November 8th of 2000, Florida declared George Bush the winner of FL with 49% of the vote and beating Al Gore by less than 2,000 votes. Because the margin of victory was within 1%, the state is required to do a mandatory automated/machine recount. 

After a few days, the automated recount came back and now Bush’s lead was reduced to only 327 votes. Later analysis showed that 18 of FL counties (which account for nearly 25% of all votes) did not complete the required automated recount. Additionally, residents of FL came out saying they were confused by the ballot and accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan. Even Buchanan came out publicly to say he believes these residents did not vote for him and the votes in those very left leaning counties should go to Gore (3,500 votes). This was request was denied and those votes stood for Buchanan.

Because Gore and his campaign never challenged the automated recount and couldn’t fight for Buchanan’s votes, this result stood. However, FL law allows for a campaign to request a manual recount of the votes in specific counties. The Gore campaign requested the recount of 4 counties that are traditional very pro democrat. These manual recounts are required to meet a mandatory deadline of 7 days.

The mandatory recounts are supervised by members of both parties to ensure accuracy. But instead of ensuring all votes are accurately counted, both sides would repeatedly argue over which ballots had been filled out correctly and would attempt to throw out ballots against their party. The reason these ballots were disputed is because of the Butterfly Ballot or hole punching ballot. When you punched a hole in the ballot, some did not go through all the way. This allowed parties to say that because the hole in the ballot was not completely through (known as a “hanging Chad”) it should be tossed out. This lead to arguments over how deep a hole must be punched to qualify. By the time the deadline hit, no county had finished their recount and the FL Secretary of Stare refused to extend the deadline. It was expected on Nov 18th, the FL Secretary would conclude the winner of FL was Bush.

However, on November 17th the FL Supreme Court stepped in an declared that no result could be finalized until they heard the appeals of the court cases already in process. A few days later, the FL Supreme Court ruled that the manual recount should continue and they extended the original deadline of November 14 to November 26. However, because of the hanging chad issue, most counties did not complete the recount and on the Nov 26 the state of FL declared Bush the winner by 537 votes. Gore understandably challenged this ruling.

The FL Supreme Court ruled that all ballots (around 70,000) in question must be manually recounted.

But on December 12th, the US Supreme Court ruled that the FL Supreme Court decision for a recount was unconstitutional by a 7-2 vote. Then by a 5-4 vote in the US Supreme Court, it was ruled that time had run out for a recount and Bush is the winner of FL. The US is very ideology driven and the 5 conservatives in the court ruled for Bush while the 4 liberal judges ruled for Gore. 

Adding fuel to the fire Gore won the popular vote but lost 271 to 266 in the electoral college.
We may never actually know. 

Full disclaimer, this may get removed as I'm not a historian. I am, however, an attorney. So, I can talk a little bit more about the legal battle behind it. 

On the night of the election, a [slew of news networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEB9hWYMpA0&feature=emb_title) called Florida for Al Gore. However, they did so *before* the polls actually closed.  However, after the polls actually closed, Bush took the lead by over 100,000 votes. Gore called Bush and conceded.  As the night drew on, it became apparent that the race was actually closer than anticipated.  The day after the election, Bush [only had a lead of 300 votes](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html).  Gore called Bush and rescinded his concession.  As overseas ballots were counted in the following days, Bush's lead grew.   Thus began the five week legal battle to determine the winner of the election.

Regardless, the Florida secretary of state declared the election for Bush and the Democrats demanded a recount *in certain counties* where "undervote" was particularly prevalent. The "undervote" was a result of "hanging chads"  -- ballots where the hole wasn't *entirely* punched through. It was unclear if these individuals intended to vote for a certain candidate and failed to actually punch all the way through, or if they began to punch and changed their mind. This led to "[undervote](https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/30/jackson.undervote/index.html)": where the machines tabulating the ballots were unable to register ANY vote for president on around 9,000 ballots in Miami-Dade county (a heavily democratic area) 

The initial stages of the recount also led to an examination of the infamous "[butterfly ballots"](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/article/20101107/NEWS/812036359) \-- an infamously confusing ballot setup. As you can see from the photo in that article, it's confusing. The first punch is for Bush, the second for Buchanan, the third for Gore.  Buchanan, a conservative third party candidate, received many votes in heavily democratic areas, leading [some people to believe](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/12/666812854/the-florida-recount-of-2000-a-nightmare-that-goes-on-haunting) that many people who intended to vote for Gore selected the wrong hole punch. 

The Florida Supreme Court ruled that a "[legal vote](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/#tab-opinion-1960861)" was one where the intent was clear from the ballot and ordered a manual recount of the ballots in Miami-Dade County. They also empowered state officials to order, if necessary, a recount "in all counties that have not conducted a  manual recount or tabulation of the undervotes ... \[and\] to do so forthwith,  said tabulation to take place in the individual counties where the  ballots are located..." 

The US Supreme Court, however, reversed the Florida Supreme Court's decision. In a 7-2 decision, in [Bush v. Gore](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/#tab-opinion-1960861) they held that ordering a few specific counties to recount -- but not ALL counties -- violated the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution. In effect, they reasoned that the ballots in counties NOT subject to a recount were not given the same protections as those in a county in which there was a recount.  In effect, they needed a statewide recount or no recount.  

In that same case, the Supreme Court held, 5-4, that there was no alternative vote procedure that could be established in a timely manner that would satisfy the Equal Protection and Due Process concerns. This is the portion of the ruling that effectively ended the election and gave Bush the presidency. 

The narrative of stealing the election primarily comes from the Bush campaign's legal efforts to stop the recounts and declare him president. Whether that is actually true, we may never know. The recounts were halted.  The truth behind the mysterious Buchanan votes was never uncovered.  Bush became president.

Later reports found that the "overseas" ballots which widened Bush's lead were not treated with the s[ame standards as other votes](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html) \-- with officials sometimes ignoring errors or double counting ballots. On the other hand, later reports also found that [Bush maintained a lead](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/us/examining-vote-overview-study-disputed-florida-ballots-finds-justices-did-not.html) within the disputed ballots. 

Ultimately, whether or not Bush won the election the Supreme Court decision is particularly relevant today. In *Bush v. Gore*, the Supreme Court was willing to step into and modify a state's procedure for determining a presidential election. This precedent may soon again become relevant in the coming weeks.

It depends on who you ask and how they counted the ballots.  

[NORC did a study in 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20070125163734/http:/electionstudies.org:80/florida2000/index.htm) and found that Gore would have won by between 60 and 171 votes had the full by-hand recount of all disputed ballots been conducted, depending on what criteria was used to read them.

However, it's not accurate to claim that Bush "stole" the election or used "intrigue".  The official count was "the official count" when Gore conceded.  It is still the official count in the public record.  The actual, factual count is incredibly difficult to determine, simply because of [the type of ballots](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/storyimage/LK/20151105/NEWS/812069858/AR/0/AR-812069858.jpg) used by FL in 2000.  The design is poor from the start - voters used a little tool to punch out a perforated section next to their chosen candidate.  However, what do you do with a ballot that is only partially punched and the perforated section is not fully removed?  You may have heard the term "hanging chads" - [this is what the phrase refers to.](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/courses/275f00/chads.gif)  What about ballots where the voter didn't press hard enough and the chad is clearly depressed, but not actually detached?  There's a lot of room for ambiguity, and whether a ballot has been clearly cast for one candidate or the other is open to interpretation.  There's also room for voter confusion, as the Gore/Lieberman ticket is the second option in the left hand column, but you need to punch the 3rd hole to select it.  The 2nd hole is actually for the first option in the right column.  Not a very clear layout.

What really determined the winner in 2000 was how the ballots were counted and when they stopped counting.  Gore wanted a full by-hand recount in four extremely close counties with a lot of ambiguous/questionable ballots.  Bush didn't, since he was winning based on the by-machine recount.  Initially the FL courts ordered a statewide, by-hand recount of only "questionable" ballots, but the US supreme court put a hold on that because different counties count votes differently and it would fall afoul of the equal protection clause.  Gore could have (and arguably should have) pressed the issue further in the courts, but he didn't.  

Had he appealed using specific counting standards, it likely would have been permitted.  Depending on what those standards were, he probably would have won.  But by that point it was already mid Dec. and everybody was completely fed up with the whole process.  The public just wanted it to be over.  The Bush campaign had spent the last 5 weeks pushing the narrative that Gore was a sore loser and he was dragging the whole country down rather than just admitting he lost.  Public opinion was starting to agree with the spin.  At the advice of his lawyers and advisors, [Gore officially conceded](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/politics/text-of-goreacutes-concession-speech.html) on 12/13/2000.

The results of the election may well have been inaccurate, but it was certainly not "stolen".  It was (and still is) somewhat ambiguous who the voters in FL really intended to choose.

Florida was not the only state whose count was in question. I don’t see any answers addressing the integrity of the Diebold voting machines in Ohio. Can anyone qualified to answer in this sub speak to that?
Strictly speaking, this question is still subject to the 20 year rule, right?

Well, the answer is unfortunately not that satisfying, but I expect that you came into this question realizing it was a somewhat vain hope given the use of "disappeared from history". To provide a little background, Sally Hemmings had a number of children, some of whom died in infancy, which are generally accepted as being fathered by Thomas Jefferson (I would direct to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2) for more discussion, broadly, of the sexual relationships between masters and slaves in the antebellum South). Whether or not this was fact has been debated since before Jefferson himself died, and scholarly opinion has swayed about, but it is pretty much now the consensus.

Anyways though. Harriet, described as "nearly as white as anybody and very beautiful" had no trouble passing for white, and as you already are aware, made use of this. She was freed in 1822 at the age of 21, apparently on a promise Jefferson had made to Sally Hemings to do so when the children reached that age. The documentation of Harriet's liberation is almost next to nothing. Edmund Bacon, who worked as an overseer at Monticello, described her departure, being the one who gave her the $50 that you mention, and stating she had been headed for Philadelphia. And as for her life after she headed north, we only have one account which we can give any real credence to, that from her brother Madison, who wrote in 1873:

>Harriet married a white man in good standing in Washington City, whose name I could give, but will not, for prudential reason. She raised a family of children, and so far as I know they were never suspected of being tainted with African blood in the community where she lived or lives. I have not heard from her for ten years, and do not know whether she is dead or alive. She thought it to her interest, on going to Washington, to assume the role of a white woman, and but her dress and conduct as such I am not aware that her identity as Harriet Hemings of Monticello has ever been discovered. 

Washington City in this case refers to the District of Columbia as it was then known, and it would appear that while she kept a low profile, she did not choose to cut all ties with her family, at least immediately, as Madison claims to have remained in contact with her through the 1860s (he was writing in 1873). He also gives us reason to believe it quite possible that she has living descendants, but of course was much to guarded to allow any information to get out which could give much of a thread to follow. What the end of communications even meant is up in the air - perhaps she decided to cut her final tie to non-white society, or perhaps she simply died. We can only speculate. But in any case, Madison's account is the lone source we can rely on to reconstruct any sense of her post-emancipation life.

She was not the only child of Jefferson and Hemmings to follow such a route. While Madison and Eston both left records, writings, and known descendants, their brother Beverley was similarly allowed to leave Monticello for the North, and even less seems sure about his fate then his sister, doing a similar disappearing act but without, it seems, even the record of correspondence that Harriet left He was briefly in contact, long enough to communicate back that he had married a white woman and that they had a daughter, living in Washington City, but that seems to be the end of it. In both the case of Beverley and Harriet, it should be noted, Jefferson *officially* recorded them as being escaped slaves, as their departure was recorded in the 'farm book', but it was quite clearly allowed with his approval as a means of sending them North in technical compliance with the aforementioned agreement he had made with Sally. The backhanded means of liberation is thought to have been a means of following through without providing ammunition for those looking to prove the parentage.

Now, as to the second part of your question, you might perhaps want to x-post to /r/AskScience as it is less a history question that one for a geneticist. What I do understand of these things would imply that it is possible to find genetic matches that show relations by various degrees, but it isn't like those genes are signed "T.J." Establishing who that common ancestor is takes a lot more leg work. To compare to the famous claim about Genghis Khan's widespread DNA, this is based on finding the the same Y-chromosome (which records patrilineal descent) in millions of people that shows they share a common male ancestor a certain period back in time. Genghis Khan is then assumed to be the one based on historical circumstances. But I would hesitate to say more, as again, this is getting into the territory for a scientist to discuss.

Let's start with beef, since the patty is the easiest part here, and also the most important part of the burger. The romans absolutely had beef. There are dozens of references to beef throughout greek and roman literature. In the odyssey, Odysseus kills some sacred cattle, and cooks the meat. I'm sure that in a big city like rome, it would be easy to come across some beef. Grinding beef by hand might be hard, but I'm sure our McRoman can pull it off, considering his need for a delicious burger. You can do that with a decent knife, but it'll be an absolute pain. 

Next, we need cheese. Pliny, in his *Natural History* (XI, 96-97) talks about cheese. In chapter 97, he lists off a bunch of kinds of cheese, but what sounds good to me is his comment that "Goats also produce a cheese which has been of late held in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by smoking it." Smoked goat cheese would be nice on a burger, if a little off from traditional McDonalds. 

Our greens are next. Onion is also mentioned in Pliny's text. IN book XIX, chapter 32, Pliny talks about onions. He mentions a few varieties of onions. The onions of Crete are known for "the sweetness of their flavour." Sweet onion is my preferred burger onion, so let's hope our McRoman can find that. However, he can certainly find some kind of onion. We're doing good!

Now for Lettuce. Once again, we're in luck! The romans ate lots of lettuce, and once again, Pliny has us covered. Chapter 38 of the same book is all about lettuce. He describes a bunch of lettuces, including one so large it could be used for a small garden gate! The footnotes in the translation seem to indicate this might be Sessile, or romaine lettuce, so we'll go with that. However, any lettuce will do here, so let's not worry too much about that. We got lettuce! 

Pliny disappoints here with pickles. Despite devoting Chapters 2 - 5 of Book 20 to cucumbers as a medicine, and chapter 23 of book XIX to cucumbers as something to grow in your garden, Pliny doesn't actually mention that you can pickle cucumbers anywhere I saw. Columella' *de re rustica* (on agriculture), however, does. He states that you mix up "hard brine," which is heavily saturated saltwater, and vinegar (which was made from wine and spices), and then you add cucumbers and all kinds of other stuff. Your pickles will be giving your burger a real funky taste. 

Mustard seed is also mentioned in Pliny. Apicus mentions mustard as well, and wants everyone to use it all the time. I didn't feel like crawling through more translations for all this, so I just went out and found someone else's adaptation of Apicus's mustard recipe. I linked it down below. The recipe is going to make a stone ground, strong flavored mustard. It's got some whole seeds, and is probably closest to modern brown mustard. This is strong artisanal stuff, so again with the funky taste and strong burger. 

Bread is going to be expensive at the least. Modern flour is of great quality, historically speaking. Only the finest flour would have been fine and white. Off in Book XVIII, Chapter 26, Pliny talks about bread and risen bread. He says that "At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till it begins to turn sour." That's sourdough - they have a starter culture, and then they would use it. It's not fed and kept like a modern sourdough culture, but it is decent starter yeast. The flavor from it will be inconsistent, and you'll probably have some grit from the grinding, but if your McRoman shills out all the cash he can, he'll get decent sourdough bread. This will not be a neutral flavored bun, and it's not going to look great. But you could buy some sort of small loaf at a bakery, so at least we have a bun. 

Sesame seeds are also not the hardest. It's an old crop, and a quick search pulled up a JSTOR result on how the "seed was well known to ancient greek and roman authors." I'm sure our Ronald McRoman could walk on down to the market and buy a little thing of sesame seeds if needed. So he just needs to pay the baker to put a bunch of sesame seeds on the nicest small loaf he has before he bakes it. Easy peasy!

The romans would have had frying pans and griddles. The Royal Ontario museum of archeology has an article they published in the American Journal of Archaeology, which I found reproduced on The University of Chicago's website. It includes a number of illustrations of Frying pans and Griddles. They look not bad for frying. 

In summary: Yes. we're going to burger town. But it's going to be gourmet, and not what we're used to. The biggest issue will be the beef, which is going to be a pain to butcher into ground beef. But it won't be that off from what you might get in a fancy hipster restaurant. I dunno how much this might all cost, sorry.

Oh snap, I'm late to the party on this one. Let's talk about some McCaesar's, shall we? 

First, let's discuss the basic components of a cheeseburger and what those entail. Some of the modern stuff ([like heavily sugared buns](https://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/answer/how-much-sugar-in-a-bun/)), we'll obviously pass over, but we *will* be talking about what our ancient cheeseburger will taste like - and how it'd probably be pretty damn delicious, but with a bit of Roman flair. 

So most basic of the basic ingredients:

* buns  
* cheese 
* beef patty (possibly two if you're like me and eat more than your body weight in a day I mean what)  
* salt and pepper  

However, if you just make a burger with those things, it's going to be a boring burger. What makes the burger delicious isn't just its beef and cheese, but its toppings. Today, those include ketchup, mustard, mayo, and, oftentimes, some sort of mystery sauce. The Romans didn't have access to tomatoes, so we'll go ahead and skip that one, but not only can we get everything else, I think we can replace the ketchup and still have things taste just fine. Some other toppings'n'stuff are tomato (again), lettuce, onion, butter, and garlic (powder, used for seasoning). 

But we don't want any old McDonald's burger - [we want a *real* burger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM_KMYulI_s). So can we make Gordon Ramsay happy with readily available ingredients in Rome? I'm gonna go ahead and say absolutely. 

First off, I'm gonna go ahead and start with a quote from Cato the Elder who, among being a cantankerous old coot who liked hating on Carthage, [wrote an entire book about how great cabbage is](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/K*.html), as well as giving us this delightful quote:

> “Of this last kind of comparisons is that quoted from the elder Cato, who, when asked what was the most profitable thing to be done on an estate, replied, “To feed cattle well.” “What second best?” “To feed cattle moderately well.” “What third best?” “To feed cattle, though but poorly.” “What fourth best?” “To plough the land.” And when he who had made these inquiries asked, “What is to be said of making profit by usury?” Cato replied, “What is to be said of making profit by murder?” 

(Cicero, *De Officiis*)

That is to say, the Romans loved beef and recognized the amount of money that could be made in the proper care and raising of cattle. While grain is what everyone talks about being mass produced for the Roman people, it was a poor man's food (as shown by the constant grain subsidies that were in place to feed the people of Rome, not to mention the actually massive shipments coming in from across the Mediterannean). But the beef was not only high quality ([I'll refer you to the non-cabbage related portions of Cato](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/home.html), written in the 2nd c. BCE), but it was certainly not a rare commodity. That being said, I'm not sure that the beef was particularly cheap - it's tough to nail down prices (and I'll see if I can do some side research into estimates for you, but since we don't even know for sure how much wheat cost....I'm digressing), but meat was meat, and the majority of Romans (the poor) did not have enough loose change to commit to it. That being said, other (more contemporary) authours talk about cows nonstop, and if you'd like to know more about cattle breeds, what they might have looked like, and what they were good for, I'd be happy to provide sources. For now, know that there were many, some were renowned for their meat, and some for their cheese.

And oh my, did the Romans love their cheeses. Cows are versatile creatures, and they offer a variety of substances that were useful for this endeavour - meat, cheese, and butter. Now, the Romans weren't themselves heavy users of butter (Apicius avoids it in all of his recipes, and the Romans themselves seem to have seen it as a weird German thing), preferring olive oil or other fats, but it was certainly theoretically available. If you can make a good cheese, you can make butter. So we can certainly check off the butter, the cheese (probably way better cheese than you'd get with most burgers, honestly), and the beef quite easily.

Salt is one of those things that everyone likes to misunderstand - there's a trope that the word *salary* came from the Roman soldiers being paid in salt, which has no real basis - but hey, the Romans themselves were unsure about where their word *salarium* came from. Either way, the Romans had salt, and they greedily held control over their salt supplies. One of those mines was at one of Rome's major ports in Ostia, giving easy access to the resource. 

Pepper, on the other hand, is not a naturally occurring European resource. However, by 1 CE (thanks for that date, gives me the excuse to rant about Roman trade networks), trade with India was *booming*. After the subjugation of Egypt in 31 BCE, the Romans subsumed the Ptolemaic trade routes through the province, driving the previous levels of trade to a fever pitch, a trade explosion which continued for over 200 years. Where trade had previously been slow, with as few as twenty ships making the trip, the Romans used their military as a workforce to create the necessary infrastructure for intensifying trade with the East; over a hundred ships were soon making the annual journey to India.^1 Where enterprising merchants had previously only been able to travel at night, heavily stocked with water and in constant fear of banditry, the Romans built and fortified roads, water stations, and the trading cities themselves. Shipyards were built in an attempt to support the failed invasion of Arabia in 26 CE, which were easily converted to civilian use afterwards.^2 This large-scale rise in infrastructure created a fertile environment for a wave of consumerism to sweep the Roman world, with demand for Eastern luxuries and spices increasing dramatically among those with disposable income. Those imports ranged from places as far apart as Madagascar and Vietnam. The primary partner of Rome in this sea trade, however, was India. Trade ports ranged across the subcontinent, each one offering a different selection of trade goods, the most common of which was pepper.^3 Other imports included varied types of luxury wood, precious stones, frankincense and myrrh, and textiles such as cotton and silk. Indian imports quickly became central to Roman life, with recipes and medicines commonly using exotic spices, such as malabatrum or the especially unhelpfully described *“ispicam Indicam.”*

I've provided a few sources at the bottom for further reading on this, since there's honestly a vast wealth of information discussing Roman trade and how quickly and deeply it was tied to Rome - it quickly became *the* big business in the Roman empire, with individual shiploads being valued in the millions of *sestertii*. MacLaughlin's book is an excellent one, and Lytle is a magnificent researcher when it comes to near eastern trade (and ancient fishermen). But I digress.

By this time, pepper would have been readily available in multiple types, and wouldn't be too terrifically difficult to come by. Garlic, too, is a native herb to Europe, Asia, and beyond, and would not have been rare or even worth special commentary for its difficulty to find. Fear not, your beef patty will be perfectly seasoned, assuming that you're a decent chef and/or have access to YouTube so that you can do a quick search on Gordon Ramsay's burger. The onion, too, was incredibly popular in all sorts of things, from cooking to medicine, and your request to put onions on this concoction would have been met with approval from whomever you were commissioning. That and the fact that it wasn't hard to come by, so it would have been reasonably cheap. Overall, by the way, this burger probably would cost you a pretty penny. Probably not those 30 pieces of silver, but certainly something that you would see at an Epicurean feast. 



A suitably motivated Roman could have cobbled together some approximation of the modern cheeseburger.

We must assume, first, that this Roman was wealthy enough to own a house with its own kitchen. The great majority of the city of Rome's inhabitants lived in insulae (apartment blocks) with rudimentary, if any, spaces for culinary preparation, and simply bought most of their hot food from the many "fast food" stalls lining the major streets. 

But if our Roman had  a kitchen in which to prepare it, beef was available from butcher stalls in certain markets - an inscription mentions a *bubularius* (beef seller) near the Roman Forum (*AE* 1991, 287). It was probably customary for the butcher to have a few choice cuts prepared for customers (as seen in [this famous relief](http://romanancienthistory.blogspot.com/2016/02/famous-funerary-stele-of-roman-butcher.html)), and our hypothetical burger-loving Roman could easily purchase enough beef for a burger. 

Since the Romans regularly ground meat for sausages, our Roman would have had no trouble grinding the beef and cooking it. In the collection of recipes traditionally attributed to Apicius, in fact, there actually is a recipe for *isicia omentata*, sometimes described as a proto-hamburger. The recipe, according to a rather antiquated online translation, is:

"Finely cut pulp of pork is ground with the hearts of winter wheat and diluted with wine. Flavor lightly with pepper and broth and if you like add a moderate quantity of myrtle berries also crushed, and after you have added crushed nuts and pepper shape the forcemeat into small rolls, wrap these in caul \[that is, intestinal membrane\], fry, and serve with wine gravy."  (2.1.7 - for a modern take on the recipe, see [this page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/ethnic/historical/ant-rom-coll.html#3)).

Ground beef, in short, would have been no trouble.

Cheese was abundant, and sold from stalls throughout the city. Lettuce, grown in market gardens around Rome, was also easily available - Apicius has a whole chapter [devoted to lettuce-based recipes](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/3*.html#XVIII). 

The Romans knew how to pickle vegetables (see [this chapter in Apicius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/1*.html#22)), but I'm not aware of any evidence that they regularly pickled cucumbers. Onions, however, were used in many dishes. 

As for the bun - bread was of course widely available, and Apicius has a recipe for honey cookies with sesame seeds. I don't think, however, that the Romans regularly ate buns sprinkled with sesame seeds. 
Well, let's look at Roman cookbook [**De Re Coquinaria**](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/home.html) which was done in the late 300's CE. So almost four hundred years off your indicated time period but let's play it loose.

First, hamburger meat. He devotes one chapter to all kinds of minced dishes from fish to poultry and red meat. The red meat of choice is pork instead of beef. There are comparatively few beef receipes in the collection, which would suggest beef would not have been widely consumed at this time. As for the mincing method, chopping the meat finely seems and pounding it in the mortar to be the way instead of grinding.  He also describes kind of patty made from the chopped crab meat which is then fried, so mince + patty + cooking would be a known thing, too. 

Pickles would be easy peasy as well. He describes cucumbers with  pepper, pennyroyal, honey, broth and vinegar and in another recipe pickled beets. So pickled cucumbers could also plausibly be a thing even if he does not explicitly have them.

Mustard is also mentioned in several places as an ingredient, as is lettuce and onions. 

Cheese is also a very old dish and Romans had all kinds of cheeses. soft fresh ones and hard aged ones. Varro describes both in  [**De Re Rustica**](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/home.html)**.**

As for the bun, Romans did a lot of bread. However, I don't know if any of the many versions of bread they had were actually bun sized. Also the Roman leavening would not yield the fluffy and airy texture of the modern bun.

So I'd say the ingredients would have been available at 400 CE.
A follow up question for when this is answered: if it is possible to make one, would it be possible to mass-produce? I’ve heard of Roman “fast food”, so the concept was there, but if someone went back in time with the knowledge to do so, would it be achievable to get a Roman McDonald’s chain up and running?
It should be possible to procure all the major ingredients in some not-too-alien form. Beef, cheese, bread, sesames, salt, and lettuce were all available to a wealthy Roman. But there are some important economic considerations of this enterprise I’d like to address. 

Price indexes are an attempt to characterize the price of many different goods into a single value. The reason why they are complex is that it is difficult to construct “reasonably” a relative weighting of many different things. Part of the reason the Economist proselytizes the virtues of its Big Mac Index is that it erases all the vagaries of finding compatible weights. It’s a way to cut the Gordian Knot of reconciling the differing index baskets of goods which are at least as plentiful as national statistics bureaus across the Earth.

When you inject 2000 years of economic transformation into this process, you strain the assumptions of this comparison strategy. The Roman Empire in 1AD was as highly monetized a society as existed on Earth, meaning a surprisingly large portion of economic transactions were conducted in money. But this was only a relative phenomenon. Large swaths of the population engaged in partial or total subsistence agriculture. Many transactions, especially among the poor, were conducted in barter or payment-in-kind. And a large portion of the labor force were slaves. So when you only watch “money” you are examining only a specific slice of total economic activity. 

All these issues in the Roman Empire became much more serious after the inflationary problems of the Third Century and then the economic straight jacket of the Reforms of Diocletian. But even in 1AD looking at prices only tells you the cost weighting of only the relatively well off. (Especially if you consider that preferences really are not homothetic, but let’s not get too far gone into theory.) So while you could perhaps set your mind to constructing a Big Mac Index for the Roman Empire, you should keep in mind just how little it will tell you about their economic world.

Less important aside: the bun would be really hard to make. They had plenty of wheat, but modern refined flour is a fairly novel occurrence. They’d probably have to make something much more porous or much more dense.

If you want a relatively recent paper probing Roman prices, I’d suggest [this](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2011/retrieve.php?pdfid=219). It has a decent literature review, and covers many of the reason why this is such a hard question.
A few years ago I spent a week cooking my way through the history of the hamburger in order to write an article on the subject for Smithsonian Magazine, so I have some first-hand experience with some of what we're talking about.

There is a recipe in Apicius (4th Century Roman cookbook) that is very burger-like. Meat chopped up and formed into a patty and cooked. I reproduced it and found that manually mincing meat with a knife is a huge pain and takes a very long time. If you wanted to simulate the actual texture of modern ground meat, you couldn't. I've tried. You'll get something that is sort of in the same ballpark as ground beef but isn't exactly the same thing.

Hamburgers were invented roughly simultaneously in various places in the US because of one important piece of technology that suddenly became available: The mechanical hand-cranked meat grinder (or "food chopper" as it was initially billed). Once it was advertised in the Sears catalog, sales took off. 

Anyway, my point is that you really need a mechanical meat grinder to make burgers practical. They didn't have those in Rome in 1 AD. Although if someone had the idea and was very wealthy, there were skilled metal workers who could theoretically have made such a device.

The process of denazification and the trials of various war criminals in Germany was enormous. The Nazi party had 8.5 million members by the end of the war. Somewhere in the region of 18 million people served in the German armed forces during the war, many of whom had committed atrocities and war crimes. 17.2 million people voted for the Nazi party in the 1933 election. Almost 22 million had been members of the German Labour Front, the Nazi replacement for the Trade Unions. Perhaps as many as 45 million individuals were members of or associated with organs of the Nazi party. As such, the process of denazification would have to be conducted on an epic scale.

Whilst at first there was great zeal with regards to complete removal of Nazism from public life, it soon became apparent that investigating and/or punishing every single person who was tangentially related to the party would be logistically impossible, and also significantly impair efforts to create a functioning German state after the war. However, a significant number of people still went through the machine. In the American zone of occupation, 3,623,112 people went through some sort of process in front of denazification courts. 2,504,686 of these people were given amnesty. 

Suspected Nazis were divided into 5 different groups. Groups I and II were Major Offenders and Offenders. These were the big fish, going from those who had committed war crimes at the top of group I, down to leading party activists in group II. Group III was minor offenders, Group IV was followers of the regime and Group V was exonerated persons. Only a small number of people were deemed to be in Groups I or II (in the American zone 2.5%, in the French 0.1%, the British did not use the first two groups, but 1.3% of offenders were categorised as group III). In the West German zones of occupation, 5228 people were convicted of War Crimes from 1945 to 1950. There were a further 1878 trials up until 1997, of which 14 were sentenced to death and 150 given life sentences. In East Germany 4000 people were found guilty of War Crimes up to 1950, after which the efforts were scaled down. 

Did this mean that Germany had been thoroughly de-nazified? Absolutely not. Whilst the most famous Nazis and worst war criminals had been brought to justice, hundreds if not thousands of people who had committed crimes under the regime never faced trial. In 1965 the DDR published the 'brown book', which detailed over 1800 senior members of the West German Government, armed forces, police and judiciary who had been former Nazi party officials, including some who were former Gestapo officers. Whilst this book can naturally be criticised as propoganda and the West German government described it as utterly false, Frank McDonough describes the book as "not merely true, but it seriously underestimated the number". Indeed, the 9th President of Austria and 4th Secretary General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim, was rumoured to have been aware of and a collaborator in war crimes while he served with the Wehrmacht in Eastern Europe. In 1949 the West German Government passed an immunity law, giving immunity to any citizen who would have received a punishment of under six months imprisonment for their crimes during the war, effectively ending the efforts to denazify the general population. It would also be fair to say that these trials did not materially impact the opinion of the German population of Hitler or Nazism. The US conducted opinion polls in their sector, and discovered that just 54% thought Nazism was a bad idea. 59% believed that the numbers of those killed in the holocaust were true. 77% thought the extermination of Jews was 'unjustified'. We can clearly see that the process of denazification, whilst bringing some to justice, failed to change the hearts and minds of the German people.

It would be fair to say that the process of denazification is still an issue of historical debate. The scale, effectiveness and motivations of denazification both in East and West Germany are hotly debated. However, even today there are still trials of former SS members and those complicit in the holocaust. 94 year old [Oskar Groening](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/auschwitz-guard-oskar-groening-jailed-over-mass-murder) was sentenced to 4 years in prison in 2015, in 2016, 94 year old [Reinhard Hanning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/auschwitz-guard-reinhold-hanning-holocaust-trial) was sentenced to 5 years in prison. 91 year old [John Demjanjuk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/john-demjanjuk-guilty-nazi-killings?intcmp=239) was found guilty in 2011 of assisting with the murders at the Sobibor concentration camp. These will perhaps be the last of the war crimes trials in Germany, as many of the people who carried out these crimes not only got away with it, but prospered.
What about the nazi “underground railroad” and the nazi diaspora?
Did the German civilians know about the camps during the war? Or did they have to find out after it all ended?

You know, normally, far be it from me to critique praise of medieval learning, particularly from a classicist, I love medieval learning, it's what I...do with all my time but...WOW this is a meteorically bad take.

First, there are just a bunch of amusingly wrong details in this tweet that come from this man being a classicist who has no idea what he's talking about. First, there was no university at York in 800, and there were likely very few 18 year old students. By that time, anyone who was getting an education had probably already either nearly finished or taken monastic vows. Even later, when universities came to be, students started at much younger ages, 14-16 were typical, at least for the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris.

Second, they didn't read music better, on account of there not being a system of written music in 800s Britain. Also as for the "more about astronomy:" There are 8 planets in the solar system and they orbit the sun. I have now given you a piece of information that absolutely no one in the Middle Ages had, or could discover. This isn't to say that they were stupid, if you dig through my posting history you'll find countless examples of me shouting into the void that medieval people were intelligent and did good intellectual work, but we simply have access to a wealth of scientific knowledge that they did not and could not have.

Also, "knew more mathematics" is wild, given that most high school educations get you at least through Calculus, which neither the middle ages nor the ancients ever developed.

Next, we get to some bigger issues, one of which is this: Everyone can go to school now. Reading, writing, and education in general, was overwhelmingly the province of the rich, all through the premodern period. Only very recently has universal schooling until the age of 18 come into being, the same is true for large scale programs to make university affordable. The only way to truly get any sense of medieval learning is to read the texts that have survived, and those have, often, survived because they were considered of very high quality. They were what medieval authors considered the cream of the crop. To compare the most learned and most talented of an extraordinarily narrow and privileged elite against the average modern student is incredibly unfair and, I think, facially ridiculous. 

Fifth, this sort of kids these days nonsense has been around since the dawn of time.

>And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.


This is Socrates, in Plato's *Phaedrus*, talking about how this newfangled writing stuff is going to make every student stupid. [Here](https://twitter.com/i/events/841292224684003328) is a delightful twitter thread from Medievalist Matt Gabriele, detailing a list of complaints against university students. Sound familiar? It's important to remember that a student starting at Oxford would be (1) 14 years old or so. (2) Much like our university students, away from his (and it would be his, women were not allowed in medieval universities) family for the first time. (3) Legally protected from local law, because university students were only subject to ecclesiastic courts, not local secular ones.

What the heck do YOU think a bunch of 14 year old boys, away from their families and with substantial protection against prosecution got up to in their time at university? If you thought it was "exclusive and devoted study of the classics and of theology" then I have a freaking bridge to sell you.  The University of Paris's charter, handed down in 1215, had several legal provisions designed to sort out jurisdictional issues that resulted from a massive tavern brawl between a bunch of locals and a group of German students (This is from *Medieval Violence: Physical Brutality in Northern France, 1270-1330,* which contains a full chapter on student violence) Hell, the founding story of the University of Cambridge is that a bunch of Oxford clerks got run out of town for causing the death of a woman, and several were hanged without recourse to the ecclesiastic courts. Town and Gown dislike is also as old as Universities.

I'm not as familiar with the classical record, but given that Plato's idea of a great intellectual gathering was "Let's get wine drunk and talk about love," my suspicion is it is much the same. 

Finally, and somewhat pettily, it's not the "So-Called Dark Ages," John. It's the Early Middle Ages. Only Classicists and Modernists who don't know better call it that.
I can talk specifically about mathematics, and in that circumstance the tweet is woefully incorrect.

To begin with consider what mathematics an 18 year old student in 800AD York would have known. The most impactful mathematical text of the time was Euclid's elements and this had been lost to Europe during this period, while being preserved by the Arabs. Instead geometry was restricted to simplistic and practical applications. Consequently any appeal to the students having an in-depth and rigorous knowledge of Euclidean geometry and the proof methodology it contains are categorically false. Indeed, there is a story of Gerbert of Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II), who was a known scholar and proponent of mathematics, struggling to solve a problem that would have been basic for mathematicians familiar with Euclid: given a right angle triangle with known hypotenuse and area, find the other two sides. 

Instead much of the mathematics revolved around arithmetic, word problems and the problem of calculating the date of easter (which is essentially an applied arithmetic problem). Arithmetic would have been a challenge since they used Roman numerals, hence calculations with large numbers would have been a substantial obstacle. Moreover, decimals did not exist and manipulations with arbitrary fractions were still unknown (fractions were mostly of a fixed form). This was part of the difficulty Bede faced when trying to calculate the date of easter.

The word problems were, in general, correspondingly simple. Alcuin of York, who conveniently lived until 804 AD wrote a book of elementary word problems that can be found [here](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Alcuin_book/). As the site states "it is worth remembering as one reads the problems, that this was the highlight of mathematics in Europe at the time." Here is an example of such a problem
>There is a field which is 30 yards on one side, 30 yards on another, and 18 metres in the front. How many square yards is the area of such a field? 

This is just calculating the area of a triangle. 

Let us compare both of these to what mathematics a modern "average student" from university knows. Well, putting aside a lack of practice and excluding the wiggle-room that the phrase "average student" entails, most students know quite a lot. They are certainly familiar with performing arithmetic with arbitrary fractions and decimals, including the relationship between the two and a knowledge of place value. They are also aware of how to calculate the area of a triangle, and indeed many of Alcuin's word problems would be comfortable for students who finished a mathematics education at 16. Looking at Gerbert's problem in modern terminology, you are solving the equations x^2 + y^2 = H and xy=2A. Similar to Alcuin's problems, this would not be a challenge for many with a mandatory maths education.  

If the average university student was a STEM student then they would probably have knowledge of calculus, complex numbers and basic differential equations. These would be unrecognisable to anybody from that period and much later, although problems that could be phrased in the language of calculus, such as movement of pendulums, would obviously be understandable.

If the average university student was a mathematics student they would probably have knowledge of analysis, abstract and linear algebra, elementary topology and elementary number theory (among others). Much of this knowledge and machinery was unknown to people 200 years ago, let alone 1200, and an average student of today often learns mathematics that was cutting edge only 150-200 years ago. The overwhelming emphasis on proof would also be unrecognisable to the 800AD students, since they hadn't seen Euclid. 

This all comes with the caveat that the students in 800AD were not intellectually incapable and that the steps mathematicians made throughout history were extremely important and significant in the field's development. I tend to be of the opinion that if the great mathematicians of the Middle Ages lived today they would also be very strong, although possibly in other disciplines. 

Essentially mathematics in 800AD Europe was just so basic that the advanced research level was trivial in comparison to the discipline we see today, so an average student then would be woefully ill equipped in comparison to modern students. Some of this may also apply to logic with the progressions in mathematical and symbolic logic, although I am not sufficiently familiar with non-mathematical logic to comment.
I cannot speak for the other parts of the tweet, since I am not well versed in historical subjects other than history of mathematics. However, the comment about knowing more mathematics is not possible for a simple reason: the mathematical tools that are currently taught to university students today were simply not invented yet. Actually, even most high school math subjects were not known to anyone in the world, let alone a university student.  


Examples:  
\-Calculus, which is taught at high school or freshman year at a university, was non-existent until Newton and Leibniz. There are at least 800 years until the notion of derivatives appears. And the modern form of integration, which is called the Riemann integral, was developed by Riemann in 1854.  
\-Solutions of the polynomial equations are very well known right now, thanks to the work of Evariste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel, who were both born in early 1800s. Their combined work shows us that there is no general solution to polynomial equations of degree higher than five. This is something that is taught in group theory courses, which most math students take in the second year of their education. (Some institutions teach group theory to other majors such as physics and engineering, although it is not really typical) However, in 800s, not even the solvability of 3rd degree equations was established. The formula for the cubic equation has to wait at least 700 years until Gerolamo Cardano is born.  
\-Almost any undergraduate student who is in engineering or STEM takes a course on differential equations, which is also not possibly known by anyone in 800s, for the simple reason that differentiation is non-existent.  
\-Set theory is a subject that is taught at high school level. I remember hearing about set theory paradoxes such as Russell's paradox (formulated in 1901) in high school. The modern understanding of set theory came into existence in late 1800s and early 1900s with Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, Ernest Zermelo etc.   
\-The fact that pi is irrational was not known until 1700s. Adrien-Marie Legendre gave the first correct proof in 1794.  
\-The study of complex numbers, which is taught (at least primitively) in high schools, was virtually non-existent until 1500s. (until Bombelli and Cardano)  
\-Analytic geometry was developed by Descartes and Fermat in 17th century.

I think the only subjects in which a university student in 800s could know as much as an average, modern university student are basic geometry, trigonometry and calculations/problem solving. But even the claim that an average student who just graduated from a university in 800s knew more mathematics than an average high-school graduate of today is not a legitimate claim.
Definitely not. As no chronological and geographical boundaries were set for the last expression in the original claim, using the *in dubio pro reo* principle I will limit myself to the UK in recent years, to maintain the comparison between English students in the year 800 and 2020. This said, let's dissect the claim.

Reading? Not really, no. Depending on whether John Dickson meant the reading during the university education proper or general reading experience up to and including studying university, the responses should fit the gamut between 'definitely not' and 'you surely jest'. In all developed countries today, entering university is preceded by 10-12 years of basic and intermediary education. During that time pupils are required to read quite  a substantial amount of text what is further expanded by the hobby reading encompassing all the written materials, be it handbooks, documentaries, newspapers, magazines, fiction books, role-playing game materials or any other text-based sources (including internet). This was hardly achievable by the medieval students, especially as early as the year 800 due to significantly restricted access to the written materials caused by physical and technological constraints.

Languages are a tricky subject. It is safe to assume that the students in the year 800 could have spoken primarily two languages: local form of Old English and Latin used in education and ecclesiastical proceedings. Norse will still be rare around that time. Does it matter? Not that much. Please take note that students in UK are less likely to know foreign languages that their continental counterparts largely due to the fact that English replaced Latin as the *lingua franca*. In Middle Ages, learning Latin was a means to an end and should the scholarly and religious texts were written in vernacular, the need to learn Latin would be far less pronounced. This is corroborated by the fact that English is the most common second language across Europe. It should be also noted that modern universities, unlike the early medieval one, run language courses for their students, contributing to greater availability of the linguistic education. Last but not least, students in York around year 800 were largely local, lacking the exposure to foreign languages. In 2019, foreign exchange students accounted for almost 20%, and although 20-25% part of them were coming from English-speaking countries, there is still a large percentage of students for whom English is not a first language. On the other hand, educated English in modern period (say, 17th or 18th century) would have most likely known Latin, Greek and French in addition to their native English.

The issue of music might initially look a bit biased, as the school that existed in York around the year 800 CE was the direct descendant of the church school founded by Archbishop Paulinus in 627 and had strong focus on the teaching of choral music. Using modern comparisons, it would have been an equivalent to a specialized conservatory rather than a regular university. Comparison of reading music is also a shaky prospect. I don't know how this subject is taught in UK, but the basic education in continental Europe often includes the music course that covers the groundworks of notation. Nothing special, but enough for a student to play a relatively simple piece on any instrument they can use. Of course, how much of this is retained until the late teens/early twenties by people not interested in music is another matter, but it is taught. Furthermore, the notation we're speaking about did not really evolve into a coherent system until late 10th century, and for the initial few centuries of the Church existence, the melody of the chants were largely transmitted orally, what was one of the reasons for proliferation of choir schools. Around the first half of the 9th century, systems of notations assisting in singing or rather melodic recitation were introduced, but this means that the best musical guide students in York around 800 CE could have possibly had was the first prototypes of neumatic notation assisting the singing of verses. They did not allow to write music not accompanied by text and thus were a far cry from the standard staff notation we use today. The latter is a product of Middle Ages, having been developed around 12th century, but this is several centuries past the time we're discussing. So, again, if this claim has been made about the late medieval university, it would have been largely true, as music theory has been taught there as one of the major 'courses'. But in reference to the year 800 CE it is nowhere close to the truth.  

Modern mathematics is far more advanced than anything people in 800 CE could have an access to. Although the exceptions possibly exist, average student of any faculty in modern York has been required to finish secondary education what allows us the assumption that they would need to prove understanding of concepts like polynomial equations, probability, statistics, functions and derivatives that did not exit in 9th century curricula. In addition, all students of technical universities either know differential and integral calculus that or are required to learn in the first year. This particular subject, although quite well developed in India at that time with its elements such as infinitesimals being used by scholars in the Hellenic Golden Age, generally started to take shape in Europe only in 11th century but even then they were still in its nascent in comparison to what is taught today.

When it comes to astronomy, then I would say it is an especially very bold claim. Modern students are usually aware of how the universe works at the very basic level and even if they forgot most of what has been taught, they know that the planets orbit far more massive stars and are themselves orbited by moons due to the forces of gravity. They are aware that the stars themselves radiate heat and light due to nuclear reactions and that they are vastly larger than they would appear. Students also have knowledge, no matter how nebulous, about the galaxies, asteroid belts, difference between gas giants and other planets, black holes, solar wind, atmosphere, vacuum and similar phenomena that are commonly mentioned in the physics handbooks or popular books about cosmos and are a staple elements in the science-fiction genre. Most of the the concepts I mention in this paragraph were completely unknown (not to mention that Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were discovered only in 18th, 19th and 20th centuries respectively).

So, to sum it up, with the possible exception of languages, modern people studying in York possess tremendous amount of scientific knowledge they tend to take for granted, but for the Europeans in early 9th century large part of this knowledge would have been completely groundbreaking and in many cases even incomprehensible.
This seems to be one of those statements which is technically almost true, but requires some slightly specious reasoning. Frankly, it seems like a dig at modern students more than anything, which seems unwarranted.

Information from the [2011 Census](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/language) suggested that 92% of people in the UK had English as a first language, while 7.7% spoke English "well" as a second language. [This 2017 survey](https://www.indy100.com/article/languages-eurobarometer-survey-eu-eurostat-uk-average-number-european-union-7791931), admittedly  based on now-unsourced data from /r/dataisbeautiful, suggests that the average Briton speaks '1.6' languages; to whit, a lot of people have only half-remembered GCSE French. Your average student from 800 would, in this case, most likely have an edge: students would, of course, have spoken (Old) English, but would have been trained in Latin from an early age, and some may even have had the opportunity to study a third language, perhaps even Greek. By the 1170s, clergy such as Jordan de Fantosme even start writing in vernacular French. This wasn't always the case, however: prior to the "Carolingian Renaissance" of the late 8th Century, Alcuin of York (one of its main proponents) expressed a concern that many parish priests lacked the necessary training in Latin to even carry out their masses properly, let alone to study the Classics.

Modern schools and universities are a far more diverse yet specialised mode of education: a modern student might only learn maths to a GCSE level, specialise in geography from then on, and never have any educational interaction with Logic and Philosophy, astronomy or music, for example. The [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/departments/), to use an example, currently offers degrees in Economics, Finance and Accounting, Business Management, Computer Science, Engineering, Drama, Geography, Bioscience and Neuroscience, among others, alongside subjects expected of a ninth-century student such as Classics, Theology and Religion, Natural Sciences or Philosophy. 

Astronomy, optics, and the associated mathematics were considered important subjects by the Church for their use in calculating important dates such as Easter, and for a philosophical desire to better understand man's place in God's creation, so our Ninth Century Student may well have had a much better understanding of that maths compared to a modern student who only studies to GCSE or A-Level, but then that knowledge would pale in comparison to that of a modern astrophysicist. Our NCS almost certainly wouldn't have had any mathematical knowledge of engineering, for example. Practical skills such as architecture were typically taught via physical training and apprenticeship, rather than in a classroom setting.

Philosophy is not currently a part of that National Curriculum in the UK, so outside of a Philosophy or PPE degree, the 'average' modern student is indeed unlikely to be familiar with classical Logic as a field of study, so that one is technically true, but does seem like a somewhat unnecessary dig at the modern student.
/u/Stormtemplar gave a good answer to OP's direct question about a fictitious student at York, but let me answer about a kind of student I know more about, and that might help get to what OP's tweet is driving at. Skip to the last paragraph if you want the tl;dr. (Anything below that's uncited comes from Adam H. Becker's *Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom*, on the school of Nisibis in the context of Late Antique education. I can go back and give better citations if necessary.)

In the 9th century, during the so-called "Dark Ages" in Europe, there were schools (of a kind) that flourished in the Near and Middle East. The most famous one, which reached its zenith in the 6th century, is the school of Nisibis, on the border of modern-day Turkey and Syria, and its students and faculty were (predominantly) Christians who spoke a dialect of Aramaic (Jesus' language) called Syriac. Now, I say this is a *kind of* school because it is something in between a school and a monastery. That is, it was a religious community, and the education included a ton of theological and liturgical training (including singing in a choir), but it did fulfill the role of a school: young people (children and young adults) left their homes to study there, there were stages or levels of training, there were teachers and administrators, and people received an education. The first stage at the school was learning to pronounce words (Syriac, being a Semitic language, uses an abjad rather than an alphabet, which means it forms words without writing in the vowels, so learning to read was a bit more challenging); the next was learning grammar; then finally was rhetoric and theology.

But what was rhetoric and what was theology? Plato and Socrates were famously hostile toward rhetoric or some uses of rhetoric, but the Classical world at large didn't share this hostility. Rhetoric was important for daily life, and despite being cast as the enemy of philosophy, the two, in truth, often intersected.^1 This is particularly true in that both rhetoric and philosophy depended on logic, specifically a Neoplatonized form of Aristotle's Organon. (Note that, while Plato didn't like rhetoric, Aristotle wrote an entire treatise on it.) For students at Nisibis, the goal of learning rhetoric was to aid in religious disputes against Neoplatonists, Zoroastrians, and Jews (and, after the Islamic conquests, Muslims), disputes which were often conducted on the common ground of Aristotelian logic. Hence, it was imperative that they learn logic well, lest they give a fallacious argument against a religious opponent. 

What did one do with this training? Aside from disputing with heretics in the street, you could continue this pseudo-monastic life and engage in what other members of the school were engaged in. One of the most fascinating aspects of Nisibis is that it played a big role in the translation of texts from Greek into Syriac, the first part of a chain of transmission that also produced Arabic and Latin translations (kickstarting the Islamic Golden Age and the Renaissance, respectively).^2 The school culture that developed among Syriac Christians is hugely important for the preservation of works like Aristotle, which went on to form the foundation of modern science when the *Posterior Analytics* resurfaced in the High Middle Ages.^3 So, to return to the fictional student, you would have learned Greek at some point in addition to Syriac, and pretty damn well at that.

Mathematics and astronomy, I'm not sure if those were studied in any serious way at Nisibis. However, mathematics was reasonably well developed and studied in a "theological" form at the Neoplatonic academy in Athens, among other places. A good example of this is the *Theology of Arithmetic*, ascribed to the Neoplatonist Iamblichus. If you read it, good luck trying to figure out what it's talking about! But more to the point, the "study" of math at this time would have involved learning Euclid and geometric proofs (the Neoplatonist Proclus wrote an enormous commentary on the Elements). 

**TL;DR:** So to return to the question. Would the average 18 year old then have known all of those things better than the average university student today? I concur that the answer is definitely, No. But I would argue against the way /u/Stormtemplar answered the question by invoking modern scientific knowledge. By that standard, Plato knew less than the modern university student, which is obviously not what OP is asking. The average student at Nisibis, probably by the time he was "university level," knew Aristotelian logic pretty deeply, which is more than the average modern student (not engaged in math or science, and even many who are) would know; they were formally trained in singing publicly, something that many university students have no background in; they knew at least two languages well enough to read and translate--moreover, two languages from different language families: imagine the revolt if every university student had to learn Chinese or Arabic; and, depending on where they were, they would have learned mathematical proofs, which, again, university students couldn't do. As for astronomy, I would find it hard to believe that people who could see the Milky Way every night of their lives would know less about astronomy than your average university student from a city or suburb. 

So, do they know those subjects *better* (to the extent they could) rather than knowing *more* (facts) than the average modern student? In my view, without a doubt.

Hey, folks. I'm the author of the offending tweet. If I'd known it would get such interest, I would have given it more than 2 minutes thought! 😊 Let me concede various critiques and see if I can't strengthen the basic point I was hoping to make.   
**1.** First, I teach in a leading university in my little part of the world, so I am not entirely ignorant of the standards of language, grammar, rhetoric, logic, etc. I must say, my tweet emerges, in part, from being depressed about the decline in the liberal arts.   
**2.** Secondly, I am really only speaking about English-speaking universities today (US, UK, Australia, NZ), not Asian, European, or elsewhere.   
**3.** Thirdly, speaking of "York in 800", is really just (poor) code for the Carolingian schools of the 800s.   
**4.** My core point, fourthly, is really that a student who had completed studies in one of the better schools - let's go with Fulda, Tours, Rheims, or Reichenau - will have had competencies that exceed the "average" student in an English-speaking university today. They would have strong competency in at least two languages (the home language and formal Latin, at least), and this is NOT the norm in English-speaking universities today. Their grammatical knowledge would be vastly superior. They would have a knowledge of formal logic and rhetorical forms which students today typically do not have.   
**5.** Fifthly, what about the mathematical subjects? This is where my thesis is weakest, but I have a small defence for your consideration. I accept that their arithmetic and geometry would be (beyond) basic for a high school student today (as difficult as it must have been in Roman numerals!). I will retract that.   
**6.** However, I think I want to retain a claim about the other two mathematical subjects, music and astronomy. Classical musical notation was not invented for centuries. However, the Carolingians (a) did have basic neumic notation to pictorialise melody, (b) invented mnemonics to recall long melodies, and, most importantly, (c) analysed music at a theoretical level to discern its harmonic proportions and measures (on the ancient classical model). They did a kind of philosophy of music. Given that the typical student today does not have any musical knowledge, I think our 18 year old Carolingian might win here.   
**7.** And astronomy? I understand, of course, that their entire model was incorrect. However, I would maintain that their computational and observational astronomy was quite rigorous, and at least left our Carolingian kid better aware of the seasonal movements of large bodies and constellations than our typical student today. They would appear like one of those nerdy children who can point out many things in the night sky. For this, they studied Bede and even Pliny's Natural History, complete with diagrams.   
**8.** There was a huge appreciation of poetry that is no longer present in our students. And for this they not only studied Ambrose and other Christian poets but also Ovid, Virgil, and others. And they routinely composed their own Latin poems for assessment.   
**Conclusion.** So, while I think my hasty tweet deserves some of the criticism it received. I think I will hold firm in suggesting that a typical 18-year-old Carolingian "graduate" had knowledge and a breadth of learning that, in many respects, was superior to the (English-speaking) university student today.   
**Recommendation.** For those who are interested, I recommend Rosamond McKitterick, “The Carolingian Renaissance of Culture and Learning” (151-66), in *Charlemagne: Empire and Society*. Manchester University Press, 2005. Also John J. Contreni, “The Carolingian Renaissance: Education and Literary Culture” (709-757) in *The New Cambridge Medieval History. Vol.2. c.700-900*. Cambridge University Press, 2008. And, of course, read as many of the primary sources referenced in these essays as you can access.  
Many thanks.

The first week wasn't especially important but it was part of a very short arc that saw Hitler go from opposition political leader to absolute dictator in a series of steps. 

The Depression in Germany splintered public opinion. This led to a very unstable legislature in where no one party could govern effectively. As a result, there was an increasing reliance on government by emergency decree by otherwise mainstream parties. This established norms for authoritarianism and anti-democratic behaviour but had little to do with the Nazis. They were just a growing opposition party at this point, seen as outside realistic voting options for most. 

Hitler announced he would only seek power through elections in 1931, which helped solidify him as a viable political choice for the middle class, capitalists, military officers and other conservatives. Before that, Hitler and the Nazis were seen as ruffians outside the pale of good taste that appealed to angry violent yahoos. 

Hitler came a strong second in the January 1932 Presidential election to Hindenburg, and remained leader of a large but not in any way dominant political party. The Nazis were one of numerous parties in a highly fractured legislature. More parliamentary elections were held in July and November of 1932 but there was no ability to form a majority government that was stable, and the minority administrations were rudderless. 

After the November elections, a number of leading politicians and wealthy men appealed to President Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor in order to get stability. In January 1933, he came to power in a coalition with just three positions for the Nazis but critically, control of the police. 

That first week wasn't especially profound. But Hitler quickly dissolved the legislature and called for new elections to be held in early March. I'm not sure if that was in the first week or not, but the calling of the elections wasn't especially crucial. 

Feburary 27, 1933 was crucial: The Reichstag building was set on fire. A Communist was found inside in incriminating circumstances, accused of the crime by the Nazi policing minister and the resulting political crisis gave Hitler the excuse to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. He suspended basic rights and allowed arrest without trial. Mass arrests of communists and political opponents were combined with political violence and intense anti-communist propaganda. 

There is a near consensus that the fire was the work of that communist. There is a minority view that the Nazis had a role in setting the fire and framed the communists to give them the excuse to issue the decree and polarize the election against the communists. Either way, the fire gave Hitler the excuse to issue the decree and that was act that got him a dictatorship. 

The Nazis came short of a majority in the election. To remedy this, they proposed legislation giving Hitler a 4 year temporary dictatorship. This required a super majority in the House, and they didn't have the votes. So the Nazis used the Reichstag Fire Decree powers and their control of the police to arrest the communist members of the legislature. They also detained some of the Social Democrats and physically intimidated others. They created so much chaos and intimidation, and took away so many opposition votes, that they made their bill viable. 

On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag voted to grant Hitler those "temporary" powers to enact laws without the consent of the legislature. From here they expanded their campaign to outlawing the Social Democrats as well as the Communists, then dissolved all trade unions. Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps. By June, all other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. 

The first week in power wasn't that important. But democracy was completely dissolved within five months of Hitler assuming office and Germany turned into a one-party state that jailed and murdered opponents.

Edit2: Hindenberg to Hindenburg
Eddie, I'd contend that what you should be paying attention to is an event that happened less than one month after Hitler was appointed chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. I'm referring, of course, to [the Reichstag fire](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657).

On Feb. 27, 1933, the German parliament building, the Reichstag, burned down. 

This is a key moment in the rise of Nazi Germany and one of the points at which Germany shifts from the Weimar Republic to a totalitarian state.

The Reichstag had been the heart of democratic Germany, a representative body that ─ even in 1933 ─ still held the belief that it answered to the people, not the state. The Nazi party held a minority of seats in that body. It had even lost 34 seats in the November 1932 election while the Communist Party gained 11 (for a total of 100). 

The Reichstag was by no means perfect. The Weimar government had shown its flaws, and the rise of Nazism had shown the Reichstag's conservative members to be willing to go along with the radical Nazis. The conservatives in the Reichstag believed Hitler was a buffoon, someone controllable even if he got into power as chancellor. They were not captivated by his speeches (in general) and believed he was less extreme than he actually was. With Hindenburg as president, the conservatives believed that Hitler would be checked, and the Nazis could be brought into the fold safely. Things worked out differently, of course.

When the fire took place, Hitler and his closest advisers saw that it was a golden opportunity. A young Dutch Communist had been arrested at the scene, and so they were quick to declare the fire an arson, a communist plot designed, as Goebbels wrote in his diary, "to sow confusion in order, in the general panic, to grasp power for themselves."

Many people have claimed in the years since the fire that it was entirely orchestrated by the Nazis as a pretext to seize power. Many others have claimed that there's little evidence of a conspiracy, and that the Nazi leadership was simply opportunistic. [Richard Evans' 2014 review of *Burning the Reichstag* is a wonderfully detailed breakdown of the arguments](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n09/richard-j-evans/the-conspiracists). 

In the end, I'm not sure whether it matters all that much. In either case, the Nazis called the fire an act of terrorism, and in order to fight terrorism, they needed to improve security. In order to improve security, they needed new powers for the state, and they needed to make arrests. Nazi party members were enrolled as auxiliary policemen, and overnight they arrested hundreds ─ if not thousands ─ of communists and left-wing politicians and political organizers. Disregarding parliamentary immunity, the Nazis seized the leaders of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.

The morning after the fire, the German cabinet ─ which, like the Reichstag, had a non-Nazi majority ─ drew up an emergency decree designed to ensure security. It abolished freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, legalized phone-tapping, suspended the freedom of some of the German states, and in general meant the end of free government in Germany.

Using the terrorist attack at the Reichstag as a pretext, the Nazis pushed through the emergency decree, which was signed by a wavering Hindenburg. 

Now, with unprecedented power as Chancellor, Hitler was able to brow-beat his opponents. Less than a week after the emergency decree passed and the Nazis had been able to unleash a firestorm of violence against their opponents, a new federal election was held. The Nazis still tallied only 44 percent of the vote, despite their actions, but it was enough.

Two weeks after the election, the Nazis were able to gain enough votes from non-socialists to pass the Enabling Acts. These acts gave Hitler and his ministers exclusive legislative power. The president and the Reichstag were sidelined.

By the summer of 1933, all opposition was crushed. More than 100,000 people had been sent to concentration camps. Thousands more were murdered. All independent political parties were dissolved. Only the Nazis remained.

It happened that quickly. There were less than four months between Germany's last free elections, in November 1932, and the passage of the Enabling Acts in March 1933. If you want to learn more about this, read Richard Evans' *The Coming of the Third Reich.* It's widely published and easy to understand.

Now that I've told you what I think, let me actually answer your question.

On the night that Hitler became Reich Chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlight parade in Berlin with some 60,000 participants. Some observers noted in their journals that Goebbels had the marchers go in a circle, so as to pass the reviewing stand at least twice in order to create the impression of greater numbers. There were still plenty of cheers regardless.

Though the Nazis put on a show of force with the parade and other events, they were careful to stage the production as a show of support for Hindenburg, to say that the parades were a "tribute to Hindenburg" and that they were not truly disrupting the traditional order. There were marches in other cities as well, and occasional violent clashes with Communists. There was a shootout in Spandau, shots fired from a house in Charlottenburg at a march. Copies of the communist party newspaper were seized and burned.

Generally, however, the leftist parties and left-center parties tried to keep a low profile, fearing a government crackdown on their operations. There was local opposition, but nothing organized at a national level.

Four days after taking the Chancellorship, Hitler made moves to keep the leadership of the German Army neutral. He feared a coup, and to reduce the chance of that, he spoke to Army leaders and pledged to do many of the things they favored ─ fight the Treaty of Versailles, restore conscription, and destroy Marxism.

On Feb. 4, the cabinet issued a decree allowing the government to detain for up to three months (without trial) people who used weapons to breach the peace. It was targeted at people resisting Nazi stormtroopers. 

Before Hitler became Chancellor, the Prussian police had been keeping an eye on Nazis and other paramilitaries who caused trouble. The police might not have been able to act against these armed groups because of political considerations, but they still investigated them. Hitler ordered those investigations to stop.

In the middle of February, Hitler also created an auxiliary police force made up of Nazi paramilitaries, in effect putting Nazi violence under the protection of the police.

In the beginning of February, the Nazi minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, and Hermann Goring (the minister of the Interior for Prussia) began banning Social Democratic newspapers. The Social Democrats responded by suing, which had some success.

As the month went on, the Social Democrats began to join the Communists as targets of violence from Nazi paramilitaries. In response, the Social Democrats tried to stick to a legalistic defense. They did not want to respond to Nazi violence with violence of their own, an act that would encourage a heavy-handed response from the federal government.

In Wurttemberg State, the president, Eugen Bolz, declared the new government to be an enemy of freedom. Hitler responded that Bolz had no room to talk, since he hadn't protected the Nazi Party when it was persecuted in the 1920s.

"Those who made no mention of our freedom for 14 years have no right to talk about it today. As Chancellor I need only use one law for the protection of the national state, just as they made a law for the protection of the Republic back then, and then they would realize that not everything they called freedom was worthy of the name," Hitler said in a speech.

While the Nazi paramilitaries were making enemies of the Social Democrats and the Communists (and to a lesser extent, the Centre Party), there were plenty of people in Germany who delighted in what he was doing. Remember, this was the Great Depression, and there were many in Germany who enjoyed his actions.

Evans quotes the diary of a woman named Louise Solmitz:

"I’m delighted at Hitler’s lack of a programme, for a programme is either lies, weakness, or designed to catch silly birds. ─ The strongman acts from the necessity of a serious situation and can’t allow himself to be bound."

PART I

To start, unless they were prosecuted after 1929 they probably wouldn't have been there in the first place.

Let's go back a decade to explain why this was the case.  The Volstead Act - the legislation providing the nominal teeth to provide a method to enforce Prohibition on the federal level - had a structural weakness that essentially doomed it from the start even if everything else surrounding Prohibition had worked: it required jury trials.

To say this overwhelmed the Federal Court system and made punishment under Volstead laughable doesn't even come close.  From Daniel Okrent:

>"One of the nobler aspects of the Volstead Act was its guarantee of the right to a jury trial for anyone charged with a violation. It was a requirement, it soon turned out, that the legal system was incapable of handling...Mabel Willebrandt [one of the most aggressive prosecutors of Prohibition] acknowledged that “juries will not convict if the punishment does not fit the crime,” and she was proven right in city after city, as juries effectively nullified the law because they didn’t think any punishment at all was appropriate for breaking the liquor laws. After Smedley Butler was fired as director of public safety in Philadelphia, he offered a statistic that was simultaneously a boast and an admission of defeat: in two years, his police force had made 227,000 liquor violation arrests. To Old Gimlet Eye, this indicated that his men had nabbed 15 percent of the city’s population; to anyone else, it indicated that they had arrested the same people over and over and over again.

Or as one district judge in New York put it to a Prohibition violator in the mid 1920s, "You have been brought before me twelve times in twelve months for violations of the Volstead Act. What do you have to say?" His reply: "Your Honor, I can't help it if you're not promoted."

This led to what was essentially chaos in the court system for a decade, especially since Dry advocates used conviction numbers as a brute force yardstick to measure prosecutorial effectiveness; the Southern District US attorney in New York was expected to clear 10,000 cases annually.

>"Proceedings were conducted without court stenographers or clerks. Six judges and one magistrate were expected to dispose of fifty thousand cases annually. Even if each had worked full time on nothing but Volstead cases, together they would have been able to handle fewer than four thousand a year—and had they done that, no other federal matter would have been adjudicated anywhere in the district, which stretched all the way to Albany...by one accounting, U.S. attorneys across the country spent, at minimum, 44 percent of their time and resources on Prohibition prosecutions—if that was the word for the pallid efforts they were able to sustain on such limited resources. In North Carolina and West Virginia, the federal prosecutors devoted 70 percent of their time to Prohibition violations; in Minnesota, 60 percent; in southern Alabama—where Mabel Willebrandt would directly supervise one of the most aggressive enforcement efforts in the nation—Volstead prosecutions consumed a staggering 90 percent of the federal docket."

What this led to in turn was a shortcut: the vast majority of cases - which were misdemeanors anyway - were plea bargained out for a guilty verdict and a nominal fine, and if you were crazy enough to actually bring something to a jury trial, then as one prosecutor put it, "The fixers, he said, were found even in the men’s rooms, attempting to bribe jurors hearing those few cases that made it to trial. In the courtrooms crooked lawyers encouraged perjury."  In addition given the terrible training and miniscule expenditure on Prohibition Agents - presuming they weren't already felons when they signed up, where by 1930 almost 10% had been fired for lying on their applications for previous convictions, which doesn't even begin to cover those taking bribes - the police work was generally terrible and the courts often had field days with fourth amendment violations, and had legal implications that still exist today.  Last but not least, at the beginning of the 1920s there were a grand total of three federal prisons throughout the country - so where exactly were you going to put all the miscreants?

So this led to such scenes as "thousands of Volstead violators were...(delivered) by the wagonful to the badly degraded Federal Court in downtown Manhattan. This led the (US attorney for the region) to concoct an opportunity that quickly became known as “Bargain Day.” Publicly promising to request light fines in exchange for guilty pleas, he invited defendants to the Old Post Office Building south of City Hall, where his staff, working with two cooperative federal judges, could process five hundred cases at a time and clear up the backlog."  While the fines were often small, usually ranging between $5-$250 (the former for consumers, the latter viewed as a cost of doing business by the providers), the numbers added up: in the Northern District of New York, in 1925 and 1926 a single judge assessed $2.5 million in fines for Volstead violations, or the better part of $40 million today.  Incidentally, this is one reason my second favorite scene of *Boardwalk Empire* (the first being Nucky Thompson declaring 'that imbicile is going to be the next President of the United States!' when he hears Harding has received the nomination) is the one in which the Mabel Willebrand-inspired prosecutor is shocked to discover she finally has a shot at Nucky in court and attempts to throw the book at him - and the exhausted judge working at 2 am looks for 10 seconds at the evidence he's actually arrested for and fines him something like $5.  While the scene is of course entirely fictional, it's also a decently accurate representation of the general futility of Volstead era prosecutions; in fact, one of the few judges who decided to actually try to enforce the law as intended and who had used sightseeing buses to round up prisoners actually went insane after two years of doing so and ended up killing himself.

But that was just in Federal Court.

One of the nuttier aspects of the Eighteenth Amendment was that it allowed concurrent jurisdiction between the Feds and the States with the expectation by the Drys that State governments would step up.  As you'd expect, this didn't quite work out uniformly.  From Okrent again:

>The peculiar second clause of the Eighteenth Amendment, assigning “concurrent” enforcement power to the federal government and to the states, mandated (or at least encouraged) armies of cops across the nation to stand shoulder to shoulder in the booze wars. The relative strength of the Anti-Saloon League in various parts of the country could be measured by the proliferation of state laws designed to be “concurrent” with the federal strictures. Anyone arrested for insobriety in Vermont was subject to a mandatory jail sentence if he failed to name the person from whom he acquired his liquor. At one point Indiana vested train conductors and bus drivers with the authority to arrest passengers carrying alcohol and made it illegal for retailers to put flasks or cocktail shakers in their shop windows. Mississippi decreed debts related to the acquisition of intoxicating beverages uncollectible. Iowa banned the sale of Sterno, from which alcohol could be extracted by filtering it through a rag or, among drunks with better table manners, through a loaf of bread...only eighteen states bothered to appropriate as much as a dollar for enforcement. In some jurisdictions this reflected a distaste for the whole business; New York repealed its state enforcement code in 1923, and Maryland never even bothered to enact one.

One great example of just how even true believers were restricted comes from Pennsylvania, where Gifford Pinchot - the legendary founder of the Park Service - got himself elected Governor on a Dry Platform.

>In his first month in office he turned the state police into a commando army. A single week saw raids on illegal liquor operations in eighteen counties. Reminding Republican legislators that he was now head of the party, that he had led them to victory at the top of the ticket in November, and that they had pledged their support to his legislative program, Pinchot got all the laws he wanted. Swollen with the pride of a triumphalist, gleaming with the righteousness of a reformer, Pinchot announced that he had achieved his legislative success without making a single promise in exchange for a vote. “This is an unbought victory,” he proclaimed, “and ten times as valuable on that account.”  Unbought, perhaps, but unfunded as well. After Pinchot’s glorious moment had passed, the legislators who had gone along with his program stiffened. It was one thing for the Pennsylvania legislature—any legislature, really—to give militant drys the laws they wanted, but quite another to provide the funds necessary for their enforcement. As a result, the legislators decided that the total appropriation for Pinchot’s ambitious program should amount to precisely...zero.
Ok, trying this again with a little more detail because I think my first answer was removed. 

The 21st Amendment, passed in December 1933, repealed the 18th Amendment, which mandated nationwide prohibition. By February 1934, all pending cases dealing with prohibition violations were ordered to be wiped from Federal Court dockets. There were roughly 9000 such cases at the time. The Supreme Court ruled that the repeal of the 18th Amendment meant courts could not sentence or inflict penalties based on that amendment in pending cases (*U.S. v. Chambers,* 1934). 

No general rule was established regarding pardons or commutations of sentences for those who broke dry laws before the repeal of Prohibition, however. U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings recommended leniency for casual offenders, but not those who made careers out of illegal liquor practices. 

Part of this lack of forgiveness for larger-scale liquor violations (involving bootleggers, rum runners and the like) stems from *revenue* violations. The 21st amendment repealed the 18th, but it did not override specific tax and permit violations incurred in the process of illegally distributing liquor. In 1934, for example, the Justice and Treasury departments expressed a desire to "vigorously to prosecute all forms of liquor-tax evasion and other frauds upon the revenue which have resulted in a tremendous loss to the Government."

At a state level, there are examples of larger-scale pardons granted for dry law violators. A New York Times article from Feb. 26, 1933 describes Indiana Governor Paul V. McNutt's decision to repeal the state-level prohibition enforcement law before Prohibition was ended at a federal level. McNutt announced that he planned to pardon or parole roughly 400 people who were serving sentences for liquor charges at the time. "If these men were kept in prison after the liquor law is repealed, they would be political prisoners," McNutt said. He only granted amnesty to people charged with transporting, possessing, or selling liquor. He did not include people who were incarcerated for public intoxication or driving under the influence -- these charges would remain illegal even after prohibition ended.

Similarly, in 1932 California Governor James Rolph announced plans to pardon the roughly 1000 liquor law offenders held in California prisons following the state's decision to repeal the California liquor prohibition law. 

In summary, pardons depended on the specific nature of the crime, especially when it came to prosecution at a Federal level. There are certainly instances of retroactive pardons, some on a large scale.

Well, at that point there probably weren't many of them locked up for very long, honestly! One of the major problems with prohibition was the lack of funding for enforcement of prohibition under the Volstead Act, and the level of enforcement varied greatly from region to region. In general, small towns were more likely to be strict on their enforcement of prohibition, and many counties chose to remain dry (some even to this day), so even though it was no longer a federal crime to make, drink, or sell alcohol, that doesn't mean it was necessarily decriminalized in certain areas in 1933. This means there wasn't like a floodgate of people suddenly locked up for things that weren't crimes anymore.  
For some context, the federal Prohibition Bureau was formed in 1927 and was headed up by a prohibitionist lawyer from Ohio named John Kramer, but 6 months later he quit when he realized that the law would not, in fact, basically enforce itself as he had claimed it would, and his department was dramatically under-funded for the amount of work that his employees were expected to do. Prohibitionists essentially expected everyone to just obey and not drink at all, so when people continued to produce and consume booze they were like \*surprised Pikachu face\*.  This meant that the measly $10 million budget for the Prohibition Bureau in 1926 (out of the estimated $300 million actually required) left agents very underpaid - especially in more expensive cities- so agents were often very susceptible to taking bribes/payoffs just to make ends meet. This meant that those who could afford to slip an officer some funds were not often arrested, so the "big fish" who made and distributed bootleg liquor weren't often nabbed and charged.  When FDR took office in 1932, he slashed the department's budget down to barely $2 million, so the funding was drying up even further before prohibition was finally repealed.  According to Richard Hanes in the early 1930s, "Raids on speakeasies were rarely more than an annoyance, and even padlocking doors rarely kept speaks closed more than a day. Courts were overwhelmed with Prohibition cases, and the juries generally sided with the accused. As a result courts began to set aside certain days for bootleggers, moonshiners, smugglers, and speakeasy managers to come, plead guilty, pay a five or ten dollar fine, and go back to what they had been doing." So, essentially, by the end, the budget for finding and prosecuting folks was dried up, and people could get sprung from jail easily as long as they could pay their fairly small fines.  
After prohibition was repealed there was a mad rush for liquor licenses, so those in the previously-illegal booze business were generally able to stay in their same field if they wanted to do so above board.

This is a boring answer, unfortunately. Prohibition's enforcement was relatively unlikely to incarcerate people. America was not yet used to arresting large groups of people or detaining them for long periods of time. This meant the number of people in jail for violating prohibition in 1933 was tiny. (So was the general incarcerated population, really.) The most generous count of people serving long term sentences for violating prohibition in 1933 is a few hundred people. And almost all of those people were serving time for what we'd call aggravated crimes. They'd been smuggling rum and opened fire on the police and killed an officer, for example. Their clemency was not a major goal of the legalization movement.

Prohibition enforcement, paradoxically, was lethargic in the courts even where it was vigorous on the street. And it wasn't always vigorous on the street. Even where it was, the norm was that large amounts of alcohol was seized and destroyed. Only a percentage of those led to arrests and a small percentage of those led to convictions. Most of the criminals were simply released or plead out. New York is fairly typical: of something like thirty thousand raids, about seven thousand led to arrests. Of those seven thousand raids leading to arrests, only seventeen led to convictions. This amounted to less than ten convictions per year and not all those convicted actually went to jail. The proportion was similar in most other major cities. And enforcement outside of the major cities was weak to non-existent with a few exceptions.

And it's not as if people weren't imbibing. To return to New York, there were at least twenty five thousand speakeasies and maybe as many as a hundred thousand. There were as many as hundred thousand permanent establishments engaged in lawbreaking. That doesn't include people imbibing at home, just professional establishments. And yet you had less than ten people a year being convicted and less than that being incarcerated. Even multiplied across the whole United States this was a small phenomenon.

The main mechanism of enforcement was the seizure and destruction of *property* by the police. They would bust up a speakeasy or dump the barrels of alcohol into the river. They'd also sometimes beat the people involved. But even when the club was full of German or Catholic immigrants or Jews or African Americans (all disproportionately targeted groups) it rarely led to long term incarceration. In a minority of raids they actually let the criminals simply walk away, often after some form of intimidation. Even when arrested they were usually not charged, or plead out, and released.

And these were the *most* fervent police enforcers. In New York, the police force had a large Irish Catholic contingent whose sympathies were wet. They often studiously ignored alcohol use. In fact, this appears to be the majority of police everywhere, such that the Federal government increasingly sought to coerce local cooperation from unsympathetic local policemen. (This attempt at coercion never quite seemed to reach Washington or investigating their wealthy friends, naturally. It mostly focused on groups like Germans, Catholics, Jews, and African Americans. Jews, Catholics, and Germans were particularly associated with drunkenness. And African Americans were just generally stereotyped as lazy and given to vice.)

More broadly, this question is projecting a modern situation into the past. Mass incarceration and its attendant social ills simply didn't exist for most of the 20th century, let alone the 19th century.

The US prison population has been slightly rising over time (roughly growing with population). But it roughly quintupled between 1980 and 2005, with most of that growth happening in the 1990s. Not only has the number of Americans incarcerated increased but their terms have gotten longer, leading to a greater proportion in long term vs short term detention. The current debate is only possible in a relatively modern world where a common tool of crime enforcement is long term incarceration. But that simply was in the future in the 1920s.

Large scale imprisonment is a modern and new phenomenon, not something with a long history. For example, in 1932 about 200,000 Americans were incarcerated. About half of those in short term detention of some kind or another. That was less than .2% of the population. Today we have about .8% of the population incarcerated and only about a third of them are in short term detention. Incarceration began to grow in the 1930s, began to shrink in the 1950s, then began to grow again in the 1960s to 1970s. Then it doubled between 1980 and 1990 and then doubled again between 1990 and 2000, representing the vast majority of growth. Its growth then slowed before it started to shrink in the mid 2000s. It's since continued to shrink. So we have a pretty secure time period for the explosive growth of mass incarceration: 1980 to 2000. You'll note that starts fifty years after Prohibition ended.

Mass arrests and large scale detention were an option in the late 20th century due to the growth of government power and a new political view of government that saw it as a provider of solutions to social problems. This was especially the case after the New Deal and Great Society. But those were in the future during Prohibition. The government of the 1920s lacked the judicial forces and police powers to do anything like the drug prohibition we have today. They lacked the courts, the judges, and the prosecutors. And they lacked the actual prisons and facilities. They also didn't have a view of themselves that implied such broad mandates.

These things would be built up in the 1930s through to modern day as government powers and state capacity grew. And the growth of crime in the 1960s along with the Great Society's promise to solve social ills led to the ideas that the government was supposed to prevent even low level crime. But again, this is all very much after Prohibition.

There was a prominent 'yes' campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio ([there are some examples of editorials and ads here](http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote)). In contrast, there was *no* significant 'no' campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda. 

In parliament, all of the major parties supported a 'yes' vote, and so there was no published 'case' for a 'no' vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one. 

It should be said that there's some controversy over the meaning of the constitutional amendment to omit the mentions of indigenous peoples in the constitutions; it's more complicated than 'recognising Aboriginals as Australian citizens'. Attwood and Markus in 1998 argued that its implications for the legal rights and status of indigenous peoples in Australia were slight, as in most states Aborigines had already had the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote (apart from, sort of, in Western Australia and Queensland). Attwood and Markus argue that the change was largely symbolic for this reason. Elsewhere, Taffe in 2007 argued that the real change that resulted from the constitutional amendment was that Aboriginal affairs was no longer a state but rather a Federal responsibility. Where, previously, Federal governments had argued that indigenous people were the responsibility of the states, they no longer had this particular excuse; as a result, for example, the Whitlam government set up a department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1972. 

There are a few reasons why the 'yes' vote was popular, especially amongst the majority of the Australian population that lived in cities. By 1967, the advent of television in the 1950s had opened many eyes to how difficult conditions were for indigenous peoples. Additionally, the Australian public was aware of international opprobrium about the Apartheid of South Africa, and did not want to become an international pariah, and the referendum seemed a clear way to demonstrate that. And in the 1960s there was a new-found prominence for indigenous rights activists, such as organisations like FCAATSI. And as the change was in many ways symbolic, there were few real grounds for opposition to it, as nobody particularly felt they would lose out (which perhaps might have been different if the consitutional amendments clearly implied the land rights which came about after the Mabo decision in the 1990s, for example).

In general, advocacy for the 'no' vote was largely seen in public in letters to the editor, and was often quite racist; one letter to the editor of the *Adelaide Advertiser* claimed the vote would propel indigenous people "into the turmoil of a civilization they probably do not understand and do not want". More genteel arguments against the amendment revolved around arguments for states' rights, which would be undermined by the change to the constitution. However, even this was quite muted; the Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin, appears to have had assurances by Harold Holt that they would continue working with the states on Aboriginal Affairs. There's also some suggestion that state Premiers were happy to handball responsibility for a difficult portfolio - that they probably did not understand and did not want - to the Federal government.

The highest 'no' vote was in Western Australia, where there was a 20% no vote. Western Australia of course had a successful referendum to secede from Australia in 1933 (which was ignored by the Federal parliament), which is emblematic of Western Australians having less trust in the distant, Eastern-based Federal Government than the rest of Australia. There were also higher 'no' votes in country areas - the highest being in Kalgoorlie in country Western Australia, which almost hit 30% (and which still has some significant and highly publicised tensions between the indigenous and white parts of its community).

Thank you!
While i'm far from knowledgeable in that area, it seems that scholarship on the 1917-1919 Famine is sorely lacking. The main text appears to be *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd. However, Majd's thesis has taken some hits, according to reviewer Willem Floor, Majd makes three assertions:

* “the 1917-18 famine in Iran was caused by British intervention in Iran”

* “as a result 40 percent or 9 million of the population died”

* “the subject of the famine and the resulting genocide has been ignored by scholars so far”

To begin, Majd goes to great lengths to pick and choose his sources, ignoring sources within the British archives and over-relying on US sources, and those British sources he does use (the diaries of the British generals whom he blames the famine on) work against his theory that the British government acted to exacerbate the famine. It seems far more likely that the famine was caused by a combination of Russo-Turkish fighting and foraging in Iran, poor harvests, and bad weather conditions in the grain producing regions of Persia. Additionally, in rural areas, the famine was aggravated by the presence of those hoarding grain whose effect was minimized in places such as Tehran when local authorities took control of the food supply and dispersed it as necessary. 

On the second point, Majd’s choice of 9 million is likely inaccurate as he picks and chooses his census data, ignoring more accurate numbers taken from demographer Bharier:

> “The author rejects the population figures for 1914 as calculated by Bharier using the backward regressive analysis, which is a standard demographic tool. Majd does not explain why he faults the methodology and assumptions used by Bharier. He only states that Bharier failed to mention the occurrence of the famine and therefore his data are wrong. Moreover, the US consul stated that in 1914 the population of Iran was 20 million, a figure that is credible given that the number of votes in the Tehran elections also shows that the population of Tehran was in the order of 400,000. Majd does not cite or discuss any other estimates by contemporaries that offer much lower, and in my estimation, more realistic figures. In 1919, the population of Tehran was 200,000 and the population of Iran as a whole was 11 million, according to Bharier. Ergo, a genocide of 9 million people. Majd does not explain why he has confidence in Bharier's 1919 population figure (p. 52) but not in his 1914 figure”

The *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* agree with Bharier’s numbers and Dr. Mahmood Messkoub writes in *Social Policy in Iran in the Twentieth Century* "Majd claims that the famine of 1917-1919 killed half the population, an exaggeration surely that does not tally well with the evidence provided in his otherwise useful overview of famine in that period."

Floor tentatively agrees with Majd’s third point stating:  “It is true that so far few historians have dealt with the 1917-18 famine, and after having read this book I think there is a real need that somebody does. Majd's objective is not to understand why the famine happened and why its impact was so devastating... for he only wants to show Albion's perfidy and assign blame. “

So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search. I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. "Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic." Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)

So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.

As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.

While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the "South Persia Rifles", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.

F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).

>"The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence."

So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival.
It was a bit frustrating to see this on the front page without any answers, so I've decided to do a little research of my own ^with ^the ^help ^of ^Google. 

From what I gather, there has not been much scholarly work on the topic. The most-cited book I found was Mohammad Gholi Majd's *The Great Famine & Genocide in Iran* (available in [preview mode on Google Books](https://books.google.be/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)).

You can also have a look at [*Iran and Its Place Among Nations,*](https://books.google.be/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&pg=PA16&dq=iran+famine+1917&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUlrC_7oXOAhUGXRoKHVbqDXYQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=iran%20famine%201917&f=false) which provides a summary of Majd's argument.
>One of the little known calamities of World War I and its aftermath in Iran is the widespread famine that the war engendered across the country. The most significant treatment of this subject is the book by the agricultural economist Mohammed-Gholi Majd, *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919.* [...] Majid quotes the American charge d'affaires in Persia at the time, Wallace Smith Muray, as having claimed that in 1917-1918, up to one-third of Iran's population was wiped out by famine and disease. 

>To be sure, the exact causes of the devastating famine are difficult to grasp. Majd blames the British who, after the Russian revolution of 1917, had become the main foreign power in Iran. Having isolated farmers from their customers inside Iran the British, Majd claims, made it impossible for the country's fertile regions in its north and northwest to remain connected to the rest of the country. At the same time, according to Majd, a significant amount of the grains produced in Iran were forcibly acquired for British troops in the country and shipped abroad to other British troops in the region.

>Majd concludes that, unbeknownst to most, one of the main genocides of the twentieth century occured in Iran during and immediately after World War I.

However, the authors also point out:

>It is difficult for rigorous academic research to corroborate these figures. The word "genocide" implies the willful killing of large numbers of noncombatants. The historical record in this area is murky. A more extensive scholarly treatment of this subject would have to utilize "triangulation" and provide evidence from others, including British, Russian, and Ottoman sources, to show the extent of the famine and the ways in which it was affected by the war and its aftermath. 

And, if you have access to JSTOR, you can also find [another review of Majd's argument by Persia scholar Willem Floor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4311715?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). He is very critical of Majd - going as far as sarcasm:

>So good were the British in concealing that there even had been a famine that the document tabled by the official Persian delegation to the Versailles peace treaty trivialized the famine and obscured its causes [...] The scheme worked so well that scholars dealing with Iran, even if they did know about, did not write about it, until now. 

The thrust of Floor's argument is that Majd's estimate of the Iranian population is far too high and that he has it out against the British. He suggests reading James Barton's *Story of Near East Relief 1915-1930* for a overview of the difficulties of famine-relief in the broader region.

Barton points to light snowfall in the winter, spring drought and the breakdown of the irrigation system as partially responsible for famine in Iran's Kermanshah and Hamadan provinces. 

So, as you can see, there's some debate around this famine. I'm surprised there is no Wikipedia article about it.

I have taken several courses on the history of the ME, but this topic in particular is highly politicized; original documents are highly biased depending on whether they are written by those sympathetic to British or Iranian interests.  The most informative piece of work on this topic is probably [Mohammad Gholi Majd's 2013 book](https://books.google.com/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false).

Generally speaking, there was a famine in the area, exacerbated by British, Russian, and Ottoman forces fighting for control of the area.  

In more detail:

Some documents show that the population of Iran was 12 million in 1900, 15 million in 1910, and projections put it at 18-20 million in 1920.  But, census records in 1920 put the population at 10 million, suggesting that "8-10 million" people died, per [Mohammad Gholi Majd](https://books.google.com/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false).

Edit: Another user has commented on the veracity of these numbers and, while s/he notes that they are inaccurate, I believe his/her net assessment of the casualties results in a similar conclusion to the one I reach in the following paragraph.  

I have not verified whether the census methodologies were consistent, nor have I attempted to vet the records noted by Gholi Majd in his book for internal consistency.  The urban statistics suggest a somewhat more modest reduction in net population.  In wartime, and during famine, there is usually a disproportionate reduction in urban population density relative to rural areas [(Bradley Thayer, 2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781832/); [Alex de Sherbinin, 1995)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/report1a.pdf#page=24), and Tehran's population fell from 500,000 to 200,000 in this period (again, per Gholi Majd).  This isn't conclusive, but I would estimate gross casualties at ~5-7 million based on this figure.  Also important to note: the famine occurred some years prior to 1920, so using a 1920 population estimate to back-calculate a death toll from 1917-1918 or 1919 is going to give an inflated number.  In short, the author's "8-10 million" figure is almost certainly too high.  

Regardless, it looks as though we can be *certain* that somewhere between 3 and 10 million people died, and the figure is likely towards the middle to upper end of that spectrum.

As to why it happened: there would have been a famine in Iran due to poor harvests, without any wars.  But, fighting between the occupying British, Russian, and Ottoman forces significantly exacerbated the problem.  Per Gholi Majd, British military grain and rice purchases from within Iran for the period were in excess of 500,000 tons (Russian & Ottoman figures not noted). This was seen as a savvy move, as the grain would otherwise have required importation from ~India, and it saved British shipping capacity for the Atlantic theatre.  The British and Russian (and Ottoman?) armies destroyed grain reserves in towns that they thought might be occupied by the other side(s) in the future.  The author also notes that the acting Iranian government saw an extreme reduction in revenue as a result of the conflict, and was unable to alleviate the famine.  He blames this on Britain's manipulation of currency re. oil exports, but I can't comment on the accuracy of this claim without extensive additional research.  Gholi Majd goes into much greater detail re. a number of British military decisions and policies that exacerbated the famine locally.  

Contemporary documents say that the famine ended in 1918, but Gholi Majd suggests that it continued into 1919.  This is politically relevant, because fighting between Britain and Russia had ended by early 1918.  I don't want to get into the details, but, if the famine continued into 1919, post-war British policy may have been responsible for some of the casualties.  

Contemporary media commented on the fact that the Russian army looted and contributed to the shortage as well, but Gholi Majd downplays their influence by suggesting that "famine already stalked the land."  It's odd, because the exact same could be said for Britain's responsibility for the situation.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd has a particular bone to pick with Britain.  If you read between the lines, it sounds as though the author is angry that Britain *chose* to feed its armies with locally-sourced grain, as opposed to using additional resources to import it.  Russia (apparently?) lacked similar logistic capabilities, so he sees them as less culpable.  This gets kind of wishy-washy, because the author uses historical facts to try to explore how the situation *could have been avoided* and devotes an entire chapter to explicitly address who should be blamed.  He very clearly holds Britain accountable.  

There is also ~no mention of the Ottoman army/actions beyond some sparse notes regarding the timeline of their fighting with Britain well into 1918.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd ~ignores the actions of the Russians and Ottomans, in preference to those of the British.  But, again, I'm not sifting through other original sources.  

I also don't know what proportion of the grain consumed by Britain or Russian (or Ottoman) forces would have made its way to the Iranian people, so it's hard for me to blame either party for a set proportion of the final death toll.  They are responsible for some number of the dead.  Possibly millions.  Probably not as many as 8-10 million.

TL;DR There was a famine and a war being fought by outside parties.  3-10 million people died, mostly of starvation.  The fighting between Britain and Russia is to blame for at least some of the deaths.

I'm sure /u/qhapaqocha is going to come in and hit this out of the park, but I'll make a first pass at it, if that's alright. I can think of four ways women could attain positions of high rank within the Inca system of government.

The first and probably most obvious is to marry the Emperor, the Sapa Inca. His official wife —who was almost always one of his sisters or half-sisters (not step-sisters, thank you to u/MooseFlyer for catching my mistake)— held the position of Coya, Empress, which came with a good deal of religious veneration in addition to the soft power that comes from having ready access to the most powerful man in the Inca world. Below the Coya there were other wives and concubines —both related and unrelated to the emperor— and they had as much personal power and authority as their personal relationship to the emperor and their status as mother of various princes and princesses determined. Imperial favourites and mothers to prominent royals were women of great influence.

The second position that immediately comes to mind is to be the head of a Panaca. The Panaca is an institution unique to the Inca. Emperors were mummified upon their death, and that mummy continued to hold a court in its palace, ruling over much of its former estate, forever. The trouble with a mummified emperor, of course, is that it doesn't talk much. How do you know what it wants to do with all that wealth? Well, a cult of royal courtiers formed around the mummy and interpreted its wishes. Any Inca could join a Panaca —although only one Panaca, and their powers and influences did vary— and this became an avenue for both men and women of unimportant birth or low reputation to align themselves with an organization whose power might almost rival that of the current Sapa Inca. The inner circle around a mummy was often almost entirely female, and though we do not know quite how leadership within the Panaca's courtiers was decided, it may well be that the fact that men had other career opportunities outside the cult dedicated to a mummified emperor saw ambitious women commit themselves more fully to climbing up through the ranks to wield real power over the wealth of the deceased emperors. 

Third, Chosen Women were beautiful girls taken from their parents by the Inca State and put into special houses until they were married to either the Emperor, one of the Emperor's favourites, or to Inti, the Sun God who was the patron god of the Inca.* Now a Chosen Woman had little power, it is true, but a Bride of the Sun who went on to become the leader of a House of Chosen Women —especially the large ones in Cuzco and on the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca (then Lake Chucuito)— might be equated to a Mother Superior or an Abbess of a particularly powerful religious institution. What happened within the walls of her domain were her business, and her House of Chosen Women had enormous influence on what happened in the surrounding area.

Finally, the Inca were polytheists, and they were very open to the gods and cults of the people they absorbed into their empire, provided the superiority of the Inca pantheon was acknowledged. In that spirit, female religious leaders and especially women with oracular powers were given as much power within Tahuantinsuyu as they would have held before their worshipers were amalgamated into the Empire. The Inca were also willing to creating new female religious figures of enormous power. Probably the best example of this happened when Mama Ocllo —Coya to Topa Cusi Yupanki and mother of Huanya Capac— died. Huayna Capac adored his mother, and so he commissioned the creation of a new state cult in her honour, including a young woman to be known as Mama Ocllo's Voice, who had the ability to speak on his mother's behalf. Years later during the great revolt when the northern third of the Empire (roughly Ecuador) revolted, several units of pure-blooded Inca were embarrassed during a siege and then publicly berated by Huayna Capac. Now the rest of the Inca military were soldiers fulfilling their tax labour quota, but pure-blooded Inca —Pacuyoks, Ear-Plug Men— considered themselves to be volunteers. They decided to 'unvolunteer' and march home to Cuzco, and only the timely intervention of Mama Ocllo's Voice heaping them with praise and promising them riches turned the deserters around. 

To circle back to your reference to Yzma, while none of these are a perfect fit for her, I think from context we can establish she's not married to the Emperor, and if she was running a Panaca we would see her in close proximity to a mummy and speaking on its behalf. If she was a Bride of Inti running a House of Chosen Women, she wouldn't have Kronk as a henchman, because Houses of Chosen Women were exclusively female domains. Yzma —to the extent that Disney cares about such things— almost certainly was some kind of witch or religious figure. She clearly has magical abilities and the freedom and power to go where she wants, when she wants, doing what she wants.

As a footnote, let me explain that asterisk I put after Inti the sun god who was the patron of the Inca. There is a lot we don't know about the Inca religion. There is a theory that I like the sound of that suggests Inti was not actually the Imperial patron in the Inca pantheon. He was more the patron god of their empire-building. As Tahuantinsuyu grew, the Inca built sun temples on heights overlooking their conquered peoples to let the new citizens know who was boss, but Inti as an Empire Builder and Huanacauri as their war idol were probably much more cults of conquest than of true reverence to the Inca. Viracocha, the Creator God and head of the Inca pantheon, was probably the true patron of the Inca, but they did not create many new temples to honour him during the course of their empire-building. They did maintain and glorify the places where others worshiped him, though.

Edit: Minor edits for clarity.

Edit 2: Half-sisters, not step-sisters.
This is an excellent question, and I'm going to complicate it by asking, "what do you mean by power?" The Inca had a complex interweaving of social, sacred, economic, and political power, and the history of the Andes had examples of women attaining power of various stripes long before the Inca. To give two brief examples predating the Inca:

Archaeological excavations in coastal Ecuador at the site of Capa Perro recovered the burial of a shaman, or perhaps an initiate, of a young woman, some 14-18 years old. She was interred with numerous accoutrement depicting her role in society: a *coquero* (perhaps antique for her having been passed down), which is a small lime pot used to activate coca leaves' alkaloids while chewing; greenstone pendants (green being a collor of fertility and preciousness throughout the Americas) and a fruit bat mandible found in the abdominal region; and a fragmented ceramic figurine that was found in the disarticulated remains of a feline snout. [More recent work in Bolivia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2019/05/06/ancient-bolivian-fox-snout-pouch-contained-cocaine-and-other-hallucinogenic-drugs/#7aedc1bd2b8a) has recovered a fox-snout pouch with residues of hallucinogenic drugs, and it's possible we are looking at another example of one of these Andean "bags of holding" for shamanic paraphernalia. This young woman dated from Terminal Valdivia times, some 1800-1500 BC - so at this early time within Andean social complexity, some societies held women as authorities in religious matters.

Let's turn the clock forward a bit more to the Moche of the north Peruvian coast. There, at the site of El Brujo, Peruvian archaeologists recovered a female mummy now known as the "[Lady of Cao](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Reconstitution_de_la_Dame_de_Cao_%28Mus%C3%A9e_du_quai_Branly_-_Jacques_Chirac%2C_Paris%29.jpg/375px-Reconstitution_de_la_Dame_de_Cao_%28Mus%C3%A9e_du_quai_Branly_-_Jacques_Chirac%2C_Paris%29.jpg)". As you can see from the picture link I just attached, the lady of Cao was interred with a remarkable array of gold, including a sizable hammered-gold headdress and two massive golden war clubs (ceremonial). The Lady of Cao has been posited as a ruler or dynast of El Brujo, itself a sizable Moche settlement - so in the early centuries AD among the Moche there is evidence of women within the ruling class not only in a religious sense, but politically, with implications for military strategy and legitimacy.

With some of this historical background in mind, let's look at the Inca. The position of Sapa Inca, in the chronicles and dynastic lists compiled, were always men. However, their queen, the *Qoya*, was also imbued with immense power. Being of Inca stock herself (by blood - think Targaryens or Habsburgs, so sisters or first cousins), the Qoya provided counsel to her husband and acted as a chief political advisor and ally for the emperor's policies. Being the primary Qoya carried immense weight, as queen or queen mother. However, the Sapa Inca married secondary wives as well, often to cement political alliances with ethnic groups to be brought into the imperial fold. Wayna Qhapaq had something like a dozen wives, and some fifty children, which is what precipitated the fraternal civil war of the 1520s, when he and his chosen heir Ninan Kuychi died unexpectedly. The Qoya, being part of the Inca extended royal family, held especially great power in determining how these heirs were selected; this is because a Sapa Inca, rather than strictly taking his father's name and kin group, founded his own kin group or *panaqa* (some have called these royal corporations, or dynastic lineages). Each new panaqa, while claiming legitimacy from their father going back to Manqo Qhapaq (the mytho-historical first Inca), seated their power in practice to the ruler's mother. This meant they were often the primary advocates for their sons' political fortunes, and commanded immense wealth which they had full autonomy to distribute. (Unfortunately, much of this courtroom intrigue has been lost to history.)  As in the cases of Inca mummies of the Sapa Inca, the Qoya's mummy and image also maintained this power after death. However, this heightened power also meant higher stakes - Wayna Qhapaq, upon taking the throne in the typical coup of legitimacy, banished the failed heir to the throne but executed his mother.

This is all in addition to the institution of the *aqllakuna*, the Chosen Women commonly referred to in surveys of the Inca. These high-status retainers selected by the Inca, and secluded in *acllawasi*, were essentially given a cotillion of sorts, with training in textile production, political and military strategy, religion, and history; their destiny was that of being consorts to the Inca elite (or their mummies), or else being tactfully deployed wives for marriage to potential allies and subjects. As you might expect, however, our knowledge of women in Inca society, as elsewhere in history, is limited when compared to men, and often colored through male gazes and voices.

My main focus isn't on women in America's, but I have overlapped into that area before. I had to do a quick google search to remind myself what Yzma did in the movie, but it sounds like she was an advisor to the emperor and eventually wanted to kill him to take his spot. 

 In that way, Yzma would not have been able to obtain the throne and become a ruler, but she certainly could have been in a significant political position in Incan society. While it may have not been in an advisory role in the sense of how we view advisors to leaders today, women in Incan/Andean society were still able to obtain significant social/political power. 

Historian Karen Powers defines the Pre-Colombian Incan society as "gender parallelism." Powers writes that "Before the Spanish arrival, the peoples of the Andes put together societies that were characterized by gender parallelism and gender complementarity. In gender-parallel societies, women and men operate in two separate, but equivalent spheres, each gender enjoying autonomy in its own sphere. For example, in Inca society, women had their own religious and political organizations with their own female hierarchies of priestesses and officials, as did men in their sphere. Although men and women functioned in separate, gender-specific spheres, their worlds were highly interdependent and were joined together at the apex of the political system through the rule of a paramount lord and his council." 


This separation of gender was not created to be unfair or to restrict women, however, as they were often viewed as existing next to each other and working with each other in social and political goals. Women were able to pass property down to their daughters the same way fathers were able to pass goods down to their sons. This is in contrast to how the Spanish would upend society in the coming centuries when they arrived. Women were able to obtain the role of *Curacas* that were able to make significant choices in local matters dealing with access to material and goods produced by the community.

Above the community level and more at the 'national' level that Yzma would have been, women had considerable influence. Again, Powers writes, "Power often came to men through women. It should also be noted that at earlier stages of Andean political formation, some women had exercised power as paramount rulers." While women were still seperated by  gender parallelism, women could still impact political outcomes by voting and/or advising. While advising may seem like a weak term, these women were also held in esteem and respected, thus were able to hold influence. This did not mean that women were equal in all regards, however, given that ultimate political power still resided in the male heirarchy. While women with political influence like Yzma may have existed within the religious/political structure of Incan/Andean cultures, Yzma would not have been able to cross over from the female political/religious sphere and become the absolute ruler of the Incan empire.

While your question has been answered by others, I would like to add further to it. But before going into that, let me state that to understand the answers you've to understand caste itself which unlike the usual understanding as a neat pyramid or totem pole with a clear hierarchy, was far more complex with communities & individuals usually going up & down dependant on their material status. This usually resulted in a system where a high material status advanced the social standing & vice-versa.

Let's go through the questions one by one & see how we could do this
> Without any way of tracking people, or proving who was who, how would people in a town I had never been to, 100 miles away, ever know I was untouchable unless I told them? Why couldn't I just say I'm not an untouchable, what would any of the townsfolk do to verify my claims?

Unfortunately for your plan, there are actually ways for proving that you're not what you claim to be. All Indian villages maintained genealogies *(vamshawali/kursinama)* for the families living in the village. Not only that, this also extended to the people who have left the village/city for better pastures who would in some cases would return even a few generations later to claim their patrimony or a share of it (this has been recorded in a court case of 18th century where the descendants of a migrant returned to the village after 40 years & got a share of the original dues of their ancestors). So if somebody doubts you they could simply send a messenger to your village to verify the claims.

And these records didn't stop at village levels, there were nomadic communities who had their own generational clients & thus they also acted as a source of keeping track of family trees. And these nomads travelled far & wide regularly, so if you claim to be from a city 100 miles away a nomad could ask somebody from that village whether they are aware of your family which could lead to your claim being disproven.

Aside from the above methods, the pilgrimage centers had their own genealogical records going back upto hundreds of years (my own family tree could be traced to 400 years atleast). So in this case, suppose you're on a pilgrimage with your new neighbors, the local priests could start asking you about your ancestors to keep records which could lead again to your story being proven to be false.


So suppose you are planning to advance your status what you need to make sure is that your claim couldn't be disproven. So make it as remote as possible that any verification is imposible. Because your goal isn't proving your lineage. Claiming that is enough.

Another thing you need to do is to establish familial bonds with established & respected members of the caste you're aspiring to. This could be through marriage preferably getting the men in your family married to women of families of verified lineage (b/c of the concept of Anulom-Pratilom). Another is to adopt a male from some high ranking family of that caste group.
> Why didn't any untouchables in Indian history do this? Or, did they?

Actually many tried. Some succeeded, some failed. In fact this phenomenon was so widespread that an 18th century proverb mocked it by stating that **difference b/w a Kunbi & Maratha is 3 good years** i.e. continuous material prosperity could lead to somebody of low origins claiming high status

I would like to discuss a few examples of this happening in history in the same time period as you claimed

1) **The Ramnagar Rajas of Daman** :- 

They were Koli chieftains in Daman on western coast of India who guest came into prominence in the late 14th century. Kolis were a caste of fishermen & were considered impure by the others. The Ramanagar chiefs succeded in amassing wealth by engaging in trade & with the arrival of Potuguese in early 16th century worked out an agreement of mutual support with them further cementing their status. Once that happened the Ramnagar Rajas started looking for a higher status as *Kshatriyas*. So by 1596 they hired a few Brahmins from South India who invented a *vanshaavali* tracing them to a 12th century prince of Kannauj in North India & princess from Yadava kingdom of Devagiri in South. Both kingdoms were highly regarded but destroyed in the initial years of Islamic conquest with a few survivors left & most of their records destroyed. So they were distant enough so as to not be disproven. A cadet branch of the house based in Jawar which still claimed to be Koli was explained as bastards produced through concubinage [sic]. Eventually the Ramnagar line was destroyed as a result of the conflict with the nascent Maratha state in 17th century. But by 18th century, the Jawar branch of the family had revived the Kshatriya claim & explained the Koli origins as a result of a political union made in times of distress.

2) **The Bhonsales of Maharashtra**

This brings us to the late 16th century when a certain Maloji Bhonsale started rising in fame in the kingdom of Ahmednagar. He was an intrepid soldier who quickly amasses a fortune & decides to enhance his status by buying *deshmukhi* (lit. 10% lordship) over 7 villages. At this time, Maloji starts to claim Kshatriya status by tracing his lineage to a 14th century exiled Prince of Mewar (again notice the distance, both in terms of location & time). The local Marathas, who are Kshatriyas doubt his claims & indicated towards less illustrious origins (with some claiming that Maloji's father Nagoji used to be a bandit & others saying that Maloji was a simple farmer who chanced upon some hidden treasure). Maloji in a curious incident succeeded in getting his son Shahji married to the daughter of Lakhoji Jadhav, a direct descendant of Yadavs of Devagiri (the same ones in the case of Ramanagar Rajas). The result of this marriage was the illustrious Shivaji who established the Maratha kingdom. The claims of descent from Mewar were ratified in 1730s under the reign of Shahu the grandson of Shivaji. At the same time another clan with the surname of Bhonsale (no relations to house of Maloji), serving as generals, claimed that they were descendants of a later exile from Mewar & got their claim ratified at the same time.

3) **The Raj Gonds of Central India**

In the 16th century, in the Central Indian jungles the tribal Gonds started to amass political & military power by serving the local rulers as mercenaries. One such example is *Jatba* of Nagpur, who served the king Tulobaji. Jatba eventually usurped throne & by 1595 was established as an independent chief claiming descent from the *Yadava kings of Devagiri*. In 1685 his descendant converted to Islam to gain the support of Aurangzeb & adopted the name Bakht Buland. But the later rulers dropped Islam & started marrying back into Gond community & supporting the Marathas. They were eventually supplanted by the aforementioned Bhonsales & pensioned off. But they kept their status as Raj Gond & Kshatriyas with some of them still living. Another example of Gonds would be of those of GarhMandala who came to power in later part of 15th century & claimed descent to the *Yadava kings of Devagiri*. This dynasty was eventually ended in 1584 under the attacks of Akbar.

4) **The 4 Prabhus of Maharashtra**

While all the earlier examples are of individuals who rose through their military might, this wasn't the only means of social advancement. In the mid 17th century disputes started arising b/w the native Brahmans & the Prabhus. The Prabhus claimed that they were caste Brahmanas, & have migrated to the area from the North. They presented two theories of origin, one claimed that they migrated in early 13th century in a group of 400 families to serve the *Yadava kings of Devagiri* (I think you may notice the pattern by now) as the region lacked learned men; while the other took it to mythological times & claimed that they were settled in the area by the sage *Parsurama, who was 6th avatar of Lord Vishnu*. The local Brahmans otoh liked to claim that the Prabhus were an amalgamation of Shudras who were hired as bureaucrats due to a shortage of learned men. These disputes became so severe that Shivaji made it a policy to always have a Brahman, a Prabhu, & a Maratha in charge of forts so their mutual jealousies would prevent them from forming any conspiracies. But the Prabhus persisted in their claims, & even in 1789 we find a court case which reached to the Central govt of Marathas in Pune & the Prabhus were ordered to desist from officiating the marriage rites of other communities (though they could do so for the Prabhus) & not to prevent their widows from remarrying if any expresses the wish (this was especially insulting as only the Shudra widows remarried). But then again in the 1810s the Central Govt issues a decree to stop the practice of Prabhus marrying into Brahman families by paying exorbitant bride price. Finally, the Prabhus splintered into 4 communities:- the Chandraseniya, Kinchole, Pathare who became Kayastha (a caste which is mix of Brahmans & Kshatriya) & the Bhatt who became Brahmans.

Firstly, I'd like to mention that "caste" itself wasn't a singular construct. It varied from region to region and could be delineated along lines of class, profession, education, and birth. To shed some light on the nuances of caste, I will refer to a specific example from Northern India, which during this period was under the rule of the Mughal empire.

In 1605, the Mughal emperor Akbar died at age 63. His grand vizier, Abul Fazl wrote the Ain-e-Akbari, which is the 3rd volume of the official history of Akbar's reign. In this volume, he details the large variances within the Jat caste of Northern India. The Zamindars (landlords/tax-collecting nobles), armed forces (warrior class) and even the farming peasants all belonged to the Jat caste. As you can see, it was not uncommon for castes themselves to be segregated and occupationally diverse. The pre-existing systems used by Hindus to describe caste were also influenced by concepts of social hierarchy from Islam. 
Taking another example from Southern India, the Madurai Nayak dynasty, which lasted from 1529-1736 was of the Balija caste, which was a merchant/trader caste in South India. In the popular consciousness of caste, they would be viewed as Vaishyas, which are placed on the lower rungs of social hierarchy. I hope these examples shed some light on the difficulties faced in describing the caste system of this period.

Although generalizations about castes are obviously unfavorable, a lot of caste systems find their origin in the enforcement of social stratification primarily to collect taxes and rule the lower classes of society. In this period, which is an era of Mughal empires and Islamic sultanates, this translated into rulers levying such a system for the taxation and rule of the non-Muslim masses. This is a trend that carried on past the medieval era.

It is also important to stress that although varying forms of casteism were prevalent throughout the subcontinent, they were codified into an administrative mechanism during the British Raj. An account of the various developments and classifications used by the British merits a separate response of its own. These classifications were used to qualify/disqualify Indians for various jobs and roles within the Raj itself. Another commentor mentioned that the codification by the British was the final nail in the coffin, and I would like to add that it is not a stretch to imagine it as the coffin itself. Although systems of caste were extremely prevalent in the subcontinent, they were legally formalized by the British through their census. This information was then incorporated into their governance of the subcontinent, through means such as the granting of administrative jobs and senior appointments to the upper castes. Among other laws, the British Raj introduced measures to criminalize lower castes and presume them guilty by birth. Through such laws and the census, this period saw what little caste mobility existed fade away.

Anyways, my final point is that the answer to a specific question about the caste system in India would require not only a specific region/location, but also a depth of information on the individual castes. Caste itself didn’t exist as a rigid concept in this period and was only beginning to be codified into what historians call the modern caste system. Even if a peasant laborer were to move to another town, they would not be easily incorporated into the pre-existing ruling classes. Other barriers to caste mobility included the lack of education, financial/administrative power and land ownership. Specific answers to questions of caste are also limited by a dearth of in-depth knowledge on the regional stratifications seen in this period.

Caste in India was a constantly evolving concept. The caste systems that were prevalent in the medieval and modern period were very different from those seen in the pre-modern and Vedic periods of Indian history.

Yes, you could do that but not always and not everywhere in Indian subcontinent. The books you will read in this topic are lacking because it is quite complex and changes from one region to another. It was mostly possible to do this in Deccan India or the periphery of India. For example :- the Tulu dynasty of Vijaynagar Empire were lower caste who became Kshatriyas i.e the ruling/warrior caste. Another example is more localised and oral history-- someone I knew are Brahmins in present times but were counted as lower caste farmers 300-350 years back. Keep in mind though they are Brahmin, they are considered lowest of the Brahmins by other castes. This happened with other castes as well with Vedic Hinduism spreading from Northwest to rest of India. Vedic Hinduism had to spread without disrupting the existing social order of the times. So the people who would be considered lower caste by occupation suddenly found themselves classified as Kshatriyas and other upper castes. If you look into the original gotras( originator like Adam) of the Vedic Aryans and compare it to the present gotras you can see addition of many new gotras in the various castes of the subcontinent. 

To show you how complex it can be, I shall present you with three further examples from ancient and Mediaeval India.

 1.You must have read about the Gupta Empire, now Gupta are considered the merchant class/ Vaishya. They were able to climb to Kshatriya caste and would go on to inter marry the Kshatriya women, which was one way of legitimatize their position in the society. They even intermarried with descendents of Gautam Buddha's uncle. 

2. Next we look at the many Central Asian invaders and how they were integrated into Indian society. They were considered mlechhas( barbarians) and hence were looked down upon by the literati elite of the ancient India. Even though they were treated as mlechhas, they were formed the ruling political and military elite which didn't conform to the Vedic world view. To remedy the situation, these cavalry warriors were called Patit Kshatriyas (fallen warriors) as they had been forced to move into India due to expulsion from their original homeland. The best example for the above would be Kushans of post- Mauryan period or as you may better identify them as the Yeuchi tribe that had to cede to Han Dynasty. They adopted Buddhism as their state religion as it more open in comparison to Vedic Hinduism. Moreover, in Buddhist world order Kshatriya were the top caste not Brahmins. Another thing you should keep in mind the importance of horse in Hinduism. Horses exclusively belonged to the upper class and caste as was the case in other parts of the world till early modern period. This combined with the mastery of composite bow which was usually identified with military elite of India. All this meant even if the Brahmins were against their integration into the society they could not do much. 
                       It was around this time that the major dharm shashtra of Manu was compiled. Manusmriti was written down to counter the changes prevalent in North and Northwest India. 

3. Lastly, contrary to the image of peaceful India which I find is more due to Buddhism, Jainism and Mahatma Gandhi; India was highly militarised society. Lack of central authority and feudalism from 700 AD onwards meant ever present danger of a bloody conflict. Majority of these were low intensity warfare. This led to demand for mercenary as well local militia. If one such upstart feudal lord was able to consolidate power and build his own his kingdom, he sometimes would allow the mercenaries to change their caste. Hence, lower caste looked at military careers as not just necessary to survive but thrive as well. This continued to be viable means of social mobility under Mughals, Marathas and other local satraps as late as early 19th century. This is the reason " Indian Arms Act, 1878" was a huge issue for Congress and other Indian pressure groups of the day. 

When the British East India company and later the Crown became the hegemon in South Asia, they started by classifying and rigidifying the caste system. Caste mobility had drastically reduced even before the British took over but they were proverbial last nail in the coffin. Now, the social standing depended on education which was the forte of Brahmins.

Also,I would like to address the conversion to other religions to escape caste system. The majority of converts to Christianity are tribes of South Asia rather than the lower caste. The majority Christians are all present in Northeastern states on India.  These tribes had minimal contact with Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism,Sikhism as well as Islam till early 17th century. 
Those that did convert to other religions were not lucky either as all these religions did invent their own form of casteism which are overlooked or not discussed as often. Moreover, it was not just the lower caste for whom it was beneficial to convert to Islam as many upper castes converted to Islam to gain favor with the ruling elite.

Edit : There were other ways through which one could change one's caste. Post Vedic Hinduism had the option of climbing the caste hierarchy through "yagna", a ritual practice perfomed by the household of the new ruler/ warrior. It was officiated by certain group of Brahmins. This yagna is called " Hiranyagarbha". It roughly translates to Golden Womb and was performed by Rashtrakuta Dynasty of Deccan India. This yagna meant cosmic rebirth of the person as Kshatriya even if they did not belong to Kshatriya caste. 

Similarly, the (in)famous Rajputs of Rajasthan were inducted into Indian caste hierarchy through a genesis story. They are called "Agnikula" Kshatriyas meaning originated from Fire. Then there are Nagavanshi Kshatriyas of Eastern India who were originally tribal warlords and cattle herders. They, too, were able to attain Kshatriyahood through conquest as late as 1500s. They played pivotal role in the polity of Mediaeval Kalinga in its fight against Delhi Sultanate.
  

I'm sorry is the answer seems ling drawn out but there are a few things that need to be understood before going on to answer this question. 

Firstly, One of the problems with trying to view Indian society with the 'caste' lens is that the categorization under 'caste' is a European construct, starting with the Portuguese. The original Indian terms for what the Europeans later on described as caste is jati and varna. Jati in India is synonymous with birth. Jati, while it implies difference, does not suggest an absolute hierarchy or ritualistic distinction. Indeed, jati terms tend to indicate (if they indicate anything) associations with traditional occupation (mostly lost in modernity), region, and language. In other words, jati is often bounded by a regional political and social economy rather than an objective social hierarchy, as is sometimes assumed. Varna on the other hand, is the fourfold division of the society in Brahmans or priests, kshtriya or warriors, vaishya or merchant and the shudra or slaves (These are not precise rather loose translation for those who might be unfamiliar).

Caste, or 'Casta' is first used to describe the Indian society by Barros while writing Decades da Asia (If I'm to remember correctly, I'll need to confirm the name of the book). The understanding that the Europeans developed of that of Indian society was that of a complex, rigid & hierarchized system divided within the four folds of varna. The British later on codified the law and the perception of caste was unchanging was further rigidified. 

The reality was very different from the way the Europeans understood it as. The castes in the Indian society weren't fixed categories which people were born into, but rather more fluid and flexible. This can be seen in the case of Rajputs, who were, initially based on the work of Col. James Tod were romanticized as the caste to succeed Kshtriyas as the protectors and the preservers of the social order. But more recent works have established that Rajput was a category that could be acquired by clans aspiring to rise in the social order by following the prescribed code of Rajput behavior (DHA Kolff uses the folksongs to argue this case) which was based on distant service and ascetism. The romanticized image of the Rajputs was a result of James Tod equating the Rajputs to the Scottish Highlanders. Another example is the use of the category of 'Brahmakshatra' by the Guhilas in Mewar once they become a significant power in the regional politics. One became a 'Brahmakshatra' when a Brahmin traded his role of a brahmin to become a kshatriya by blessing of a renowned guru or an acharya (who is also a Brahman). Guhilas used this to provide more legitimacy to their claims to rulership. Many of the thirty six clans of Rajputs had tribal or at-times even foreign origin. Now the fluid character of the caste can be seen in many other instances in Indian history, but the point to take away is that with enough power, military upstarts could aspire and even gain positions that weren't traditionally theirs's or they weren't born into.

Now coming back to the question, for an untouchable to run and pretend to be a brahmin required him to be first acquire knowledge that could help him in the pretending. Here comes the problem of language of literature, which till the end of first millennium AD was Sanskrit and was monopolized by the Brahmans who were the majority of the writers of the literature in the language The women & shudras (untouchables included) weren't even allowed to listen to the language, and even the works like Kalidas' ' Abhijanaskahuntalam' shows the elite men talking in Sanskrit whereas all the commoners and the women talk in Prakrit. So, if the untouchable wasn't even allowed to listen to the language, how can we expect them to learn the trade of brahmans for the purpose of pretending. Another thing to keep in mind is that Brahmans weren't a monolithic caste per-se and were divided in various sub-categories with differing levels of social and economic standings. One example of this is the Bhumihar brahmans of Bihar, recruited by EIC army. The match, EIC and Bihari Bumihar became an interesting combination as Bhumihars weren’t respected as they engaged in agricultural labor, a task prohibited for the farmers, and the EIC wanted to hire a high-caste army. Thus, Bhumihars employment in the army fulfilled army’s need for high caste soldiers, whereas Bhumihars got a prestigious job (EIC was the highest payers of all the employers at the time) and also a caste certificate which they could show off to their traditionally more respected Brahmin counterparts as a show of newfound power and respect. (Forgive me for digressing but I believe it needs to be stated to understand the nature of ‘caste’ in Indian society).

Now, from the second millennium AD, the vernacular shift (Sheldon Pollock calls it the ‘vernacular millennium’) takes place and the Sanskrit hegemony is broken by vernaculars which are followed by rise of regional states where the vernacular finds patrons. Another aspect that promotes the vernacularization is the Bhakti movement where the saints (of various castes) start using vernaculars of the common people’s tongue to give speeches and started to ignore and break caste restrictions. Here, the chances of our Brahmin (on anything but untouchable) impersonator are better learning to carry out the impersonating but I’d find it difficult for someone who is part of a Bhakti group like Nathpanthis, Dadupanthis or the like to find motivations to leave groups to return to the Brahmanical fold as these groups already practiced the sense of equality our untouchable craves.

Another problem that our impersonator would face would be a spatial one. The towns in medieval India were divided according to the mohollas or colonies of different castes. Thus, these communities were tightly knit and had long chains of personal connections thus making it easier to identify those of their caste. Further, our untouchable would be living in the outskirts of the town and won’t have the material strength required to imitate the higher caste moholla walas in dress and in taste, but also in habit.

So I wonder if we are looking at this through too much of a modern lens.

&#x200B;

Would an untouchable even think of leaving?  How much did they know about other towns 100 miles away?  I am guessing most were illiterate - so how equipped would they be to navigate to another town 100 miles away? How distinct of an accent would they have?  While life as an untouchable was pretty terrible but how realistic is it that they'd leave whatever sort of support structure they did have.

We don't know. Seriously. There are as many explanations as there are scholars.

Medieval people thought it was weird and funny, too. [They even parodied it.](http://i.imgur.com/QYcaDFv.jpg)

The British Library's Medieval Manuscripts blog, which I will shill for every chance I get, has some more great examples [here](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2013/09/knight-v-snail.html).
According to the late, great art historian Michael Camille (in his book "Image on the Edge"), there have been a number of theories behind the iconographic motif of the snail in 13th, 14th, and early 15th century marginalia. Citing other historians and art historians, he mentions parallels with the story of the Raising of Lazarus, individuals cloistered away in the safety of fortified castles, the Lombards, social climbers, and more lewd, sexual interpretations. For more, see ["Image on the Edge",](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax9WAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=image+on+the+edge&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikoZidxaXJAhVGOiYKHcQpA1AQ6AEIMDAA#v=onepage&q=image%20on%20the%20edge&f=false) pp. 31-36.

(as an aside, the snail motif appears in late 15th century 'trompe l'oeil' marginalia, but Camille dismisses this era of medieval illuminated margins as "The End of the Edge" in the last chapter his book--one of my quibbles with his work).

Thanks for your understanding!
The USSR had an extensive civil defence organisation, which developed from Local Anti-Air Defence or MPVO (Местная противовоздушная оборона - МПВО) initiated in 1932. You might be interested to know that in autumn 1940, the MPVO was organised as part of the NKVD, the secret police, by order № 001378. They were especially active during the siege of Leningrad collecting firewood, organizing the evacuation of the disabled, assisting the victims of bombing, burying bodies, distributing gas masks and training the population in their use. The MPVO in Leningrad was commanded mostly by women (1,500 by the end of 1942). When the Axis were driven out of the USSR, they also assisted in minesweeping, according to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations [1].

When the original "Duck and Cover" film was being shown in the United States in 1951, the Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Navy or DOSAAF (Добровольное Общество Содействия Армии, Авиации и Флоту - ДОСААФ) was organised in the USSR. DOSAAF was a technically voluntary paramilitary organisation aimed at teaching skills of military value to the population, especially to the young - there was a lot of overlap between DOSAAF and the Komsomol, the political youth organisation of the USSR. Activities included fitness and sport, marksmanship, radio operation, driving, first aid, as well as military study. In 1952, it was estimated that 15 million people were DOSAAF members [**edit:** according to Leon Gouré in his work for the RAND Corporation in the US, rather than estimates closer to the USSR]. In 1955, there was reportedly a renewed push for membership and an emphasis on civil defence - physically fit men from 16 to 60 and women from 16 to 55 were liable for civil defence training in partnership with their school or workplace [2]. Also at this time, the MPVO was directed towards civil defence, with different services (for public order, firefighting, communications, etc.) drawn from police departments, fire departments, TV and radio operators, etc. There were also "self-defence groups" drawn on a compulsory basis from men between 16-60 and women between 18-55 who were not liable for obligatory military service or deferred from the draft. Exemptions were made for pregnant women, the sick and disabled, among others. In an emergency, the MPVO would be "supplemented by large numbers of ordinary citizens who have been trained by DOSAAF and can be instantly mobilised." [3] **Edit:** We'll never know how effective Soviet civil preparedness would have been in the event of a nuclear attack - this kind of mass mobilisation and organisation would likely not have been realistic. But certainly the idea behind DOSAAF was to instruct the population in civil defence skills.

Only in 1961 was the MPVO reorganised into the official Civil Defence of the USSR. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in October of that year stated that there was little effort in actual shelter and evacuation plans, with the Soviets at that time relying on WWII-era shelters and subways in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev. The Bulletin made a point that the difference in population density and industrial concentration with the US meant the USSR had less need of such plans. Osgood Caruthers of the New York Times reported from the USSR that "nowhere in Moscow or any other city visited by foreigners can one find signs pointing to shelters... no practice alerts are held... posters are extremely rare... [and there is] no such thing as an effort on a citywide basis to organize block crews or house wardens for civil defense" [4]. However, the CIA produced a report in May 1961 stating the USSR was spending between $500 million and $1.5 billion annually on civil defence, with a large part invested in shelter construction, in a program started 10 years beforehand [5]. According to the St Petersburg publication Fontanka, 4,003 bomb shelters remained in the city in 2010, 2,873 thereof located under residential housing [6].

In the later years of the 60s, Soviet Civil Defence had begun to produce short films similar to "Duck and Cover" advising citizens and schoolchildren what to do in the event of an attack, you can see cards at the electronic archive of the Russian National Children's Library (click one and then click "Перейти к просмотру") [7]. The film "Главное - не растеряться" ("Most Importantly - Stay Strong") in 1968 shows Soviet methods to withstand an atomic attack on a city, with Civil Defence leading people to designated shelters and evacuating to the countryside afterwards [8]. Another film made as late as 1989 goes into detail about the evacuation plans [9]. Civil Defence were also producing literature such as "Everyone Should Know And Be Able To Do This" (Это должен знать и уметь каждый) in 1983 [10]. **Edit:** Soviet film production for higher education also produced informative films in the late 70s-80s such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sRzfmgu5A).

According to a survey of Soviet emigrants in the 1980s, 41.3% remembered where the civil defence shelter closest to their job or school had been, 29.3% had gone to a shelter during a drill in the last two years of their time in the USSR and 8.1% had even taken part in an evacuation drill, leaving town temporarily [11]. The authors of the survey note that these are all in the minority, so preparedness was perhaps not so thorough in the USSR at the time.

There are two parts of this question. “Cold War hysteria” (to take the term at face value for a moment) had a great many aspects and the worry about nuclear war was only one of them. In the United States, for example, we had McCarthyism, ideological propaganda, etc.  Basically all of these things were also present in the Soviet Union. In both cases they were equally important or prominent features throughout the length of the Cold War, that stretched some forty-or-so years. 

Although there was, in some sense, an ever-present threat of nuclear war,I’d be careful about calling a forty year stretch a sustained period of mass hysteria. The Cold War was a long, complex period and the importance of nuclear technology alongside the threat of nuclear war  had far reaching consequences that stretched far beyond the need for bomb shelters and drills. Because you’ve already got a pretty good answer about the Civil Defense aspects of Cold War living, I’m going to focus on some of the social and cultural ramifications of nuclear technology in the context of the Cold War.

Let’s talk about ideological worries first. Under Stalin, ideological purity tests were hardly a new thing by the beginning of the Cold War, but they did take on a new urgency as the contest between the United States and the Soviet Union began to take on an increasingly ideological character.

In the Soviet Union, particular attention was paid to scientists and engineers. Although it is true that some scientists received relative freedom and privilege because of their central role in, for example, the Soviet nuclear program (see, for example, Soviet physicist Igor Kurchatov), who was told by Stalin in 1945 “If a child doesn’t cry, the mother doesn’t know what he needs. Ask for whatever you like. You won’t be refused” (Suny, The Soviet Experiment, 371) But that dependent on complete political subservience, which was sometimes scientifically limiting. Quantum Theory was considered particularly suspect under Stalin for example (Suny, 372)

Other scientists were not so lucky. Take for example, Iurii Zhdanov (not to be confused with Andrei Zhdanov), a biologist, who came under fire for comments about evolution. He wrote an apology letter to Stalin that provides us with a bit of a window into just how deeply the sciences were beholden to political ideology in the Soviet Union.

>Appearing at a seminar of lecturers with a paper on the debatable questions of modern Darwinism, I undoubtedly committed a whole series of grave mistakes.
1. The very presentation of this paper was a mistake. I clearly underestimated my new position as a worker within the apparatus of the Central Committee, underestimated my responsibility, and failed to take into consideration that my appearance will be thought of as an official point of view of the Central Committee. Here was expressed that “university habit,” when I made known my viewpoints in any scientific controversy without meditation. Therefore, when I was invited to give a paper at a seminar of lecturers, I decided to express my deliberations there with the reservation that this is “a personal point of view,” so that my appearance would not obligate anyone to anything. There is no doubt that this was “professorial” in its poor judgment and not the Party position.
(The entire letter can be found in translation here: http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1947-2/triumph-of-t-d-lysenko/triumph-of-t-d-lysenko-texts/zhdanov-letter-to-the-central-committee/)

Nuclear and more conventional conflict were consistent topics on the minds of the Soviet leadership and the Soviet people, but the Soviet Union was not monolithic, nor was the United States. Aftter the death of Stalin and the election of Eisenhower, the Soviet leadership hoped that a relative peace could be established (This period is commonly know at “the Thaw”).  
Nonetheless, as you know, the Cold War continued to the end of the Soviet Union in spite of the fact that periods of relative stability were established by the two governments.  Of course, this was happening at the same that nuclear weapons became the focus of both militaries. Both countries saw conventional military spending go down, but saw spending on nuclear arms increase by 1960.

The Soviet Union had an extensive system of bomb shelters as well. The Moscow Metro, much of which served as bomb shelters in World War 2, was an ever-present feature of Soviet citizens living in Moscow, and was also to serve as a massive shelter in the case of a nuclear attack. Children had drills, and so forth. (As already answered)

The similarities went beyond that though. Kate Brown makes a compelling case about the similarities of Soviet and US  “nuclear cities” in her book Plutopia, not to mention the cultural effects of plutonium disasters that occurred during the same period. The cities of Richland and Ozersk had quite a lot in common, down to government monitoring of the citizenry, health risks, etc, on the downside and access to consumer society (yes, even in the Soviet Union). Brown’s argument is interesting, in that these two cities represented the American Dream and the success of Soviet communism on the one hand and (later) the danger of the production of nuclear material. 

In the end, perhaps, that’s the story here. The nuclear technology that accompanied the Cold War was at once a source of optimism and a source of worry. This was true in both the Soviet Union and the United States. The internal politics of the United States and the Soviet Union were radically different, so it is interesting to see how the Cold War and nuclear technology ended up manifesting in very similar ways in both places. 

I wouldn't call it "hysteria" ("exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement") — the USA and the USSR both _were_ threatened by the possibility of nuclear war. The USSR even more than the USA for most of it; the USA [ringed the USSR with airbases full of nuclear-armed bombers](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-nuclear-bomber-deployments-1945-1958.jpg) by the 1950s, with war plans that would leave the USSR a "smoking, radiating ruin at the end of two hours," as one of the US officers involved in the planning put it. This was followed up by ICBMs, short-range nuclear missiles, submarine-launched missiles, atomic artillery, etc. Through the 1960s, the balance of nuclear strength was disproportionately in the US's favor; only in the 1970s was there a real "parity" in terms of both sides being able to inflict identical damage to one another, though even by the 1960s the USSR was capable of doing great harm to the USA. 

I would not consider fallout shelters, duck and cover, etc., to be "hysterical" under those circumstances: they were part of the US Civil Defense program, the goal of which was to try and mitigate (as much as possible) the effects of a nuclear exchange that the politicians felt may not be preventable, to keep as much of the US "alive" after it so that recovery might be to some degree possible. It is easy to laugh at this stuff in retrospect when you do not respect the very real sense of danger that existed at the time, though I have found in recent months that Americans are getting a taste for that feeling once again. Many of the Cold War CD policies were flawed in many ways (e.g. city evacuation was just not going to work for major metropolises), many were only of relative help (e.g. they would not save everyone but would lower the number of casualties), many were very specific to their specific strategic moment (_Duck and Cover_ is good advice for 1951, but it was inadequate by the 1960s, when the size and power of the Soviet arsenal was larger, and fallout the more pertinent "survivable" threat). It is unfortunately very misunderstood, having turned into a political hot potato in the US and Europe by both the left and the right in the 1980s. 

That out of the way, your question comes down to, "were there Soviet Civil defense programs, public service announcements, etc.?" And the answer is: yes. The Soviet Union did have Civil Defense programs that were similar in many ways to the American ones. They had fallout shelters, public blast shelters, various forms of public education programs that were aimed at schoolchildren and adults alone, etc. I am not aware of anything quite as kitschy as _Duck and Cover_, which is extreme kitsch by any standard. The most famous Soviet Civil Defense document in the West is _[Grazhdanskaya Oborona](http://bunker-datacenter.com/plakat.go/)_ ("Civil Protection"), a textbook of Civil Defense (this one from 1986, but apparently it was first issued originally in 1970), which is rather beautiful to my eyes, illustrated in the _lubok_ style of a peasant woodcut.

The real historical question about Soviet Civil Defense was, how "for real" was it? In the 1970s and 1980s there were accusations by hawks in the US that the Soviet CD program was lightyears beyond the (always anemic) US program, and that Soviet strategists felt nuclear war was thus "survivable" and would be more willing to wage it. While the Soviet CD program was definitely better-funded than the American one — no great feat given how much of a low priority CD was (the US fallout shelter program was, ultimately, aimed at convincing people to _build their own_ — indeed, much of the US program was no more than an information campaign, not a real infrastructure project), there is no evidence that they regarded it as any serious "hedge" or incorporated it into a more belligerent warfighting strategy, and how "useful" it was is rather debatable.

He will have a book out on this soon, I believe, but in the meantime, the best comparative history of the US and Soviet Civil Defense programs is Edward M.

If so, are there any good videos (Doesn't need to be in English) of what the USSR did to teach people via media? Like in the US you see those videos of kids at school. Does the USSR have any?

Hello everyone, 

If you are a first time visitor, welcome! This thread is trending high right now and getting a lot of attention, but it is important to remember those upvotes represent interest in the question itself, and [it can often take time for a good answer to be written](/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/). The mission of /r/AskHistorians is to provide users with **in-depth and comprehensive responses**, and our [rules](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) are intended to facilitate that purpose. *We remove comments which don't follow them for reasons including unfounded speculation, shallowness, and of course, inaccuracy*.

Thank you!
This is a very interesting question. In an environment of fiercely hostile states competing for supremacy, it doesn't really make sense for a successful general to write down his knowledge for all to read. And any ruler who got hold of such a document would find it in his best interests to surpress it. So how did a text on military methods end up as one of the most famous and widely read texts from Ancient China?

In many ways, the 孫子兵法 (*Sun Zi Bing Fa*, "Master Sun's Art of War") is not the most promising place to look for an answer. The origins of the work are shrouded in mystery; the author may or may not be historical; the manuscript tradition is fraught with difficulties; the text itself was summed up by Robin Yates as "terse and obscure" and by Victor Mair as "extraordinarily terse and maddeningly obscure". We'll have to dig into these issues a bit if we are to get any sense of what the *Sun Zi* was meant to achieve.

First, the origins. At first glance, this question seems easy to answer: in his 史記 (*Shi Ji*, "Records of the Grand Historian"), the Han Dynasty scholar Sima Qian tells us that the *Sun Zi* was written around the early 5th century BC by a famous general called Sun Wu. Sima Qian offers some delightful biographical details of this Sun Wu, including the famous story of how he trained the concubines of the king of Wu in heavy infantry drill. The notion that there was indeed a historical Master Sun, who wrote his treatise on warfare at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, is still held by many. If we adopt this view, the answer to your question is relatively simple: a fugitive from the northern state of Qi (according to one version of the story), Sun Wu needed to impress his new master the king of Wu, and apart from his display as a drillmaster, the compilation of his Thirteen Chapters (the *Sun Zi*) would have provided evidence of his abilities. The biographical tradition helpfully notes that his advice and leadership allowed Wu to expand and conquer its neighbour, Chu. 

The problem with this account of the genesis of the *Sun Zi* is that there is no earlier account of the life of a general named Sun Wu, and that the very practice of assigning authors to works is not something the Chinese actually did until after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The find of a collection of texts on strips of bamboo - the traditional recording method - in a group of graves dating to the late 2nd century BC has confirmed that the *Sun Zi* existed more or less in its currently known form at that time, but there is no evidence that would support a date as early as the 400s BC. Moreover, if it did date that far back, it would be *by far* the earliest Chinese military treatise, with a gap of well over a century between it and its oldest successor. 

Indeed, the text itself has been shown to reflect the military practice of the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BC), not the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771-476 BC) in which it was supposedly written. The well-organised, well-drilled infantry armies envisioned by Master Sun do not belong to the era of chariot-borne warlords and their loose entourages that was the Spring and Autumn period. Its references to crossbows must place it in the period after these weapons were invented (sometime in the 4th century BC). In other words, the text is far more likely to be a product of the 4th century BC than the early 5th; as far as we can tell, the spread and recognition of the work as a military classic belongs to the early Han Dynasty.

It is not surprising, then, that Chinese scholars as early as the 13th century AD have wondered whether the legendary author of the *Sun Zi* ever really existed. Many modern experts have been persuaded by Jens Østergard Petersen's argument that the details of Sima Qian's biography of Sun Wu are generic, and that all its elements can be found in biographies of other generals too. Sun Wu's name (effectively meaning something like "wandering warrior") is considered too convenient, and his historical context too vague, to take him seriously as a character of the late Spring and Autumn period. In fact, there is robust evidence of the existence of a general and military expert with the surname Sun - but his first name was Bin, and he lived well over a century after the alleged time in which Sun Wu flourished, and he is credited with writing an entirely separate treatise on military matters, which was rediscovered in the same collection that gave us the earliest extant traces of the *Sun Zi*. It seems all too likely that the family name Sun, famously associated with military expertise, became attached to a growing collection of martial wisdom compiled over the course of the Warring States period. The opening of each chapter of the text with the formula "Master Sun said:" is paradoxically an indication that there was never a "Master Sun" - only a succession of authors legitimising their wisdom through his reputation. Predictably, Sun Bin was eventually credited with being a descendant of the legendary Sun Wu, whose wisdom clearly ran in the family.

The fact is that the way of recording Ancient Chinese texts, using the strips of bamboo mentioned above, is extremely conducive to this sort of textual tradition. Single strips of bamboo contain no more than one or a few lines of text; the strips are held together with string. As the string breaks or decays, texts become jumbled, with later editors often totally unable to restore them to their original order. From our point of view, it is shockingly easy for lines to be added or lost. One of the frustrating things about the *Sun Zi* is that much of its metatext - its "next"s and "therefore"s - don't actually make any sense, and that not enough serious philological study has been devoted to restoring the text. Given its many uncertainties, we are on far safer ground to assume that the work is the product of many hands over a long period (roughly the 4th and early 3rd centuries BC) than that it is the work of a single, legendary military genius.

So where does that leave us with regard to your question? Why was the *Sun Zi* written? Who benefitted from writing it and spreading it around?

Here we find a useful parallel in the tradition of Ancient Greek literature. In Greece, as in China, military treatises did not develop in a vaccuum, when a particular military mastermind decided to commit his wisdom to the ages. Rather, they began to appear in an era that saw a general shift in notions of learning, in which oral tradition and abstract thought began to gave way to practical written works that allowed knowledge in discreet fields of expertise to be replicated and taught. In Greece, as in China, the art of war was swept up in this movement by the conditions of the age: in Greece, the hegemonic wars of the Classical period (of which the Peloponnesian War seems to have been especially important as a driving force), and in China, the prolonged and devastating Warring States period. In both cultures, the earliest written works of philosophy had appeared some time before, and kickstarted a tradition of recording advanced thought for the benefit of others. It is not surprising to find Chinese catalogues grouping the *Sun Zi* in the Daoist (that is, philosophical) tradition. It and the many other military treatises that appeared soon after all fit into the same new approach to the spread of knowledge. The purpose of the text was to teach, so that future generations facing military problems would not have to reinvent the wheel.

In the season 7 episode Much Apu About Nothing, we find out what Homer's actual paycheck looks like.

[It starts with a bear wandering Springfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkV_ztynYDM), and Homer leading a group to city hall demanding protection from bears. This causes Quimby to start a "bear patrol", and the following dialogue:

>Homer: Woo-hoo! A perfect day. Zero bears and one big fat hairy paycheck. [Homer opens.] Hey! How come my pay is so low? Bear patrol tax! This is an outrage! It’s the biggest tax increase in history!

>Lisa: Actually, Dad, it’s the smallest tax increase in history.

>Homer: Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer tax.

>Lisa: That’s the home-owner tax.

>Homer: Well, anyway, I’m still outraged.

The brief glimpse notes a "net pay" for 40 hours of 362.19 (and an added bear tax of $5).
Calculating backwards with other taxes, the pre-tax earnings are $479.60, or
**exactly** $11.99 per hour.

The episode aired in 1996. Based on inflation, this makes a modern pay rate of $20.78 per hour.


It also would help to know the value of the house. The creator [Matt Groening](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/matt-groening-reveals-the-location-of-the-real-springfield-60583379/)
confirmed in an interview the Springfield in question is modeled after Springfield, Oregon,
so we could technically look at house prices there, but an episode shortly after 
read "The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours" as the chalkboard gag; 
it's hence not the best approach to consider the location to be canon. Also, we have an idea of the value of the house from the episodes themselves.

In the episode Lisa's First Word (season 4, initially aired 1992) it is revealed that
in 1984 that Grandpa Simpson sold his house (which he had gotten due to a crooked 1950s
quiz show) in order to pay for the down payment of the new house, of $15,000. In that
time 20% for a down payment was quite typical, so let's suppose a house value of
$75,000.

This is somewhat low for the US at the time -- the [average value was $89,400](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/realestate/rate-fears-spur-building-and-buying.html) -- but
keep in mind that the house is depicted as part of the low end of the market for the episode,
plus Springfield itself has a strong chance of depressed property values ([witness the size of their potholes](https://frinkiac.com/gif/S04E12/376759/384901/)).

In any case, if we back-date the paycheck with inflation, Homer had a $7.94 per hour paycheck once he took the nuclear power plant job, which comes out to $16515.20 pre-tax per year. 1984 was a bad year for buying houses with a 13.88% interest rate, so the actual amount per month would be something like $700/month.

This leaves about $6100 pre-tax which in 2021 dollars is roughly $16,000. This would be in line with a 1984 estimate from the Bureau of Labor with $20,531 for a 4-person family (this is before Maggie was born) and 31% put into housing (leaving $14,266).

(DIGRESSION AS TO WHY 1984 WAS SO BAD A YEAR FOR HOME BUYING)

The US was just getting off its worst inflation spike in its history. In brief: in the 1972-1974 period in the United States both food and energy prices rose (there was a Saudi Arabian-led oil embargo on countries thought to support Israel in the Yom Kippur War) and a second food price hike kicked off more inflation from the 1978-1980 range. (There’s some mess in the early 1970s involving Nixon wage-price controls but I’m skipping over that.) The end result was an average inflation of 6.85% over the decade, eye-popping compared to the prior two decades (2.38 and 2.56 percent respectively) and at some points the inflation reached double digits.

Inflation was bad enough during the decade that in 1974 there was a WIN (Whip Inflation Now) campaign led by US President Ford [complete with novelty merchandise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_inflation_now#/media/File:%22WIN%22_earrings.JPG).

When Ronald Reagan became president of the United States in 1981, inflation was near 10 percent, and credit for bringing it down goes mostly to Paul Volcker (chairman of the Federal Reserve System, appointed by Carter) who cranked the federal funds rate all the way to an eye-popping 20%, a level it has never been at before or since. (Housing interest rate was at 18.45%.) It took a while for new builds to happen and the housing interest rate to drop, so it was still high in 1984.

(END DIGRESSION)

Now, there's one more thing I haven't accounted for: The Simpsons had a adjustable-rate mortgage (as revealed in No Loan Again, Naturally, season 20, when the subprime crisis hit). They were possible in 1984: adjustable-rate mortgages were approved by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1980 (state savings and loans could issue them before that year), specifically because of sluggish housing. (In 1984, [they accounted for 68 percent of new mortgages](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/04/business/mortgage-rates-up-in-july.html).) This turned out not to be so much a problem because the rates [started to drop more or less continuously](https://infogram.com/1peg7nvdnl9e9qtm75ryenpw2msll1ewld0) up into the 1990s.

This means the Simpsons would normally be fine in their finances with the part of Homer's salary remaining (as their situation would improve over time). Of course, Homer is not necessarily responsible with money, which is why (due to events in the No Loan Again, Naturally episode I already mentioned) Flanders now owns the house, with the Simpsons as renters.

Man, oh man, Suffice to say, finding sources on a niche topic like this were NOT easy, but they do exist! At least a few Dermatologic studies were published after the war and I was able to find a few of them, both of which focus on Acne in the Pacific Theater. While prior to the war acne was considered a nuisance more than something serious, American servicemen in the Pacific were found to be developing what came to be called "tropical acne", an extreme manifestation of the condition that could be physically debilitating and symptoms of which included "large pustules, draining sinuses and extensive, disfiguring scars,frequently [keloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid)". To be sure, it isn't that the breakouts themselves were being caused by the men simply being in the Pacific - the studies indicate that a history of acne previous to service was a major factor - but various factors from the wartime environment, including "increase in vasomotor activity, caused by the heat, plus the inadequate toilet facilities" all contributed to severely affect men who had been sent to the Pacific. Being unable to clean, minor outbreaks could become infected, and many cases seem to have been serious enough that that the afflicted men were unable to continue serving on the front and had to be evacuated for more medical treatment, and many declared permanently unfit for duty.

Not all men who suffered breakouts were necessarily suffering from such acute symptoms though, and all in all, acne seems to have been one of the more common issues soldiers in the Pacific theater faced. As far as dermatological issues, at least, it was second only to tropical skin disease/fungal infections, with somewhere between 20 to 30 percent of all patients hospitalized for skin issues suffering from tropical acne.

As far as treatment goes, doctors found that standard treatments were generally quite ineffective and remaining in tropical conditions would generally cause a worsening. Attempts to use penicillin showed little real result while evacuation to cooler environments alone could cause real improvement in the condition, so that seems to have been the standard procedure.

So in short, someone else can weigh in on other theaters, but at least in the Pacific, Acne was a serious issue faced.

Edit: I was able to find one other source, which doesn't add to much to what has been said here beyond the [small addition here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/69dal7/was_painful_acne_ever_an_issue_in_ww2_if_i_slept/dh63f6r/) but does note that as far as the European theater goes "[acne] was a condition of no consequence".

Edit II: The book also includes a picture of tropical acne if you want to see what we're talking about. I don't want to link directly to it for the RES people so you don't open it automatically by accident, so scroll on down to [Illustration 85 in the Table of Contents.](http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/internalmedicinevoliii/)

I may actually have a relevant answer to this! For full disclosure, I'm not a historian and this is my first response to an AskHistorians thread, so if I mess anything up I hope my post is justly smote.

If I'm allowed to rephrase your question a bit to give it a broader context, it seems that what you're asking, more generally, is: **did soldiers in WWII, in the course of being soldiers, find themselves in conditions that led to painful blemishes or skin irritations?**

While this might not specifically mean acne as you're imagining it, the answer is, undoubtedly, yes! My grandfather, now deceased, served in the 6th Emergency Rescue Squadron, one of [seven squadrons of the USAAF](http://3rders.com/3rdERShist.htm) (the United States' air division before the creation of the USAF in 1947) designed for autonomous rescue during WWII. [Here's some brief verification of him to validate the source.](http://i.imgur.com/SRp2sg8.jpg) In looking at your question, I recalled a story he once told of a soldier laying on his stomach on a bed who was receiving injections to treat a pilonidal cyst, to which my grandfather asked "what's that?" and the soldier responded, "it's a thing on your butt!" Unfortunately, without any sort of documentation of this treatment or exchange, it's purely anecdotal for the purposes of your question.

However, I can do better!

As it turns out, in researching more specifics on what pilonidal cysts are, I discovered that it was actually such a common occurrence during World War II that it had a name: **Jeep Riders' Disease** (or just Jeep Disease). 

So before we get ahead of ourselves, what exactly is pilonidal disease? According to the [American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons](https://www.fascrs.org/patients/disease-condition/pilonidal-disease), pilonidal disease is a skin infection in the crease of the buttocks, close to the coccyx, which can become an inflamed, painful cyst and may also become infected. I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to see how this could be bad for soldiers - discomfort and pain while moving or sitting would be present, and the treatment, which would likely involve [phenol injections](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/192668-treatment?pa=FOK0p2BPH2xBy%2BPOS8DkPqlB0jg7Xdz8WxSQfLU%2BhMB3vecAyiYCl8NXlVpBhcdpLYSTPqBPITs28e%2FfjVymGRgdh0IYUyErgfy%2FYxjHzUE%3D#d9) or lancing and drainage, could leave victims bedridden for days. There's also considerations for the potential for infection and sepsis - soldiers are going to be moving through dirty, hot environments that are going to aggravate their condition by sweating and the inability to bathe regularly. Though the initial question seems to be one of beauty, I think it's imperative to consider the implications of skin conditions that won't just be unsightly, but taking soldiers away from active duty. 

Which brings us to the question of prevalence. Was this common? Most articles I've found, such as [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039610909001248) seem to lead back to the same place: A February, 1944 article published in the Southern Medical Journal called [Jeep Disease: Pilonidal Disease of Mechanized Warfare](https://sma.org/southern-medical-journal/article/jeep-disease-pilonidal-disease-of-mechanized-warfare/). Although I can't personally access the article, other articles citing it make the claim that about about 80,000 soldiers during WWII were hospitalized for pilonidal disease due to long and frequently-rough jeep rides which put pressure and irritation on the coccyx of soldiers, hence the name Jeep Riders' Disease. Indeed, a [study that occurred from 2005 to 2011](https://tinyurl.com/lo2gf89) found that, even today, pilonidal disease retains a significant association with military personnel. Even though my grandfather's story will never be the primary source that I wish it were, it seems like he may not have been too far off the mark about this condition affecting soldiers during WWII.

So, to get back to your original question: Was acne ever an issue in WWII? To the degree we're talking about facial blemishes or irritating marks, I can't speak. But if we ask more broadly about the kinds of conditions that soldiers worked and fought in, could we say that they contributed to health issues, especially of the skin, which could impact service? Definitely. In the case I've described here, perhaps the soldiers have a great complexion, but it's what you *don't see* that's the real problem. While I find the question of whether acne as you imagine it would be common a good one, I think there's definitely enough information to say that there were skin problems in World War II, caused by the conditions soldiers were in, that were not only unusual or annoying, but downright painful and dangerous.
Short answer: Yes, it was an issue.

Long answer: Acne, and skin disease in general, were evaluated in new recruits and draftees when they first reported for service. However, there was no official policy on whether to accept or reject someone based on their skin disease(s). Many doctors, especially early in the war, leaned towards accepting those with diseases. This accepting policy would prove to be somewhat of a mistake, because it became apparent that these admitted men were a large burden on Army dispensaries and hospital facilities. This burden was amplified when deployed into Tropical areas of combat, further reducing the combat effectiveness of the afflicted soldiers.

Acne in and of itself was not used as justification to turn people away however. Of 20,000 candidates for induction at U.S. Army Recruiting and Induction Station, Tacoma, Washington, 248 had acne vulgaris, and 0 were rejected.

Going back to the Tropics, acne (and other skin diseases caused by the tropical environment) was a significant issue. 

From a survey at Fitzsimons General Hospital:

>"A typical history revealed that the patient had had some trouble with blackheads and acneiform lesions when he was 15 to 18 years of age, but none since, including his period of training in the Zone of Interior. Trouble began, however, some 6 months after his arrival in the Southwest Pacific Area or some other tropical area. The first manifestation was the development of large, tender, inflammatory cystic lesions on the shoulder and back, which made it impossible to carry a pack. After he was treated for a considerable time by the battalion surgeon, sometimes in a forward hospital and occasionally in a general hospital, the patient was evacuated to the Zone of Interior."

The severe acne developed by men in the Southwest Pacific Area and India-China-Burma theater was very painful and risked life-threatening infections should a lesion burst and be exposed. the best course of action became immediately sending the men to the Zone of Interior (i.e. back to the U.S.) when they developed acne too severe to be combat effective, as military hospitals were not equipped to deal with it.

Hello everyone,

Like any big city, Rome was both a single idea and infinitely splintered reality - each street part of a system, every neighborhood a building block of the metropolis. And as in any big city, the ways its inhabitants experienced part and whole must have varied. Unfortunately, despite all the vivid detail provided by the letters of Cicero and the epigrams of Martial and Juvenal, our literary sources really tell us only how Roman elites liked to think and talk about life in Rome - potentially a very different thing from lived experience. Archaeology brings us closer to the sweat and dirt, but often merely in the sense of establishing the essentials of the physical setting. Your question, in other words, ain't easy to answer. But I'll take a wild stab at it. 

Rome was indeed big - by ancient standards, almost unimaginably so, to the point that it strained even the High Empire's ability to requisition resources and funnel them into Italy. But for its size, the city was quite dense. Most Romans famously lived in insulae - apartment blocks - three or four stories high, built cheek-by-jowl along every street and alley (building regulations stipulating space between apartments were blithely ignored). The five or so square miles eventually enclosed by the Aurelian Walls contained the great bulk of Rome's million inhabitants. Almost no part of the city was more than a few miles from any other part; and if you knew where you were going, you could probably walk almost anywhere in little more than an hour. Unless you want to count the litters occasionally hired by members of the elite, there was no public transportation (with the exception of construction carts, in fact, all wheeled traffic was banned from the streets for most of the day). But that didn't matter, since from any given neighborhood, a sufficiently determined pedestrian could walk almost anywhere worth going in a relatively short time. 

Although we have no way of proving (save by analogy with early modern European cities), it is likely that most Romans, like most premodern urbanites, worked near their residences. Local ties were strong in Rome, as the existence of the 265 vici (neighborhood organizations, each with its own magistrates and public cult) suggests. (One might also point to the odd festival of the October Horse, during which representatives of two neighborhoods competed for the head of the eponymous animal.) It should be remembered, however, that the great festivals of the Roman calendar brought all Romans into the ritual centers of the city, as did the combats in the Colosseum and the races in the Circus Maximus. Although Romans probably spent most of their lives in their neighborhoods, they would have never have forgotten that they were residents of a single city, and could never have doubted that their city was the greatest on Earth.

Ovid certainly thought so. "There is another good ground, the gladiatorial shows," he wrote, continuing:

> The watcher of wounds often has
had it himself. While he is talking, or touching a hand, or studying entries, asking which one is ahead after his bet has been laid, wounded himself, he groans to feel the shaft of the arrow; he is a victim himself, no more spectator, but show.

...but because we are historians here, we have to consider the context of this particular quote:

> There is no need for a code of finger-signals or nodding. Sit as close as
you like; no one will stop you at all. In fact, you will have to sit close – that’s
one of the rules, at a race track. Whether she likes it or not, contact is part of
the game.

>

> Any excuse will do: why do you think you have hands? 

In other words: when men sexually assault women and women get mad, it's the men who are the *real* victims.

Ovid must be writing satire here, right?

In point of fact, though, the designers of Roman amphitheatres and other venues for games, and (usually) the people who ran the games *did* worry about spectator safety. Most basically, this could include awnings at the top of the amphitheatre (or other venue for spectacle, like the circus) to protect the crowd from the sun. Making sure the arena was well-constructed was another priority.

At least, it was if you were not how Tacitus presents Atilius of Fidenae in 27 CE:

> He  neither placed  the  foundations  under  the  structure  through  to  solid  ground,  nor  did  he build the wooden framework with strong joints...He undertook that work for sordid reward.

And the crowd paid the price:

>  At  the  same  time,  the  building rushes  inward  or  is  poured  out  into  the  exterior  parts.  It  drags  headlong  and buries an immense force of people, including both those having been attentive to the spectacle and those who were standing around the amphitheater. 

> Those men indeed,  whom  the  beginning  of  the  destruction  had  crushed  to  death,  escaped torture, as if by a kind twist of fate. More pitiable were those whom life had not yet deserted with part of their body having been ripped from them

Much attention was also paid to protecting spectators from the animals brought in--a particular priority, since those sitting closest to the action were the highest-ranking. In addition to the high walls around the arena floor, there were often safety nets stretching even higher above them, to prevent the most agile of animals from leaping over them. But! Even in such an event, archers were standing by to kill the animals--apparently they were very good shots (and very, *very* trustworthy), since they were trusted not to kill the senators by accident...or on purpose.

In general, there were also soldiers stationed in the amphitheatre to prevent riots. Except apparently Nero *liked* riots.

And on the subject of bad emperors, or at least emperors that writers did not like: multiple sources repeat rumors that during the reign of Caligula, even just walking to your seat (or standing place if you were enslaved) could be hazardous to your health. Per Dio:

> The same trait of cruelty led [Caligula] once, when
there was a shortage of condemned criminals to be given to the wild beasts, to
order that some of the mob standing near the benches should be seized and
thrown to them; and to prevent the possibility of their making an outcry or
uttering any reproaches, he first caused their tongues to be cut out.

Suetonius adds that Caligula's motive was *the animals were hungry and he didn't want to pay to feed them.*

...Fortunately, this is *probably* character assassination rather than actual assassination.

Probably.

~~

Most of the translated quotes are from Alison Futrell, *The Roman Games*, although she took some of them from elsewhere.

ETA: Apparently it is not clear that the first bit is from the *Ars Amatoria*, which means "The Art of Love." I am providing a more realistic explanation to "men touching women in unwanted ways" than "Cupid's arrows."

Thank you!
You can listen to the BBC Radio 3 discussion where McKellen publically came out [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12012.shtml), in conversation with the (very conservative) editor of the *Telegraph*, Peregrine Worsthorne. The first discussion of McKellen's coming out I can find is [a profile of McKellen in the British newspaper *The Independent* from February 20th, 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/writings/activism/880220independent.htm), which is preserved on Ian McKellen's webpage as his writing (which it clearly is not). McKellen's coming out is portrayed as political activism in opposition to 'Clause 28', mooted legislation forbidding local governments to promote the idea that homosexual relationships might be normal. McKellen became involved in activism against Clause 28 in early January. Maybe one could say that the future Gandalf was trying to tell parliamentarians: you shall not pass...this bill. (Despite McKellen's activism, it became law in May)

According to the summary of McKellen's activism about Clause 28 in the *Independent* article:

>On Sunday, 24 January, he walked on stage and on to television screens at the Laurence Olivier Awards. "The greatest surprise", says one of the invited audience, "was the roar of approval that greeted him when he mentioned Clause 28". The next day he shepherded a host of stars, and one baby, on stage at the Playhouse, before journalists and Lords bussed down the Embankment for the occasion. The radio and television blitz followed, and by the end of the week homosexuality and censorship were issues of national interest in a way unknown since the late Sixties.  

>To achieve this, McKellen played a very private card. One friend describes it: "Coming out is the essence of gay liberation, and Ian understands that. There are only two or three other working actors who have done it, because it is dangerous. But he knew it was time to stand up and be counted." Though he described himself as gay in a World Service programme on 19 January, the declaration was made to most of Britain on Radio 3's Third Ear, on 27 January.

>The occasion was a spirited argument with Peregrine Worsthorne. It provoked a remark about "disgusting homosexual practices" from the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and a query laden with innocence from McKellen: did Mr Worsthorne mean the Garrick when he spoke about gay clubs? The following Sunday's leader did the Stop Clause 28 campaign no harm at all.

Unfortunately, the archives of the London *Telegraph* do not appear to go back more than 20 years, and Peregrine Worsthorne's response to McKellen's coming out in his paper is not accessible online as far as I can tell.

Additionally, McKellen wrote a piece for [*Capital Gay* magazine summarising his rather eventful 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/activism/activism_coming_out.htm). In it, he essentially claims that his homosexuality was not particularly a surprise to anyone in his life, given the theatrical circles he moved in:

>That I had actually come out probably surprised me more than my being gay can have shocked any listener who knew my work. Indeed, some of them have written to say that they'd known I was gay for years and couldn't care less. When I told my step-mother, soon after, she said the same. My friends had always known; so had my fellow actors, because backstage there are few secrets. But I'd always avoided saying I was gay to the media - even to the gay press - insisting that my private life was my own. My complacency had involved nothing more embarrassing than the occasional white lie about not being married - I was never, though, one to talk about looking for the right girl and relishing parenthood.

In terms of reaction in the US, the first mention I can find on Factiva is a reference in the *Boston Globe* to McKellen, in April 1988, winning the Norton Award for the best achievements in Boston-area theatre, for his one-man show, 'Ian McKellen Acting Shakespeare'. Giving a speech, accepting the award, according to a *Boston Globe* story by Jeff McLaughlin:

>With regard to the denouement of McKellen's remarks -- in which he recounted his decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality and work for tolerance and rights for gay people in Britain -- not even Elliot Norton knew what was coming. Norton said, in a Wednesday note, that McKellen had asked for at least 20 minutes to speak, but did not discuss his topic beforehand. "But he had planned it," Norton wrote, "to the point of writing out his whole talk and, in the half hour or so before the ceremony, studying part of it before a dressing-room mirror."

>McKellen's speech may well approach historic status, and it certainly will become part of Boston theater folklore, since no one had thought ahead of time to set up a tape recorder.

One journalist's reference to McKellen from the point of view of someone not particularly inclined towards progressive views came from a review of the TV documentary Open Space on BBC2; Martin Cropper in *The Times* said of *Open Space* that:

>Open Space (BBC2) illustrated the condition [of homosexuality] with some predictable examples: the 'spanking judge', for instance, who resigned his recordership after exposure in the tabloids; the 'out' lesbian who enlisted in the Wrens specifically to meet like-minded adults, without realizing that the armed forces are the only sphere where such activity has ever been illegal. The most intelligent comment was Ian McKellen's plea for respectable homosexuals to help erode prejudice by declaring themselves publically - a move which would, however, posit a different society.

>As one has come to expect from access-television, the historical perspective was on the flimsy side. In this country at least, the 'homophobic' backlash started years before Aids had been heard of, for the obvious reason that some 'straights' had had it to here with the hectoring aggression of homosexual propaganda.

Another reference to Ian McKellen discussing his homosexuality comes from an article in the *Sunday Times* about the filming of a ITV Phil Donahue special (i.e., with the American talk show host filming a British version of the show): 

>On Wednesday the subject was clause 28. On the panel were two straights, Sir Rhodes Boyson and the Rev David Rushworth-Smith, and two gay actors, Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman, who plays Colin in EastEnders. Noisy claques in the audience booed Boyson and the vicar, and cheered the actors.

>Donahue had been told that the reserved British would never speak out; luckily many present were Americans who can utter words like ``sexuality'' without a blush.

>The debate goes like this. A fat woman is horrified to be surrounded by these homosexuals; a pigtailed young man says he's heterosexual but live and let live; a lesbian mother with two teenage children is rounded on by a man in favour of "the normal family unit''; Donahue asks who is to say what is normal? And so on. When Boyson says, "God created man and woman'' and McKellen rejoins, "and together they created a homosexual'' such a sequitur is rare.

>A grey-haired English woman declares with dignity, "I am the mother of a gay son'', but we hear no more from her: it is time for a commercial break. After it, Donahue has found another old lady. She says: "People who are born like that, it's like being a cripple isn't it? I mean they can't help it] Well, it's sad they're born, isn't it?''

>Nobody in the audience knows whether to laugh or cry.

Ian McKellen was not the first theatre actor to come out as gay, as Simon Callow had come out in a book he wrote in 1984. In early June 1988, Callow mentions McKellen in a Diary piece written in *The Times*:

>The latest such event has been inspired by that fumbling piece of legislation, Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill. To raise money for the possible victims of the clause, an extraordinary group of artists Simon Rattle, Dame Judi Dench, Mike Gambon and many others across the spectrum of the performing arts are appearing at the Piccadilly theatre this Sunday. The event has been largely inspired and organized by Ian McKellen. It was his cheeky notion to call the show Promoting Homosexuality (echoing the ambiguous phrasing of the clause itself) but the intention behind the show is not polemical; it simply represents the anxiety of a large number of performers about a piece of law that affects us all.

Elsewhere, most of the references to Ian McKellen in Factiva from 1988 refer to his career continuing as per usual, which makes me suspect that nobody into theatre in England (or Boston) in the 1980s was enormously surprised, or cared particularly that a leading actor was gay; he starred as (the heterosexual) Profumo in the 1989 film *Scandal*. Ultimately, McKellen was knighted by the Queen in 1991; coming out in 1988 didn't stop him from symbolically being admitted to the establishment.

Nonetheless, anti-homosexual prejudice in the wake of the AIDS epidemic had a support base within the Conservative Party, not least with Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, who in a 1987 conference speech said that "Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay...all of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated!" Clause 28 remained on the books until the Labor government voted it out in March 2003. 

McKellen relates in the *Capital Gay* piece discussed Clause 28 with Tories at Westminister: 

>At Westminster, I met our lawmakers — and remembered their words: The Minister — "I don't understand why young homosexuals need their own clubs — why can't they mix with everybody else of their own age?"  The Whip in the Commons — "I'm sorry about Section 28 — it's just a bit of red meat thrown to our right-wing wolves."  The Whip in the Lords — "I'm sorry about Section 28 — but you appreciate my job is just to get our chaps to vote the right way."

Hello people from /r/All, /r/Popular, /r/Stormfront, and also non-redditors lured by the Slate article!

Please be aware that, as is discussed in the article, our moderation policies here are very strict. While we do tend to relax them somewhat for [META] threads, few quick housecleaning notes are in order.

We are happy to discuss this piece, and even debate some of the finer points on which people disagree, or else it wouldn't have been posted: 

* **But**, the basic rules still apply here. If you can't say it nicely, then don't say it at all. We will remove uncivil comments no matter what position they take. If you see something like that, please *don't* respond. Hit the report button and a mod will handle it, we prefer that you don't help things escalate. Rude and disingenuous posting will have consequences.

* Also, please **read the piece before you comment**. If you can't take the time to read it before you decide to disagree, why should we take the time to respond to you? If you raise a point which is addressed in the article and you don't at least reference the fact you disagree with how it is dealt with there, you probably won't get a response, and might simply get removed as clutter.

* On a similar note, do give a quick scan through the the comments before you do your own. Your question might already have been addressed, so we thank you for not making us write the same response a half-dozen times.

* Oh, and this goes without saying, but if you actually are gonna argue the Holocaust didn't happen, it saves us time if you just write at the top "Please ban me, thanks" so we don't need to bother reading the rest of your bullshit.

Cheers, 

the Mods
Awaking from my slumber to say great job on this article. And thanks again to /u/eternalkerri and /u/NMW for convincing me that an  "anything goes" moderation policy was not a good plan in the early days.

6 years you guys have been kickin and tossin and cleaning up comment responses, and i've never thanked you. Thanks for building a fantastic public space. Love coming here.
A well-crafted statement. Well done!
> Clarifying, as Zuckerberg later did, that Facebook would remove posts for “advocating violence” will never be effective for a simple reason. Any attempt to make Nazism palatable again is a call for violence. 

What's more, removing only the pro-nazi posts which are explicit calls to violence assists them on making Nazism more palatable. That is effectively acting as editors, removing content that might repel an otherwise susceptible reader.
Sometimes its dissapointing checking out a topic you're interested in but then seeing that its just all deleted comments but i prefer having no information than bad information. Cheers to the moderators for doing such good work.
Once when I submitted a question it was denied. The mod who responded to me indicated why it was denied and then gave an explanation which touched upon my initial post and answered the question I had submitted. I have long since forgotten the question, I have not forgotten how I was treated and how a mod, on a *heavily* moderated sub, took their own time to answer me themselves.

Keep it up.
I'm not sure how relevant that this is, but I'm a mod on /r/Judaism, and we also don't bother debating Holocaust deniers.  We just ban them on the spot.

As far as we're concerned, it's not a substantive argument, just a false veneer of rigor intended to give antisemitism the look of legitimacy.

EDIT: I keep seeing messages pop up from the app, which, when I go here, have been deleted.  I can't read the messages, but I'm assuming that they're antisemitic garbage which either the mod team, or an algorithm of theirs, is deleting.  Either way: good job; keep it up!
Thank you, that was a really great article, and did a fantastic job of putting into words some of the conclusions about this kind of rhetoric I've come to recently. I hope more places choose to moderate themselves this way.
Thanks very much to all the moderators on this subreddit; those who put up with so much, for so long, for so little recognition.
I was glad to see the caveat defining revisionist history. The term is often used as a shorthand for a baseless or politically-motivated theory but the process of examining, re-examining, and problematizing the historical narrative is a bedrock principle of the field. 
Even typing this i feel as if i shouldn't be making a top level comment. which is great evidence of how well the mods have consistently enforced the rules over the years. 

Other subreddits come and go but i feel this one will be around for a long time to come. 

thanks for the great work!


I saw the twitter thread from one of the mods here, and it was really great seeing the professionalism in this sub shown to a wider audience. 
[deleted]
It popped up on my facebook. I immediately shared. 

It does a great job at explaining how extremists use "just asking questions" to legitimize nazi-ism. 
I was at F8 (Facebook's annual conference) this spring in a professional capacity, and Zuck spent a few minutes discussing Facebook's responsibilities with respect to "fake news" and several other Facebook reps spent at least an hour on the topic in the room I was in. By the end of the conference, I was ready to slap him.

The particular that bothered me the most was Facebook's new stated policy about untrue content. They talked about how they were working with fact-checking organizations like Politifact and Snopes to identify news content that was verifiably untrue. Then they talked about how they were using Facebook's algorithm to de-emphasize such content from identified bad-faith publishers. For instance, a Sandy Hook denialist article posted or shared might get flagged and be 80% less likely to show up on another user's feed. But if we've got the capability to identify this as a bad-faith and dangerous argument, why should it appear on *anyone's* news feed? Why should the corporate Facebook page for the bad-faith content creator not be banned or removed? They've gone through all this trouble to painstakingly identify abusive content, and then *not remove it*. What's the point of that?
Well written!

You really nailed it with the part that it is easy to make a short false statement but hard to fully explain why it is and correct it with facts (paraphrasing here).

I always eventually feel a sense of 'mental fatigue' and later on frustration when trying to accommodate similar situations IRL .
Just commenting to show my support. In my opinion, strongly moderated forums are the best kind of forum, and this subreddit is perhaps the best example of that.

Secondly, the article is absolutely correct. Giving these people a platform is not acceptable.
This sub has the most iron clad moderation team, and I really appreciate it <3 

^please ^dont ^remove ^my ^comment
I have the utmost regard for the job you guys do here.

As a mod of /r/changemyview  (another heavily moderated sub), it's interesting to see the similarities and differences.  

While, like you, we have a zero-tolerance policy toward hostility and rudeness directed at other users, we do allow the discussion of lots of frankly horrible opinions.  We can't change someone's racist opinion if we can't discuss it.

Even holocaust denial is potentially fair game, as long as the OP appears to be posting in good faith.  

[I'm not saying that I think you should, especially since there's no really valid historical question to ask that starts from that assumption.]

Of course, like you guys, we get accused of bias from both sides, which is ironic.  If we remove a post denying the holocaust where every top level post presents an argument for how we know the holocaust actually happened, which side are we biased in favor of?

Anyway, congrats on the well-deserved attention!
Bravo. As a frequent lurker here, I really appreciate the work your team puts in. Let me join those in giving thanks for makimg this one of the best subs on reddit!
>In this endeavor, deniers focus on many minor and obscure details and leave out crucial context. It takes them little effort to formulate a wrong assertion, but it takes historians a long time and a lot of words to refute one. Our early attempts to engage on these points have shown that length and nuance do not play well on the internet and do not interest the deniers. The point of JAQing off is not to debate facts. It’s to have an audience hear denialist lies in the first place. Allowing their talking points to stand in public helps sow the seeds of doubt, even if only to one person in 10,000. 

This section in particular reminded me of [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVkJvieaOA) of the video series [The Alt-Right Playbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xGawJIseNY&list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ). The whole series is well worth a watch, I think, if you're going to consider engaging in political debates, both online and out in the real world. It's really helped me step back and reconsider / change the way I interact with some of these political types by getting a better understanding of the big picture and how these kinds of things play out in the long haul.

One of the key ideas coming out of the series, at least to me, is that ultimately some of the best things you can do to defeat these kinds of toxic ideas are to just *don't engage* and *don't give them a platform*. The approach AskHistorians mod team is taking here is definitely on the right track, I think; kudos! :)
Fantastic article. The AskHistorians mods are by far the best mods on this site for quality content (HQGifs mods might be a close second).  
Sometimes in relation to current events, I see questions come through AskHistorians that are ... leading questions. To obfuscate, let's say that Borogravia is meddling with the Clacks Towers in Uberwald, and that's in the news. I have seen questions pop up during some times like "How were the perpetrators of the Zlobenian Genocide against Borogravian Treacle Mines dealt with after the War of the Year of the Sideways Leech?" or "How was it received when it was discovered that Ankh-Morpork was Using Zlobenian Money to buy Land for Clacks Towers in Borogravia?"

For things like that, is there any way to detect and prevent brigading of "whataboutism" posts, when current events make bad PR for someone who has the capability to do "social media shaping"?
I agree in principle with the concept of deplatformng certain narrow lines of argumentation. I have serious concerns about the actual humans that actually run Facebook being able to implement such a policy in a way that will not slide into direct manipulation of public perception to influence the populace. 

There are many more examples of topics about which one can have a legitimate good faith debate than there are topics like Holocaust denialism. I don’t trust Facebook to be able to reliably differentiate between them. 
Does anyone know of studies done about how ideas like holocaust denial spread online and how they're influenced by being banned or being debated with? Are there ever circumstances where engaging with them is useful in order to expose falsehood?
TIL about JAQing off. I had no idea this was even a thing. Feigning ignorance to open up the door to Holocaust denial and sowing the seeds of doubt is truly insidious
I was made aware people were saying things about me.

I approve of these things.
Oh, so this is the reason I've blocked r/history and kept this one 
Thank you so much for the work you do! I was raised by a holocaust denier who is rabidly antisemitic and bigoted in other ways. Our high school history class didn't have much time to cover the holocaust and I never learned more about it in a classroom environment. (Our teacher tried, but the class was big and unruly.) I'm not a historian, so I'm not always sure where to look for more information on everything I missed. This sub is wonderful for learning more and hearing about books, etc. to dig further. 

And for anyone asking, I've argued with my father over and over about it while even showing sources cited. He doesn't care. There's no convincing some people. The best we can do is save our energy to educate people who actually want to learn. 
I agree 100% with the stance taken in this subreddit. The internet has fundamentally failed when it comes to addressing stuff like this. I think this approach will help stop these ideas from spreading but how do we engage the people who already have gone to the dark side? Facebook and reddit aren't the place for that, but surely we should try to do something? Anyone know of any successes engaging directly?
I'm reading here all the time, usually not responding. Just having fun reading.  
On a personal note - I'm a jew and it's heartwarming to see, thank you.
>Conversation is impossible if one side refuses to acknowledge the basic premise that facts are facts.  

These are words to live by. I just thought of a couple people in my life. 
Denying the Holocaust is to historians what "not believing" in evolution is to biologists. Come to think of it, beliving in a flat earth to astronomers and physicists... Why do we have such a problem of ignorance in such an  information packed and knowledge driven modern world? Have we always been like this?
I've said it to people before and Facebook is just a reactive company they won't do anything till it blows up in their faces unlike you guys on this sub who are 100% proactive and I thank you for that. 
I think this is a good policy. I'd also want to remove similar bullshit like "was the moon landing real, historically?"

But have we ever done a thread about the history of Holocaust denial itself?

No one would have been stupid enough to dare not believe the Holocaust happened until at least like... Well really, the last few years. Only now that the witnesses to it have recently passed.


I would prefer to have all ideas in the open where the lousy and historically inaccurate ideas can be destroyed publicly for all to see.  To me that is a more effective approach than censorship.   I don't want to hide evil, I wish to confront it and defeat it. 
I don't know how I've gone this long without ever hearing "JAQing off" before, but I'm glad I have now. 
This sub is a shining beacon of hope in a dark and confusing world. Thank you.
Wait, people actually don't think the Holocaust happened? How? Did...did WW2 not happen to/for them or what?
YouTube is another website I wish would take a page from this sub. So much pro-Nazi propaganda on there it's ridiculous. It honestly might be worse than Facebook
[deleted]
I absolutely approve of this article, the ideas behind it, and the moderation in this subreddit.

Thank you for what you do, and keep up the good work, cause this is one of my favourite subreddits.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, SO MUCH for this article! So. On. Point. Found myself screaming out loud, "Yes!" several times while reading.

Sorry, I'll calm down. But thank you, and STAY VIGILANT, on this and related matters. Cheers! :) 
I love this sub and I love this article for acknowledging  what so few people and companies want to acknowledge. You can be calling for violence and hate even without explicitly saying so. I work as an online  moderator as a career and I see it all the time. An account posts some supposedly harmless meme or something associated with hate, racism, or trolling... And if you don't remove it they will invariably escalate into worse and worse behavior until they get banned. (or the platform just let's them run rampant as long as they don't specifically say to attack people... This is Twitters strategy, and it clearly doesn't work.)

These silicon valley companies need to step up and take responsibility for their huge, global platforms. They simply NEED more trained human review and intervention. Their flawed bots are clearly not up to the job they've been tasked with. 
I generally agree with the points made in the article. What I'd like to know is a mod's thoughts about the people on the boundaries: people with good intentions who might be put off by the somewhat jarring experience of reading this sub for the first time. Not people who are "JAQing off" or anything - just readers who aren't used to seeing a strict process for the establishment of truth play out on a public forum.

Is there any effort being made to encourage these people to stick around? I hate to think that people are floating off to facebook because they aren't used to rigor the way the mods are. Teaching people to escape the clutches of internet nonsense seems like a valid goal for a forum promoting high quality historical outreach.

I'd also like to join the chorus of people saying thanks - regardless of the details, we're moving in the right direction thanks to mods and quality contributors.
Great article / statement.

I will use it whenever someone again claims that there is no free speach in Germany because Holocaust Denial is banned.
Really good to see Reddit getting positive media coverage as well.

You guys do a great job. Stern, but fair.
Your stance and content is much appreciated.

The fact us people like zuckaberg at least think they're isolated from the results of their actions.

History says he's wrong but it's those of us who don't have power that suffer first.
[deleted]
I lurk here a lot and don't post at all (As it should be since I'm not qualified in any relevant fields), So this may be my only chance to say this: Thank you for this wonderful sub. 
I just want to share that I found this subreddit after encountering a racist blogpost. In short, the writer claim that "African has no civilization" and that's why "African country is poor" because they "Couldn't maintain a civilization". I'm just happy to found a satisfying rebuttal in here.
Mods, thanks for doing what you do.  It’s greatly appreciated.

I used to get into battles with people editing Wikipedia with that kind of nonsense.  They’re pretty diligent over there too but I imagine you see a much large swath of deniers than they do.  Must be difficult.

Thanks again.
When the internet was young I had always thought Holocaust denying was a joke, I later found out that they weren't joking and then I became shocked. I have always loved how intense y'all are about keeping the posts clean and to the point. And NOW I am even more thankful that y'all keep all that awfulness off of here. "When You Do Things Right, People Won’t Be Sure You’ve Done Anything at All." Thank you for being such a solid Rock in these troubling times. 
As the child of a Holocaust survivor, thank you for taking a hard line against this dangerous nonsense. 
Coming from /r/all. Can somebody briefly explain how /r/AskHistorians moderates?
Excellent work mods. I really love this sub and it’s only because you all take such a hard line to bs like this. 

This sub is a great exposure to the work of historians and what they do, while providing some really compelling reading. Bravo!
Well deserved, best subreddit and one of the highest quality domains on the entire internet.
I am so glad that a community I participate in on occasion is featured positively in the news -- usually reddit is, uh, not known for doing good things.  I only wish I could have more time to research and answer more questions!  You guys usually beat me to it and do such amazing work!
>It takes them little effort to formulate a wrong assertion, but it takes historians a long time and a lot of words to refute one.

[Brandolini's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit#Bullshit_asymmetry_principle) (bullshit asymmetry principle) in effect.
The thing I've always found interesting about holocaust denial is the inconsistency

On the one hand, they want to restore the ideology of the Nazis while on the  other hand they deny one of the central aspects of Nazism.
Great article. Well written. I can sense the anger and frustration building up with each paragraph. But you made the point explicitly clear and it’s good for me to read as it gave me insight into the potential problem of allowing just a little. Especially on this kind of platform. Just a little can slip far and wide. Excellent job. Thank you. 
Great job on this article. It is extremely disheartening and demoralizing to see blatant white supremacist propaganda taking over so many online spaces (much of reddit included), and to have admins, and in may cases, moderators alike trying to play the "live and let live" game with nazis, fundamentally misunderstanding how these people operate, spread their views, and draw people in to radicalize them.

I'm definitely bookmarking this article, as I predict it's going to be something to link again and again to well meaning but otherwise apathetic or laissez-faire moderators of various online communities I frequent.  That it comes from a mod of one of the most successful and consistently high-quality subs on reddit really adds that much more oomph in this particular application. 
[removed]
The Holocaust denial policy on this sub is perfectly reasonable. 

But when it comes to the general goal (not giving the platform for spreading and legitimizing harmful conspiracy theories), it should be pointed out that this sub has it somewhat easier by also enforcing the ["No current events" (20-years) rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). This time is usually enough for some form of historical consensus to emerge with regards to a particular event, political figure or ideology. Thus truthful and false interpretations become rather well-defined and easily distinguishable, which makes policy enforcement much easier. 

I wonder how would you have done it without the 20-year rule. E.g. would you allow Sandy Hook deniers, MH17 truthers, or Assad apologists?

Because Facebook cannot impose a 20-year rule and would need guidelines for current events as well.
This was a really good read. It shows the counterintuitive relationship between moderation and free speech.

The average person hearing that certain voices are being “censored” would tend to advocate for free speech. They don’t have the subtle context of years of moderating a forum like this gives.

Really great explanation. 
Fantastic. AskHistorians really is the gold standard for web forums. I wish more websites would recognize that their supposed "neutrality" is dangerous. 
The same thing applies to subjects like climate change and evolution. Always beware the side that wants to "teach the controversy" on an accepted topic.
If I might ask, and if it isn't too meta, would you, professional historians, favor having laws against holocaust denial in the US like one can find in Europe?

For me it seems a valuable discussion. The amount of holocaust denial I see from primarily Americans is astounding. Especially that a lot of regular folks will often defend these deniers because of free speech, as if any restriction on free speech automatically leads to complete censorship.


The only people that I know that deny or question the holocaust, are doing so in bad faith and, IMO, just abuse free speech to conduct thinly veiled hate speech.
Well done guys, you make us all proud to be apart of this community
How applicable could this approach be to other forms of denialism? Topics like climate change denial are tied heavily into political discourse; while others like anti-vaccination can involve the recipient of propaganda actively searching for alternatives to explain personal tragedy. 

I'm curious has to how this could be implemented without appearing political or driving away those most susceptible to propaganda.
Proud to be an occasional contributer to this community.
I just subscribed because of this article. I am glad to see that there are those still fighting Nazis.
This is easily the best mod team on reddit . I wish you guys could everything in here. 
I completely agree with this stance and denying a platform to those who would try to peddle an argument without facts.   Here is my question in this era of Trump extremism, how do you deal with these same types of arguments / discussions in your non-internet life?  I have taken a very similar sort of stance with my brother in law who is a vehement Trump supporter.
I hope this article becomes a fixture in future history classes reading about our time. It says a lot about how social media works today, the problems it faces, and especially contemporary efforts of right-wing radicals to infiltrate and appropriate forums of discourse.
Thank you all so much for this!
That was a brilliant and insightful piece. I also love how you cite sources even in an opinion piece. Thank you for all you do, mods!
I wish more moderators were as good as you guys. 
I shared this article and I would like to encourage others to do so. It clearly makes a point that needs making. 
This policy makes perfect sense for this subreddit, but saying that Facebook as a whole should have the same policy doesn't make any sense. Facebook isn't as narrow of a community as one history-focused subreddit.
Excellent article. 
Thank you for also acknowledging other genocides like the Armenian and Native Americans, everyone knows about the atrocities of WWII (or should) but it's not the first or last time genocides have occurred.  If we wish to move forward to a brighter future we must acknowledge our past, and not ignore or deny it.
I can't even begin to tell you how much I appreciate that you do this.

I seriously. You are one of the very few reasons reddit can be a useful place.
That Deborah Lipstadt quote is great. I've been having conversations with my cousin about a certain popular thinker at the moment. He believes that given this person a platform will allow them to eventually be proven wrong. And to an extent I think he's right: the more this specific individual has a chance to show some of their ignorance on certain topics and their lapses in logic, the less appealing he will seem to those who pick up on it.

But the issue is that this is a person who already has a following and will still attract people who are ignorant in all the same ways. And going into the nuances of how they read a specific author wrong will not really be able to pick up on why this figure is just not good.

It, of course, doesn't make the issue any easier to deal with. It's also true, I think, that open debate can bring some people back from these views. But I think the wider point of the article, that these grassroots propagandists are simply looking to cast a wide net, is vital here to understand why such rules in a place like this do exist. A strength of a sub like this is that you can expect to see well-researched answers. The catch is well-written and well-researched answers take to put up. It's easier to spam questions which will take words-upon-words to debunk thoroughly.

And there's a suspicion of wordy answers among many, I think. They seem overly defensive or not sincere to a lot of people. Which already puts people wanting to craft informative answers at a disadvantage to audiences that are being swayed in the opposite direction.
thank you for all that you do
I've got a couple questions here-

To be clear, I'm on the side of the mods in this- the holocaust ranks as one of the worst atrocities, and the people who deny aren't looking to argue- their minds have already been made up.

However, I get the sense that the writer would have groups like facebook emulate their behavior. While a good ideal to strive for, do you believe that this is actually viable for such a large platform?
I know this is sorta against AskHistorians in general - I'm not a professional historian nor do I have any academic sources at hand - but thank you for taking the time to write such a well thought out article. I could not agree with your point more and think that is a critical problem we are facing on most media platforms.

It reminds me of a moment in The Royal Tenenbaums where Owen Wilson is pitching a book and his premise is "we all know General Custer died at the battle of Little Big Horn. What my book proposes is... maybe he didnt?"

Now that was supposed to be comedy, but CNN/Fox News/The internet are seemingly willing to give that kind of factually wrong viewpoint a platform. "Kelly, our next guest doesnt think Little Big Horn happened, let's hear what he has to say." 

The media is giving a free pass to racists, anti-semites, nativists, etc because they want to make it look like there needs to be a debate. I disagree, these people should be viewed with contempt for the evil and violence they are promoting. "I never promoted violence!" says the white supremacist - as if the history of slavery they speak so fondly of was bereft of horrible atrocities against the slaves. These people are being given a platform on television! It's horrible and needs to stop.

So, how do we fight this on subs which don't have such a strict moderation policy?  And on subs where we're not the moderators, and where the moderators have chosen to give a voice to Holocaust denial?  A month or so ago I had [this exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekmemes/comments/8mrob3/when_your_jewish_friend_tells_you_they_lost_5/) in a Star Trek meme subreddit, and I was taken aback by the brazenness of it.  What do you say to these people, who claim that if they didn't give a voice to Holocaust denial, they would be suppressing a valid minority viewpoint?  I don't feel it is a viewpoint worth defending, but I'm not sure how to communicate that in this kind of situation without being dismissed as a 'snowflake' who is offended by everything.
After reading this article and then going through the comments, my mind immediately drifted to the comment sections of most media outlets. It happens rarely, but when I do decide to start sifting through the bottom of an online news article, you see some pretty horrendous examples of calls for violence, holocaust denial, conspiracy, etc. You even see this on large name media outlets sometimes. 

My initial reaction is to think that the moderating policy on this sub would be very appropriate for those platforms as well. But I'm not sure if that would fall in line with what most media outlets wish to accomplish with those comment sections. 
Thank you for all that you do. 
I 100% agree that Reddit is not the place to discuss whether the Holocaust occured. Your point about how it is easy to toss a couple words together to sow doubt but refuting these claims takes a lot of effort is great. I agree that the average Redditor doesn't have the time or patience to read a lengthy rebuttal.

**My question** is, do you think there is any forum or venue where Holocaust deniers points should be openly debated and refuted? If so, what is that place?

Thanks for the great article. After reading it I do have a new opinion on the limits of free speech on Reddit and other internet forums and sites.
[removed]
Thank you for taking this stand. I only hope Zuck and others will heed your example but I am sadly not optimistic having seen their reactions to racism on their platforms, to the point where I sometimes legit think Zuck and Jack from Twitter might be white supremacists.
AskHistorians is such a great scholastic read. A lot of people are making their appreciations known here, and since it other wise stands out of place I'd like to add that I also appreciate the diligence here.
The Slate comments section was surprisingly civil. Not great, but by internet comment norms, pretty good.                   
One interesting comment was someone noting that maybe "we" should straighten out Reddit before fixing Facebook.         
Poor reasoning, but not a completely bad point.
What about questioning Holocaust figures? (ie death toll). Will that result in an instant-ban? 
Is there a post someone already did asking about the Holocaust?
[removed]
> The medievalists and classicists among us have by now become familiar with the arguments of David Irving and Fred Leuchter.  

I didn't get this part.  Can someone explain me this?
I don’t often comment, but I’d like to say that this article is beautifully written, and provides a fantastic argument for the way mods here act. 

Congratulations on acting this way, and so clearly explaining why. 
Do you guys have a collection of links or responses on here that deal with debunking holocaust denial arguments?
Great job guys!
Thank you for all the work you and the other moderators do to keep this subreddit a beacon of integrity on a website notorious for toxicity. 
Loved the article, very enlightening approach, such methods should be applied to the fake news phenomenon and the proliferation of other bad ideas on social media.

I think this is the first r/AskHistorians thread that I'll be allowed to comment on. This subreddit has a really dedicated balance between moderation and quality contributors. Kudos on the notoriety!
I appreciate the standards of this subreddit, and maybe Facebook should ban Holocaust deniers in particular, but it would be absurd to expect Facebook to try to uphold the standards of r/AskHistorians in general.

The Warren Commission formed after the assassination of President Kennedy produced [this appendix](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html) on the history of presidential protection. They note that before Lincoln, "there was remarkably little concern about the safety of Presidents and few measures were taken to protect them." This persisted even after President Jackson survived an assassination attempt due to a misfiring gun. In the 1840s Congress did assign a guard to the White House — but apparently with more of an aim to protecting the building and grounds than its primary occupant. 

During the Civil War Lincoln was guarded irregularly — sometimes by Washington, D.C. policemen, and sometimes by Army units. Lincoln "was reluctant to surround himself with guards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it." This, the report notes, "has been characteristic of almost all American Presidents."

The congressional report after Lincoln's assassination, "with traditional reluctance, called for no action to provide better protection for the President in the future." The Warren Commission notes that some people at the time saw Lincoln's assassination as a unique reflection of the Civil War, which was now over, and not something indicative of a need for broader protections. Indeed, for more than a decade after Booth, presidents continued to walk about in public alone and unguarded. (I remember, but cannot find a source, an anecdote about either Grant or Hayes, that upon receiving a threat on his life, the president didn't change his routine other than to purchase a heavier walking stick. Sadly, you should disregard this anecdote unless someone else can find a source for it, but it's delightful enough I thought I'd mention it as an aside.)

After President Garfield was shot, the New York Tribune contrasted "the simple Republican manner of life which the custom of nearly a century has prescribed for the Chief Magistrate of the United States" with "the forms and safeguards of courts" — implying that bodyguards were seen as a courtly, monarchical affectation, where as a republican president should be open and accessible to the people (July 3, 1881, quoted in Warren Commission report). Surprisingly or not, despite the second assassination of a president in two decades, Congress "took no steps to provide the President with personal protection."

The Secret Service, initially a group for combatting counterfeiters and financial crimes, first began providing part-time presidential protection in 1894 — apparently a coincidence because a group of Colorado gamblers were suspected of plotting to assassinate President Cleveland. President McKinley actually had Secret Service protection when he was assassinated, but it was his death that finally spurred Congress to give the Secret Service "full-time responsibility for the safety of the President."

Returning to Lincoln, he was certainly aware that many people wanted to kill him. President Theodore Roosevelt later quoted Lincoln saying, "Though it would be safer for a president to live in a cage, it would interfere with his business." He had sporadic guards but no formal protection.

Fascinatingly, General Ulysses Grant was originally invited to attend Ford's Theater with Lincoln on that fatal night. He begged off with an excuse about needing to be with his children, but [possibly because Julia Grant and Mary Todd Lincoln hated each other](https://featherfoster.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/mary-lincolns-rivals/). 

From a [recent biographical article on Grant](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-reconstruction-of-ulysses-s-grant/):

> Grant would never forgive himself for begging off, certain that had he accepted the invitation, his bodyguards stationed outside the door would have stopped Booth. **As lieutenant general of the U.S. Army he was entitled to armed protection around the clock. The president in those days was not.**

Hopefully this was helpful!

You can find our [position and explanation on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3ph8c/rules_roundtable_xi_answered_answered_flair_and/). I will repost the entire Roundtable below, but would stress one thing. We get this request periodically, either via META threads or Modmail, and however much people *want* it to happen, it isn't going to unless the issues laid out below could be ameliorated, and they are not simply issues of "Add flair!" They are issues of manpower, issues of technical limitations of the platform, and issues of the historical process itself, and none of them are easily surmountable however much it is something which, on the surface, may seem like an obvious feature to add for many, and however many upvoted a request for it may get from time to time.

#I Don't Want to Read All That Below. Tell Me The Most Important Things

Normally I save this for the end, but to put it up front instead, trust me when I say that if we thought it would work, we would implement it. If nothing else it would get y'all to stop asking! We really do take it seriously though, and probably once a year, at least, we have a discussion on the matter to see whether anything has changed from the reasons explained below, but for better or for worse, little does.

But while 'Answered' flair might not be in play, we do our best to provide several alternatives to give users the best browsing experience we can, and to enjoy as much content as possible. 

* Every thread has a Remind Me Bot link pre-filled and stickied to the top. Click than, and you just need to send the PM. Easy-peasy, fire and forget, and you'll be reminded to come back in a day or two when an answer is much more likely there.
* Last year, we were super psyched to be able to roll out [our very own browser extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d6dzi7/tired_of_clicking_to_find_only_removed_comments/) with the help of a wonderful community member, which we highly encourage using to view the 'real' comment count in a thread.
* We also encourage subscribing to the '[Weekly Roundup](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&subject=askhistorians+weekly&message=x)' provided by /u/subredditsummarybot to get a summary of the top content each week right to your inbox.
* The moderators also maintain several places that we feature the best content, including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/askhistorians/), the [Sunday Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), and the [Best Of Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ABest%2BOf).\

-------

We hear a lot of suggestions for things to change about the subreddit. Some are easy enough to reject, others we give serious thought to, and occasionally, we get a really good one that helps us develop changes for the subreddit. But by far there is no suggestion we hear more than the request that we implement "Answered" flair, which is something that we, perhaps infamously, have not done despite this. 

While it is a suggestion that seems self-evident to many, unfortunately, it isn't quite so straightforward an idea. And while we aren't opposed to it per se, we are opposed to implementation of such a scheme in a way that wouldn't be fair and equitable in application, not to mention something which can be administered easily and in a uniform manner. As such, there are a number of impediments, both practical and philosophical, that prevent us from putting such a flair into effect.

###There is Rarely *One* Answer

One of the biggest issues facing such a scheme comes down to the historical method itself. Different historians can look at the same evidence, and come to different conclusions. Neither one is necessarily invalid, and the debate between those competing positions can tell us just as much about a topic as the answers themselves, sometimes more even as it can help suss out details and thoughts on the process itself. In a space such as these, we generally do *not* want to endorse one perspective over another. Ideally, an answer on a topic which is subject to hot debate within the academy should make that clear enough itself, but we, as moderators, not only don't want to take sides there, but we simply *shouldn't* be seen as favoring one academic interpretation over another. 

Just as we remove comments in a thread because of how the first comment, whatever its quality, can so often become the 'hot' comment of a thread, we likewise don't want to be crediting as 'answered' a thread because the first comment which meets the rules has arrived. Put simply, we aren't endorsing *anything* here as the definitive answer. Responses which are not removed meet certain criteria which reflect fidelity to the historical method, but history is a process, and rarely do we end up with so definitive a picture that we can reject *any and all* alternatives with certainty.

####Stifling of Contributions

Closely tied into this is what such a flair would potentially do to the quality of content in the subreddit. We aren't simply speculating, but know well from many discussions with Flaired contributors, that the presence of "Answered" flair on a thread would make them less inclined to contribute further. An answer in the thread might be *decent* and just enough to justify being left up, but there is a ton more to say, or another important angle to offer. With 'Answered' flair there is simply less incentive to do so. It gives the thread a sense of finality that disincentives further contributions. 

####Workflow of Moderation

Moderating is often like being a grad student TA, assigned to a class that isn't actually in your focus. We can evaluate a lot about an answer using general principles of the historical method. We can consider the construction of the arguments, and how well the piece communicates its information. We can check sources and see whether they a) exist b) are well reviewed and c) make mention of the topics at hand. But we aren't *all* experts on *everything*. Between the whole team, we have an incredibly wide coverage, but we necessarily must do triage at times.

Say a question about 12th century France is posted. I, knowing nothing about the topic, can evaluate an answer on the criteria noted above, and decide is passes the smell test. Or maybe I think there is *something* fishy, but can't quite put my finger on it, but either way, I decide that there isn't justification for removal based on my reading *but* in either case, while not removing it, I'll flag it to the attention of the mod team's medievalists to have a look. When they are able to, they will also give it a look. Maybe they decide it is fine. But maybe they pick up on something that I wouldn't be aware of. From *there*, we have several approaches. If bad enough, obviously, we'll remove and warn the user. If it is missing something major, we might remove it with a DM explaining the issue and suggestions on how to fix it after which we review to reinstate. Or maybe the issue is kind of in that grey area, in which case we would leave it up *for now* but with some pointed follow-up question to try and suss out a bit more from the user, and only remove if their response indicates that they are already past the extent of their knowledge.

So the question is... at what point does the "Answered" flair go up? Is it when I first decide "smells OK"? But it might still be removed later! Is it after the 'in-field' mod makes their first assessment? Still might be removed depending on the latter stages. For some cases, it can easily be several stages over 24 hours for a response is *definitely* there to stay. Even beyond standard workflow, there are plenty of other things that might happen. Perhaps it turns out a response was plagiarized, so must be removed. Perhaps a respondent refuses to provide sources after request, so must be removed. And of course, because it was originally noted as "answered", other potential respondents already decided not to bother!

####Mechanics of the Flair

Even if we are able to work through all of those issues, which is easier said than done, just how is this being applied? In the end, it needs to be applied manually by the mods. Although there are ways that flair can be automated with bots, those are "dumb" solutions, which is to say, a bot can know there is a comment in the thread with at least 700 words or something, but it can't know if they are *good* words.

Likewise, although the creator of a thread can add flair themselves, beyond the fact that it isn't something we can assume will be done consistently, it also isn't up to the OP to judge the quality of the response as it is in some other subreddits such as /r/AskHistory. A response may be posted, they may read it and add the flair before a mod sees it... only for the mod to quickly see glaring issues that might not be obvious to a layperson, but utterly sink the quality from a more informed view.

So in the end, it would have to be something the mod team does manually, only after evaluation of an answer. This places a burden on us beyond what we already carry, as it creates a number of pressures, including to act quicker than we currently do, and also to be more accurate in our assessments of answers than we already are.

There's a lot of comments here about why something like this wouldn't work and isn't done, but a solution that I have found very helpful and would recommend to you is to use the browser extension. It's called Ask Historians Comment Helper and is available on Chrome and Firefox.

What it does is display a second number that tells you how many top-level comments are actually there and haven't been deleted. So if you see something like 100 comments (2), you'll know there are answers, whereas 100 comments (0) tells you everything is deleted.
Am I the only one who thinks it's hilarious to see 175 comments and then open it to find all were deemed unworthy?  I legitimately laugh and save it if it's a good question.

Keep me guessing mods, I like the gamble.
The issue isn't with AskHistorians. People should instead be complaining to reddit and getting them to change the freaking comment count to whats actually in there. Its incredibly stupid to push these problems off on the subs to have to try and find a work around, when the big issue is on the sites end.
As I understand it from The Mods, requests for Answered flair are the most common suggestion made. [Here's a relevant Rules Roundtable](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3ph8c/rules_roundtable_xi_answered_answered_flair_and/) as to why we don't have it.

To ease your browsing experience and get just already-written content, I highly recommend the channels laid out in the AutoMod autopost on every thread. If you're on desktop, the Browser Extension will make for a much smoother browsing experience. (May AutoMod's circuits always run without overheat!)

EDIT: In case you're more the listening type, I must cry that AutoMod is *most remiss* for not also directing people to [The AskHistorians Podcast](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/podcast), with contributions not just from our flairs but also sometimes outside experts. Rest your eyes, lend the Podcast your ears!

I appreciate the mods reasoning of not endorsing one historical perspective over another. When I see an AskHistorians thread on my feed, I make a mental note that it may be too early to open so I don’t open. But every once in a while, I remember to open the top posts of the week/month and generally find my answers there. 

I find that *not knowing* whether a given question will be answered tends to push me towards exploring the subreddit in general at a later time, and seeing questions/answers I wasn’t initially looking for. 

I feel that an answered flair á la OutOfTheLoop would make my exploration of this sub much more brief and surface level.
As is, the current process discourages users from actually opening and reading threads with answers because there's no way of telling which ones are or aren't answered. There's such a small chance of actually hitting a thread with answers that I (and I imagine others) have just stopped checking.
Obviously Zhukov has already posted a 2-part answer explaining why we don’t choose to do that as part of our moderation, but I’d like to point out another thing: do you use r/OutOfTheLoop? They do the answered flair on threads with answers ...and I find it pretty inconsistent to the extent that I ignore the presence of that flair. Half the time when I click it and it doesn’t have the flair it’s got something that looks like an answer to me, and vice versa. So I suspect we’d be about successful at doing it as them (otherwise they seem a well-moderated subreddit - not criticising them) and it wouldn’t end up being a useful thing for deciding to click on a thread.

The other thing to remember is that Reddit doesn’t just show you the most popular threads - it shows you a carefully algorithmically curated selection of stuff from the subreddits you subscribe to, which ranks some things higher than others. Our experience as moderators here is that we‘re a bit screwed by the algorithm. After all, for most of Reddit, if you click on it and don’t see anything interesting and then click back, Reddit rightly assumes you probably don’t need to see it again. Whereas because our rules go against the grain of the website, it means we get *a lot* of people who click once, see no answer, and then Reddit never shows it to them again. Even though, 2 hours later, the thread has matured and it looks like there’s an answer in the thread. 

As a rule of thumb, almost everything that is popular - 1000 upvotes plus - will probably get an answer.  So if you click on a thread and don’t see an answer - save the thread or use the remindmebot function (which is why there’s an automod message about that in every thread!) and you should then see an answer when you check back a few hours later. Hopefully!
Yeah especially on the app, which takes an eternity to load the comments section, this is disappointing.
I stickied the 'Official Moderator Response' already which goes through most of the various issues in play here, but I want to just hammer on on and expand separately and specifically, since it isn't one of the big reasons *for us*, but it is, I think, the biggest reason for *readers* when it comes to downsides that impact *them*. That is to say users might not care about increasing mod workload - *rude* - and they might not actually care about the nitty-gritty of the historical process and out concerns about perception of a response with v. without "Answered" Flair, but presumably they do care about there being content to read in an absolute sense. After all this issue is raised because they want to be able to consume more of it.

But, and i cannot stress this enough, even if we caved and said "*fine, the desire of the users is so overwhelming here, against our better judgement we will implement 'Answered' Flair", **the result for users would be a declining amount of content**.

I don't mean this even regarding our concerns about how it might decrease interest in contributions, but rather I mean we, as mods, would approve fewer answers, and we would take longer to do our due diligence on what ones are approved (likely meaning we remove them for awhile while we do our confirmations to make sure they ought to be up). As it is now, we do a lot of checks on answers anyways - I won't go into details to keep this short, but you can find more explanation of how Mods judge answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) - but that is for the current way of doing things. 

We do not, and never have, claimed we're perfect, and bad answers definitely make it through sometimes. Sometimes they only make it through until another mod catches something, in other cases a trusted flaired user might be the one to flag it for us, and in yet others it is a regular user who provides a takedown. We, as mods, are the frontline of bullshit detectors here, and we have a lot of tools for fighting it, but it is a process that involves the entire community, and this is important because **"Answered" Flair stands to fundamentally alter that in two critical ways.

The first is in its likely clamping down on a willingness to disagree. We get plenty of modmails, which we *deeply appreciate*, from users who flag issues with an answer, and we always look into them. Sometimes they are wrong, sometimes they are minor enough to not be reason for removal, and sometimes they are on the money and we kill the response, but whatever the outcomes, we always try to make sure the user who raised the issue knows we appreciate it and that they are helping out. We also see it in comments where a user might say something like "The mods should maybe look into [xxxxxx issue xxxxx] as I'm not sure that is correct". The point here being that there is recognition of how we work from these users. We do our basic due diligence, but aren't signing off absolutely, and users also help by raising issues to us. Giving an answer positive approval though has two opposite results which are both fairly negative. The first is how is can dissuade some users from speaking up - "I don't think this is right, but the mods approved it, so maybe I'm the one wrong here" is a reaction we *rarely* want to encourage. Second is creating an antagonizing relationship with potentially quite learned users, who instead of flagging *for our attention*, now are starting at "I can't believe the mods approved this when it is clearly wrong about [xxxx issue xxxxx]". This is similarly something we don't want to have happen. All together, this now feeds into the second, larger issue.

As addressed more in the Roundtable I linked above, there is a smell test we apply to an answer which is an holistic evaluation. Making up numbers for purpose of analogy, lets say it is a score out of 20, where 5 points each are possible for source use, quality of argument, depth of content, and readability, and right now, to pass my 'smell test' an answer needs a 12-14 - so either it needs to *nail* some things if it doesn't do others at all (5, 2, 5, 2), or it needs to do everything passably well (3, 3, 3, 3). At that level, I can't *guarantee it* but I do have enough confidence to leave it standing (if I ran into it), or clear the report (if someone else reported it).

Now let's add "Answered" Flair to the mix, and now as a mod I'm not only saying "OK, I'm not removing you" but rather I'm saying "OK, I'm *endorsing* you and signaling to readers this answer is mod approved". If I'm doing that, my smell test is going to have to change, as I'm going to need to have a higher confidence level to sign off in *that* way. So maybe I'm now at 14-16 for where my 'smell test' level is. So of the two examples I made up above, only the first one would even be something I *consider* approving, and it is just on the lower edge, while the second one is a clear removal. Because we aren't enforcing a simple binary. We're enforcing a confidence level, where there is always a gray area, and "Answered" Flair basically means we're shifting ourselves from "Approve at Confidence of 65% ±5" to "approve at "Confidence of 75% ±5". (and again, I stress I'm making up numbers to provide an easy to express analogy for an holistic process. We don't use a scorecard that is quite so straightforward in reality).

So what this all comes down to is that if we are changing our process to one that is pre-emptive, clear, positive approval of all responses left up, it means we, as mods, will need to feel more confident about what we approve than we are currently, and be stricter than we currently are already.

#It means that we would be approving a noticeably smaller number of answers, leading to a reduction in responses on the sub.

This has several knock-on effects. While we may now have answered flair (yay!), it also means more frustration with unanswered questions. It means popular questions take even longer to get answered than they do currently. It means fewer get answered at all. 

And maybe for some that is a welcome trade-off (although, I would stress, *not* for mods who get literal death threats sometimes for removing shitty answers), with some users reading all this and saying "I'd take half the answers for noticeably better uniformity in quality". But it also means fewer contributors, and long term brain drain, and thus long term decline in even the best stuff. 

Yes, the top-notch flairs you know and love will be just fine, but it cuts off the pipeline of new ones. Flairs are made, not born, and contributors grow as writers and historians here. They might start out writing *just good enough* answers (or even with a warning or two!), but you can check out the sub archives and see how much long time contributors have improved. *Increasing the bar for what is "just good enough" though cuts off many of them*. Users who used to be able to get a foot in the door by just getting by, and *then* growing as contributors never get that start because they can't even reach that bar. 

So anyways, there are a lot of issues in play here, but this one is one that I think deserves particular attention, and hopefully that all lays out the issue well enough.
I appreciate that even a small thing such as “post flair” is thought about and fleshed out from all angles on this sub. Thank you Mods. Proud to be a part of this community.
I just want to say I \*LOVE\* and appreciate the care the mods put into this community. Thank you!
Just want to add to the appreciation for this sub’s vision and standards. I’ve been reading this tread for the last hour and am floored by how combative some people are being.

I think the moderators have expressed their reasoning why it doesn’t work for their vision well and appreciate their articulation that they are working towards a larger vision. That’s why the quality here is so high. If it was more lax the quality would go down. Most readers I believe wouldn’t want that, but as they said ultimately it’s up to them and it’s above and beyond to engage so much with the community as to why they are making the decisions they are. You don’t have to agree, but flat out saying their reasoning doesn’t make sense I think is missing the point. It’s gray. And where it’s gray it’s their call. And again they are actually respectfully stating why they view it as gray. This is a free product and there are a million alternatives if this isn’t your jam. I personally appreciate the standards. So much of the internet is a free-for-all and it’s nice having a space with rigor and principals that guide the content. Thanks again mod team!

It seems that you are being pedantic about "answered".  OP is asking for a tag that shows that at least one answer post has been approved. Maybe choose a different term like "Responses" or "Posts Approved".
Maybe an “answered” flair is the wrong word. Perhaps just a “content available” flair, which makes no value judgement as to the answer that is there. 

As I said elsewhere, the browser extension does not work on mobile. The Sunday digest often has to be sought out at it is poorly upvoted.
Am I alone in feeling this isn't a huge problem? It takes about 5 seconds to open a thread, see it isn't answered, and pop back out. I've never really had an issue with this. 

If I'm interested in the question, I check and if there are no answers, I just check back later. I generally skim through the round-up posts if I feel like just reading. I can just go through quality responses there. 

It's absolutely minuscule in comparison to the hassle it is to sift through the jokes / off-the-mark responses on similar subs that don't delete have similar levels of moderation.

I really wish THIS post was flaired as "answered"
Agree! I can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated with unanswered posts.
With all due respect to the mods (genuinely, I understand how labor intensive this is, and the roundtable makes it clear), something needs to change. I appreciate the effort with the things like a browser add-on, mailing list, etc, but this is Reddit, it places a large burden on the reader to use all of these outside tools just to arrive at a somewhat user-friendly experience. I don’t have an answer for you or a silver bullet, you all have thought this through. I guess I would only suggest that Reddit is a platform not exactly amenable to the stringency put on posts in this sub. As a user and fan of this sub, it is indeed disheartening to comb through threads and find so little to read at times, so much so that I would perhaps even prefer less stringency (which perhaps could translate Into less mod labor) if it meant more readable material.
Any time I see a meta thread I take the opportunity to thank the mod team for their tireless efforts. This is one of the best subreddits on the site because of it.

I absolutely agree that an "answered" flair would stifle discussion but for this problem, something as simple as a flair indicating the thread isn't empty would work fine. No need to make any value judgements besides "We didn't delete this one post so the flair goes up"

and when the team is sometimes deleting hundreds of posts it doesn't feel like it would be too hard to implement something like that.
How about the inverse of this? An unanswered flair that gets added automatically and is removed once a comment is made. It wouldn't discourage other from adding onto the discussion, would encourage discourse to start, and prevent situations where you expect an answer and get none.
Or at least have it so that deleted comments don't show up in the comment total on the main page.
subscribe to [/r/HistoriansAnswered](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoriansAnswered/) instead. It is an auto generated group I think.
As a non-historian, Id often appreciate a space to answer "just use some fucking common sense!" Im not suggesting you allow it. Im just saying it would be nice.
Getting far too pedantic about what constitutes "answered". Why not just a flair that signifies "Has at least one answer", then it's up to the reader to decide how well it's answered!

All we want to know is whether it's worth even clicking on the link! Even a terribly answered message is better than a row of deleted comments!
I second this
This is exactly what I said yesterday, and I got downvoted into oblivion.
Yes please. I echo everything the OP has stated.
Ya this sub sucks because of that
How about this:

1. All posts start off with an 'unanswered' flair. 
2. If there is an answer that satisfies the poster, they can reply to the answer with a comment containing a character (see Δ in CMV) or message that simply removes the 'unanswered' flair.
3. Optionally, the flair removal will notify the mods, who, in their own time can a. Do nothing - the usual default b. Reinstated the 'unanswered' flair c. Very Very rarely, bestow the 'Answered' Flair.
I suggested adding a "∅" tag to all new posts, signifying that it is *likely unanswered*, and have the symbol be removed when there is a top comment with a long answer (all done with automoderator).  And the symbol can be added or removed by mods as necessary if it goes wrong.  That would require minimal effort by mods and would be a big improvement.
+1,000,000
Can answers stop being deleted or removed when they have hundreds or thousands of upvotes as well?
The fact this is flaired as "meta" is just perfect.

A note to commenters: ~~If you're here for an answer, there isn't a sufficiently good one posted yet. The thread is highly upvoted because people are interested in the question, not because there's an answer.~~ If you think you have an answer, that's great! Before you start writing, though, take a spin through [our rules on answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_answers) and make sure you can write something in-depth and comprehensive that addresses the content of the released files.

If your only contribution is to ask/complain about deleted posts, or why there's no answer, you're very likely to be temporarily banned. If you have a complaint about moderation, start a meta thread or send us a modmail.
While I certainly hope you were being glib with your Oliver Stone comment, the short answer to your question is: "Not much." There certainly was no information that changed the official narrative of the assassination; though there were a lot of intriguing new bits of information about the case, and semi-unrelated cases.

The Washington Post did an absolutely terrific breakdown of the most notable revelations here:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/jfk-assassination-files/?utm_term=.2937d722401c

Probably the most notable, at least from my perspective, were documents detailing some of the various CIA plans and plots to kill Castro. This, of course, has long been known, but this particular document (the first one listed in the Washington Post piece) is an official 1975 internal examination of all the efforts and fleshes out the various plots in much greater detail than was ever known before.

The 82 page memo refers to another, unpublished 1967 memo by J. Edgar Hoover with the absolutely wonderfully title of "Central Intelligence Agency's Intentions to Send Hoodlums to Cuba to Assassinate Castro." This, of course, speaks to the intra-agency conflicts between the FBI and the CIA on matters related to Cuba.

But your question is "is there anything in these files that provides any type of indication of a conspiracy in the JFK assasination?" and the answer is, "No." The whole release dominated the news cycle for what, about a day? The level of revelations--dominated by interesting but not particularly revelatory minutiae--seems to indicate that this was about the appropriate level of general interest.

Keep in mind that at the very last moment, Donald Trump elected to withhold numerous documents for further vetting. So until those specific documents are released, we are looking at a subset of all of the information still contained in the archives.
I have a related question, given a large information dump like the JFK investigation, how do historians analyze the information these days?
Perhaps nothing new in the US, but the released papers revealed and confirmed how deep was the involvement of the CIA with the Mexican government, and we are talking about presidential involvement, Harvey Lee Oswald and spying the embassies and communications from Soviet aligned countries in Mexico. 

The papers, specially some telegraphs, confirmed the identities of LITENSOR, LITEMPO-8 and LITEMPO-2, code names for the Mexican president at the moment Adolfo López Mateos, former president Luis Echeverría, and Secretary of state Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (Who would become president the following term) respectively.

The telegraphs had a thorough description of Harvey's Lee Oswald activities in Mexico before JFKs assassination, and the communications held between all the possible actors specifically between the Cuban and Russian embassies in Mexico City. 

If the identities of the spies were outrageous, the president and top political actors, and a sovereign country working for a foreign entity.... the fact that they were under the CIA payroll was, with their names and amounts detailed, ... just too much. 
Those papers were meant to be released around 1994s but the US Commission in charge of that put another 15 years of reserve to the documents. It's believed that it was an arrangement between the Mexican ruling party at the moment PRI and the CIA, as the elections were around  the corner with the ruling party at that moment being the same as the one in the 70's. In addition, treason (aiding a foreign country) is the only crime for which a (ex)president can be held accountable for by the Mexican justice.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The involvement of Mexican senators, governors, chiefs of police and presidents is starting to be confirmed. A good starting point in English could be  Inside the Company from Philip Agee.

During the campaign and subsequent presidency of Nixon, much of his rhetoric revolved around two things in particular - crime and drugs/drug use. Nixon was the progenitor of the War on Drugs and even coined the term (although Reagan would supercharge it during his time in office).

Nixon's presidency is the time where academics begin to refer to a period defined by 'mass incarceration', where we started to heavily enforce and criminalize drug offences, particularly marijuana. Behind such efforts was forms of racist pandering, often seen as a backlash to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. We can see this particularly when it comes to drug usage, as the Nixon administration sought to associate African-Americans with drug use in order to excuse the criminalization and policing of their leaders and communities. We see this in particular with the infamous quote from Nixon's top domestic advisor, John Ehrlichman:

*"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”*¹

Nixon himself wasn't above racial remarks either. In a taped recording, he stated in regards to marijuana legalization supporters: *"You know, it's a funny thing, every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana are Jewish. What the Christ is the matter with the Jews, Bob? What is the matter with them?"*²

During this time, there was even a commission appointed by Nixon to study the effects of Marijuana (as the Controlled Substances Act was being authored). However, when the commission found the cannabis use did not present a danger to society as the administration often presented, it was ignored. 

Fast forwarding to Reagan, and we see the kickstarting of the conservative legal philosophy commonly known today as 'tough-on-crime'. It advocated for harsher criminal penalties for those convicted of a crimes (particularly violent crimes and drug offenses). Mandatory minimum sentences were established, forcing those convicted of a crime to have to serve a specific period of time for that crime (in the Clinton years this would be followed by 'truth in sentencing' laws that made those convicted of a crime have t serve a signficant portion (85%) of their sentence before being eligible for parole). Criminal penalties for drug offenses were increased heavily, particularly with the Drug Abuse Act of '86. This law also introduced penalties for crack cocaine possession, which were far harsher than for powder cocaine (something often regarded as a way to unfairly discriminate against African-American). This particular way of thinking in regards to crime lasted through Bush Sr.'s presidency.

From the period of 1970 to 1994, the prison population increased exponentially - from around 200,000 in 1970 to 1.5 million in 1994. Without a doubt, this trend was guided by the actions that the federal government took during this time in regards to how it handled crime, drug use and dependency, as well as race relations.

- I recommend looking into the Shafer Commission, as well as the earlier LaGuardia Report which was published in 1944 and came to many of the same conclusions as the later Shafer Commission. Both are important in regards to the history of drug prohibition in the U.S., and the LaGuardia Report is important especially in regards to the relationship between prohibition and racial discrimination.

So far, the war on drugs is big contributor, explaining the policing used to incarcerate people. What about the privatization of jails, it's often mentioned as contributing the dynamics. when did this happen, how and why?
This previous AH answer by /u/Gorrest-Fump is related.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/71j5qa/has\_the\_american\_prison\_system\_always\_had\_a\_much/dncua67?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/71j5qa/has_the_american_prison_system_always_had_a_much/dncua67?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Which I would paraphrase as "the treatment of black people in the prison system is a direct reaction to the ending of slavery". The missing part is whether this heavy-handed treatment spilled out onto society in general, resulting in high incarceration rates for everyone, not just black people.
Could an issue be some countries don’t report how many they have in prison? Which would make the US percentage rise even higher?
Would the privatization of jails not have driven the need to keep them at close to full occupancy to justify expenditure on them?

The romanticism of the East Coast/West Coast feud makes lots of people want to point at Biggie as responsible, but most of the evidence seems to point to the man 2Pac and Suge jumped in the hotel lobby, Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson was responsible. His uncle, Keffe D, said as much in an [interview with police] (http://www.laweekly.com/news/the-keffe-d-tapes-10-highlights-of-confession-from-gangster-who-says-sean-combs-hired-him-to-kill-tupac-2395421). 

According to [LAbyrinth](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQlPvwmA4l8C&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gl=US&gclid=CIHH7bbN_c4CFaRrMgodizYE_g&gclsrc=ds), Anderson was allegedly a member of the South Side Crips who had had issues with Suge Knight's Bloods-affiliated record label dating back to an incident at an LA mall in which Death Row associate Travon Lane had his DR medallion stolen in a Footlocker. Speculation claims that Puffy paid for this, as he wanted to use the chain in a Bad Boy video mocking DR, but if there's evidence that it was more than speculation, I've never seen it. 

Additionally, it's fairly well documented that in the weeks following 2Pac's death there was a large scale gang war in LA, seeking retaliation for his death. MC Eiht, a longtime Compton rapper, has [gone on record] (http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/02/03/mc-eiht-says-tupacs-gang-affiliations-led-to-his-death/) stating he believes it was 2Pac's gang affiliation (through Suge Knight) that led to his murder. 

If you comb through his Death Row releases, they're full of references to Bloods, down to his repeated use of "M.O.B.," a common Blood saying (Suge is also a known member of the Mob Pirus) and shout-outs to known Pirus ([Neckbone, Tray,Buntry](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-philipssuge15nov1502-story.html)).

That said, LAPD Detective Greg Kading wrote in his book [Murder Rap](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Rap-Untold-Investigations-Detective/dp/0983955484) that he believes Puffy commissioned Keffe D for the hit. It is also alleged that Biggie [paid $1 million and provided the gun] (http://www.mtv.com/news/1457346/biggie-paid-gang-to-kill-tupac-report-says/) that took out his rival. 

There is further speculation that 2Pac was planning on leaving Death Row, which led to Suge Knight to order his death, but remember Knight was in the car when 2Pac was shot. 

At the end of the day, no one really knows. Everyone involved is either dead or not talking.    
[deleted]
Follow up question, why is there so much controversy and conspiracy theories surrounding this case? Apart from the status of the victim what made it unusual in terms of police investigation etc?
Similarly, was anything ever proven to any degree regarding Eazy E's death, viz. Suge allegedly injecting him with HIV?
I have a question for anyone that could answer. Did anything ever come from the suspects vehicle. Did they ever find it or anything?

In short, yes. 

And no. 

Actually, it's complicated. 

First, the most basic question:  which *edition* of Frankenstein?  The 1818 version (which is more science-horror) or the 1831 (which is the one most people read, and is more religiously-minded)?  I think I remember this passage from the last time I read the 1818 version... but I'm not sure. 

Either way, you can approach the question of whether Europeans from the 1750s to 1850s expressed concern, emotions of regret or pain, or even outrage from a number of different directions. 

1)  The Literary Angle. 

Shelleys work is a work of early Romanticism.  The Romantics (which included Shelley's husband Percy) were all about using their literary craft to excite emotion or generate passionate feelings.  That's why, in Mary's *Frankenstein*, there's so much anguish:  Victor tearing at his breast, Victor falling down and weeping, Victor swept up in the powerful scenery of the mountains he's climbing, Victor recoiling in abject horror, etc. etc.   Coming out of the more cerebral Enlightenment, the Romantics were all about *feeling.*

And one of the ways to evoke this feeling was to tap into older tropes about the misery of human history--tropes of lament that go back before the early Christians, even, to the great literary figures of Classical Rome.  Tacitus' *Germania* was in some ways a pointed critique to Romans of their own political and moral corruption of course, but it was *also* a lament for these sturdy, simple German people, who were doomed to be conquered by Rome, and assimilated by them.  (as Rome had done to so many other peoples.)

(Christopher Krebs has a good book out on Tacitus--*A Most Dangerous Book* (2011)-- where he writes about the Germani as one of the first groups to be seen as "noble savages"... who were doomed by the wheels of history to fall under the expanding yoke of mighty Rome.) 


Interestingly, though Bartolomeo de las Casas, who wrote passionately about the destruction of the Indians (by Spanish rule in Latin America) in the 1540s,  is often described in history survey classes as a pioneer humanitarian and even a cultural relativist--because he not only cared about the Indians, but wrote respectfully of their ways and tried to argue that their ways were something other than 'savagery'--he was actually on pretty solid and well-trodden ground *literarily*, as there had existed this 1,500 year-old genre of lament for the defeated, pity for the fallen, regret for the destruction of the noble-savage foe. 

In Shelley's *Frankenstein*, when the Creature reads, he/it reads a bunch of 18th century, Romanticism-tinged histories... including Volney's *Ruins of Empire* (a lost classic) written in the 1790s, describing the fall of civilizations of the past.  This late 18th century history in turn was drawing on 2,000 years of classical lament for the defeated, the disappearing, and the dying.  

Shelley was very well-read.  By including this wide range of literary and historical works in *Frankenstein*, she was of course flexing her intellect.  But she was also digesting these books for a more popular audience.  She's sort of a fusion of Carl Sagan and Stephen King... but I digress.

So, how many readers in (say) 1830s London, as they read about the monster in tears over the fate of the Native Americans, shared the feeling?   Difficult to say.   Certainly some.  It would not have felt "strange" to read the words, because it was an established literary motif, both for the Americas (from Las Casas onwards) and for all suffering "noble savages" everywhere.  (more on that below.)  


2)  The American angle.   

This is the one that I'm not qualified to really grapple with (because my American history is so weak).  Nonetheless, while the most recent trend in American historiography has been to emphasize how the eradication/removal of Native Americans amounted to a genocide (with genocidal policies but also genocidal *motivations*), an older generation of history emphasized the "deep regret" with which American political leaders, religious leaders, thinkers and writers, and even soldiers and journalists confronted or grappled with the way that European Colonials/the Early United States pioneers brutally treated the Native Americans.  From Henry David Thorough to (maybe?) Laura Engles Wilder.  But I don't know enough to say more on this however. 

Regardless, I doubt Mary Shelley would have been very tuned in to this discourse.  It's too early in the century. 

First off, she would not have been that up on American culture or events (though Wikipedia tells me she met Aaron Burr... I did not know that!)  
But she would not have been reading *American* books for sure... because no one was, since the United States was such a political, economic, and cultural backwater.   A cultural wasteland, if you will.  Not worth the time.  (and has this really changed....?   but I digress...  :-) 

Alexis de Tocqueville's influential book on America, which did regret the treatment of Native Americans (though I read this decades ago, so take with a grain of salt) wouldn't be published until the 1830s... well after the second edition of *Frankenstein.*  So Shelley couldn't have read it, and probably wasn't very aware of early (early 19th c. United States) disagreements on the cruelties of "Indian Policy."  


3)  The Imperialism angle.  

But even the literary tropes of regret, lament, and compassion for the suffering noble savage mentioned above could have various implications and various things "feeding" into it. 

In the escalation of imperialism that first began stirring (or rather, reviving) around 1815 and peaked in the 1880s & 1890s, there was a growing fascination with--even obsession with--the "dying" or "vanishing" races of primitives. One of the key books here is Patrick Brantlinger's *Dark Vanishings: Discourse on the Extinction of Primitive Races* (2003), which is worth a read (though I think he's a literary scholar, not a historian??).  

Either way, there was a lot of ink spilled by scientists, explorers, missionaries, politicians, poets, and journalists about how the "primitive" peoples were doomed to disappear after contact with "civilized" races. Brantlinger calls this "extinction discourse"... which he sees as an offshoot of imperialist and racist discourses, in that--despite their tone of lament and regret (and in some cases call for efforts at "preservation")--presented this physical/cultural/historical eradication as inevitable... and thus became a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.

Obviously, Charles Darwin is a key figure here.  In his section on “the extinction of races” in *The Descent of Man* (1871) Darwin writes, 

>When civilised nations come into contact with barbarians the struggle is short, except where a deadly climate gives its aid to the native race.

But Brantlinger's work shows how this theme--of primitive races being *doomed*--predates Darwin significantly.  (In fact, the more I learn about Darwin, who published the *Origin of Species* in 1859, the more I see how he really compiled long-standing ideas, observations, and tropes rather than originating them .. but I guess that is always the case in history, there is nothing new under the sun.)  

Anyway, while Darwin's work on "extinctions" of human groups in 1870s was a half-century after Shelley wrote *Frankenstein*, Brantlinger shows how much this idea was in circulation much earlier, even around 1800... which the erudite Shelley would have absorbed.

And, to repeat:  while this notion of the regrettable dislocation of, vanishing of, death of "primitives" (the new "noble savage") was often one that made people feel sympathetic or even sad, it could also be deployed as one more element in the ideological arsenal of empire:

"The primitive civilizations are doomed!  This means there is no reason not to annex this island/sell this rum/beat back this savagery with volley fire...!"

"No, sir, I disagree!   Yes, the primitive civilizations are doomed... but this means that we have the moral obligation to go in and protect them, to minimize the damage, to administer their transition to civilization, to make sure it is done correctly!"

"Good Sirs, I could not disagree with you both more!   Yes, the primitive civilizations are doomed... and so we must fund a Great Museum, in which we will place on display all of the objects and artefacts collected from the primitive peoples, so at least some elements of their primitive culture will be Preserved for All Time!"

All of these themes actually work equally well with imperial expansion.

As an add on question, Josephus' "Testimonium Flavianum" is often cited as the only "non-christian" source that mentions Jesus directly.  How solid is the historical consensus on the validity of this claim?
I may have missed this somewhere, but what evidence is there of document Q? Couldn’t Matthew or Luke have copied the other? 
[deleted]
I've reviewed this question several of the times it has come up on AskHistorians and read the FAQ as this is quite interesting to me. From the perspective of a historian would there be as much/more/less evidence of a similar vein for the existence of the some of the mythological figures, such as Hercules, as compared to the evidence for Jesus?

Firstly, I find the question somewhat problematic in discussing Buddhism and its ideals. Without going into too much detail and losing focus on the main question at hand, it's crucial to discuss how popular western understanding of Buddhism is heavily built upon the work of Buddhist propagation in the 20th century. In the 1900's onwards, Buddhism would begin to truly take hold in Europe and America as a practice, where previously knowledge of the religion (and I do say religion, this is a wholly separate and complicated argument and matter which we will not explore not) mostly came from explorers, missionaries, historians, and philosophers. Theravadin Buddhism occupied the most interest in the first half of the 20th century, accessible due to colonial presence in Theravadin countries. With Japan's defeat in World War II, Zen came to be truly globalized. Tibetan traditions also have a notable presence, greatly due to the political situation of the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the Dalai Lama's subsequent flight and advocacy work. A second wave of immigration from Southeast Asia can be credit from -political, economic, and social instability, prompting growing communities of Vietnamese Mahayanan and Southeast Theravadin traditions.

Why do I mention all this? Because the practice of Buddhism in the west is noticeably different than in Asia. Whereas Western Buddhism heavily focuses on and specializes in meditation and contemplation, the various kinds of Buddhism in Asia treat the religion on a much more intimate, everyday, and cultural level. In the same manner a churchgoer interacts with the community through practice, ritual, holidays, etc, the Buddhist in Asia does not only focus on the dharma, but the relationship with the laity and the monastic. Historically, the monks were the vanguard of the tradition, and they served the community by offering the spiritual, moral, ethical, ritual, educational guidance. Laypersons were observers and offered whatever was necessary to sustain the monastery. The differences in proportion of layperson to monk in the west and east must also be highlighted. Fewer ordained and qualified teachers in the west means the entire practice of Buddhism needed to change, and the monk-layperson relationship drastically adapted to new conditions.

As such, there have been efforts to alter, deemphasis, and deminish the religious and worship aspects of Buddhism, to be compatible with spiritual trends and social circumstances of the mid to late 20th century. We must understand that Christianity's overwhelming historical presence in Europe and America has heavily impacted society and culture. Alternative options to the dominant norm are always sought after, and Buddhism is one of them. This was especially the case in the 20th century, with the growth of New Religion Movements and a tendency to look towards Asia as a guide for spirituality. This further shapes how Buddhism is to be shared and taught with a different kind of audience. (This is why we also see differences today with American Buddhism and Ethnic Buddhism, the kind practiced by ethnic and immigrant communities.) Meditation and personal insight as a means to achieve liberation and spiritual cultivation is a major focus accessible to the laity in America and Europe. It is not just something reserved for the dedicated monks, the common layperson can participate too. And this is compatible with western conditions, as Buddhism offers a path that isn't in servitude towards a God or higher being, but rather, the personal self. This is why we might mainly focus on or understand the dharma and its ideas as concepts such as the paramitas and the Four Noble Truths. It is also critical to distinguish *detachment* from *asceticism*, which is something discussed in the Middle Way and cautioned by the Buddha. Asceticism is an extreme, not encouraged in Buddhism. However, there are historical instances of intensive devotional acts, but this cannot be considered the norm. The lifestyle of the monastic is certainly rigid, restrained, and intense, but ascetic is somewhat of a misleading term.

To return to my main point here, Buddhism in the east and west are engaged and understood differently. We may understand parts of the dharma as removing attachment, reliance, craving, towards material and impermanent things. These elements, of course, aren't neglected in Asia, but the Buddha and other Buddhist figures represent other ideas of wisdom, salvation, guidance, and meaning. This is why you may find gilded figurines and statues in Tibet and Southeast Asia. Why the offering of merit is so crucial to Burmese society. Why temple goers regularly prey and offer incense in China. Simply put, aesthetics, images, and physical, consumable, and tangible things help one to understand and engage with Buddhism. This is effected by, effects, and intermingles with culture of whichever society Buddhism is in. Ostentatious art is just a natural result of this.

**Part 2a - Answering the Main Question, On Statues and Grandiosity**

---

&nbsp;


Okay, so now that we somewhat understand why some arts and aesthetics of Buddhism may be fanciful and extravagant, why are Buddhist statues so darn big?

We must explore this by dividing time between the pre-modern and modern world. Firstly, we can consider the ancient world and earlier Buddhism. I will try to create a narrative from three examples, Central Asia, China, and Japan, each relying on the preceding civilization with the transmission of Buddhism and its art and practices.

Buddhism originated in the Northern India/Nepal region, and made its way south and west. Buddhism would take an immense hold in Gandhara/Central Asia, up until the great social changes of Islamic conquest. As such, Buddhism spread through the Silk Road, and would be impacted by other ideas with it. Alexander's conquests brought the importance of Hellenistic culture to Persia, Central Asia, India, and China. This is significant as the Greco-Roman valuing of the human figure would dramatically influence art in the aforementioned regions. There is some debate in art history regarding the significance and impact of cultures on one another, though. Large statues of human-like and animal figures existed in Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. Subjects can vary, be it royalty, rulers, deities, or other mythological figures. Nevertheless, it could be fair to suggest that Hellenistic, Egyptian, and Persian aesthetic values had some impact on Central Asia.

This is why the Bamyan Statues, destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban, are/were such important examples of early Buddhist art. Previously, depictions of the Buddha and other Buddhist figures in the Gandharan region might take form in stupas and statues, but those would not exceed 10m/33ft in height. The larger Buddha in Bamiyan was 53m/174ft in height, while the smaller was 35m/115ft. Not only that, the famous monk-traveler Xuanzang describes them as to be decorated with precious stones and gold. These large statues would be an imposing and awe-inspiring site, one highly praised by residents and visitors alike. It would also represent the devotion of the people, the power of the ruler, and the admiration and respect followers would have towards the Buddha.
I am a scholar neither of Buddhism nor of Buddhist art. Since I have, however, had occasion to read about the Indo-Greek origins of Buddhist monumental sculpture, I'd like to offer a few provisional comments while we wait for an actual expert on the topic.

First, to make an obvious point, most of those mega-Buddhas were set up in the last 25 years, and should thus be interpreted in the contexts of national/regional pride and modern economic strength. They do, however, draw on an ancient tradition of colossal sculpture - as attested by the world's 18th tallest statue, a ninth-century Buddha near Leshan, China. 

I cannot pretend to trace the combination of religious, economic, and political factors that underpinned the creation of any particular image. But I can call attention to the fact that the tradition of monumental sculpture in Buddhism was very likely inspired, at least in broad outline, by Greek artistic conventions. 

After Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, substantial numbers of Greeks settled in Bactria - roughly northern  Afghanistan and Tajikistan - bringing their language and culture with them. To take a famous example, Ai-Khanoum, a Greek city in the heart of northern Afghanistan, had every amenity of a Hellenistic polis: a gymnasium, a theater, and - most pertinently - dozens of statues depicting gods, heroes, and local worthies. A few of these statues, such as the cult image of Zeus in the city's primary temple, were colossal. 

Ai-Khanoum itself was wiped off the map by nomads in the mid-second century, and the Greek kingdom of Bactria lasted little longer. Many of the Greek settlers, however, fled south into what is now northern Pakistan and northwestern India, which had been a province of the Bactrian kingdom. In this region, a motley assortment of Greek kings reigned, and occasionally ruled, for another century and a half, presiding over a realm in which Greek religion and Greek art coexisted and intermingled with their Indian counterparts. A remarkable number of Greeks converted to - or at least publicly expressed sympathy for - Buddhism, describing themselves as "Yavanas" (a corruption of "Ionians") in dedicatory inscriptions etched into the walls of Buddhist caves. 

The Indo-Greek kingdom disintegrated around the end of the first century BCE, and its territories were soon absorbed by the great Kushan Empire. But in Gandhara, part of the old Indo-Greek heartland, a remarkable artistic tradition, clearly inspired by Hellenistic conventions, continued to thrive. There is some scholarly debate over whether the Greek element so evident in Gandhara art should be understood in terms of Indo-Greek survival or fresh influence conveyed via the Hellenophile Parthians. Whatever its sources, however, the depth of this Greek influence is impossible to deny. 

It was in Gandhara, and during the first century flowering of that region's characteristic Greco-Buddhist art, that some of the earliest known sculptural representations of the Buddha appeared. Until this point, the Buddha had been represented aniconically - often by footprints, a tree, or a stupa. Now, in Gandhara, he began to be represented as a man, in statues that blended traditional Indian depictions of yakshas (nature spirits) with Hellenistic clothing and artistic conventions. [This statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art#/media/File:Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg) is a good example.

Sculpture on a monumental scale was not, of course, a purely Greek innovation. But it was the  Greek-inflected Gandhara tradition, which spread through the Kushan Empire, that dominated the iconography of the colossal (and now tragically destroyed) Bamiyan Buddhas, which may have been begun as early as the third century. As you can see in [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan#/media/File:Buddha_of_Bamiyan.jpg), the robe of the larger Bamiyan Buddha was characterized by the Hellenistic-style drapery of the Gandhara style. 

Does this mean that the colossal statues of the Buddha carved in Central Asia and (later) in China and Japan were directly inspired by the great cult statues of Greek temples? Of course not. Artistic influence is never so simple. But I do think that, in the distant lineage of all the gargantuan Buddhas on Wikipedia's big statue list, you'd find a little Greek DNA. 

This, again, is only a partial answer. But I hope that it can at least complement the definitive response that a true expert will (hopefully) provide.
A similar question has been asked before and answered by u/troymcclurehere [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9bcrll/of_the_top_twenty_tallest_statues_in_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about how the creation and gifting of Buddhist artworks was a way to generate merit, which may help you.

I am no historian, but a study of Buddhism in Japan has been a large focus of my studies in university lately, and I am a student of history. In an extremely oversimplified layman's terms; (forgive me historians who know a LOT more than me, I may be wrong in some respects)

1. Buddhism is not as simple as we think of it. Like Christianity it has MANY sects that range in beliefs on enlightenment/salvation widely. 
From those that believe in a monastery life separate from most of society with strict rules to be reborn as a higher being, to Zen, which focuses on meditation and personal, sudden enlightenment (among other things), to those who believe that simply speaking the name of Amida Buddha is enough to be saved in Amida's pure land (similar to Christian paradise or Heaven in many ways). 

To say Buddhism is all the same is like saying Catholics, protestants, Mormons, and Southern Baptists (among the many, many others) are the same. 

In Japan, historically many sects believed that contributing to a great project like the building of a statue to honor one of the Buddhas could have been seen as a way to get closer to enlightenment or intone the mercy of said Buddha. It was similar to tithes and donations in the Christian church for many sects of Buddhism. 

This doesn't directly answer your question, but I hope it contributes to understanding why some sects do have a greater focus on statues and material representations of spiritual things. 

Simply put, to the western student, sometimes Buddhism feels like a paradox or inconsistent, but to people in the east these paradoxes are often wholly and readily accepted.
Ok, so as far as I can tell the vote was anonymous, thus the problem is that we might never know who did not vote for Hitler in that meeting.

When reviewing the fragmentary early membership lists of the NSDAP, there are a few possibilities who could have voted against Hitler but the most likely is Anton Drexler.

Drexler was one of the  founders of the NSDAP (then named Deutsche Arbeiter Partei, German Workers' Party, DAP) in 1919 and Hitler's main rival for party chairman in 1921. Drexler who had been the second chair of the party had taken over first chair in 1920 when his predecessor Karl Harrer resigned over conflicts with Hitler. A similar fate awaited Drexler, who was unable to mount any serious resistance to Hitler. Hitler had parctically become indispensable for the party by 1921 because of his success as an orator and he guarded that role as well as what he understood as ideological purity of the movement jealously.

In 1920 and 21 the NSDAP was plagued by a shortage of money and by being one among the many völkisch movements in Germany. To alleviate both of these problems, they attempted to merge with other, similar, parties such as the DSP and the Deutsche Werksgemeinschaft. Hitler opposed this because it threatened his supremacy in the party, so he used his own role as leverage. Successfully crashing the DSP negotiations, he attempted the same in connection with the DWG negations but failed and so, in a fit of rage, he threatened to resign several times in 1920 and 1921. Every time, fearing the loss of their popular orator and really, the only thing that set them apart form the dime a dozen völisch parties in Germany, the NSDAP leadership placated Hitler by giving him what he wanted.

Again sent to to convince Hitler not to resign, Drexler asked him in July 1921 what he wanted. Hitler demanded chairmanship and extraordinary powers within the party. While Drexler and Hitler showed their unity on July 1926, Drexler as the current chairman was obviously the choice for those who opposed Hitler within the party and there seem to have been at least some because according to Ian Kershaw, 3000 anonymous pamphlets attacking Hitler had been prepared by the time, the members' meeting rolled around.

So, it might have been Drexler who voted against Hitler, possibly expecting a victory of himself, which obviously didn't pan out. Drexler left the NSDAP when it was dissolved after the Hitler Putsch and only rejoined in 1933 never again to gain any kind of political role until his death in 1942.

Other possibilities include Gottfired Feder, prominent member of the anti-Capitalist movement within the NSDAP, who later served in minor roles in the Nazi adminsitration; the first chairman, Harrer, though it is unknown if he was even there (he died of natural causes in 1926); or one of the lesser known early members about whom little information can be found such as Hans Baumann or Karl Beggel; or it could have been Hitler himself following convention in some parties of abstaining to vote for himself though given his personality that seems rather unlikely. In the end, it probably is not possible to find out with any kind of certainty.

Edit: Apparently, Robert Payne claims that the dissenting vote came from a man called Rudolf Posch, a party member and librarian (who is not to be confused with the Austrian Social Democrat of the same name). I have no idea where this claim comes from. Neither Payne nor Joseph Howard Tyson who also mentions this in his book on Dietrich Eckhart have that fact footnoted, though it is likely that one of them got that fact from the other. I could go and look up his Nazi party file though according to the information in the search engine of the German Bundesarchiv it is rather thin and it seems that man never made any sort of impact on the history of the NSDAP again and what became of him is unknown.

2nd edit: for more on the conflict between Hitler and others in the party see /u/boffcheese comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bs2hk/hitler_won_control_of_the_nazi_party_with_an/d9r1se1/)

Were you allowed to vote for yourself? Or is it known for definite that there was someone voting against the grain?

Could you show me a source for the claim in your question, as far as I know the vote was unanimous, if you're refering to the 29 Juli 1921 vote for the function of *Führer der NSDAP* ?

German quote:


"Doch erst am 29. Juli 1921 fand im Cirkus Krone eine außerordentliche Mitgliederversammlung statt, in der Hitler mit 554 abgegebenen Stimmen einstimmig zum Parteivorsitzenden (Führer der NSDAP) gewählt wurde. Die NSDAP wurde nun völlig auf die Person Hitlers ausgerichtet und dessen Vorstellungen vom Nationalsozialismus für diese als verbindlich eingeführt."

Thank you for the post. As a second generation Korean American, I'm always trying to learn more about the history of Asian Americans - this is something my parents knew little about and schools only taught in passing.

There were two issues I personally had with this post.

First - this is definitely not unique to this post, but anti-Asian American racism and xenophobia are often used interchangeably. Xenophobia is fear of foreigners. In my feeling, conflating the two adds to the "perpetual foreigner" stereotype. Rather than it being a racist attack against fellow Americans, it is being framed as a xenophobic attack against foreigners.

Second - the post (especially the last paragraph) portray Asian Americans as passive victims with limited or no moral agency. If Asian Americans are silent, this post claims, that is because they have internalized this model minority myth...from white people. If Asian Americans are "polite, submissive, and self-sufficient," that's because they have been socialized...by white people. If Asian Americans decide to "accept what gets thrown at them," that's because they've been convinced that it's good to do so...by white people.

In other words, this is arguing that the mindsets that Asian Americans have and the decisions that we make are not fully our own - rather, they are something imposed upon us by white people. So even though Korean culture discourages speaking up, a Korean American not speaking up is due to white people. Even though Korean culture encourages patience and stoicism in the face of adversity, a Korean American not speaking up is due to white people. Even though Korean culture is quite hierarchical and emphasizes deference to authority, a Korean American being "submissive" is due to white people.

By depriving Asian Americans of moral agency and placing white people at the center of this, this perpetuates the narrative that only white people are capable of making moral decisions, while everyone else is just passively dealing with the consequences of said decisions. The implication is that even if white people made *bad* decisions that led to discrimination and inequality, they are still *capable* of making decisions and are therefore *fully human*, unlike other people.
Since Mexico is part of North America too, I'm adapting a part of an [older answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/b4ti11/how_interconnected_was_the_world_of_16th_17th/eja6x9m/) on forced migration of Asians (especially from the Philippines) to colonial Mexico. While much removed in time, I hope it's still relevant to show how anti-Asian sentiments and policies in the Americas go back to the late 16th century. 


For the global Spanish economy, Mexico provided a major trading centre. It was the connecting point between the Peruvian and Mexican silver; the goods traded from China via the Philippines (silk, porcelain…); and Spain. This meant also an often forced movement of people. 

With the huge native American demographic catastrophe, Africans were increasingly brought over to work in households but also in the important mines. Intermixing between native and African people often living in similar conditions became regular. At the same time, from the late 17th c. smaller groups of Asian people came to New Spain from the Spanish Philippines. In both cases they worked in harsh conditions of slavery or forced labor.


What about the **Asian populations in colonial Mexico**? Filipino communities developed in some major cities; and Japanese came to live there. 

 The Philippines had been conquered by the Spanish in 1571 and since then formed an important trade link with New Spain. According to Serge Gruzinski

> Ever Since the Jesuits had set food in the archipelago, Japan had attracted numerous Iberian missionaries and merchants. The establishment of the Spanish in the Philippines had brought Asia closer to Mexico, and made Japan a focal point for royal officials, merchants and monks, all of whom saw it as a providential springboard for the fabulous land of China.

Asians above all from the Philippines started to be brought esp. to Mexico to work under slavelike conditions – so there were people from regions like China, Japan and even India in Mexico, but most Asians came actually from the Spanish Philippines. Usually their categorization was not clear then, so they have only been investigated more in recent years. From van Deusen’s “Global Indios”:

> After 1565, as Spaniards learned to navigate the Pacific currents, and as the Iberian Union (1580–1640) enhanced commercial links between Portuguese and Spanish merchants in South and East Asia, countless numbers of slaves from South and East Asia (and, most notably, from the Spanish and Muslim Philippines) who were categorized as “chinos” began arriving in Mexico and elsewhere.

> They mainly served as domestic laborers and artisans. Although many had originated from the Spanish domains of the Philippines, authorities in Mexico purposefully avoided labeling these “chino” slaves as indios for more than one hundred years so that they could not petition for their freedom as Spanish vassals protected by the New Laws. In fact, it was not until 1672 when a Spanish royal decree declared them to be free indios.

This was a tactic to keep Asian slave labor going decades after most enslavement of indigenous American people had ended. 

At the turn of the century, growing Asian communities existed in West and central Mexico, with an important one in Guadalajara. The comparatively large community in Mexico City was probably in the indigenous San Juan quarter. Quite a few Asian merchants worked daily in the central Parían market. Asians actually dominated the barber trade in the city centre due to their expertise and prices. Even official complaints of the city’s barbers could not break their influence.

As I said, most of the “chinos” in Mexico were actually Filipinos, although there were also Chinese merchants from the Philippines, and a small Japanese presence, which I’ll briefly turn to.

---

The execution of six Franciscan “martyrs” in Japan 1597 became quickly known in Mexico and came as a shock. This event in tandem with Jesuit reports that the highly developed Japanese were the “Spaniards of China” led to an increasing fascination with the region, not only in Europe but also in New Spain. This was affected by other events – including the first two **Japanese diplomatic missions** traveling to Mexico, and the second one from there to Spain and Italy. They made stops in Mexico City in 1610 and 1614 before Japan’s increasing policy of seclusion from the 1620s onwards. 

While not much resulted from these missions in terms of economic or diplomatic exchange, they did further raise interest in Japan. We also know that some members of the missions stayed on in or near Mexico City. The major Nahua (Aztec) historian Domingo de Chimalpahin, living at that time and place, tells us how some members were baptized and stayed on for a few years to work as merchants. 

Most Japanese seems to have returned to Japan by the 1620s due to the mentioned changing Japanese policies; but contact had been made. After Japan was opened up economically centuries later, from the later 19th c. economic exchange with Mexico was taken up again in a different form. 

Finally, both *pardos* (descendants of Africans) and Asians would in the 17th form an important part of the militias, which guarded the important Spanish silver shipments from pirates on Mexico’s west coast. These militias existed, a different and fascinating story. However, according to Slack most of its Asian members were probably Filipinos, then marked as Chinos.

Charles Mann has hypothesized that Japanese samurai might have come over from the Philippines - where they had aided the Spaniards to quell Chinese uprising in Manila in the early 17th c. ; and that these samurai may have aided in the Mexican militias too, but there’s little evidence for this. At least though, Slack finds that one samurai settled in Guadalajara’s Asian community, Diego de la Barranca. He was not destitute but rather must have come from an influential Japanese family, lived in Mexico for the rest of his days, even being granted the prestigious Don title. 

To sum up: While Asian communities were relatively small in colonial Mexico, it's important to underline here slave labor of especially Filipinos continued until the late 17th. century - being outlawed much later than the enslavement of native people by the Spanish Crown, as a "loophole" for discrimination and unfree labor.

*Edit: added some context*
>On 3 November 1885, the Chinese population of Tacoma, Washington was forcefully expelled from the city by city authorities and a mob of white supporters. 

Tacoma now has the [Chinese Reconciliation Park](https://www.tacomachinesepark.org/about-the-tacoma-chinese-garden-and-reconciliation-park/), which is an educational park that is built visually around a Chinese garden, but has educational material about the Chinese expulsion and what happened. If you are local or visit the area, it's a great educational tool.
I apologize if this question is crude or inappropriate, but I've always wondered where the association between Asian people and the color yellow comes from. Does this have a single origination, and what is the historical context? Other race/color pairs--while not wholly accurate or devoid of connotation--at least seem to have some grounding in physical attributes. But Asian people are not yellow, unless they're on The Simpsons, and indeed "Asian" is such a broad category that encompasses a staggering range of skin colors. Again, I know this is a sensitive topic and I apologize if my question even borders on racism, I assure you it's just ignorance on the part of a sheltered white boy from the suburbs. But where else would I get a nuanced and properly contextualized answer?
This post *does* do a good job at providing a short history of anti-Asian racism in North America. And I agree that /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov *has* addressed the portion of [/u/TheGuineaPig21's question](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m9bmbq/the_atlantaarea_murders_were_racially_motivated_a/grlyrz9/) about the details of the subreddit's rules quite capably. 

However, Zhukov has *not* addressed the more important portion of his criticism: that the second-to-last paragraph of this post, the one that's supposed to provide the tie to the current event that inspired it, is easily its weakest link. There the moderation team makes authoritative, conclusively-phrased statements about minute details of the motives underlying a mass murder which hasn't even been *under investigation* for a week, let alone gone to trial.

I wholeheartedly agree with /u/TheGuineaPig21 that it is ludicrously premature to conclude that racism played no part in the shooter's motivations. The inference is even a *reasonable* one, given the news reports that quote an eyewitness as saying the shooter was yelling about 'killing all Asians.' 

And yet.

No matter how laudable the broad goal of combating racism may be, and no matter how foul this man's actions were, /r/AskHistorians' high epistemic standards are what makes it what it is. And a reasonable inference from news reports that quote a single eyewitness is not the kind of evidence that is typically regarded as adequate around here- perhaps for the kind of millennia-old event in Classical Rome about which only one primary source even *exists*, but certainly not for anything as extensively-documented as a 21st century American capital murder trial. The information we have to date amounts to a Rorschach test upon which one can project their existing biases and instincts, nothing more- and I hope to see the moderation team of /r/AskHistorians resist the temptation to engage in such exercises in the future.

This is not to say that current events should be altogether avoided. A version of the mod team's post with the title changed and the next-to-last paragraph excised, simply providing context on the United States' history of anti-Asian racism without ill-advised speculation *directly and immediately* relating it to a current event, would have been both wholly unobjectionable from the point of view of academic standards and a positive contribution to the nation's discussion of an incredibly important subject.

But as an Asian-American (I hate starting a sentence like this, but in the modern climate I feel it has become necessary), I am far more disturbed by the myth of "the myth of the model minority" than by the myth of the model minority. We are more than a model minority; we are model Americans. Asian parents have high expectations of their chlldren, maintain strong family structures, and pride themselves on the educational attainment of themselves and their children, all factors which lead to outsized success.

Success breeds envy, and there has been a concerted effort to suppress Asian enrollment in elite educational institutions. A great example is the lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard. Yes, the white man who founded the organization has led a long-term, concerted effort against Affirmative Action. But the information that has been revealed by this lawsuit is damning against Harvard. Since Asians were scoring hundreds of points higher than comparable white applicants on standardized tests, Harvard systematically assigned Asian applicants lower "personality ratings" in order to justify their exclusion \[1\]. We are all aware of harmful, dehumanizing stereotypes of "Asian robots". Harvard put this into action to ensure that white students remained in the majority (unlike, for example, UC Berkeley; there, racial discrimination in admissions is forbidden and Asians outnumber whites).

Meanwhile, the past year has seen several municipalities change admissions criteria for the stated purpose of "increasing diversity", but really for the purpose of eliminating the Asian population. Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, for example, was 73% Asian. Lowell High School in San Francisco was 50.6% Asian. 75% of Stuyvesant School in New York City was Asian. All have changed admissions policies in a way that will sharply increase the white, black, and Hispanic population and get rid of the Asians.

I am a brown-skinned Asian American and yes, there have been some nervous moments in airport security, but the most significant discrimination I have faced in my life was in college admissions. Thanks to the recent lawsuits I know exactly how they discriminated against me: by assigning me a lower "personality score" because like all the other Asians with high SAT scores, stellar grades, and piano skills, I am more of a clone than a fully human individual with hopes and dreams. Doesn't matter; succeeded anyway in spite of them.

I don't join Asian activist groups because none of them speak for me. None of them will call out racism, discrimination, and white supremacy when it is done cynically in the name of racial justice. If we are speaking of "flattening" Asian Americans, then perhaps you could stop pretending we are monolithically left-wing. Yes, most of us vote blue, in increasing numbers. Who else am I supposed to vote for when the other side is so racist and xenophobic and wants to shut down the immigration that makes our country so great? That doesn't mean I want anything to do with an ideology that justifies punishing people who look like me for working hard and striving for success.

EDIT: Obligatory thanks for the award, anonymous redditor. I know I don't speak for everyone, but I speak for some - and that's important. I struck out the whiny preface at the beginning and am grateful for the AH community for not downvoting or deleting a post that I suspect does not align with the majority opinion among readers. Some respondents have asked for sources for my claim. This is a perfectly reasonable request and I will work my way through it this week.

For those who quietly agree with me but are afraid to speak out, please check out [https://www.fairforall.org/join-us/](https://www.fairforall.org/join-us/), an organization that was founded recently to fight back against "...a cynical and intolerant orthodoxy. This  orthodoxy requires us to view each other based on immutable  characteristics like skin color, gender and sexual orientation. It pits  us against one another, and diminishes what it means to be human." This is what \*real\* antiracism looks like.

Well shit that explains a lot. Learned a little about history, learned a little about myself and how to frame recent events. Thanks
This is a good summary of the history of anti-Asian racism in North America, but it does not seriously attempt to prove its title, or justify the (mod-sanctioned) violation of the 20 year rule. Quoting from a previous [rules roundtable on the importance of the 20 year rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/45wqkl/rules_roundtable_5_the_current_eventsmodern/):

>You need to only look at news reporting on recent events to get a sense of just how problematic questions on, perhaps, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Arab Spring, or the Invasion of Iraq might be, even discounting people throwing their opinions into the fray. We can see this from past events, such as World War II, where immediate reporting was often wildly off-base, and in some cases it would take many decades for real, solid understanding of certain events to materialize. To borrow from /u/restricteddata who eloquently answered once before on this topic:

>>It is comparatively straightforward (though there is always room for interpretation) to talk about historical trends. But the closer you get to the present, the less we know about where things are going, what really went on, what really mattered. **We usually lack deep knowledge of sources, as well, and are reliant on journalistic accounts — the "first draft" of history that is not really history at all, and in retrospect is often severely lacking in the "whole story."**

I do not condone any acts of bigotry and I think it is *very* premature to conclude that racism played no part in the shooter's motivations. But there are very valid reasons why emotionally-charged subjects like this are excluded from discussion here, and its part of what makes this subreddit so useful as a resource (especially compared to the rest of Reddit, which suffers from endless partisan bickering). I dislike the moderators abrogating the rule for themselves, regardless of the intent.
I just want to say thank you to the Mod-team for serving as such an insightful and respectful resource. Much appreciated.
Not to make light of the issues people from East Asia have faced, but given that 9/11 was 20 years ago now I feel history has not done a well enough job of documenting the hate and racism all Asian-Americans faced after that tragedy. I would love to see sources touching on a subject like that as well if possible.

Thanks for sharing, these are all highly insightful.

I‘ll be adding that to my list. And kudos to the mods for this highly informative post!
Sorry if this is one too many thank you comments, 

I appreciate both this specific post and the posts of this type written by the mods. They provide good bases of knowledge about emotionally charged events like this one. I also appreciate the removal of the various racist and/or misogynistic comments this thread has received. 

I've been with my Taiwanese-American partner for nearly six years now; it's terrifying to think about the individualized attacks she has faced and the devastating attacks she could face. 

Where the Myth of the Model Minority is a silencing ideology, it creates a moral imperative for others to speak up, spread awareness, and help Asian-Americans/Canadians reclaim their voice. 

Basically, thanks mods.
I studied Anthro, and am myself desi. I've been dropping this comment on threads about anti-Asian racism. I'd happily take feedback from a historian's perspective.

Orientalism is not a specific set of racist stereotypes, but rather a system by which racism can work. Due to economic and geopolitical factors at the time, European exercise of imperialist power in Asia was a bit different than elsewhere in the world. While of course this happened to some extent everywhere, European ingress into Asia required more negotiation with and participation with the native social and cultural systems, as opposed to outright conquering and imposition. They got around to conquering and imposition in the long run, but they did so in a way which forced them to engage directly in a highly complex millennia-old culture. This naturally created some cognitive dissonance: how do you justify rule over someone else on the basis of their inferiority, when everyday you're being forced to confront the complexity of their culture? The answer was Orientalism, or the theory that 'civilization' could be split into two types, the intellectual, rational West, and the mystic, unchanging East.

&#x200B;

This is significant, because it produces a fundamentally distinct system of racism. Racism against African and Indigenous American people is often grounded on the (fallacious) premise that they are barbarous, and do not have true civilization. Racism against Asians is typically grounded on a different premise, that they have civilization, but that it is mystic civilization. It's not that cut-and-dry, of coarse. For example, you definitely see Orientalism at play against cultures like the Aztecs, and there are certainly tropes of barbarity employed against Asians sometimes. Mainstream narratives of racism can be violent against non-Asians as well by obscuring patterns of Orientalism in their own history. But broadly speaking, an observable distinction exists. This can often foster problems in modern antiracist activism, because our perceptions of racism are grounded in studying the history of the development of racism against people of African and Indigenous American origin. So for example, antiracist activists will observe attitudes towards Asians along the lines of, "look how civilized they are," and come to the conclusion that actually racism against Asians isn't so bad. But that fails to take into account that most atrocities against Asian people have specifically been justified on the premises that Asians embody a 'dangerous' mystic civilization.

&#x200B;

Orientalism views Asian culture as unchanging and monolithic. This is the other side of the coin to the perceived mysticism of Asian culture, which is meant to differentiate it from the perceived rationalism of western culture. 'Mysticism' also decontextualizes Asian culture from its context. The West is seen as rational, therefore the things that happen in the West are explicable by studying them in nuance. But the East is seen as mystical, meaning that things just sorta happen there (this is if you're looking through the racist lens of Orientalism). Meaning that the East supposedly can be explained simply through observation of what happens there. The East becomes responsive not to its own history, but to the context of the Western gaze. Thus, the East becomes monolithic, because it functions largely as a proxy for the West to enact its own ideas about itself.

&#x200B;

This monolithic nature to Orientalism comes to play quite often in western discourse. The East becomes either a monolith of the abuse of power, or a monolith of victimhood at the feet of the West. But what the East can never be, at least in the context of Orientalism, is the product of complex historical and cultural systems which incorporate imperialism both internal and external, systems of power both internal and external, and both internalization of globalized western culture as well as continuity of existing indigenous culture.

&#x200B;

This complexity can seem intimidating. But we view Western culture in its full complexity all the time. Answer this: My computer monitor is a square, all squares have four sides, how many sides does my computer monitor have? If you answered four, you just used a syllogism. Syllogistic logic was first detailed in a formal fashion by Aristotle, who also had some interesting thoughts concerning the Athenian polity, an institution involving slavery and deep misogynies. That doesn't inhibit our ability to apply syllogistic logic, and the idea that we can't distinguish the two things probably seems absurd. This is the Orientalist bias at play. Years of history has programmed us to default into distinguishing elements of "Western" culture while homogenizing elements of "Eastern" culture. The rational West set against the mystic East.

&#x200B;

And syllogistic logic isn’t actually as universal as you might think it is. There are other equally significant models of formal logic. For example, dharmic philosophy standardized its first models of formal logic around the same time as the Greeks did. They then went on to solve many of the same basic logic problems as the Greeks, and at roughly the same pace. Here’s the catch. Both schools got the same answers despite the fact that they work in fundamentally different fashions. Greek formal logic is based on syllogistic logic, formalizing the meaning of an expression. In syllogism, the answer given by solving the expression will always be correct, but expressions are limited in the kind of problems they can solve. Dharmic formal logic is based on technical logic, formalizing the organization of an expression. That's kinda like ignoring whether a sentence makes sense in favor of whether it’s grammatically correct. Technical logics require you to accept prima facie that no correct answer is guaranteed, but that the process of answering will yield information, if not a valid solution. Less reliable, but vastly more flexible.

&#x200B;

It’s incredibly cool that something as ‘common sense’ as syllogism turns out to actually not be as common sense as you might think. And that matters historically. Algebra, one of the foundational concepts in all modern mathematics, was essentially formed out of the merger of Greek algorithmic logic with Sanskrit formal grammars under the rule-based organizational framework of Islamic jurisprudence. Algorithmic logic descends from syllogistic logic. Sanskrit grammar is intertwined with theories of technical logic. As for Islamic jurisprudence, that’s a deeply complex cultural tradition in its own right. It’s a tragedy of Orientalism that only ⅓ of the perspectives which went into creating Algebra goes appreciated. Everyone likes to bring up Arabic and Indian contributions to mathematics as an antiracist “fun fact”, but reducing the full breadth of Nyaya technical logic and Arabic jurisprudence to a small piece of trivia is actually only replicating the underlying racist bias of Orientalism. Now consider what it would be like if these elements of culture weren’t just bits of trivia, but the way you see and interact with the world. That's an existential threat. It's not about credit. It's about being made to feel like aliens for the things which are as intuitive to us as: if a then b, and if b then c, then if a then c.

&#x200B;

People often feel overwhelmed when faced with the complexity and nuance of different types of racism. That's totally understandable and it's a very natural. But it's also a function of how racism against Asia operates. Because the complexity in question applies to pretty much all cultures. And yet it tends not to trigger the same sort of dread in conjunction with "Western" culture, or forms of racism that are more immediate to the West, as it does for the "East". This is a really deeply situated bias, and I'm not ascribing it to any single person personally. In fact, even among Asian people there's still internalized Orientalism. It really is inescapable. But I think that identifying and confronting it can help to challenge that fear of facing a complex world, and lead to better, more informed stances in the long-run.

My cultural background is in the Sahaja tradition, and in my family, I'm the only person of my generation who is trained in the tradition. Of the older generations, there are only three people left, and they're getting quite old. By the end of this decade, it's likely that I'll be the last of us. This despite young people in my family being proud of their identity, and my family putting emphasis on protecting our heritage. Why is it fading? Because of the crushing pressure that gets put on us to assimilate and conform, a pressure that I think goes unrecognized. As Asians, it might seem like we're treated better, but the moment we embody complexity or nuance, the hammer really comes down. I'm not trying to establish a competition between myself and those of other identities. This stuff is contextual. I genuinely don't think that it can be compared. But I also think people need to appreciate that violence against Asian people is way more normalized than they realize. It goes unnoticed because it's more polite and therefore invisible. But we're talking about the eradication of entire cultures here. That's plain old violence, and it takes a mental toll. If antiracism can't see ethnic cleansing for what it is, how can it call itself antiracist?
Thank you for this! As an Asian American, it's important to understand the historical context to the racism our community has faced and currently faces. 

I have one question that maybe this community can help me understand/study/navigate better, but I've seen a disturbing trend on online forums, about the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, that blames the Black community for anti-Asian sentiment and racism -- and that it's the black community that's mainly to blame for the rise in violence. It's my understanding that this pernicious rhetoric stems from the model minority myth, that has divided our communities for decades and fostered anti-Asian sentiment and anti-Black sentiment in both communities for the benefit of white nationalism. 

However, whenever I bring this up and attempt to explain that, I get met with a lot of disdain and called a boba liberal, even from members of my own Asian American community. 

Am I wrong to associate the current extremely popular (and I believe racist) rhetoric spreading around the forums, that the black community is to blame, as stemming from this model minority myth? Are there sources or books that connect and detail this phenomenon? What has the true history of Black/Asian community dynamics been? And is there historical evidence that it's been shaped by white nationalism?

Also, anti-affirmative action sentiment seems to always be thrown in the mix of all this and Asians used as a wedge to push that agenda. What's the history behind that? 

Okay, that's more than one question. Sorry, there's been a lot of misinformation being thrown around out there, and I'd like to get things cleared up.
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but the racism shows up in harmful and insidious ways other than physical violence.  In 2018, in Gwinnett county (metro Atlanta), Asian Americans were the most likely to have thier ballots rejected (it's the only data I could quickly find).  https://psmag.com/social-justice/georgia-voter-suppression-targets-urban-areas
There's no evidence that the victims were prostitutes and the massage parlors are brothels.

And yet, the police announcement that the shooter had a sex addiction made people automatically assume the victims were prostitutes.

So, the victims have automatically been labelled as sex workers, which completely dehumanizes these women and somehow justifies the violence against them and makes it seem like it's their fault.

And now everyone is perpetuating the stereotype that Asian women working in massage parlors are all prostitutes.

Killing them wasn't enough. These women (most of them were grannies) have to be insulted and called prostitutes!

This is what infuriates me the most!
Like so many others, I appreciate this post very much. This right here is the reason this sub is one of the best curated spaces on reddit. 


In addition to all the listed sources, Edward Said's *Orientalism* is a great starting point for an overall glimpse into the project of colonization of the East*. It is a dense read but it is richly sourced and a rigorous study (and has led me down many many paths of history since).


** Colonization here not merely in the militaristic sense but also through academia, journalism, depictions in media, dehumanizing & mystifying Oriental culture and rituals, establishing it as the "other", studying it - as if it was a "thing" to be examined. Its infantalization & savage-ification. From Napoleon's invasion of Egypt to the East India company owning most of the Indian subcontinent. From the Lawrence of Arabia to James Bond to Indiana Jones to the Mummy. From Flaubert to Arabian Nights.

All of the good stuff.
Thank you for this. Thank you for using an educational platform to spread awareness. I'm so thankful to have found this community.
this is a good and interesting writeup, altho I am familiar in passing w/ the history of the (US) anti-Asian immigration laws of the 20th and 21st century it feels like most non-academic documentaries and writings leave it there after those laws are repealed and just end suddenly as if everything is totally fine for Asian and Asian-American people. the additional 70 years between then and now re: re-stereotyping Asian immigrants is something that doesn't seem to be discussed too often esp. in the context of the greater civil rights movement which explains why a lot of people apparently can't (or won't) understand how this could be a racially motivated attack.
What were some of the events that caused the removal of some of the more racist anti-immigration laws? What was the motivation? Was it related to the Civil Rights Movement?
I want to add my sincerest thanks as well. I'll be sharing this with family and friends to jump start their education on this subject. Truly, the only silver lining when trajedy strikes is that it can turn into a teaching moment. I take solace in the fact that thousands+ will see this and learn something new. I certainly did. And this is why r/askhistorians is my fave sub. Keep on keeping on.

As an Asian American, the events on March 16 were just heart wrenching, as were subsequent discussions on the suspect's "motives." So bless you all for shedding light on forgotten and often untaught sordid history of anti-Asian sentiment, violence, and racism in America and Canada.  For the first time, I feel like our plight, invisibility, is being noticed and legitimized on a more epic scale, and it starts by giving a voice to the actual victims with historical context. Trends and patterns. 

And this conversation seems rote by now... Racial injustice doesn't just happen out of nowhere.  No one should be surprised. And yet many are. Or indifferent.  I feel immense sorrow that, yet again, it has to take mass murder (or murder in general!) to spotlight prevalent issues in our society that a large percentage of our population doesn't think needs fixing, or remain willfully ignorant that it does. Or they go the lazy route and blame the victims. Just sad.
r/AskHistorians is my favorite part of the internet. Things like this is why.  Thank you for educating me.
Thank you for this insight into history I was unaware and for making sure information and acts are put in the historical context.
Thanks, seriously.
Thank you so much for making this post. It was educational and enlightening and I'm happy to share it.
Have you acquainted J Sakai's historical account of asian-american struggles? Do you think it adequately portrays the nature of popular and institutional hurdles against asians in the states?
Excellent post. Thank you.

Is it possible to speak to the term "Chinaman's Chance" and its origins?
Thank you for this post, it was very enlightening.
Thank you for this wonderful history lesson! I wish I was taught this in school.
I think this is has been an especially provocative instance of harm, confusing people trying to draw lines. For me as a white straight man, I feel like I couldn’t put my finger on it until I looked at motivation and intention as something that is still shaped by our racist and sexist history. Regardless of mental health, social exclusion, religious delusion, self hatred, sexual frustration, it was ultimately a white man using power against other people, mostly of whom were women and Asian. Just because in his eyes there wasn’t a racial component, doesn’t mean that it wasn’t inherently racist by the definition of racism. Even white supremacy, which seems to imply someone who is intentionally participating in it, is no less real from someone who is not intentionally participating in it. And it’s important to acknowledge all aspects of this if we want to understand and change society for the better.

Edit: also, we seem to equate violence/murder/harm with hate when we talk about racism and sexism, but that can be an oversimplification of motivation when we overlook mental instability. Someone who throws their own life away along with their victims is absolutely mentally unhinged, and while that doesn’t excuse or justify the harm they cause, it should motivate efforts to foster a mentally healthier society. That includes addressing racism and sexism.
Cant believe redditors were defending this man and saying that its not a hate crime. It just shows how they don't see Asians as people.

I study early islamic history and history of islamic theology so I can take a crack at this. 

First, I would like to challenge the question’s own wording: no major “sects” actually hold a stance against women education. Rather, individual actors within different sects use generalized rulings and claim the case of women’s education falls under the general umbrella of said ruling. An important first concept to unravel here is the idea of Ejma’a, I.e. Consensus. Most major islamic sects, including Sunni and Shia, believe that if the majority of reputable scholars agreed on a ruling within a given timeframe then this does imply that it is in fact what Allah wants. The actual definition of Ejma’a is a lot more strict and lengthy than this of course, and naturally there can be disagreements about whether a specific matter have reached consensus or not. However, for the interest of brevity, I will not expand on those.

In Sunni school of thought, a clear promise of "[Allah] protecting the message" in the Quran is the basis for equating Ejma'a with Allah's will. The rationale goes that if all reputable scholars were to agree on a wrong interpretation of the Quran then the message certainly will be lost. Given that Allah promised to protect the message, wrong Ejma'a isn't a possibility. Other sects have their own interpretation to the source of thr validity of Ejma'a, with the most notable being the Shia's Ma'soomoon.  

Essentially, most islamic sects agree on the legislative power granted by Ejma’a even though some disagreements between sects exist as to why exactly does consensus equate authenticity of claim. This is why Sunni’s give themselves the title of Ahl AlSunnah wa AlJamma’a, People of the Sunnah and Ejma’a. This title is supposed to hint at the two main sources which can be used to infer islamic rulings: either a direct ruling on an identical matter discussed in AlSunnah (i.e. the life and teaching of Prophet Mohammed) or by inference. In inference, a scholar attempts to project a modern issue into a comparable one in AlSunnah, where a direct ruling does not exist. Rulings on camels and carts are sometimes extrapolated on all methods of transportation, for instance. When sufficiently enough reputable scholars agree on the projection, the ruling reaches an Ejma’a status. 

As far as my knowledge goes, no direct quote from Sunnah nor an Ejma’a exists to discourage women’s education in any of the major islamic sects. In fact, many texts do encourage pursuing knowledge and education regardless of sex. For instance, the Hadith “whoever is pursuing a path of knowledge is pursuing the path to heaven” is generally understood to be unisex. As you stated, the wives and daughters of the prophet were major scholars; AlBukharri and Muslim had multiple female teachers etc. In fact, most of the surviving literature on any voices speaking against educating women in the medieval islamic period reached us through texts directly written to refute them. Famously AlJahith dedicated entire sections of AlBayan Wa AlTibyan to mock those views as he did not view them worthy of a proper refutal. 

Where then, do some individuals drive the power to make educating women haram? A second concept is needed in here: the islamic doctrine of giving means the same halal-haram categorization as their end. If a halal act inevitably leads to a haram one, or is made in pursuit of a  haram act, then the halal act is ruled as haram. Once again, most islamic sects agree on this general rule itself, but scholars even within one sect disagree as to when it is applicable and when is it not. A famous application of this rule all sects agree is a wrong application is forbidding farming grapes in fear that it might enable someone to make wine out of it. Again, this is an example that is used to teach a _wrong_ application of the rule. The commonly used correct application however is forbidding insulting unislamic idols. The reasoning here is that inevitably insulting idols of practitioners of other religions leads to hatred, wars, and deaths. This general rule is known as the rule of Sadd Althara’e.

Where some applications of rule of Sadd Althara’e are agreed upon one way or the other, it historically has been the easiest rule to abuse. One can see both the importance of such a rule, but also how easy it is to abuse to fit anyone’s agendas in forbidding an act as long as they can conjure up a hypothetical scenario in which said act inevitably leads to a haram act.

This all goes to show that the restriction of women’s education in question is not tied to a specific sect but rather to individuals choosing to enforce the rule of Sadd Althara’e under their geographical range of influence. This precisely is why you find two countries of similar islamic sects having different rules, and why the Taliban can feel justified switching back and forth between allowing and disallowing education for women. Proponents of prohibition would readily admit that no islamic text directly forbids education for women, but they will strongly argue the existence of inevitable haram consequences. Justifications vary way too wildly to count, and the reader is encouraged to play their own mental gymnastics to connect a haram act to education. 

According to Dr. Ahmed AlBassam, the history of western colonization or forced influence to the islamic world cannot be ignored in this regard. While education in general long existed in the region, the modern structure of K12-BS-MS-PhD as well as the structure of each given subject is still viewed as a wildly western import in the region. The history of colonization leads some to view this import with a lot of skepticism and as another mean of western cultural domination in the region. This skepticism leads to viewing western education as more of a necessary evil contact with which to be reduced if possible. It is no coincidence, AlBassam says, that countries more hostile towards western powers end up viewing education with a demonic look as apposed to countries with friendlier relations.

The influence of culture-based patriarchal power structures too cannot be ignored, as it determines which subgroup of society get the duty/privilege to perform that “necessary evil” when western-structured education is viewed in that manner. I will attempt to return later to elaborate on the last two points and answer questions.

Although I'll swing back to the circumstances around 1876, to start off, I'm going to turn this question on its head and look at why voter turnout *declined* in the elections following. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.

So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite "loopholes" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.

This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.

It can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at "demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.

So as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.

To discuss the 1876 presidential election, let's rewind the clock...

FIRST to the 1860 presidential election, where 81.2% of eligible voters (white men) participated. This heated election was a four-way split with Abraham Lincoln (Republican), John C. Breckinridge (the breakaway pro-slavery Southern Democrat), Stephen A. Douglas (the mainstream Democrat, often referred to as a "Northern Democrat"), and John Bell (Constitutional Union, a third party neutral on slavery issues). The electoral college went to Lincoln, sealing his victory, but the popular vote was not in his favor (39.8%, meaning 60~% of Americans did not vote for Lincoln). Lincoln's election - and the indifference re: secession from the lame duck president, James Buchanan - among *many* other issues regarding slavery - provoked South Carolina into leaving the Union, followed by several states in early 1861 and the establishment of the Confederacy.

NEXT presidential election is 1864 during the war itself. Turn-out continues to be high (73.8%) which is  impressive considering the number of white men away from home in the battlefield and the new introduction of absentee voting. As to be expected, there is widespread voter fraud. The Union soldiers backed Lincoln, though, and he won the day again. The Civil War ends in 1865, and Lincoln is assassinated soon after. He is replaced by his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, who Republicans do not want to remain in power because he was a bit too sympathetic with white Southerners and showed bigotry towards newly freed African-Americans.

NEXT presidential election is 1868: former Civil War Union general, Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against New York Governor Horatio Seymour (Democrat). Another high turnout (78.1%). It's electoral slaughter with Grant winning triple digits against Seymour's ninety. But, as with Lincoln's 1860 election, Grant does have a struggle in the popular vote, where Seymour receives a healthy 47~%. This is the first time African-Americans, newly freed from slavery, could vote. In contrast, some white Southerners had not yet gained back their voting rights from their treasonous turn against the U.S. government. Entire states (VA, MS, TX) were termed "unreconstructed" and had no electoral vote.

NEXT presidential election is 1872: the incumbent Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against Horace Greeley (Liberal Republican, a breakaway party from the Republican party). The Democrats did not run anyone, throwing their support behind Greeley. The turn-out (71.3%) was less high, in part because of the confusion with the Democrats' absence and the split Republican ticket. Still much higher than we see today, which fluctuates in the 50s%. Very strangely, Greeley actually died during the vote counting process. Even more strangely, his wife had died the week before the election, so he spent his few weeks left on Earth in a grief-stricken daze. 

And FINALLY we get to the 1876 presidential election. Presidential elections for the past four cycles had been intense, fraught, and significant for the future of America. You have the spoiler number: 81.8% of eligible voters participated. Certainly, by 1876, American men recognized the importance of the presidential election and their individual vote in the race. In particular, there was a real obsession with what would happen between the Republican and Democratic parties, as they've undergone great stresses in the last sixteen years. Yes, the Civil War was won, but Reconstruction had taken a real toll on both parties. Unlike in the 1872 presidential election, Democrats decided to run and campaign hard.

Our two candidates: Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes (Republican) against New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden (Democrat). Incumbent Republican President Grant decides not to run for a third term, in part because of accusations of corruption in his administration. Democrats had not won a presidential election since the 1856 presidential election twenty years prior.

Issue 1:  White Southerners hated Reconstruction. The white leaders of the Southern states were sick of U.S. federal forces' occupation and influence on state/local governments in the South. Thus, the white South seemed poised to vote Democrat. During the 1876 election season, numerous incidents of pro-Democrat, anti-black violence occurred, including an ugly series of events throughout South Carolina (remember: the first state to secede in 1860). One such event, the Hamburg Massacre, made it clear to white Southerners that anti-black violence / voter intimidation would not be stopped by federal Republican officials, leading to more violence and voter fraud on Election Day. Consequentially, resentment towards "carpetbagger" Northerners and Republicans was now intertwined with resentment towards freed African-Americans. Note that in 1876 (11 years post-war) three ex-Confederate states still were under Republican governmental control: Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. And white Southerners hated this ongoing federal Reconstruction: it denied them self-government. They wanted it over. The Democrats agreed. Strangely, so did many Republicans by 1876. It didn't matter: the Democrats had a stronghold in the South founded on resentment of federal intervention and a rejection of black progress.

Issue 2: The Civil War was not fully over. Many Republicans  resented the rise of the ex-Confederate back to his full voting rights. One campaign song, ["The Voice of the Nation's Dead,"](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.23702100/) included lyrics such as "Our Country from all Traitors we must save" (traitors being ex-Confederate Southerners) and "Tilden aided Treason" (re: Tilden's conservative anti-Republican views). Republicans contrasted Hayes' valorous military service in the Union Army (he was repeatedly wounded but continued to serve) with Tilden's war-time criticism of Lincoln and disdain for Republicanism. Republicans even accused Tilden and Democrats of [inspiring intimidation and violence of Northern men](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.12804700/)  (the so-called "carpetbaggers", who brought all their belongings to the South in bags made from carpet) who had relocated South at the polls. Republicans "Waved the Bloody Shirt" of the Civil War, as it was known then.

Issue 3: In 1876, the United States was struggling economically. Since 1873, the country had been suffering through an economic depression and financial panic, which incited frustration against the incumbent Republican party, who many blamed. More people show up to vote to expel the incumbent party when times are rough. (A more recent example of this case is Herbert Hoover and FDR in the Great Depression.) So, surprisingly, the Democrats have an edge by having NOT been in presidential power for a while.

Issue 4: That strange third party from the 1872 presidential election: the Liberal Republicans. These undecided men had to find a new home, and the Democrats went in for the embrace. They took on the policies of Liberal Republicans and propped up Tilden as their candidate: an anti-Tammany Hall, anti-corruption honest man. Liberal Republicans, who had been repulsed by the corruption in Reconstruction and the Grant administration in 1868 and 1872 terms, were pleased with the nomination. BUT the Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes looked equally as good, if not better, for his life-long dedication to honor and honesty, and of course, this was naturally their home party. When Republicans rejected a candidate interested in the spoils system and chose Hayes, the party won back many Liberal Republicans, though notably not all.

Issue 5: The swing states - oh the swing states! If you look at [the electoral map for the 1876 election,](https://www.270towin.com/1876_Election/) you'll see some states far North have gone blue (Democrat). Tilden campaigned hard in his home state of New York, and he won it (note: NY had gone Republican in 1860, 1864, and 1872). Several other states swung Democrat that were situated around New York, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, which were key to achieving electoral victory. Further west, Indiana also proved to be a contested ground, with the difference of five thousand voters turning the state in favor of Tilden and the Democrats. 

The swing states added up: by the end of the Election Night, Tilden and the Democratic Party had amassed 184 electoral college votes, one shy of winning the whole thing. But those three aforementioned states under federal reconstruction - Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana - were in dispute. (So was Colorado, which had just become a state). These 20 votes cast the whole election into confusion, leading to a massively political/cultural mess called the Compromise of 1877 (which put Hayes into the presidency and officially ended federal Reconstruction).

Oh - and finally, perhaps most importantly - Issue 6: Fraud. So much fraud. The percentage - 81.8% - is based on *reported* numbers of ballots cast. Corruption raised hell during the 1876 presidential election in terms of counting votes. South Carolina boasted 101% of eligible voters participated in the election. Florida and Louisiana similarly saw inflated numbers. Democrats threatened both black and white Republicans with violence in the South. Not to be outdone, several Northern states also saw inflated and almost impossible numbers of eligible voters coming to the polls. This massive amount of fraud led to the electoral confusion and disputed Southern states, which in turn brought about the Compromise of 1877.

So whether 81.8% of eligible American voters in 1876 actually participated... will never be known. But, without a doubt, the 1876 presidential election was both impressively strange and contentious.

Follow up question. With the literacy gap in the country at the time, as a consideration, can these turnout numbers really be trusted?

They would have also seen him as a scumbag, but not quite as much of one, and not necessarily for quite the same reasons. (It, of course, would also depend on who this audience was.) 

As you note, "Goddard"'s book was actually based on a real book, The Rising Tide of Color by Theodore Lothrop Stoddard. Stoddard was probably one of the most generally popular scientific racists at the time that The Great Gatsby was published. He actually published another book the same year as The Great Gatsby, with the same publisher, Charles Scribner's Sons; Scribner also published influential works of scientific racism by one of the movement's founders, Madison Grant, as well as many others of their ilk.  Jonathan Spiro, who wrote a biography of Grant, assumes that "Goddard" is actually a mashup of Grant and Stoddard, while other writers refer only to Stoddard. The main thing to note here is that the ideas of scientific racism that Tom discusses in the passage you reference were absolutely in the mainstream; they were not unopposed (in fact, it arose in parallel with Boasian anthropology, which stood in direct opposition to its principles and which was mocked by scientific racism at least in part because Boas was Jewish) but were pervasive and influential in the American (white) mainstream.

Scientific racism (very briefly) was the belief that race is an innate biological concept that can be explained evolutionarily. It originated in the 18th century as early naturalists and anthropologists  placed humans within the animal kingdom and differentiated them by "species." As these ideas grew  more popular, it became more and more accepted to not just classify the races by their appearances and biological characteristics but to rank them, whether in terms of their intelligence, their beauty (particularly that of their women), their hygiene, and their ability to be productive members of society, among other things, and as Darwinian evolution became accepted, it soon was incorporated to give a feeling of urgency to the situation- that the races were competing with each other and that lesser races could "pollute" higher ones. These ideas became popular enough that they became influential on government policies in the US and elsewhere- immigration policy, sterilization policies, and anti-miscegenation laws, among others, were clearly and heavily influenced by scientific racism and eugenics to the extent that scholars generally consider that Nazi Germany was heavily influenced by the US in this matter. 

Essentially, then, these theories were well in the mainstream both in terms of popular knowledge and in terms of practical application at the time that The Great Gatsby was published- in the several years before, for example, Grant and his disciples had lobbied successfully for a massive overhaul in US immigration laws that nearly or even fully cut off immigration by Jews and Asians, among others, and eugenics-influencejd policies greatly contributed to the disenfranchisement and restriction of Black citizens as well- to give only a few examples of this influence. Scientific racism was a popular subject of books and magazine articles that were popularly available and heavily consumed. 

The question is then- where does F Scott Fitzgerald land on all of this? 

Tom Buchanan gives the following speech in the book, in a conversation between him, the protagonist (Nick Carraway), and Tom's wife Daisy: 

>“Civilization is going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”  
>  
>“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.   
>  
>“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  
>  
>“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of un-thoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”  
>  
>“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things. . . .  
>  
>“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”

On the one hand, Tom is clearly an unsympathetic in the book- and not just in the book as a whole, but even in the passage: he is condescending and demeaning to his wife (of course in the book it turns out that he's having an affair) and the protagonist is surprised at Tom's vehemence and calls it pathetic. It is clear that whatever Tom may THINK about his own racial superiority, in the universe of the novel he is not superior at all. So it is a very valid interpretation to see Fitzgerald as using scientific racism to skewer Tom and show what a terrible person he is (in contrast to his own opinion of himself, where he sees himself as superior for the way he was born and condescends to someone like Gatsby who is self-made). It's clear that the abovementioned passage is not complimentary to Tom and that readers should know this, and indeed, many scholars, including scholars of scientific racism who discuss the novel, end it here. 

But it's very possible to go further into an examination of Fitzgerald's own feelings about race and discussion of it in the book in order to get a more nuanced interpretation. There are plenty of themes within the novel that actually echo the views of the Stoddards and Grants of the world. One scholar notes that part of The Rising Tide of Color isn't just about race, but about the decline and degradation of civilization, specifically white civilization, and that this is a theme that's pervasive in the novel, particularly in how it depicts a rugged Westerner being exposed to the materialistic dissipation and decline of the East Coast. Clearly, if nothing else, Fitzgerald read the book- and he may have even internalized parts of it.  He was also clearly hobnobbing with the authors of such works, whether through his publisher (he shared an editor with some scientific racist writers) or through various literary circles, where authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs were also influenced. But it's worth noting that the rest of the novel is filled with ambivalent descriptions of race as well- the antisemitism in the depictions of Meyer Wolfsheim, the way in which Gatsby's dubious (implied non-WASP, with various scholars making cases for Gatsby being Jewish or Black) origin and ancestry manifests itself throughout the novel, and a number of instances of dubious and prejudiced language when referring to Black and Jewish side characters. Most strongly though, one can note the way that multiculturalism is dealt with throughout the novel, alongside a theme of decline- there is clearly a sense of ambivalence at best. Fitzgerald does not explicitly condemn any of Stoddard's ideas, after all.

So yes, readers would have seen Tom as a racist. They may or may not have seen this inherently as a bad thing, though the particular way in which his racism is written is clearly meant to show a negative side to his character. But how they would have thought about Tom's reading of this book would have more to do with their own prior opinions about these kinds of (pervasive yet often opposed) views in their own minds; to someone who thought they were abhorrent, this would have shown Tom as being abhorrent for the same reason, but to someone who believed in the principles of scientific racism they may not have seen it in quite the same way.

Hello everyone, 

A quick reminder for both first time vistors, and those who are apt to forget the rules here. We've already had to remove several joke comments, several "I don't know, but here is one security incident I know of no one died during" comments, and one about ~~how wonderful the mod team is~~ how much the mods suck. The mission of /r/AskHistorians is to provide users with **in-depth and comprehensive responses**, and our [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) are intended to facilitate that purpose, so those were removed, and further rulesbreakers will be considered forewarned. 

An additional important reminder ought to be made with a question like this. If such an incident has occurred, hopefully someone will be along to write about the matter in due time. *But if it has never happened*, a response that is simply "Nope" or "Not that I'm aware of!" will *not* be sufficient, and thus with a response in the negative, we would expect to see a demonstration of familiarity with the history the Palace guards, so as to be reasonably confident that it is the *answer* rather than ungrounded speculation.

Of course, we know that it can be frustrating to come in here from your frontpage or /r/all and see only *[removed]*, but we ask for your patience and understanding. Great content is produced on this subreddit every day though, and we hope that while you wait, you will check out places they are featured, including [Twitter](http://twitter.com/askhistorians), the [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all), the [Monthly "Best Of"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/bestof) feature, and now, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/askhistorians/). It is very rare that a decent answer doesn't result in due time, so please do come check back on this thread in a few hours. If you think you might forget, send a [Private Message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLINK%20INSIDE%20SQUARE%20BRACKETS%20else%20default%20to%20FAQs%5D%0A%0ANOTE:%20Don%27t%20forget%20to%20add%20the%20time%20options%20after%20the%20command.%0A%0ARemindMe!) to the [Remind-Me bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/), and it will ensure you don't!

Finally, while we always appreciate feedback, it is unfair to the OP to further derail this thread with META conversation, so if anyone has further questions or concerns, I would ask that they be directed to [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians&subject=Question%20Regarding%20Rules), or a [META thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/submit?selftext=true&title=[META]). Thank you!

Edit: As this seems to have scored big on /r/All, and a *lot* of people unfamiliar with the sub are tracking in here, here is a quick breakdown of the removed comments for the curious, although it is likely already out of date from when I started compiling it given the speed of responses flowing in:

* 11 comments are "I know of this incident where they *didn't* kill someone". As stated above, giving one or two examples of it not happening doesn't answer the question unless you can contextualize it to the larger history the Guard.
* 2 comments are just "Yes" and 1 comment is just "No". 2 at least made partial sentences. I appreciate the consistency. 
* 1 is suggesting this should be posted to /r/AskReddit with a serious tag. If what you want *is* a thread which allows broader speculation then here, then I encourage you to follow /u/SuperHICAS' advice. If someone does, I'll even edit to link it here.
* 8 are about how much ~~they *love* the mod team~~ the mod team is a bunch of "massively absorbed c**ts".
* Update: And now [a visible answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6n0s04/has_the_queens_guard_ever_killed_someone_at_a/dk61kob/). Enjoy.
The answer is "yes, probably," but I have been unable to locate specific numbers. If you're looking for a bodycount of the Queen's (or King's) Guard, nobody that I know of has compiled such a list. Obviously, the units from which the Guards are drawn often see combat overseas, and have fought in battle over the past centuries, but the likeliest incident that I immediately thought of (this is actually linked from the Wikipedia page on the Queen's Guard) was during the [Gordon Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots). This was, to the best of my knowledge, the only time when members of the Guard were in a position to fire on people in the city of London, and then actually did so.

As background, the Gordon Riots marked a period of severe civil unrest in London, 1780, as a result of anti-Catholic sentiment and other contributing factors that are not worth getting into here (but mostly boil down into "Lord Charles Gordon was at fault and that's why we named it after him"). Long story short, on June 2 a number of demonstrators marched on Parliament to deliver a petition, and while the debates were going on inside the demonstrators outside were getting themselves riled up to the point where Members of Parliament were apparently at risk of being killed. The Guards were obliged to clear a path through the crowd in order to allow Parliament to exit, which they did by eleven o'clock in the evening. **This is very probably the best bet to answer your question**: the [Palace of Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster) where Parliament meets is technically a royal residence.

That being said, it seems unlikely that anybody was actually killed during this initial incident. (Of course, the soldiers were armed with musket and bayonet, which aren't great for nonlethal crowd control because they're weapons meant for killing people outright -- see the Boston Massacre for one example of when things went tits-up like that.) Anyways, in the days following the unrest outside of Parliament, the rioters went rampaging through the streets smashing stuff, but most of their targets appear to have been non-royal residences. Among the buildings ransacked were several of the prisons, where the prisoners were set free and mostly escaped recapture; foreign embassies, especially of Catholic nations; the houses of wealthy Catholics; and a few houses of local government officials or nobles perceived to be pro-Catholic in their stance. People *definitely* got killed by soldiers during this later action; the numbers that I am seeing are 210 killed, 75 died in hospital, and 173 wounded. Among the units deployed were units of the Guards, who distinguished themselves defending the Bank of England.

We have no way of knowing exactly how many of the dead can be ascribed to the work of the Guards -- they were not the only regular soldiers present in London at the time, and the city drew upon the support of local county militias to supplement their forces (incidentally, these irregulars seem to have acquitted themselves better during the actual riots). Please also note that the purpose of the rioters was never to attack the king, or his properties: it was an outpouring of anti-Catholic hatred that manifested in attacks on more low-hanging targets. Most of the estates more typically thought of as royal residences (Buckingham Palace in England, Balmoral Castle in Scotland) have more or less escaped such violence over the years.

During the United States' westward colonization in the 19th century, one of the most cohesive groups to take advantage of the overland trails was the Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints), on account of persecution and violence back east. While some did go all the way to California, most overlanding Mormons settled in Utah. Pitching out in Utah Territory ought to have been a refuge/semi-independent existence for the Mormons, but then the 1849+ gold rush happened. And Utah became a necessary transit point for the flood of emigrants to California. Well, transit point and conflict zone.

Because while some emigrants found that Mormons were good to trade with, attitudes often soured very quickly in both directions. Lacking roads, wagon trains and cattle herds rumbled through whatever fields and towns stood in their way, often tearing up the seasons' crops. Mormons who remembered themselves or their ancestors being assaulted and having their property destroyed back in the Midwest, in return, saw their chance to harass emigrants under the excuse that surely they had come from Missouri, Illinois, etc. It's important to remember we are talking about settled, established colonies/territories here. When violent (to people or property) incidents happened, parties went to court--and smashed right into a harshly divided Utah administration split between local, often ecclesiastically-appointed Mormon officials and federal administrators dispatched from Washington.

Basically, *no one* was happy. Emigrants felt they could not get justice from Mormon juries. Mormon officials believed federal delegates were overriding their sovereignty and territory rights. U.S.-sent officials complained that the LDS Church could and did essentially override their own decisions.

And in the 1850s, this concept of popular sovereignty had a peculiar importance in American politics that you might be more familiar with under the phrase "states' rights"--that is, it needed to serve as a code word, in the politics of President James Buchanan's Democratic party, for the defense of *slavery*. Mormon theological opinions--namely, polygamy--couldn't be allowed to tarnish the image of a seen-as-necessary principle. 

With the complaints from Good Protestant Overlanders and fleeing federal officials combined with darkening attitudes towards Mormons and Mormonism as politically damaging, Buchanan by fiat declared a new (non-Brigham Young) governor of Utah and sent a cadre of troops as combination police officers/bodyguards in 1857. Young and the Mormon leadership either did not get this memo or had reasonable experience on which to believe this memo was a purposeful deception: they saw the incoming troops as an invasion force meant to impose martial law and renew persecution of Mormons. So they called up *their* own militia, prepared for doomsday scenarios, and *forbid Mormon residents from dealing with or aiding non-Mormon overlanders.*

As to why the Utah Expedition/Utah War is less often discussed, of course there are the general platitudes like "you can only study so much in one history class" "not enough people were killed to make it a significant war" "the U.S. soldiers were kind of wimpy and when the '57-58 winter was bad they kinda just gave up and went home." But to investigate more specifically to the historical context, I'd like to focus on one brutal event within the time frame of the Utah War: the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

Like other emigrant groups before them, the Baker-Fancher wagon train (named for its leader-organizers, John Baker and Alexander Fancher) out of Arkansas had counted on being able to wheel and deal with Mormon shopkeepers for supplies before they headed through mountains and desert. Not under the new apocalypse-coming statues of the LDS community, though. Frustrated, the Fancher party did two things. First, they stopped to camp at Mountain Meadows pass in southern Utah to rest and consolidate for the weary trip ahead in the face of fewer supplies than they had planned for. Second, they talked a massively violent rhetorical game against the Mormons. *Not only* were they going to give the Mormons trouble, *not only* were the incoming U.S. army troops going to give the Mormons even more trouble, *but*--the clincher--people in the Fancher party "knew people" who had oppressed the Mormons right out of Missouri, or maybe--some bragged--maybe they had *been* those people.

Local militia leaders Isaac Haight and John Lee were not about to let this slide. They determined to attack the wagon train while they were camped. They were evil-crafty about it, too--they paid a group of Paiute Indians in cattle to participate in the initial attack in September 1857. 

But Lee in particular wasn't satisfied with a few deaths in a skirmish. With the terrified Fanchers huddled down where they could defend themselves but not actually escape (and the threat of winter--and not being able to pass the mountains--looming), he went in to negotiate their surrender. Children and the wounded would leave first, in wagons; women and older children next; finally the men would walk out.

But Lee didn't mean "surrender," he meant "lambs to the slaughter." The Mormon soldiers massacred the entire wagon train. Only a handful of very young children were allowed to survive (they were kidnapped/adopted by Mormon families). 

Historians have called this the worst event in Mormon history, which you might expect from historians. But the Mormons knew it at the time, too. Heck, they knew it in advance, which is why Lee and Haight worked so hard to get the Paiutes to participate in the initial attack. And while white Mormons were responsible for the brutal massacre, Paiute participation gave them the opening to claim Indian responsibility for "yet another" wagon train attack. (As John Unruh demonstrated so categorically, the actual "Indian threat" to overlanders was borderline nil, and our stereotypes today are the result of pop culture tropes and rumors already current in the 1840s).

The interesting thing, though, is that blaming the Paiutes didn't work quite as neatly as Haight and especially Lee might have hoped. So the Mormon leadership, desperate to avoid being implicated in triggering the slaughter, turned Mountain Meadows into a pinpoint-local event instead. They offered up Lee as the scapegoat--he was excommunicated in 1870 and *executed* in 1877. Well, America's gossip mill loves a good gory bad guy making a bad end, which quieted things on the "back east" and government ends. And it's not like the Utah government was raring to make "the worst event in Mormon history" a topic of major discussion.

Nicely illustrative of how the Massacre slid out of historical memory is the fate of its physical commemoration through memorials and historic markers. In 1859, with the massacre still a fresh memory *and* knowledge of white domination of its perpetration bleedingly fresh, U.S. military officials (!) set up a massive monument at Mountain Meadows. Brigham Young himself apparently oversaw its destruction just months later. The U.S. rebuilt it; the Mormons destroyed it again.

In 1932, with Utah now a nice state and the LDS Church itself not directly involved in government in the same way as the territory days, the state historic commission determined to build a marker. Except...they basically hid it behind rocks several miles from the road, so no one would *actually* see it. To make things even worse: Juanita Brooks' 1950 book *The Mountain Meadows Massacre*, the first scholarly investigation of the event which laid much of the blame at the feet of Young and the LDS hierarchy, triggered two reactions. First, quietly, the LDS church undid Lee's excommunication very posthumously, recognizing that the extent to which he had been scapegoated was wrong. Second, also quietly, the church *bought the land where the 1932 marker was*--and razed it.

And as James Loewen discovered in his investigations for *Lies Across America*, as late as 1990, the "new, improved" marker firmly in U.S. government control still stated:

* "The company of emigrants...*was attacked*" [passive voice]
* the original monument "was not maintained" [interesting way to say *torn down*]

The Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a feel-good story on anyone's part. The emigrants--who are undeniably teh victims here!--have been built up in collective memory to look not so good (victim blaming is always the easy way out), the Mormons don't look good, the U.S. government doesn't even look all that good for giving the impression of invading a territory (bad PR, overwrought officials fleeing and stoking rumours/hatred in Washington, giving up after one blizzard). The massacre didn't fit pre-Unruh theories about horrible violent Indians; but the real story of Indian participation in the beginning plus being blamed for the later events doesn't particularly suit *any* political agendas in more recent decades. The Utah Expedition roots that helped spark the slaughter are a diversion from the "popular sovereignty is about slavery" narrative that drives what you might call the major plot line of U.S. political history leading up to the Civil War.

Historical memory is not inevitable: people control what does and doesn't get told, as well as how it gets told. With so much history out there, far more than anyone could ever hope to know--yes, agendas are going to drive what does and does get "told" and "remembered". And as the history of the Mountain Meadows Massacre's commemoration shows, in this case people on all sides had a much more vested interest in forgetting than remembering.
Mormon History! This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures! I'm going to assume that you are not Mormon, but if you are, please forgive me for explaining something you already know. If you look at current LDS sources for information about the early history of the LDS church you will find that it is all [correlated](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Correlation_of_the_Church_Administration). This basically means that the Church has simplified and whitewashed its history into something more socially acceptable. Because of this it can be difficult for active members of the Church to find sources and information that they consider acceptable. This is also why sometimes Mormons (or non-Mormons) will hear about something in Mormon history and feel like they should have known about it, but didn't. The Utah War in general, and [Mountain Meadows Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre) in specific are good examples.

The Utah War is a period where Brigham Young was using his influence to try to control many aspects of the Utah Territory. Keep in mind that when the Utah War started the Mormon Pioneers (Saints) had been in the Salt Lake Valley for about a decade, and Brigham Young had amassed a huge amount of power in that time. This all started with the Mormon Reformation which is a time when Brigham Young started pushing the Saints to follow the law of polygamy, and accept him as the leader of the Church, Territory, and Army (Nauvoo Legion). You can learn a lot about this time period by reading [Wife No. 19](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) by Ann Eliza Young. She also discusses how Young had become a dictator in Utah Territory at that time, and how his desires were turned into action and violence within Utah.

So, what actually happened? The simple answer is "not much" but, as with much of history, things are more complicated than they might at first look. As I recall the trouble started when the [Willie-Martin Handcart Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_handcart_pioneers#1856:_Willie_and_Martin_handcart_companies) struck disaster in Wyoming in October 1856. In response to this tragedy the United States sent soldiers and investigators to Utah to try to figure out why such a disaster happened. While this might seem like a normal response, for Young it was an attack on him, his leadership, and his people. You can get an idea of how often he felt this way about any criticism by also reading the [Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng). 

Young started to order the Saints to make the lives of Gentile soldiers (non-Mormons) difficult by doing things like spooking livestock, burning supply wagons, and harassing them. The Saints felt justified in doing this because of the persecution they had suffered in the past, and they wanted to stand up for themselves now. At this point things might have all blown over, if not for the death of [Parley P. Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parley_P._Pratt).

Pratt was murdered in Arkansas, while on a mission, by the jealous husband of a woman he had converted to Mormonism and wanted to take as a plural wife. Her husband found out, found Pratt and killed him. Sadly, at about the same time as Pratt's death a Pioneer company also from Arkansas set out for California. The Baker-Fancher party had nothing to do with the death of Pratt, but that was not the message the Saints received. By the time Baker-Fancher arrived in SLC there were many who believed that they were responsible for the death of a beloved Elder in the Church. The Saints refused to sells provisions to the group (or perhaps they were ordered not to), and the group moved south to Utah Valley and Provo where they were, again, unable to resupply. Finally they were told of a place further south where they could camp and try to regroup and figure out what to do to get across Death Valley and to California.

The Baker-Fancher party arrived in Mountain Meadows in early September 1857. They were the besieged by a group consisting mostly of Mormons dressed as Paiute Indians, although there may have been a few Paiute involved. After 3 days they were then massacred on September 11, 1857. Over 130 men, women, and children were killed, and only 18 children under the age of 8 were saved. Those children were raised for about a year by Mormon foster parents, some of whom had participated in the massacre, until they were rescued and returned to their families in Arkansas.

This was pretty much the end of the Utah War. The massacre stirred up too much attention, and with the polygamy also being pushed at the time there was pressure to back off and lie low for a while.

Sources I used (although much of this is from memory, so if I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it):

[Wife No. 19 by Ann Eliza Young](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) was originally published in 1875 and is a somewhat contemporary telling of the same events.

[The Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng) is a great source of information, but is very dense. I have not read all of them, and mostly only excerpts.

[Massacre at Mountain Meadows](https://www.amazon.com/Massacre-Mountain-Meadows-Ronald-Walker-ebook/dp/B004JU1WJ0/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) is specifically about the event, and is also a good read.

The [Year of Polygamy](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/) podcast is an amazing resource for all things polygamy, and early Mormon history related. Each episode is sourced on the website, and Lindsey Hansen Park has done an amazing job with it! Specific episodes about this subject are: [episode 116: Frontier Massacres](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/tag/mountain-meadows-massacre/). I was at the recording of this episode, and it was fantastic. [Episode 43](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/year-of-polygamy/year-of-polygamy-historian-joe-geisner-and-violent-1850s-utah-episode-43/) is about violence in the 1850's in Utah, and [episode 44](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/year-of-polygamy/year-of-polygamy-the-utah-war-episode-44/) is specifically about the Utah War.

Special thanks to /u/mythrin for all his amazing knowledge, and for giving me the courage to be a normal person who talks about Mormon history. (Also, if you show up because I summoned you, can you let me know if there is anything I need to add?)

The Tsar was passionate about exercise, perhaps to make up for his short stature (especially in comparison to his father) but also, he seemed to just enjoy being active. 

From [Anna Vyrubova's memoirs](http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/2anna1.html):

> To tell the truth, the Tsar was rather weak and lean. When he was sitting it seemed he was well-built but in fact he was not even of medium height because of his short legs. Nevertheless, he managed to harden his organism by sports and physical exercise in fresh air and develop physical strength. 

She notes that, in particular, he was an excellent and avid swimmer and enjoyed long walks:

>The Tsar loved the sea and swimming, he also liked to stop for some time in some place before getting to the next island. On the archipelago he went in for shooting. The Emperor was a good swimmer and he devoted every moment of his free time to that sport. The Empress was the only one from the family who could not swim because of her weak heart. The Tsar liked long walks. He used to go for 2-hour walks choosing the most difficult paths. 

You can see a chinning bar in his [bathroom here](http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/img/bath2.jpg) (from Bob Atchison’s Alexander Palace Time Machine). Although not pictured, Bob Atchison also notes that the Tsar had weights in his bathroom.

Due to young Alexander's health issues, the entire family would often exercise together (see [here](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3084&context=etd)). "Building snow houses, chopping wood and shoveling snow entertained the family during the winter months, while riding, hiking, tennis and planting trees occupied them during the warmer months." 

Interestingly, biographers often juxtapose his physical prowess with his failures as a tsar. "He kept in excellent physical shape by taking vigorous exercise, A strong walker and an indefatigable rower and tennis player... He romped with his children as if he belonged to their age group. However, time had not added to his intellectual powers but had simply given him a working knowledge of the government." (From the same source as above, and also  Poliakoff, Tragic Bride, 193.)

All in all, he seemed to have been an extremely active person who thrived on physical exercise, but also seemed concerned about his physical appearance.
Very interesting question! 

Yes, Nicholas II would have exercised for several reasons - aesthetic value and messaging (in the very literal sense of *strong* leadership), certainly, as well as enjoyment. He certainly had an active lifestyle, and his physique is not incidental. 

The source best suited to explore his *personal* approach to exercise is probably his diary, where he speaks often of skating, swimming, sailing, tennis, and walks. 


Here's a rather typical example from the summer of 1905:
>The heat was healthy. In the morning I was quite busy until one o'clock... As a thunderstom was approaching, did not play tennis for long - the downpour was very heavy...

There are a few threads here: one a genuine appreciation of athleticism, especially outdoors (as you see here, though he was well-regarded as a gymnast). Though you will references to stepping away from the demands of leadership by embracing nature, though these are somewhat less explicit in Nicholas' own writings.  Second, there's an international interest in athletics during his reign - the first modern Olympics being held in 1896 - so an interest in highlighting a new, modern, perhaps cosmopolitan Russia. Other, broader reflections of Nicholas' view of sports can be seen in the creation of a Russian Olympic Committee and sponsorship of regional programs intended to foster an interest in sports. Nicholas significantly reformed and expanded educational systems, attempted to restructure local government, oversaw expanded industrialization - improving Russian athletics fits well within his projects.

In short, no. And even things like the Generalplan Ost are less clear in what they were intended to be than people often assume but more on that below.

The thing about post-war plans is that they tend to be extremely tentative and uncertain until the point the war is actually over and even then they can change in some rather crucial details. Just as a quick look at the Allies: The first sketching of plans began in earnest in 1943 after first territories in North Africa had been liberated and many things weren't actively settled until Yalta and Potsdam in 1945 and even then substantive changes remained, f.ex. Yugoslavia becoming a socialist country. Plans for how the occupation of Germany would be handled concretely weren't finalized by the time the first German city, Aachen, was liberated by the Western Allies. So, post-war plans by the Nazis at any point in time are to be taken with a huge grain of salt and were subject to constant change.

Generalplan Ost is actually the best example of this. I've written about it before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6eqm99/why_is_the_generalplan_ost_considered_different/) and the crucial point is that the GPO was never fully implemented, only in very small parts. Because of rising, cost, effort, and the course of the war, planning for the GPO stopped and all started projects in connection to the GPO came to a halt after 1942, when the Nazis decided instead to use their available resources and manpower for the war and the Holocaust (which had been a crucial part of the GPO). What was implemented was very piecemeal and compared to the grand vision of the plans, comparatively small scale.

The same holds true for other plans, some of which never really made it out of the planning phase. Here the example of the Madagascar Plan is very fitting. I've written some more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hkvcr/what_were_the_nazis_planning_to_do_with_the/) and with this example, the gist once again is that the so-called DIII proposal is genocidal in its intentions but only every existed in a very, very rough outline that never made it past a draft phase due to the fact that it wasn't feasible under existing conditions – Allied control of the seas – and that it was never fully endorsed by the entire political establishment of the Third Reich, which due to the political structure of Hitler's Germany had a tendency to be at each other's throat the entire time of its existence.

This last point is important because there only existed one agency charged with developing policy towards Africa: The NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy (Koloniapolitisches Amt der NSDAP – KPA). The KPA had been founded in 1934 and drawn together Nazis who had been involved in colonial policy during the period of Imperial Germany prior to WWI and charged with the mission of developing plans on how to bring former German colonies back under German control. It's head was Franz Ritter von Epp, an old Freikorps member and early Nationalsocialist.

Epp was rewarded this way for his continuing loyalty to the Nazi movement. A former soldier and successful Freikorps leader he might have been but a shrewd political operator he was not. Within the power structure of the Third Reich all his attempts to re-make the KPA as an official state agency rather than a mere party office failed and in 1938 the German Foreign Office won a significant political victory over Epp by taking charge of all efforts to win back the German colonies. Henceforth Epp and the KPA were charged with developing plans for Africa in general.

For the next two years, Epp and his fellow Nazi colonial administrators without a colonial empire sat around and dreamed up megalomaniac plans for how a new German colonial Empire in Africa would look like. Most of these plans however were either so bad or so unfeasible that they apparently never made it to the phase of being written down coherently and therefore there is little record of them whatsoever.

Only in 1940 with Axis success in North Africa did the KPA have its fifteen minutes of fame. What they essentially did was dig up old drafts from WWI Germany for what would happen after a German victory in Africa and slightly re-tooled them. Effectively, they planned for a large central African German colony encompassing the majority of British colonies in the area and containing Tanganjika, half of Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Nordrhodesia and the Kongo with South Africa as a German puppet state. attached to it. They drew up racial laws more modeled along Nazi lines for these territories that were closely oriented also on those in South Africa and Rhodesia. Their plan also included some presence by the SS.

However, this plan – and this must be emphasized – was really, really rudimentary and while the KPA did already start preparing future colonial administrators for their role, it lacks the detail that – say – even the GPO had. This is all laid down in a document that doesn't encompass more than a good 30 pages of typewriter script, which isn't all that much.

And Epp's fifteen minutes would be over soon anyways. Going on into 1941 and 1942 losses in North Africa squashed dreams of a Nazi colonial empire and in 1943 the KPA and all Nazi planning for Africa was officially ended by Hitler and Bormann with all resources going into planning for the East.

Epp's plan did include very harsh racial laws that certainly could be seen as a preparatory stage to genocide or in as much as South African and Rhodesian policy edge on forms of cultural and other genocide but it did not include such concrete measures like the GPO, the Hungerplan or the Holocaust. Like so many other things it was a Nazi fever dream fantasized up by people who saw themselves as the future white supremacist overlords over the world and who thought that they could colonize Africa on a 30 page memo.

Edit: There still is an interesting history to write about Nazi war criminals fleeing to Africa though as just a few crumbs of information I dug up for [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9b0q48/why_would_nazi_doctor_horst_schumann_receive/) reveal though.

You should see if any of your nearest universities have Anthropology departments.  My school had a whole sub department for Archaeology and my professors would have been stoked to have a local come to them with an opportunity to do field work.  It’s great practice for the students.  If you’re open to it, they can do a full excavation.  Or if you prefer no digging they may be able to map out the area with ground penetrating radar.  But if you let them dig they’ll probably be better able to get you the information you’re seeking.
You've gotten some very good advice about anthropology/archaeology, so I thought I'd give you some public history perspective so you can come at this from other angles. (I work in public history/museums.)

In your shoes, some of my first steps would be to confirm if the family that owned the land did actually own (or lease) enslaved people. This can be a tricky thing to confirm; as others have noted, enslaved people were counted in different ways over different census periods. You can start by mapping out the owners of the property from 1790-1860 and finding them in each census year. You'll want a basic genealogy tree of the family to at least indicate who ended up owning the land from generation to generation, which will be helpful when you are looking for census records and for your next step. Of note: Georgia also conducted a state-specific census, which may have included information different from the national census. More on that through the Georgia Archives: [https://www.georgiaarchives.org/research/census\_records](https://www.georgiaarchives.org/research/census_records)

Census records only cover a specific point in time in a year ending in 0, so there's also possibilities in between those years. The next thing to look at will be any kind of wills or probate records for immediate family members who died during those years. It was not uncommon to list enslaved people among the "possessions" gifted or deeded to a specific family member. Sometimes this is a basic description, and sometimes it's more detailed. An example: within my own family there is a record of my great-x-5-grandfather leaving an enslaved 17yo girl named Permelia to his widow. (Note: all of the above can be carried out by a competent freelance genealogist, if you'd rather hire someone to do it.)

If the family did also have a long history within the area (which it sounds like), your local historical society may have more information on them. Start with your town, and then go to county level. The Georgia Archives has a nice directory of local history organizations that may prove helpful: [https://www.georgiaarchives.org/ghrac/directory](https://www.georgiaarchives.org/ghrac/directory). A longtime landowning family may appear in published town histories, published genealogies, and more. If you're really lucky, you may find actual papers belonging to the family that would detail more.

If you're able to prove that the family did enslave people, then you have corroborating evidence that there may be the grave of an enslaved person on the property. It seems to me unlikely that an enslaved person would have been buried in a family plot, but you never know. If the family did enslave people, there may also be other traces of that history on the land that would prove interesting under archaeological examination. The Georgia State Archaeologist should have some kind of idea of what an excavation would look like, whether it's a good student project, etc. It seems likely that they will also have experience in finding and handling traces of enslavement.

There are museums and historic sites that are doing similar work right now, and if you can find one local to you they may have additional advice. I don't know the Georgia history landscape very well, but there's likely to be someone nearby. I'd look on their website for evidence that they're taking the history of enslavement seriously before reaching out; there are a number of museums & historic sites still hewing to old and simplistic interpretation rather than really grappling with their history. So you'll want to find clear, direct evidence on their website that they are interpreting and engaging with their site's history of enslavement through programs, archaeological work, ongoing research, etc.
Archeologist here - specifically a bioarcheologist with a background in CRM (culture resource management, the non academic branch of archeology). I have worked on large native cemeteries and standalone native burials, as well as pauper cemeteries. Further, I've worked on plantations and slave villages. 

First, it's going to be hard to get a CRM company out there without paying them. CRMs are for profit (usually, at least in California where I live) so they can't afford to pro Bono work. Since you are on private property, there's no chance of getting government money to pay for an excavation. 

Second, in the absence of historical documentation there is no way to tell if this burial is a slave burial, short of an excavation. While I have not worked on a slave graveyard (my work was with native burials and 19th-early 20th century pauper cemeteries), my guess is that if the unmarked grave was near another burial with an elaborately carved headstone, you're looking at the owners plots. Again, no experience with slave burials specifically, but experience with working on plantation sites and slave 'villages' tells me that a slave would probably have not been buried near the owners. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say that there is a greater possibility that it MAY be a child burial, due to the other nearby headstone belonging to a woman who died in childbirth, and the stone in question being unmarked. Obviously, this is just an educated guess, so please take this with a massive grain salt. If you can find more info on the woman with the marked stone, you might be able to see if her child also died, which would make my hypothesis a little stronger (but still by no means correct or even overly reliable) 

Third, best people to contact would be your local state historical preservation office (SHPO). They probably won't be able to help you with excavation directly, but they might be able to tell you who can.

Finally, I can't believe that any anthropologist would tell you to do the excavation yourself. Please don't. Echoing what others have said, this is a big no no in archeology. Provenience (or the exact placement of artifacts or remains within a historical site) is everything in archeological data collection. That being said, your best hope for an excavation is to get some university archeologists out there. As others have said, I'd recommend contacting the head of the department directly to see if you could get some grad students or even an undergraduate who would be interested in a cool project.
Give the Georgia State Historic Preservation Office a call at  770-389-7844. They should be able to help get you in touch with an archaeologist. This is the office that is usually in charge of keeping a record of all archaeological sites within a state. Here is their website  [https://georgiashpo.org/](https://georgiashpo.org/)

(FYI: Archaeology is a subfield of anthropology in the US)
You could do some genealogical research online to figure out whether the young woman buried there was a slave. The census noted a person's race, so if a white Sarah Mapp shows up living there in those years, there would be your answer. You can make a free account on [FamilySearch.org](https://FamilySearch.org) and search their census records from 1840 and 1850.

The 1840 US Census only named the head of household, so if there are other names on the headstone you might be able to determine what Sarah's father or husband's name was and look for that in the census records of your town. Everyone else in the household was just counted, with race and free status noted. She would only be counted in that census if she was born before the time they took the census.

You'd have better luck with the 1850 census, which named all of the white members of the household. Slaves were only counted, not named. Since you know the exact property that the Mapps should be living at, that could help you narrow it down. Most records, including the US Census records, are free to view on [FamilySearch.org](https://FamilySearch.org). (Occasionally for other types of records they will tell you the record exists but redirect you to a paid site like [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) to view them, but that shouldn't happen with US Census records.) If Sarah Mapp showed up living at the house around the right age, that would mean she was white. If not, she might have been a slave.

My family's farm had a small family cemetery, as well graves that were known to be the enslaved people of the first property owner that settled the land, before my family purchased it way back when. Family had good documentation over the years about this, and family was the only owner of this land for a few generations. You may find that there is information about your land, the families that lived there, and perhaps the enslaved people that lived and worked there as well. My family, for example, kept meticulous family records, and extended family all around owned neighboring land. So the local library has bound family history details and sources. Additionally, if anyone wanted even more information, and contacted our family, interested in the history of that cemetery or land, most of us would be happy to assist. Our family, sadly, sold that property a few years ago. I remember, as a child, helping my grandparents restore the cemetery and keep it cleaned out. I had a detailed oral history of the people who are buried there, as well as which graves were those of enslaved people, what we knew about them, the fact that the enslaved people were buried in a specific area (and possibly why). 

Researching the family history of the landowners in the local library, and asking descendants (both landowner, and possibly descendants of any enslaved people if generations continued to live locally) may help you not only verify if those are "slave graves" but also might lead to any documented or oral history that might survive.
I want to chime in with a slightly different tack: you should be consulting an attorney who specializes in real estate law before proceeding any further.

You're starting to get into a grey area of property law here.  In fact, in several states - Virginia, I'm thinking of you - gravesites on private property have very distinct access rights and can complicate the title.

So prior to doing any more work on the archeological side of things, please protect yourself by sitting down with someone who is licensed and knows Georgia title law to discuss your situation and what you'd like to do.  Any attorney worth their salt will tell you getting called in early for a possibly overcautious consult is vastly preferable to the alternative.

As far as the history, awesome sauce to you for being so proactive, and unfortunately I don't have anything to add on that front - you've gotten some high quality responses so far!
Hey first of all, I'm glad to see from you other comments that you are all on board with going about this in the proper manner. I saw that you mentioned you may do a memorial of some sort and clean the place up around it. Great idea, but I would say be careful if you are digging at all as graves can have other graves near them if the area was used as a cemetery. Grave stones can be taken away/damaged, and many may have been unmarked graves. Just a heads up!

Thank you!
This question is an excellent one, but it veers into notions of sociology a bit, so I apologize in advance if this answer is a bit narrow. I'll chip in with a brief summary of an outstanding historical investigation called 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' by historian Linda Gordon. 

In sum, Gordon makes a very good argument for this sort of watering down of racial ideals into simply "white" and "other" as a product of American western expansion in the Reconstruction period (late-19th century and very early 20th). Her book tells the story of a group of orphans who were sent west from New York City to Arizona in 1904. These orphans were taken in by a Catholic organization that housed, schooled, and fed what were classically thought of as street urchins that spanned any number of nationalities. These kids represented a mixed bag of Italian, Irish, Dutch, German, Russian, etc. heritages, and were the product of broken, disintegrated, or lost families in many cases. 

This is where it gets interesting, though. In New York City, these kids were viewed as undesirable for any number of reasons, not the least of which because of their respective "races." In short, the Catholic charity that looked after these kids couldn't give them away (literally...nobody would take them). An idea was hatched to clean these kids up and send them west, where good, Catholic families that applied and were properly screened could adopt them. Out west, these kids could be a boon to families who had lost their kids in the journey west, or just due to the sometimes harsh conditions out there. 

Gordon's book details a 1904 expedition of children sent to an Arizona mining town called Clifton/Morenci (the towns were combined) where a number of generous, charitable Mexican families went through the proper channels to apply for and adopt these kids for a number of entirely respectable reasons (because these families had lost kids of their own, because they saw it as their Christian duty, etc.). It is important to note that these kids weren't just given away willy-nilly: the families that adopted them went through the proper channels, as did the organization that saw to their relocation. 

None of the white families in Clifton/Morenci had shown any interest in adopting these kids before the children arrived in town, but a very interesting thing happened once they did. When the white residents of the mining community saw these white kids get off the train and go to live with the Mexican families, they LOST. THEIR. MINDS. Something akin to a lynch mob formed that evening, and the white residents went house to house, armed, and took the white children out of the Mexican homes. At one point, this white mob held the priests and nuns responsible for the adoption placements at gunpoint, and demanded the names of all the families that had taken custody of these "white" children. 

Sadly, the courts upheld this action as entirely legal and justifiable, since (according to the courts) these white adults were acting in the best interests of the children. Yep, the courts sided with an armed mob of kidnappers because it thought that Mexicans getting custody of white children was so offensive and dangerous an act, that armed abduction was necessary to rectify the situation. 

Gordon uses this incident to illustrate just how flexible and malleable notions of race truly are, and to illustrate how these notions were bent and reformed in the United States at the turn of the 19th/20th century. In New York, these children had been Irish, German, Italian, etc. Once out west, where whiteness was threatened by Mexicans, Native Americans, or Chinese, these kids simply became "white." So one could, by extension, argue that in the United States, the default "white" category developed as a defense mechanism for European transplants who saw an opportunity to reframe the debate on race once they were out west, where one's country of origin mattered less than if one was not Mexican, Native, or Chinese. This is a simplification of both Gordon's work, and the discussion on ethnicity studies in American history, but beginning with 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' and digging into Gordon's sources might be a good place to start if one is looking to do a deep-dive on this subject.  

**EDIT** - I really appreciate the gold! There's been a lot of great follow-up answers here that more comprehensively outline the broader history of ethnicity studies in not just the U.S., but in Europe as well. For the people asking for more information about orphan trains, the legal ramifications of the 1904 incident, or "whiteness" in European culture, I'd recommend digging into Gordon's sources, or even just having a look at what u/FoucaultMeMichel wrote below. 
This is a complex question, and there isn't really *one* way that non-Anglo Europeans became "white" in the United States. I am by no means an expert, but I can recommend two books that I've found quite helpful in thinking through this:

* Nell Irvin Painter, The History of White People (Norton: 2010) 
* Matthew Fyre Jacobson,Whiteness of a Different Color: European Immigrants and the Alchemy of Race (Harvard UP: 1999)

I think there are a couple of important caveats to any discussion like this. First, there is a historical distinction between "whiteness," the Caucasian "race," and Anglo-American conceptions of what it meant to be of the American race. Skin color was not always the sole or even primary indicator of racial difference, although it has certainly come to be. To give you an example, in 1899 William Ripley published a book called *The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study* in which he collated huge troves of data from various European anthropologists into an overarching theory of biologically determined racial difference for the continent. He divided Europe into three racial types: the Teutonic, the Alpine, and the Mediterranean. And these three races were distributed across Europe more or less north to south (Teutonic in the north, Alpine in the middle, and Mediterranean in the south). The basis of this division was not due to culture, or skin color, or any of the markers we know today. The division was based on primarily on head shape ("the cephalic index"). [Here's a map of the index from *Races of Europe.*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ripley_map_of_cephalic_index_in_Europe.png) Madison Grant, in his book *The Passing of the Great Race,* took Ripleys theory and made it fully normative, equating the Nordic (Teutonic) race with human excellence. 

Nineteenth century racial theory typically grouped these European races into one larger racial category (Caucasoid), which was set apart from the Negroids (African) and Mongoloids (Asian). Polygenism was the theory, popular throughout the 19th century, that these three races were in fact not biologically related to one another. And noted scientists like Louis Aggasiz spread polygenic racial theory across the country on the lecture circuit. I mention this because it's important to realize that racial differentiation *within* the Caucasoid race was of an entirely different magnitude than the racial differentiation *between* Caucasoids, Negroids, and Mongoloids. And although thinkers like Grant would  magnify the racial differences within the larger Caucasian classification, that was peculiar to his style of eugenic theory, not all racial theory. The racial divisions within the caucasion race still exist today, but rather than "racial difference" we now talk about them as "ethnic difference." And although ethnicity is now largely understood to index culture, many people still describe ethnic difference in terms of biological difference (e.g., swarthy Italians). 

I mention all of this to suggest that, although many scholars talk about X or Y group "becoming" white, whiteness was not necessarily a category that existed from the start and slowly accumulated a larger population. We can also think about whiteness subsuming other kinds of racial/ethnic difference--in other words, it's not that Germans in America became "white," rather, their whiteness became their most defining feature.  Jacobson argues that "the contending forces that have fashioned and refashioned whiteness in the United States across time . . . are capitalism (with its insatiable desire for cheap labor) and republicanism (with its imperative of responsible citizenship)" (p. 13). To this list I would also add religious toleration, since anti-semitic and anti-catholic sentiments have often governed who was white. But that does not explain why whiteness replaced European racial divisions as a primary mechanism of making sense of social difference. 

What most scholars mean when they talk about whiteness in American culture is the suturing of skin color to "Anglo-American" culture, which is also difficult to quantify. Elisabeth Kinsley, for example, talks about "ethnic" performances of Shakespeare in New York City between 1890 and 1910 as one path through which ethnic difference was reconciled with Anglo-American culture (Kinsley, "This Island's Mine: Mapping the Borders of Shakespeare, Whiteness, and National Belonging in Manhattan's Ethnic Theaters, 1890-1910" *Text and Performance Quarterly* 34 (2014): 52-71), and there are literally countless other ways in which this kind of cultural refashioning took shape. 

But "becoming Anglo" doesn't tell the complete story either. Jacobson argues that three forces were particularly important in allowing whiteness to coalesce as a unified racial category: American imperialism, which "conferred its benefits by a logic of pan-white supremacy,"; naturalization case law related to changes in immigration law in the 1920s; and civil rights politics "[eclipsing] the lingering divisions among the white races as it pressed its agenda of racial justice defined by the binary logic of the Jim Crow south." (201). He concedes that this list is far from exhaustive, which speaks to just how complex this question would be to answer, but he sees these three forces as crucial.

I would recommend reading his book to learn the specifics, because the arguments are complex and the textual archive he marshals is very deep. Painter's book tells a very similar story, although she has a more nuanced look at permutations within whiteness in the early part of the 19th century. Where Jacobson focuses heavily on policy, law, and science, Painter talks about the cultural currents that made whiteness what it is. 


The above answer is an excellent one, but it focuses on the modern notion of 'whiteness' as it appears in the 20th century. However, the concept of whiteness has been uniquely attached to the idea of America since it's inception.

In pre-colonial Europe the ideas of whiteness and blackness were fairly vague and so to an English person, someone from Spain might be considered black. However, through the process of colonisation, it can be argued that the idea of 'whiteness' was built at least partly in opposition to the idea of 'blackness', so that by the time of the writing of the American Constitution, it was possible for white Americans to have rights that were denied to the substantial black and native populations in America.

This argument can be seen in Gary B Nash's book 'Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America.' He argues that the institution of slavery required a leap of logic to categorise all Africans into a single group of inferior servile 'blacks'. In such an environment it then became possible for the other inhabitants of North America to be classified as either 'White' European or 'Red' natives. 

It can also be argued that the concept of whiteness was created as a way of pacifying the growing lower classes that were developing in the North American colonies. If there was a strictly defined underclass of 'black' and 'red' savages, poor European migrants would be more likely to associate themselves with the ruling classes and so unlikely to band with the rest of the subjugated peoples in opposition. This process was probably not premeditated, but came about as a lot of historical processes do in a series of pragmatic decisions made by people at the time that caused society to drift in a certain direction. 

He goes on to clarify that these distinctions were never as defined as they can sometimes be presented and the categories were actively created by the other races. So, groups of slaves of African descent who had few concrete connections to Africa built on the connecting aspects of their disparate societies such as food, music, dance and religion to help create a new notion of a black African American. In the same way, Native Americans unified in opposition to the invading whites. These boundaries were also blurred so there are stories of people crossing or subverting these categorisations throughout early American history. 

It seems that later waves of immigration to America by Polish, German, Italian, Caribbean, Chinese and other people simply slotted into the system that was long established in culture and partially codified in law.

PART 1

To start with, I don’t want to downplay the restrictions that the Taliban placed especially over urban life. Most of the things in the original post did indeed take place, and especially in Kabul and other large towns/cities. An article by Juan Cole, ‘The Taliban, Women, and the Hegelian Public Sphere’ (1), describes much of this in analytical perspective that focuses on the spectacle of violence and restriction: public executions for immorality took place, but even more common was to see things like cassettes or electronic entertainment equipment ritually ‘hung’ as well in public. Regarding birds, this was partly due to the fact that people frequently kept birds like pigeons and especially quails or partridges for competitive sports that would also involve gambling; and even if no money changed hands, this kind of spiritually and materially unproductive time-passing was seen by the Taliban’s parent school of thought as frivolous at best, and were frowned upon. The Taliban took this, and made it into a prohibition.

Addressing your larger point about prescriptions and prohibitions that include entertainment but extend far beyond them to include eg. dress, Cole writes about all this in terms of public sphere theory. To his view I would add a more recent material theory by Kusha Sefat, who writes about ‘Things and Terms’ in post-Revolutionary Iran. (2) The setting is different, but Sefat’s ideas work for Kabul post 1996, when the Taliban took over, and implemented policies like the uniformity of men’s and women’s physical presentations outside the home, and the removal of ‘westernized’ objects as signifiers for ‘un-Afghan’ and ‘un-Islamic’ lifestyles. In practice, the uniformity that the Taliban demanded was also heavily skewed in the direction of ‘Pashtun’ dress, and residents of Kabul, which gets much icier than Kandahar or Jalalabad in the winter, found it highly distressing to have to wear heavy sandals and a wool shawl in the snow, as opposed to shoes/boots and a coat; and apologies that this is anecdotal from my own fieldwork in Kabul, rather than from a printed source). In any case: the Taliban period, in Kabul, was heavily marked by attempts to reshape the material landscape, to create a proliferation of certain kinds of objects and block the visibility of other kinds, as a way to change (or ‘reform’) people’s interiority into the direction that the Taliban wanted. In other words, the material world around one, and the way that one moves through it, have an effect on the kinds of thoughts that one thinks/can think, and will produce a new kind of ideal society in which the Taliban were raised to an almost higher level of reality, which would seem natural and thus uncontestable. Indeed Cole, analyzing list of Taliban prohibitions, says that they all fit organically into what he calls an ‘episteme’. Many entertainment forms, like TV and radio and cinema, depicted landscapes that cut against this episteme; and the objects they depicted were especially singled out as well: the Taliban specifically outlawed Leonardo DiCaprio’s hairstyle in Titanic, which had been popular in Kabul among youths.

As Cole writes, much of this applied to ‘public’ space, but the Taliban also employed morality squads who could search homes for contraband objects, as well as practices. Weddings and things could not be accompanied by instrumental music, although the punishment for drum music was apparently discretionary to the particular inspector. Additionally, the Taliban, like the Mujahidin and the PDPA before them, had a well-developed network of informants, formal and informal/coerced, who could help police the domestic. Anecdotally, again, many families simply used kitchenware to produce music for happy occasions.

Returning to Cole’s article, you’re also right that urban society generally seems to have been ‘not much fun’. That is, Cole cites a Swedish Physicians for Human Rights report that says, among other things, that 97% of women surveyed (in 1998) showed clinical signs of major depression.

In the midst of this, sometimes, resistance itself could be a source of … not \*fun\*, exactly; but I’ll let the following speak for itself. Anne Brodsky quotes an activist in the Revolutionary Afghan Women’s Association, who ran underground educational and other services, especially for women, who were particularly restricted in their access to social goods:

“Our life is not without pleasure and meaning. Our sacrifice is for the value of freedom, not just for anything. I will not be able to achieve my personal goals in life—they were stolen by my country’s history. But for the children in this school I will sacrifice so they can reach theirs—they must be able to achieve. I am so angry at my own suffering and lost future that these innocent children must be aided.” (3) 

WITH ALL THAT, THOUGH:

As outlined in Geoffrey Robertson's book *An Inconvenient Genocide*, the core belief behind the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.

Robertson cites the Turkish "official" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: "[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false."

(It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)

On the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group...". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians "rose up" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that "credible evidence" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.

(Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)

tl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of "genocide" by the United Nations.


Okay, this is a hard question, because it is a very loaded one. You assume that current Turkish state does not see itself as the continuation of Ottoman Empire, but it does. I think an easier question to answer would be "why and how Turkey denies the Armenian genocide". 

There are different levels of genocide denial in Turkey, I will explain some of them and source them.

1st level: "There was no killings, therefore there was no genocide." This is NOT the most popular version of the denial in Turkey. Most Turks accept that there were killings. Defenders of this version are commonly the Neo-Ottomanists in Turkey. Their argument is that Armenians were called as "sadik millet" or "millet-i sadika" ("loyal nation") in the empire, then they betrayed Ottomans and sided with Russians. Started gangs and mass killed Turkish people and Ottomans had to exile them. This version of history totally dismisses all the evidence of mass killings, by using conspiracy theories. As an example of this theory you can look at an example, which defends that Armenian genocide was invented to slander Ottoman empire:

Ermeni Sorunu: Büyük Oyun (Armenian Problem: Grand Game) by Adem Suad

2nd level: According to this, there were mass killings on both sides, but this was not a genocide. This is by far the most commonly believed version in Turkey. They mix truth with conspiracy theories and say that accepting genocide will have serious consequences for Turkey so we should not do that. They describe Ottoman Empire at the time as weak, they say that as the empire could not protect its citizens, it had to use force against Armenians. As Armenian gangs terrorized Turkish villages, Turkish people started arming themselves and attacked Armenians for revenge and Ottoman Empire could not stop them. 

There are many different versions but they are all around denying responsibility in some manner. They say that for it to be counted as genocide, it has to be systematic, government has to round up all Armenians and kill all of them. As Ottoman Empire exiled the Armenians and some of them died on the road due to climate, starving etc. it is not a genocide. Founder of Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk himself described the events by using the word "fecaat" ("disaster"). But he would not see it as a genocide as well. The defenders of this theory overlook events where government killed people just because they were Armenians as particular mistakes. They say that "there is no written general plans of genocide".

Some examples of Turkish historians, politicians and generals defending this theory:

Sürgünden Soykırıma: Ermeni İddaları ("From Exile to Genocide: Armenian Claims) by Yusuf Halaçoğlu (historian)

Ermeni Suçlamaları ve Gerçekler ("Armenian Accusations and Truths") by İlker Başbuğ (ex army chief of Turkey)

Ermeni Sorununda Strateji ve Siyaset (Strategy and Politics in Armenian Problem) by Doğu Perinçek (far-right politician)

3rd level: It was a genocide, but it was committed by the Kurds. This is a last resort defense and has some truth to it, but again only partly. Ottoman Empire armed Muslim Kurds against Christians during 1890-1908, they are named as Hamidiye corps. After 1908, Ottoman Empire continued to support Kurdish aşirets (tribes? clans?) against Christians, especially Armenians. So some people claim that genocide happened, but it was the Kurds. Again, dismissing how Armenians in other parts of the empire were killed as well.

Source:

Hamidiye Alayları Ağrı Kürt Direnişi Ve Zilan Katliamı ("Hamidiye Corps, Agri Kurdish Resistance and Zilan Massacre") by Kemal Süphandağ.


All of these are very controversial. Especially in Turkey. But I hope I gave you some idea at least. Sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my native language.

Edit: There are also many other versions that I did not list. For example some people claim that it was the will of Germany and not the Ottoman Empire. A source for that:

Ermeni Tehcirinde Almanya Etkisi ("German Influence at Armenian Exile") by Bülent Keçik

There is some debate over whether the modern Republic of Turkey was the continuing state to the Ottoman Empire or a successor. The two entities fought on opposing sides in the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22), and even briefly co-existed as separate administrative units each claiming authority (whilst at war with one another): Turkey with its capital in Ankara and the Ottoman Empire from Istanbul. The nationalist faction, led by Mustafa Kemal who defected from the Ottoman army, established the modern republic as a nation state by defeating the opposing Ottoman elements in the independence war.

The Treaty of Lausanne (between UK, France, Italy, and Japan (world powers at the time) of 24 July 1923 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire.

Successor states choose to successor states so they can inherit the treaties and claims of the previous state, and in this case inherited the responsibility of the greco-muslim and armenian-turkish migrations.

Finally one I can chime in on! 

A lot of people in this thread have commented on the reasons the Turkish government itself believes there was no genocide. But, I feel that these answers are more based in *how* the Turkish government denies the Genocide and not *why*.  In her paper, *Reading Mustafa Kemal Ataturk on the Armenian Genocide* Fatma Ulgen argues that denialism is a core facet in the foundational ideology of the Turkish Republic.

Many of other other posters here have correctly stated that the narrative that there were massacres on both sides, Turkish and Armenian, is the state posited and state approved version. Fatma Ulgen argues that this state doctrine of denialism directly stems from Ataturk. It is necessary to know that Ataturk had a major hand in writing the history of Turkey and the Turks and the development of the national culture of Turkey. He had such a hand in these processes that Ulgen calls him the "ideological mastermind of Turkey." Further,  that the memory of Ataturk, to the present day, embodies and defines 'Turkishness' that "any criticism of him that deviates from the official ideology" can drive one out of 'Turkishness'. 

Knowing this one can fully understand the argument that Ulgen makes. A national identity of Turkey was lacking at the outset of the Republic, given that the Ottoman Empire was a multi-ethnic, empire and had not sufficiently transitioned over to the idea and practice of a nation-state even in the Young Turks time. Ataturk was concerned with building a national identity, and one method to building a national identity is to create myths out of real, historical events. Myths necessitate  revision and omission/addition of detail, in the telling of the events which occurred to the Armenians in 1915, Ataturk was building a foundational myth of the Turkish Republic as whole. So what did Ataturk have to say about the Armenian Genocide? 

Well...nothing good. Ulgen utilizes speeches, telegrams, and documents Ataturk wrote to analyze his stance on the issue and his actual contribution to the denialism which, up until recently, was the de facto narrative of the Turkish Republic. During the War of Resistance in the 1920s most of  Ataturk's texts on the Armenian issue tend to portray Armenians in an extensively negative light: On the eastern front, where the Armenians were fighting in a war of independence with the aim of setting up the first republic of Armenia, Ataturk calls much of the Armenian actions a "policy of extermination", "murder and savagery" of the Muslim inhabitants. In regards to the south Ataturk reframed the Maras massacres, in which thousands of Christians were slaughtered, into an event which portrayed Greeks and Armenians as the "old murders" and the Muslims as an "oppressed people wandering in the Anatolian territory in misery." Already, before even the establishment of  the Turkish Republic the narrative has placed the Armenians as a the negative actors in the war and the Muslims as those oppressed. While, not explicitly denialism, it sets up a myth of the Turks being oppressed and brutalized by Christian elements(the largest of these within Anatolia before the Genocide being the Armenians) which sought to take Turkish land away from them. This is an important thing to understand because it sets up the undertone for the actual denial of the genocide found within the *Nutuk*, a gigantic speech/history of Turkey given by Ataturk. 

The *Nutuk* a 600 page document, given over 6 days discusses the Armenian genocide literally within the first few pages of the speech, which goes to show the underlying necessity of addressing the "Armenian question" and the Armenian "deportations" in Ataturk's mind. Given that the *Nutuk* essentially sets up and directs all later Turkish state historiography and history, this is extremely important to the conception of the Turks as a national community. So, what does Ataturk say? He stresses that the deportation of the Armenians and the cruelties they faced were only committed by "instigators and agitators" and that "the people"(*millet*)  had no part in the "mistreatment". Within the first few pages of the Nutuk, which is probably the most important document to modern Turkey, the "Deportations" are played down by Ataturk, the actual horror of the events completely minimized and placed on faceless instigators and actors. Later he states that "the report of Armenian massacre was a 'calumny' perpetuated by those who wanted to prove the Armenians in the majority in the Eastern provinces" and that they were trying to "mislead the public into believing that the Muslim population 'was composed of savages whose chief occupation was to massacre Armenians.'" The other Armenian references within the *Nutuk* was much of the same content: the portrayal of Armenians as a the true perpetrators of the savagery in the East and in the South against the Muslim population.

The demonizing of the Armenian population, Ulgen argues, is an attempt by Ataturk to portray the Turkish people in a light of innocence and victimhood. So that, in effect, the destruction of the Armenian population is both denied and seems implausible to the eyes of anyone educated by the Turkish state educational system. Knowing now, that Ataturk through the *Nutuk* set up the foundational history and ideology of the Turkish state, central to which, as evidenced by the early addressing and the staunch support found within the document, is denialism. The reason the Turkish Republic denies the Genocide so vehemently is not because of reparations they would need to pay, but because the denial of the genocide is a foundational aspect of the Turkish identity and 'Turkishness' in general and thus acceptance of the genocide is a threat to the survival of the Turkish identity as a whole.  
I would like to ask a related question: was Turkey so worried about Armenians because the Seljuk Turks are not native to Anatolia; thus, they are sensitive about uprisings by 'native' pre-Turkic Anatolians?

Tolkien was a medievalist, so not surprisingly, he drew heavily from period primary sources. These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore. 

One of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some "tweaking" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.

Although Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by "dark elves." In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.

Tolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition. There are entities that seem to fall into that line (living within mountains, focusing on smithing, and various other attributes), but with dwarves we see the clearest, exclusive use of medieval sources.

One source I would recommend is John Rateliff's *History of the Hobbit*. He goes into a fair amount of detail on Tolkien's sources for some of the important concepts of the mythology; some of what's in there has already been brought up in this thread but it's an interesting book in any case. Rateliff's book can also point you to primary sources (like the Eddas) that have been mentioned in the thread.

For instance, in the notes about the Dwarves (on pp 76-80), Rateliff notes that previous treatments of the Dwarves that are similar to Tolkien's are found in the *Volsunga Saga*, the *Prose Edda*, and the *Nibelungenlied*, as well as the *Heidreks Saga* (which was later translated by Christopher Tolkien). He also notes a connection between the "Lombards" and Tolkien's "Longbeards", as well as parallels between the origin of Dwarves in Tolkien's early writings and the *Edda*. 

There are similar sections about goblins, elves, hobbits, dragons, and other elements of Tolkien's lore that first came out in published form in *The Hobbit*.

Also this may be going beyond the scope of AskHistory, but the notion that Tolkien "singlehandedly" created modern fantasy is somewhat exaggerated; although you can certainly say *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are by far the most influential fantasy books, there are precursors to Tolkien like Lord Dunsany and George MacDonald, both of whom Tolkien read. In addition, the pulp fantasy novels of writers like Robert Howard and Jack Vance have had a large influence on modern fantasy (due in large part to Dungeons and Dragons). But if you want to pursue this question further I would suggest a thread on /r/Tolkienfans or a fantasy-related subreddit.
Lets give this another shot.

Elves and dwarves have changed appearance and attitude throughout history.  The two mythologies where you'll find elves are the closely related Nordic and Celtic mythologies.  /u/itsallfolklore already talked about the Prose Edda and their "elves."  However, the dark elves seem closer to dwarves, as they live underground and were able to craft new hair for Sif after Loki cut it off, both of these are main themes in for Tolkien's dwarves.

But for elves and dwarves in celtic literature.  In celtic myths, elves are seen as more mischievous if not out-right malevolent.  Old medicine books like Balt's Leechbook and Wio Faerstice list elves as the cause for such maladies as elfshot, a pain caused my elves shooting you with arrows.  Later we can see the myth of elves have stayed mostly the same in Romeo and Juliet, during Marcutio's speech about Queen Mab, how she may give women pleasure nightly pleasure or warts.  Here we see fairies and elves used interchangeably.  Even as late as 1884, when Princess Nobody was published and The Shoemaker was translated, elves were both described as, and drawn as little fairy people.

Scandinavian elves are much more similar to celtic elves than Tolkien's elves, though they would fall between the two.  While some elves were small like celtic elves, as in The Elf of the Rose, but they could also be the size of a human when luring men into their elven dances.

Dwarves are much less interesting.  Tolkien's dwarves are closer to the myths of gnomes, which Paracelsus used interchangably with pygmys, called them earth elementals who live underground and are only about a foot tall.  Later, closer to Tolkien's life, gnomes were described as small people who live underground and protect riches in Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg.

Tolkien elves, dwarves, and humans are a christian allegory.  The Silmarillion is a bible of sorts.  Dwarves as a sort of Ishmael - an interference with God's (Illuvatar's) providence brought about by impatience, who would throughout history be at variance with the Elves.  Abraham and his sons compare with Fanwe.  Faenor is not Joseph, but instead is cast from Eden.  Earendil has something in common with Enoch and Elijah, in that he, as mortal, achieved passage to the blessed realm.  The devil was imprisoned for 1000 years and allowed free again, exactly the same as Melkor.  There are several differences that I wont go into, but the parallels are many.  

Tolkien grabbed bits and pieces of several myths, kept some characteristics, and added heavy christian framing.  While he didn't invent them entirely, he did put a new spin on elves and dwarves that has lasted into current pop culture.

I did not forget about orcs, I just have no idea where they came from.
My understanding was that all of the races were representative of the different races and classes of Europe at the time. With the elves representing the upper class, rich, beautiful, full of themselves etc and the dwarfs representing the Jews, a race of craftsmen kicked out of their ancestral homeland, more scared amongst the other worlds populations and with the hobbits being the ideal, English countryside-dweller.

Just so we're clear in advance: [this is Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy#/media/File:Rosemary_Kennedy_at_Court.jpg), making her debut at the English royal court.

In point of fact, none of the immediate Kennedy family expressed public remorse/criticism for inflicting the lobotomy on Rosemary--at least not directly. Now, whether they all believed it was the *right* thing to do, whether they believed it was the *utilitarian* thing to do, and whether they *indirectly* expressed a sense of failure or anger--that is, shall we say, a rather nebulous topic in biographies of the various Kennedys.

One camp, headlined subtly by Doris Kearns Goodwin and like a sledgehammer by Laurence Leamer at the two poles of the spectrum, sees in Joseph's actions after the 1941 "surgery" a man seeking solace (Goodwin) or who understood he had committed a major sin (Leamer). Joseph initially placed Rosemary at a rehab/care facility called Craig House that had an excellent reputation and charged the fees to back it up. Joseph's biographer (and actual professional historian) David Nasaw shows on the basis of letters sent to family members that Joseph most likely visited Rosemary several times over the course of the 1940s, although it became horribly clear she would regain any more of what had been wrenched away from her than some motor skills. Joseph's words to his family are noncomittal--"looks very well" "feeling quite well." In 1949, probably owning up to the long-term prognosis, he arranged a special place for her at an institution/"school" in Wisconsin run by Franciscan Colettine nuns. As in, he gave *buckets* of money to the place for special accommodations for her. 

Of course, while Joseph was doing all of this, he was keeping his family away from visiting Rosemary themselves, and misleading them about the shockingly awful lobotomy results. Whether he was trying to insulate himself from his wife Rose's wrath, or protect his family from seeing what he'd done, OR protect his family from seeing that what he perceived as a last-ditch attempt to help her had still failed, is left to question.

For his part, Nasaw, whose take is generally considered among the most equitable, refuses to make a judgment call on whether Joseph believed he had done the wrong thing. But although he won't go as far to paint Joseph as a father with at least *some* sorrowful feelings for his daughter as Goodwin, she is much more brutal about the effect this had on Rose. She tells the story of Rose asking her friends over and over, "Why didn't you tell me?" only for her friends to say, "we didn't know either." In her memoirs, she wrote:

> The operation eliminated the violence and the convulsive seizures, but it also had the effect of leaving Rosemary permanently incapacitated. She lost everything that had been gained during the years by her own gallant efforts and by our loving efforts for her. She had no possibility of ever being able to function in a viable way in the world at large.

I'm not sure how this is not generally accounted a direct attack on Joseph's decision, but it does not seem to be? But then, this may be a pattern. There is one letter where Joseph comments more extensively on Rosemary's existence in the world, rather than breezy mentions of doing well. In 1958, he wrote to the nuns of St. Coletta's expressing his deep gratitude for their "persevering kindness" towards Rosemary. And pretty much every writer quotes the same lines:

> I am still very grateful for your help. After all, the solution to Rosemary's problem has been a major factor in the ability of all the Kennedys to go about their life's work and to try to do it as well as they can.

Nasaw offers zero commentary; Goodwin suggests he is expressing sorrow for the outcome, and maybe or maybe not the decision. Disability rights advocates, on the other hand, have pointedly asked, "Is Rosemary not 'all the Kennedys'?" And in Joseph's words, they find him saying that isolating Rosemary in Wisconsin, away from the world's knowledge and from her own family, was the only way that the rest of them could be successful. That is to say: people with cognitive disabilities are a problem to be solved, and to be solved by exclusion.

Of course, the rest of the Kennedys went on to champion mental health services and services for people with cognitive disabilities on the national and even international scale. Rose Kennedy was orchestrating donations for child neurology research through the Kennedy Foundation into the 2000s--and, for whatever bitterness she held, ensuring that things with a name attached would memorialize Joseph as well as herself. Jack signed a series of mental health services bills into law; while they ultimately resulted in massively inadequate care for a lot of people when the requires facilities were never built (a failure of money and a crime of NIMBYism), Senator Daniel Moynihan suggested that Jack would have *flipped tables* in the White House if he thought people like his sister would not be taken care of. Eunice Kennedy Shriver's activism in creating an arena for social life and growth in the Special Olympics I've discussed elsewhere in the thread. Ted Kennedy was pushing for mental health insurance coverage parity until the end of his life. And people generally agree that the Kennedys did a lot to raise awareness of the actual, real existence of people with cognitive disabilities and mental health disorders--and more to the point, of starting to crack the stigma on talking about them in the first place.

They shouldn't get all the credit. The 1950s saw mothers (and some fathers, but mostly mothers) of children with Down's syndrome banding together in parents' groups--ARC is founded in 1951--and did a lot to cast off the idea that a diagnosis of developmental disability was *the absolute end* for the togetherness of the family. On the other hand, you can't argue with the impact of the visibility--and pocketbooks--of the Kennedys.

I'm not a cynic who sees the other Kennedys "using" Rosemary as a platform, or rather, of "taking advantage" of her. Nevertheless, I have to wonder why--in the face of all the crusading--Rosemary herself was never allowed a presence. The lobotomy destroyed the person she had been...but there are all kind of people at all levels of cognitive ability in America. So I think it's a real question that both historians assessing the situation and disability rights advocates have to ask: were they (and hence, people in a similar situation) keeping Rosemary out of sight because of guilt, shame, unwillingness to criticize the family patriarch? Or did they conclude based on what they knew of Rosemary's own thoughts and hopes, rather than their own, what *she* would have preferred...had she only been able to voice them herself?

Can I ask a side question? I've heard that JFK was a big proponent of the community mental health act because of how his sister was treated in state institutions. Is there any truth to that?

>**At the time of US independence, the 13 colonies had 2+ million inhabitants, whereas the mother country, Britain, had only 8+ million.**

To be slightly more precise, the figures are probably 2,750,000 for the newly formed USA and about 7,5 million for Great Britain, excluding Ireland (around 4 million).

&#x200B;

>**How is it possible a colony could grow organically to 25% of home population in such a short time?**

That's mainly a matter of math. Essentially, it's a relatively small disparity between the birth rate and the mortality rate in the colonies which, over a period of about 150 years, resulted in marked growth. Whereas those figures in Britain remained much closer to one another and hence resulted in a less spectacular population increase.

1. **A higher birth and lower death rate**

The growth rate of the English colonies was remarkable. Especially in New England, which saw spectacular increases in population without the need for immigration. The annual population increase in New England exceeded the death rate by well over 3%. This might seem a small number, but figures like these are very significant when they're sustained over a long period of time because growth then effectively becomes exponential.

For example:

A population of 1,000 people (women) with a constant annual growth of 3% will result in a population figure of about 19,218 a century later;  which is an increase of well over 1800% compared to the initial 1000 people. Based on commonly cited estimates and without taking additional immigration into account, the 1780 US population had increased by less than that figure (increasing by about 1735%) over the preceding century. When accounting for immigration, an annual growth rate of 2.8% will easily get you from 151,500 colonists in 1680 to about 2,780,400 Americans in 1780.

To again stress the huge differences in outcome regarding these deceptively small figures: had the net growth rate been 3,5% instead of 3% the 1680 population would have resulted in 4,725,450 Americans in 1780; i.e. almost double its most probable historical estimate.

By comparison: the historical population of Britain is estimated at 6.5 million in 1680 and 7.5 million in 1780. This is a significant 15% increase, but a far slower growth rate than that of the Thirteen Colonies. The average birth rate and death rate largely  explain this. In the Thirteen Colonies the birth rate lay between 6.5 and 7.5 for much of the 17th century. Whereas the average total fertility rate in 17th century Britain was about 4.5 per woman. At the same time the average mortality rate in Britain (4.0-4.5 between 1640 and 1750) was much higher than that of the colonies, accounting for a slower level of growth prior to 1750.

In a large part, the discrepancy in death rates can be attributed to living conditions. 90% of Americans were farmers, living on countryside farms or small villages. Apart from a few port cities, urbanization within the American colonies was largely non-existent. In contrast, close to 35% of the British population lived in settlements with more than 2,500 inhabitants, with 15% of the total population living in cities of over 20,000 people. In general, for any period prior to the advent of modern sanitation and medicine, cities and large towns have a negative effect on the average health. It's hard to quantify this with solid examples, but one would be that of average height. A sample of British males (prisoners on their way to Australia) in 1780 showed the average height to be 5 feet 4 inches, whereas a sample of soldiers from the American Continental Amy in 1776 measured 5 feet 8 inches,  showing they were about 10 cm taller on average.

Poverty was also less of a factor in the ever expanding United States, with more than enough "free" land for sons of farmers to settle on; essentially providing a basic way of supporting oneself for everyone willing to work the land.

3. **Immigration**

American population growth was mainly, but not exclusively due to organic growth. Some 400,000 people immigrated (whether by their own choice, or not) to the Thirteen Colonies from Europe and Africa between 1700 and 1763. Even though immigrants, for most of the period prior to the American Revolution, never accounted for more than 10% of the population, they nevertheless contributed significantly to the ever expanding population base. Additionally, in the 17th century (when 85% of the immigrants came from Britain) these migrants slowed down population growth in Britain, though these effects had lessened by the 18th century, when less than 20% of the newly arriving immigrants were of British origins.

3. **Additional factors**

The period just following the initial colonization efforts in 1620-40 saw the start of the English Civil War, which (as a civil war) had a larger more negative impact on British population figures than a standard war; fought by abroad. Its overall impact on the population however, was still a relatively minor one.

&#x200B;

>**No other colonial power faced the same power disparity.**

Yes, but only when concerning the heritage of the settlers. Spain proper made up 42% of the total population of the Spanish Empire in 1800. By comparison, the Thirteen Colonies made up 'a mere' 27%  of the combined population of the colonies and Britain in 1780.

It is true, that the ethnic make up of the Spanish Empire was far more diverse/mixed than that of the English colonies and that they also included large percentages of native populations. The main factors in this difference in population composition are natural ones. The Spanish, for example, colonized latitudes with harsher climates and relatively more tropical diseases, for example malaria. The English colonies in North America, by comparison, were very similar to Britain itself; allowing for a rapid colonization by farmers and requiring far less adaptation in terms of agricultural methods. The same process, on a far smaller scale, can be observed in sub-Saharan Africa, which has no significant (genetically) European population beyond the descendants of the Dutch in South Africa; which is the only locality with a Europe-like climate.

In brief, one can approach this question down in a few ways:

**Were they likely to be considered literal war crimes and open to prosecution at the time?** No, because the Allies came up with the definitions and applications of the ideas of war crimes, and exempted themselves very deliberately from prosecution. Were they hypocritical? It was argued by some of those under prosecution for war crimes, and even by some who were more neutral, that there were obvious hypocrisies (aside from the US and UK participating in mass bombing of civilians, you also have things like the Soviet lootings and rapes, as well as mass executions at Katyn, and so on), and that this devalued the usefulness of "war crimes" as a category if it basically only applied to losers in war. 

**Were they radically morally different from other Allied activities?** It depends on how you want to parse out the morality, but they are alike in many ways (though not all) to the use of napalm (firebombing) against Japanese and, to a lesser but still significant extent, German cities. In these attacks, mass areas were targeted, with deliberate goals of destroying civilian housing and infrastructure, and with the knowledge that many civilians would die. This was especially true of the infamous raids against Tokyo and its environs in March 1945, which killed as many people as the atomic bombings did. One could argue, if one wanted, that the atomic bombs were slightly worse from this perspective: they were considerably more deadly for the area of target destroyed, especially compared to later firebombings, because of their surprise and speed of attack (with firebombings, there are ways to detect the attack ahead of time and flee, and also some measure of defense possible in terms of firefighting and fire breaks; these were not the case with the atomic bombings). The Allies also did warn, in way both vague and specific, about firebombing attacks; they did not warn (contrary to Internet myths) about the atomic bombing attacks. Is this splitting hairs? It doesn't really matter for this analysis: if you are saying that the atomic bombs were "just as bad or maybe worse" than the firebombings, you probably already are concluding that the indiscriminate targeting of civilians was some measure of "business as usual," which does _not_ in any way get you off the hook for questions about "war crimes" (in fact, it is even worse — saying you _regularly_ committed similar offenses does not make them less heinous).

**Did people at the time worry about the morality of these kinds of attacks?** Yes, both inside and outside the US government. There were many people in and out of the US who condemned the attacks, or at least questioned the city-targeting aspects of them. Within the US, even those who plotted to use the atomic bombs saw them as being imbued with special moral hazards, and thought that indiscriminate targeting of cities was potentially not aligned with stated US values. Scientists on the project (at the University of Chicago) warned that targeting cities with the first bombs would lead the world down a very dark path, and could not be justified (see the Franck Report). At higher levels, even the US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, warned Truman that indiscriminate firebombing might allow the US to exceed the reputation of the Nazis for atrocities, and worked (in a way that one might or might not judge meaningful) to keep the city of Kyoto off the target list partially as a means of mitigating the moral issues. In a forthcoming paper, I have argued that I think Truman himself saw the bomb in these terms, and that in agreeing with Stimson that Hiroshima, not Kyoto, should be the first target of the atomic bombings, he was (incorrectly) under the impression that the bomb would be first used on a "purely military target" (as he put it) and not a city. He did not, I argue, learn Hiroshima was in fact a city (and that 90% of the casualties were civilian) until August 8, 1945, as an aside. All of which is to say, if someone says to you, "nobody had moral issues with this at the time," they are wrong. Plenty of people, _including the people who ordered the atomic bombs be dropped_, recognized that this kind of bombing _did_ present moral hazards, though of course they did not think they were considering them "war crimes." But it opens the door to us considering them as moral hazards without being accused of being ahistorical.

**Did the atomic bombings violate any treaties the US had signed _at the time_?** No. The US had not signed many treaties on the laws of war at the time, and the ones it did sign did not really come into play. One can make a very stretching argument that the atomic bombings might fall under the prohibition of the use of poisonous gases, but it is a stretch (they did not create significant contamination; the deaths were primarily from fire and blast effects). 

**Would the atomic bombings of Japan count as war crimes if they were done _today_?** The US has very lengthy guidelines for how it interprets the Geneva Conventions and the Law of War today, and how nuclear weapons play into that. In principle such an attack plan — target the center of a city for the purpose of destroying the city and terrorizing a country into surrender — would probably _not_ be considered a justifiable reason to use nuclear force, as it would violate the principles of discrimination (it would unduly target non-combatants) and likely proportionality (it is overkill for the goals it is trying to accomplish). This does not mean that you could not come up with a rationale for doing the same thing (e.g., you could re-frame the justification around military necessity, the limitation of conventional forces to do the same job, a focus on the military and industrial facilities in the target zone, etc.), but the rationale used _at the time_, which is to say, the destruction of a civilian population for the purpose of convincing Japan to surrender, would probably not pass the legal scrutiny of the JAGs. But these kinds of questions are notoriously difficult to parse in the abstract, so who really knows. Current US plans for the employment of nuclear weapons are structured around the ideas of discrimination, necessity, and proportionality, and so instead of saying, "put a huge explosion in the city center" they are about how you would destroy some specific military capability in the city. Is that a moral difference? This is a question for another day. But again, I suspect the US would _not_ find it easy to justify the attacks under the _present_ Geneva Convention it has signed to (some years after World War II) which is much more explicit about the illegality of targeting cities in this way. But we should also note, while we are on the subject, that the US has found the means to justify a lot of other kinds of city bombing after WWII, which makes me a wary about concluding that the lawyers could not find a way to justify it. They are clever, after all. 

In short: by modern standards they would probably not be permissible actions. By the standards of the time, they ride the line of what the Allies considered permissible _when they were doing them_, though this was seen by many as hypocritical. In any event, the fact that they were credited with ending the war (whether they did or not is a hot topic of scholarly debate), and the fact that the Allies created the war crimes tribunal, meant that not only were there no negative consequences for those who were involved in the bombings, but in fact almost all of those who were involved saw their careers flourish as a result of them.

Question (can I ask questions here): why is Hiroshima more remembered than Nagasaki? Sometimes people will only mention Hiroshima, as if Hiroshima is a synonym for the atomic bombings.

Edit: Yes I know Hiroshima was first. I knew that before I asked. That alone doesn’t answer my question. Is it just because people only remember the first one? We haven’t used the bomb hundreds of times. Why is the second one, Nagasaki, forgotten?

Germany bombed London mercilessly. Was this considered a war crime? 
What about other bombings that caused mass civilian casualties?
Stupid question but have those two areas recovered? As in, are they still a ruined wasteland or did they rebuild these areas ?

More can always be said on this or pretty much any other topic, but there was an interesting answer to a similar question by /u/muskwatch answering [Why do we sometimes translate the names of Native American historical figures \(Sitting Bull\) and sometimes not \(Tecumseh\)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6km3wi/why_do_we_sometimes_translate_the_names_of_native/djnc8vd/), which might help to answer the question. Hope that helps!
Can I expand this question to ask why we know Aztec figures like Cuauhtemoc and Moctezuma from the names rendered through their native languages, but we very frequently refer to similarly famous Mayan figures like Lady Six Sky and Smoking Squirrel with these oddly literal English translations of their names from the Mayan languages?

More can always be said, but [this older answer which focuses on 1876 election](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7flfd4/the_us_presidential_election_of_1876_had_the/dqcyh7h/) may be of interest, which I'll repost here with some slight updates. It doesn't look at 1896 specifically, but is contrasting the late 1800s with the early 1900s, and the impact of Jim Crow and other voter suppression, so is quite relevant.

-------

To start things off, it is important to keep in mind that turnout was consistently high in the late 1800s. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would begin precipitously around 1900.

So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons (but not only, of course) to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite "loopholes" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.

This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early '80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.

So having looked a little at the election of 1876, and how it is a little higher than normal, but not too out of line for the period, this leads to another question... Why was 1872 a *very* noticeable anomaly at 71.3%, bounded in 1868 by a turnout of 78.1%, and of course 1876 at 81.8%?

Let's start in 1868. That year, Grant ran against Horatio Seymour, a northern Democrat from New York, and won with a fairly respectable vote lead. He was especially buoyed by a strong performance in the South, winning many of the former Confederate states. How though? Well, an astute observer might notice that despite a much higher turnout *percentage*, the actual numbers of voters was lower, which would be somewhat counter-intuitive. But, while I have been unable to find any sources which explain *specifically* how that number is calculated, if it is counting eligible voters against turnout, it seems likely that it is accepting the disenfranchisement of many *white* former rebels in the Southern states as legal and proper, and not counting them in the rolls of eligible voters. Certainly, it was the lack of their votes which, unable to balance out the newly enfranchised black vote in the South, helped to support his campaign down there. 

This stands in comparison to the 1872 election, where those former rebels had since been reenfranchised, and thus counted in the rolls of eligible voters. But many voters nevertheless chose to stay home, why? Well, check out who was running! Grant was seeking reelection, but his opponent was Horace Greeley - a Republican, not a Democrat! He was riding the Liberal Republican ticket, a splinter party from the Republicans, dissatisfied with Grant and much of what he had done in his first term. They lacked an entirely cohesive platform but generally stood, at the least, for playing nice with the South, and ending or softening the various Federal policies directed there. Greeley had been one of the most forceful voices in the Republican party for sectional reconciliation, and would win its nomination, but it wasn't straight forward, and caused a good deal of acrimony. At the Party Convention which nominated him, he had gone into is not as the favorite, beating out Charles Francis Adams after six ballots. There was enough bitter disagreements after his victory speech and declaration of platform that Adams supporters mostly just went back to the Grant camp, even if begrudgingly, unwilling to support the "turncoat and traitor", representative of the lack of cohesion in the movement from the start.

As for the Democrats... they simply didn't run a candidate. As newspaper editor Theodore Tilton wrote in aptly summing up the sentiment followed:

>Since the Democratic party pledges itself to abide by the constitutional amendments [...] and since it wants universal amnesty [...] why not therefore let the better class of Democrats unite with the anti-Grant Republicans?

But the party was dominated by the Northern Democrats, and perhaps the platform was one they could support, but not necessarily one that made voters in the deep south happy, or at least enough so to nominally vote for a non-Democrat. In the end, it was a fairly tepid election, between two candidates who didn't quite endear themselves well. Grant waltzed to reelection with a 11.80 percent margin on the back of an electorate that perhaps wasn't all in for him, but couldn't get behind Greeley's "motley" mix of appeals. What it did represent though was the growing dissatisfaction within *some* parts of the Republican party, who tired of Reconstruction which they were becoming convinced was a failure. It was, of course, a conflict that would underpin the next election, as already noted, but with an actual context between Republicans and Democrats, rather than divisions within the Republican Party alone.

1/
If you want to read in detail about it, Keyssar's *The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States* is a good overview, if overly descriptive at times. His overarching argument is that although the United States was unique in gaining a very extensive franchise from a very early period - something like 70-80% of adult white men able to vote by 1800 - this was achieved before industrialisation and the threat of an organised working class. Once that occurred, with the social changes accompanying it, there was a general pushback against democracy - "*the terms of public discussion were being set by men who believed that universal suffrage had failed, that it was neither viable nor desirable in the socially heterogeneous, industrial world of the late nineteenth century*" - this being most prominent in the period after Reconstruction.

The most egregious example of this is the disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South with Jim Crow laws. In 1890 Mississippi, less than 9000 out of 147,000 voting age blacks able to vote, or Louisiana went from 130,000 registered blacks to 1342 from 1896-1904. But this wasn't a purely racial picture, but a class-based one. The sort of restrictions that disenfranchise black voters are likely to target poor whites too, and helps explain why Mississippi went from 70% turnout in the 1870s to only 15% for most of the early 20th century. And the United States enjoyed a surge in immigration at this time, and the presence of ~15% of the population born in another country, with another significant percentage being the children of immigrants, and often not speaking English or looking much like 'old-stock' Americans, solidified reaction to them.

Furthermore, as Keyssar draws attention to “*depending on the state or city in which he lived, a man could be kept from the polls because he was an alien, a pauper, a lumberman, an anarchist, did not pay taxes or own property, could not read or write, had moved from one state to another in the past year, had recently moved from one neighborhood to another, did not possess his naturalization papers, was unable to register on the third or fourth Tuesday before an election, could not prove that he had canceled a prior registration, been convicted of a felony, or been born in China or on an Indian reservation*”.

We tend to think of these kind of restrictions as relatively minor, but when analysed together, it had a significant effect on turnout, and was clearly class(and immigrant)-discriminatory. A few examples demonstrate this point. In 1921 New York – the city with the largest immigrant population in the nation – followed many other states in enacting a constitutional amendment to enact a literacy requirement. Given 25% of men who took army literacy test during WWI failed it, the effects of such a policy were enormous. Residence and registration requirements operated in a similar way. The number of people who lived in Boston at any point in 1880s was 3x greater than its highest population at a single time (fairly typical for many cities at this time), the vast majority of this mobile population consisting of members of the working class who would now find it much harder to vote. Another example is the introduction of restrictive voting policies for immigrants. There is nothing in the constitution saying that aliens can't vote, and all restrictions on it comes from the states. The picture varied over the 19th century (generally frontier states would have permissive alien voting laws to encourage settlement, and in the East it was more restricted) but by the early 20th century the tide had turned decisively for restrictions - Arkansas being the last state to allow it, changing that by 1926.

In total, most of these new restrictions were only introduced in the late 19th and early 20th century, and they were disproportionately targeting immigrants and the working class. This goes a significant way to explaining how turnout dropped so much by the 1920s.
Excellent reads. It’s amazing how much of this is glossed over in school and even college level courses in the US. This is must know information .

The early Mormon Church invested heavily in its proselytizing efforts and found its greatest success with missions to the United Kingdom. New converts were encouraged to take the arduous trip to America and across the plains to Utah as soon as they were able. Even now, descendants of immigrants from the British Isles form the largest source of the populations in Utah and Idaho .

As a consequence of these efforts, the British experience of Mormonism, which Conan Doyle might, in part, have been reacting to, was of young missionaries preaching to people who would subsequently disappear (to the U.S.) forever. Mormonism was commonly considered a cult and, of course, their practice of polygamy was well-known and widely denounced in Victorian England. Mormon missionaries were sometimes portrayed in the press and early films as Svengalis, who would mesmerize and brainwash their targets (typically young women).

Conan Doyle was known to be an avid reader and historians have suggested he based his opinions of Mormonism on several books published in England, including two by defectors from, and critics of the practice of polygamy: Fannie Stenhouse and Anna Eliza Young (one of the 55 wives of Brigham Young). These books describe a regime that was, in fact, seriously oppressive toward women. Other books commonly cited among his influences were authored by William Hickman, William Jarman and John Hyde.

William "Wild Bill" Hickman was a member of the Church, who claimed to have murdered several people at Brigham Young's direction. These included an extermination order against the Timpanogos tribe of Utah. He was later excommunicated when, according to his account, he refused to assassinate someone else at Young's order. Hickman then wrote a book admitting numerous murders, which was published under the title, *Brigham's Destroying Angel: being the life, confession, and startling disclosures of the notorious Bill Hickman, the Danite chief of Utah*.

Conan Doyle's first Holmes novel was clearly inspired, in part, by the Danites, a mysterious fraternal organization of Church members. The Danites were organized as a vigilante group to fight in the 1838 Mormon War, and were sometimes referred to as *Destroying Angels*. There is little evidence of the group's continued existence after 1838, but they became the subject of myth both in and outside the Church. Named for one of the twelve tribes of Israel, the Danites were supposed to a cabal of Mormon leaders, who acted as secret enforcers for the Church. Brigham Young repeatedly denied their existence, as he did in June 1857, when he said publicly: "\[people claim that the Danites\] are in every town and city throughout the whole of the United States, and that their object is not known by the people. That they are all over the world; that there are thousands of them, and that the life of every officer that comes here is in the hands of the Danites. That even the President of the United States is not safe, for at one wink from Brigham the Danites will be upon him and kill him...It is all a pack of nonsense, the whole of it." Perhaps not surprisingly, such denials were not universally successful in suppressing the rumors.

Conan Doyle was swept up in and convinced by some strange, fad beliefs, such as spiritualism and the existence of fairies. In any case, he wrote *A Study in Scarlet* in three weeks, while he was also a practicing physician, suggesting it was not a heavily researched work, but sprang from his impressions of the Church formed from rumor and whatever prior reading he had done.

Conan Doyle defended his work against a backlash from Mormons by saying the kind of events he described (murder, kidnapping, secret surveillance...) were, "a matter of historical record," though he admitted the descriptions were, "lurid." His daughter would later say, "You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons."

To conclude, and to answer your questions, I wouldn't say Conan Doyle had weird prejudices, but he was reflecting the unsorted mix of prejudice, myth and fact available to him at the time. Again, though clearly highly intelligent, he could be overly credulous at times. He was also a fiction writer, more concerned with delivering a sensational story than carefully recounting facts.
Mormons were definitely demonized at the time. A Study in Scarlet (1887), the first Holmes story, was first published in the Strand Magazine. It was one of dozens of novels in this time period that depicted Mormons as predatory villains trying to trap virtuous young women into polygamy. These "dime novels" were almost never particularly accurate, but they did reflect a real sense at the time that Mormons were degraded, lustful fiends.

Let me back up just a bit and define "Mormons." We're talking here about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. There were other "Mormon" churches that traced their roots to Joseph Smith, including groups in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the largest branch after the LDS Church, the Reorganized Church in Missouri. Smith founded the church in 1830, and after his assassination in 1844 in Illinois, several splits occurred over the next several years that led to multiple groups claiming to be the one true successor to Smith.

The Reorganized Church in particular went to great lengths to distance itself from the Utah church and denounce polygamy. They taught for many years (erroneously) that Joseph Smith never practiced polygamy and did not introduce it to the church, but that it was Smith's LDS successor Brigham Young who started it all. Smith did practice polygamy, but did so secretly, and so it wasn't until 1852 when the LDS Church announced to the world that it believed in polygamy.

Like many groups that have an unusual belief or practice that is maligned for the practice, the LDS Church dug in its heels on polygamy. Leaders began to preach that polygamy was not only an acceptable practice, but was superior to monogamy. They taught that in order to achieve full exaltation in the highest kingdom of heaven, one must be a polygamist. Utah was isolated in the American West—the Mormons settled it in 1847, but the transcontinental railroad wasn't completed until 1869. Rumors from federal appointees would make their way east into newspapers about how Brigham Young, who was territorial governor, was running a theocracy in Utah (he basically was).

In 1857, Mormons in southern Utah massacred an immigrant train of around 120 men, women, and children from Arkansas at a place that was called the Mountain Meadows. This Mountain Meadows Massacre was quickly reported in newspapers across the country. The act only further isolated the Mormons from the country and reinforced the view of them as a strange, bizarre people.

Cartoonists lampooned Brigham Young and the Mormons as oddities. Popular images showed Young in bed for dozens of women. They portrayed Mormons as menacing. After the Civil War, more attention was paid to the church and the federal government began to intervene. They passed anti-polygamy legislation, and they passed legislation restricting emigration of Mormon converts from Europe.

It's against all this backdrop that we get the appearance of these dime novels portraying Mormon men—especially Mormon missionaries—as predators. They often depict an innocent, naive young woman who falls under the Mormon man's spell. She is kidnapped or coerced into traveling to Utah. She must be rescued by a daring suitor or some other hero.

One of my favorites, for those of you familiar at all with Salt Lake City, has a climactic chase where the kidnapped woman climbs to the tallest spire of the Salt Lake Temple and leaps into the Great Salt Lake to escape her captors. The Great Salt Lake is at minimum 15 miles from the Salt Lake Temple. But none of that mattered to readers who had never been to Salt Lake and of course, given what they had heard, had no intention of going.

These dime novels were popular and most were of poor quality, but "A Study in Scarlet" stands out. Most people who dive into Sherlock Holmes and decide to read them in chronological order of publication are surprised to discover that the world's most famous detective, and one of the world's most famous fictional characters ever, got his start in an anti-Mormon dime novel.

The first half of the novel includes Holmes tracking down a killer, but the second half is dedicated to the Latter-day Saints in Utah (again, this surprises first-time readers), who come across a man and a girl in the desert and rescue them. The man and girl live in Utah, but when the girl comes of age, she is expected to become the plural wife of one of the sons of a prominent Mormon leader. They give her thirty days. But she has a suitor who intervenes to rescue her. I won't spoil the mystery or the story for those who would like to read it, but it's something else.

How accurate were these dime novels? They weren't. Apart from the many details they often invented or got wrong, they portrayed Mormons in a way that wasn't particularly fair to who they really were. Polygamy was not the utopia Mormons portrayed, of course. Men played favorites with their wives, and some women lived in different homes than their husbands, had little money, and lived in poverty. But on the flip side, women in Utah were granted the right to vote in 1870, long before nearly any other state in the Union. It was all, to say the least, complicated.

Dissenters and non-Mormons did live in Utah. They had plenty of complaints about LDS domination of politics and business, but by and large, they lived peacefully. In 1870, the "Salt Lake Tribune" was founded, which stood in stark opposition to Young and LDS publications. It provided an outlet and news for non-Mormons.

As the federal government continued to crack down on polygamy, things became intolerable for the church. The Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887) was the last straw. The government threatened to seize church property, including temples. It had already disenfranchised polygamists and states like Idaho had implemented test oaths for anyone wanting to vote or run for public office. In 1890, the Woodruff Manifesto announced that Mormons would no longer enter into new plural marriages.

But the church continued to approve some plural marriages in secret. Rumors continued about these marriages and Mormons continued to be lampooned in the media. The advent of motion pictures allowed for a new kind of dime novel—the anti-Mormon movie. Films like "A Mormon Maid" (1917) and "A Victim of the Mormons" (1911) followed the basic plotline of the earlier dime novels. They portrayed Mormons wearing strange robes and clothing and trapping women into unwanted polygamous marriages.

But by then the church had truly abandoned polygamy with the second manifesto in 1904. Apostle Reed Smoot had been elected to the US Senate, and lengthy hearings were held in Washington, DC, to see if he should be granted his seat. Mormon church president Joseph F. Smith testified before Congress, albeit at times not very truthfully, about the continued practice of polygamy. Because of the attention paid to the church, Smith issued the manifesto and banned all future plural marriages.

I've covered a lot of ground, but for some good overviews of this, I recommend Sarah Barringer Gordon, \_The Mormon Question: Polygamy and Constitutional Conflict in Nineteenth-Century America\_ (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002); Kathleen Flake, \_The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle\_ (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004); Michael Austin and Ardis Parshall, \_Dime Novel Mormons\_ (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2017); and for portrayals of Mormons as savages and "other," see W. Paul Reeve, \_Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness\_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2017).

Edit: A few commenters have called out my language in describing the Mountain Meadows Massacre as something that made Americans see Mormons as odd and "strange." It's a fair criticism and I wasn't trying to minimize the horrific nature of the massacre; rather, I was trying to explain that Mormons were already viewed as a bizarre religious cult. There were rumors around "Danites"—Mormon assassins who would execute dissidents or those who tried to leave the faith.

The massacre itself was, if possible, worse than it sounds. After a siege, Mormons separated the men from the women and children, had the women and children march a ways down a trail, and then they killed both groups. Later, Mormons tried to blame the massacre on Paiutes. While there were some Paiutes involved, the massacre was wholly the result of southern Utah Mormons surrounding the wagon train and then deciding to exterminate everyone except a handful of extremely young children—infants and toddlers, essentially. I'd recommend reading Juanita Brooks or Will Bagley on the massacre. Though I'm not persuaded by Bagley's assertions on Brigham Young, he is a brilliant researcher and writer, and a dear friend.

This thread shows how contested Mormon history is. I've already been asked if I'm LDS because my answer is perceived as too biased in favor of the Mormons. I'm not LDS, but I'm very used to the skepticism. Although Mormon studies is becoming more and more professionalized as an academic practice, it frequently inspires a very binary response. Latter-day Saints want to know, "Is this person for us or against us?" Conversely, those who have left the faith are, if possible, even more intense and skeptical—at least in my experience.

My use of terms like "complicated" and "messy" isn't an effort to whitewash or somehow defend the LDS Church, but it's to acknowledge that these things \*are\* messy and complicated. Even here on Reddit, which allows for much broader discussion than say, Facebook or Twitter, there are still limitations. I'd encourage anyone interested in a particular topic to PM and I'm happy to offer additional reading.

Although mentioned in the thread elsewhere, I just want to re-stress the existence of the Sunday Digest, as some people are either unaware that it is intended to also highlight interesting questions that remained unanswered, not just great answers of the past week, or in some cases not even aware the thread exists at all! Well, it does, and in many ways serves the role of what you are looking for here, although user driven rather than mod driven. It goes up Sunday Morning and is stickied, for a day or two. You can find previous ones [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Edit: Also to move this up to the top instead of as a reply, I *heavily* encourage people to use the "Remind Me" bot if you see a thread which is interesting, and which hasn't been answered yet. /u/RemindMeBot can ping you in X amount of time to come back and check the thread later. While we ask that users don't post coments to the bot in thread, [the RemindMeBot works via PM too](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/), so you can set up the reminder[using that function](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLINK%20INSIDE%20SQUARE%20BRACKETS%20else%20default%20to%20FAQs%5D%0A%0ANOTE:%20Don%27t%20forget%20to%20add%20the%20time%20options%20after%20the%20command.%0A%0ARemindMe!) in the future. 

Aside from that, if you have [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com) installed, it provides a Subscription function, to keep you subscribed to a thread for a period of time (I think three days?). And simple default reddit has a [Save](https://www.reddit.com/user/xxxxUSERNAMExxxxx/saved) function and also allowed you to see [everything you have upvoted](https://www.reddit.com/user/xxxxxUSERNAMExxxxx/upvoted/).

While I realize it isn't *exactly* the same thing, not being specifically triggered by an answer being present, the fact is that most questions which end up at the top of the sub do get answered! It takes a little patience, of course, since it may be 10+ hours after a thread goes up, but it usually happens. [I just sorted by top and opened up the 20 most popular threads from the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/top/), of those, only two lacked any real top level answer. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/54ey6x/if_obama_does_not_get_a_supreme_court_justice_in/) had links to previous, relevant threads though, leaving only [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/55n7k7/how_easy_was_to_get_new_identity_and_vanish_at/). So either 2/20, or 1/20, depending how you want to swing it, but in either case, thats a pretty excellent track record for getting an answer, and I think does make a clear argument that for a trending thread, a simple "Remember to check this thread tomorrow" reminder is nearly as good as a "Ping me when it is answered" alert.
There's nothing wrong with reposting a question, if it's gone a long while without an answer.  I posted a question several months ago, and it got zero response, so after a month or so went by, I cut and pasted the post into a new post, and that one got several quality answers.  As long as you wait a good long while to see if the first post gets an answer, I think you're OK to repost it.

**NOTE I'm neither a mod nor a researcher, so my interpretation of the rules might be wrong.  If so, please correct me**
There are great questions that get a lot of up votes and no quality answers. There are plenty of very interesting questions that get maybe 20 upvotes and no answers either.  

Factors to consider when you see upvoted questions without answers: the guidelines for a quality answer are quite strict; there are only so many flaired users (the people most likely to be able to sufficiently answer a question); someone who can provide a good, sourced answer may not be on or even see the question; the people browsing the subreddit may not be versed in that area of history; an answer can already be found from a search or in the sidebar, among other things.  

This is just the nature of Reddit. Tons of questions come and go through here without getting an answer. Trying to remedy this would just needlessly complicate things in my opinion.
Thank you mods for politely and patiently responding to the "please create an answered tag" question when it is inevitably asked every week. 
Well, I'm not adding much to the debate, but as someone who comes in here to read interesting answers I find no shortage of those and if I click on a question that has not been answered, I do not become filled with utter despair. Thus I never really understood why this question/suggestion comes up so much. Also, plenty of questions that I ask go unanswered and that is simply the only way I can imagine it being - an expectation that literally anything posted will get the effort needed for a good level answer put in, seems highly unrealistic and frankly, entitled. The mods and the flairs are already doing a huge amount of work to keep the sub as informative and well managed as it is, I don't see a point in them doing even more, just to spare few seconds of clicking to some users.
[deleted]
I just don't think it's realistic to expect the mods to maintain this and subscribers to not bicker/fight over the details. 
I dont think the mods should give in to this suggestion just because of the number of people who seem to want to see it happen. Lets not forget its the same people who post the 50 substandard replies in every thread which is the root of the problem as it is. I do appreciate your patience to deal with this particular question every other day and all the rest of them as well and I think people should look to fit in with the meta as opposed to suggesting the meta should fit in with their wants. Questions like 'Do I really want to make the same suggestion for the 5th time this month?' or 'Does my answer meet the high standards the sub rules demand?' are a great start
I will never understand why this is such a pressing issue. What benefit does this serve? No having to click into the comments of a thread and then hit the back button? Lessening the wanton injury of not seeing the answer you were entitled to because of upvotes?
This would be wonderful. So many times I click on interesting questions with hundreds of upvotes and find no answers. I understand it takes time to compose quality responses, but I too often forget about a thread by the time a good answer comes along just due to the way reddit is structured. Highlighting in a new post answers to old questions would be a good work around.
Keep in mind Reddit archives posts after a few months so some won't be able to be answered. This makes a lot of work for mods to go weeding. 
Follow up question - can we limit the Damn follow up questions? Maybe only allowed after the original is answered? It's very frustrating to see a cool question then go into the comments and see nothing but another question... 
I had a question about lines inside nazi bunkers on omaha beach which went unanswered by anyone who actually *knew* rather than was speculating.....didn't really know what to do next. Wasn't any way to draw attention to it. Figured that was just it, had no choice but to let it rest unanswered. Was disappointed.
I have a hypothesis about this problem.

I think the problem people are seeing isn't "these questions go unanswered" but rather "seeing a question with no answers is frustrating and I would like it to be answered" regardless of if it were answered last week, month, year, etc, or can be reposted at another time.

A *potential* but not perfect solution to this could be, a Moderator post that says "Comment on this to be notified of the first answer of over 300 characters to not be deleted from this question."

Then, we can comment, and if someone does post an answer, we would see it again.

That would be a bit of setup with a bot to get working, but I think it would add a lot, and then, the "unanswered questions" could be ranked by how many people eagerly await the answer.
I love this subreddit but why are its mods always so unnecessarily obstinate?

This isn't difficult. As the rules are currently written top level comments have to contain either an answer or a follow-up question of some kind, correct? And when a top level comment doesn't meet the standards of the subreddit that comment is removed by a mod, right?

So why not simply have AutoMod label any post with, say, 100 upvotes but with no valid top-level comment as "no top level comment". Then you can encourage people to filter for "no top level comment" if they're looking for popular questions that didn't receive top level comments that fit the rules of the subreddit.

Thank you!
It's not "code", but such claims could be met with suspicion. Hunting accidents were both a natural and common occurrence, but also a good cover. 

Let's look at one of the more suspicious hunting accidents - the death of king William II of England in 1100. He was out hunting with two men - Walter Tirel and Henry (William's brother and heir to the throne) - when he was shot with an arrow after Walter mistook him for a deer. Obviously, one has to wonder how the hell someone mistakes their king for a deer. Other versions of the story have Walter know where the king is relative to the deer, and is simply unlucky with his shot. This is all difficult to believe because Walter Tirel was known for his skill with a bow and being a keen hunter - that's why the king had invited him to go hunting in the first place! Walter immediately fled to France and denied that he had ever gone hunting with William II. It was also recorded that William II had received a message that morning from a monk who had dreamt last night that the king would die if he took part in the hunting trip, which sounds a lot like a coded warning, but could also just have been a coincidence or an invention to help explain why God had chosen to kill such a sinful king, as in other versions of his death it was William himself who had the dream. It also just so happens that the only other person on the hunt, Henry, was then crowned as king of England and other members of the wider hunt benefited enormously from Henry's rule. If it was an accident, it was incredibly convenient for Henry. 

But the strange thing in this case is that people generally accepted it was an accident despite obvious problems with the story. Here's the most detailed account from William of Malmesbury: 

> “The sun was now declining, when the king, drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded a stag which passed before him… The stag was still running… The king, followed it a long time with his eyes, holding up his hand to keep off the power of the sun’s rays. At this instant Walter decided to kill another stag. Alas, [Walter's arrow] pierced the king's breast. …Walter immediately ran up, but as he found him senseless, he leapt upon his horse, and escaped with the utmost speed. Indeed there were none to pursue him: some helped his flight…


Although there were rumours that it was an assassination rather than an accident, such voices were not the majority. The fact is, hunting accidents were normal. For prey like deer, a well placed arrow was usually sufficient for a kill, but sturdier animals like boar (a favourite of the aristocracy) had to be fought up close with spears and swords. Getting up close was the manly way to hunt, and that could be dangerous. Another of William II's brothers, Richard, had died in the same forest after being knocked down and trampled by a stag. The great Byzantine emperor Basil I died after his clothes were caught in the antlers of a deer and he was dragged by his belt for miles as it bolted. King Fulk of Jerusalem had the most brutal of accidents - his horse tripped at speed, leading Fulk to fall off and be followed by the tumbling horse. The saddle crushed his skull, but didn't kill him immediately. His injuries were so bad that William of Tyre records how his brains were partially forced out, and he died comatose three days later. Even accidental shootings could occur, such as with Valdemar of Denmark who, despite being very popular and having no enemies who would want him dead, was killed by a stray shot whilst hunting. 

So hunting was dangerous, and hunting accidents were a common cause of death that not even kings and emperors could escape. When we hear of some noble dying in a hunting accident, there's a good chance that it actually happened. This is especially true of accounts where it was an animal, not a person, that killed them. Where someone was killed by an arrow, that's when the suspicions start. Accidents could and did happen, but that's what made it a good cover story for a murder. At the very least, a hunting accident created plausible deniability - despite the clear problems with William II's death being an accident, it remains genuinely possible that it was so and the evidence of an assassination can all be dismissed as circumstantial. Given that William II was  unpopular, it may have been more convenient to go along with that story than to raise questions. We have no way of knowing whether William II's death really was an assassination. 

But generally speaking, 'hunting accident' was not code for 'quietly murdered', even when we have good reason to believe that someone was indeed assassinated.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians) if you have any questions or concerns.*
History is my passion, but not my profession, so writing here gives me a way to stay connected with the discipline. To be sure, I *quite like it* when I write something that gets popular, and it is a pretty heady feeling knowing I wrote something with tens of thousands of people have read and enjoyed, but at the end of the day, much of it is about writing for myself, and simply having a way to do so, with the added side benefit that I can share it with some people.

I know many flairs will talk about how AskHistorians helps them think about their topic in ways that they wouldn't otherwise. Doing academic research on a topic will, intentionally or not, often conform to certain approaches that are - obviously - academic in nature, but don't always reflect how laypeople might think about that same topic, so even if it is a 1 or 2 upvote question, if it is asking about an interesting angle on my topics of study, I am absolutely *pumped* to dive in and write about because it is a spur to me to look at that angle and think about the topic possibly in a way I haven't before. The OP made me think about the topic in a way I enjoyed, and they deserve the best answer I can provide them for doing so!

The amount of time and effort I put into an answer really doesn't correlate at all with the popularity of a question, but rather my *interest* in that question. For instance yesterday and this morning I spent *at least* five hours working on [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mdye9t/how_did_people_with_disabilities_duel_in_duels_in/gsdjlee/), which has 8 upvotes, and probably won't get many more beyond that short of an unexpected turn of fortune (like *this* thread getting popular. Funny how that worked out). I've *really* happy with how it turned out, as it is on a topic which is fascinating, and not that well explored, namely the intersection of disability and dueling. I hope the OP of the question enjoyed it, as did the others who read it, but what matters in the end is that I enjoyed researching it and writing it. I had a lot of ideas on what to draw from, but it wasn't necessarily a frame I had thought deeply about in the past; nor, from my knowledge of the literature on the topic, have many others who study dueling, which added an additional level of interest for me in diving into it.

The subreddit is also an incredible space to grow as an historian and as a writer. Getting the opportunities and impetus to go down those research rabbit holes is certainly part of it, but so too is just having so many opportunities to write... period. It is fascinating to look back and track those changes and improvements. Not to say my oldest content on the sub was awful, but I am constantly impressed when I look back on the old stuff, and I think that it really speaks to one of the under-appreciated benefits writing on the sub provides.

The one thing I'll say though is that it *can* sometimes feel a little sad when you write into the void, and I think I speak for many in saying that while upvotes are nice, they aren't that important. What *does* matter though is the simple 'thanks', or even better, a follow up question. If your question gets answered, always remember to say "Thank you!" It really means a lot, and I'd rather trade 1,000 upvotes for heartfelt "thank you" with an insightful follow-up accompanying it, cause the former means people read it, the latter means someone really *engaged* with it.

ETA: I guess I should also note that I keep a detailed record of *everything* I write on the subreddit, which is maintained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/georgy_k_zhukov).
I would first state that I have only written three or four answers on this sub, and none of them have been particularly popular. Saying that, I feel a sort of obligation to share my answers because the state paid for my education through grants and scholarships so I feel that the knowledge I have doesn't truly just belong to me. Thus, when I see a question that corresponds to the topics that I am well versed in, and no one else has replied, then I feel in some small way compelled to answer.  
I would also agree with the esteemed Zhukov that a gracious thank you in return is greatly appreciated.
I'm not sure if I'm a "top commenter", but...

I know some of the other folks here can write entirely off the top of their head ("I'm writing this on my cell phone, I'll put sources when I get home")
but generally speaking I never know a particular answer in full until I write about it. (Sometimes I know basically 0%, like
[in the question about early-20th-century bathroom breaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lmoxmh/during_the_industrial_revolution_factories_full/gnyvb8a/).) So I learn a lot more about something in the
process, and oftentimes make some connections that I've never seen in a particular text.

Sometimes there's just the dread feeling of [There's Something Wrong on the Internet](https://xkcd.com/386/). Not even just a wrong premise in a question, although there's been those, but seeing attempted speculation where it's clear more context would help everyone.

While it's nice to have an answer get seen, I have just as much fun with a [low-vote one like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lyy2ck/why_were_the_1995_dayton_peace_accords_for_the/)
about why the Yugoslav peace accords were in Dayton, Ohio of all places. Really, I'm thinking about just communicating with the person 
who asked the question, and if lots of other people get something out of it, bonus!
10-20 karma, what luxury! Maybe the question should be the other way around - what do you get out of receiving 10-20 karma? 

I just answered a question the other day that had cruelly been downvoted to 0, and it's very possible that maybe only the OP and I will ever see it. But it was about women in the crusades, which is a super interesting topic, something that has been written about a lot in the academic world but maybe not so much for a popular audience, and (I guess most importantly here) something I knew how to answer. I had sources at hand and I was also able to cannibalize a few previous answers to cobble together something new.

I don't think it matters if it's a popular or highly-visible question. If one person took the time to ask, then it's still important for that one person to know, isn't it? The OP for the question about crusading women said something like "I didn't expect such a detailed answer". Warms the cockles of your heart! That's more satisfying to me than hundreds of upvotes.

Of course, it is fun when there's a really popular question and you get a lot of karma for the answer. With a question no one else has noticed, I can sit and think about it, even for a few days. But the way Reddit works with really popular posts is that hardly anyone will see an answer if you wait a few days, even if thousands of people upvoted it. The pressure of writing a good answer really fast is a very different process (still fun...but different).

Otherwise I think I'm just repeating everything that u/Georgy_K_Zhukov said. I'm "an historian" by training but history is not my profession, so AH is a great outlet to share all this stuff in my head and on my shelves that otherwise isn't really getting used.
There's not much to add to /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov's answer; I agree on all counts. But my perspective is a little different because history *is* my profession. The answers I write here either derive directly from [my own published work](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7fmtdp/i_am_a_historian_of_classical_greek_warfare_and/), or they allow me to expand on that research (because the questions people ask on here are often fascinatingly different from the questions historians would ask).

Speaking from that perspective, I will add one further reason why I spend so much time writing long posts for a handful of upvotes: I spent years learning stuff about a period of history that I find fascinating, and if you have questions about that period of history, *I want you to get a good answer.* I want you to know what I know. Not just because you will hopefully enjoy learning it, and other readers will also see it and might find questions answered that they never knew they had - but also because it makes me feel like this is what doing all this history learning is for.

History isn't a practical skill. In fact it's often derided as a self-absorbed hobby with no practical use whatsoever. Like other fields of the Humanities, academic history constantly has to defend itself against accusations of irrelevance and attempts to defund. And if you go up to random people (or media platforms) and say you want to talk about your historical specialism to prove that it's actually really exciting, they aren't very likely to care. But here on r/AskHistorians, people come to us with *their own questions*, and we can speak to them directly about the things *they* want to know. It's affirming; it's validating; it's rewarding; it's meaningful. It may not give me any material benefits but it has so much more direct and explicit positive impact than anything I will ever write for an academic journal.
It's just something moderately interesting to do that sometimes helps people. It's no different than if you asked me these questions in person, or in a class. Occasionally it is an excuse to look something up or learn something in the process of answering a question — no harm there. Sometimes the work I put into the answers is useful in thinking about future things I might want to research more, or unearth useful things for teaching, but that's just a benefit, not the motivation.

Also occasionally my students will discover how much Reddit karma I have and be amazed, which I find _highly amusing_.
I don't think I'm a "top commenter," but I've had some very popular posts on this sub.  Like /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov History is not my profession - I studied it in undergrad including writing a fairly lengthy thesis, but that is as far as I've gotten.  I think my primary thing is that I love teaching and sharing knowledge - so when someone is genuinely interested in something I know, I'm incredibly excited to share it.  I tend to not do research for my answers beyond brushing up on some sources if I'm rusty, so the sharing of knowledge is really the pleasure for me. Rarely I get so interested in a question that I want to look it up myself to write something about it - but my life right now doesn't really give me the time to do so.  I'll hit the remindmebot and let one of the other brilliant writers teach me!

EDIT:

After a moment's further reflection, I've stumbled on one more reason I write.  Though I don't often do dedicated research for an answer, the brushing up process will often lead me down rabbit holes I find fascination - so I also love that every time I write an answer I learn *something*.
I think everyone here has given some great answers, but I think I can add another perspective. I finished college as an anthropology major, and will be applying to graduate school this fall for pre-Hispanic American archaeology (I've already asked a few people on this sub for tips, and they've been incredibly helpful!) As much as my friends are fantastic and intelligent people, I don't have that many who are as interested in archaeology as I am - and I don't know any at all who are interested in archaeology of the pre-Hispanic Americas in the way I am. So the community here has been a fantastic way for me to reach out and speak to people about a topic I love that I can't find that many places to discuss in. And, as someone who'd like to think that their (hopeful) future archaeological work won't be limited to articles and books only read by academics, AskHistorians is an inspiring reminder of public interest in history. If I become a professor, I sincerely hope I'll have a community like this to help keep pulling me out of the ivory tower.
The karma isn't why I post. I want to educate the public. After all most historians don't make money from their writing. My first book has earned a couple hundred bucks in royalties, which is a pittance for the amount of time and effort it took to write. It got me tenure but it is not profitable. So similarly, worthless internet points are not really the motivation. I want to educate people and dispel myths and misconceptions.
I just enjoy my subject area. My work is as a researcher in a research-heavy university linguistics department, but a lot of the many years of education in historical linguistics and the historical situation of languages of East Asia doesn't get much use in that role. Answering stuff here let's me engage with that and with someone who's asking in good faith and has real interest. Plus it keeps the knowledge current, and keeps me up on the latest literature on those topics, both of which are good.
I probably don't *really* count as a top commentator, but I'm going to post anyway because I spend a good 6 hours minimum writing the digest up this week and meta threads are the only time the other mods led me out of my box.

The digest never gets many upvotes. I think my average is 10-12 upvotes on the most upvoted comment. BUT I constantly get feedback on in. PM's, meta threads, in random passing. Tons of people tell me they use the digest to find answers they missed, or to browse through during the week. That kind of feedback is *wonderful*, and I get deep feeling from knowing that this thing I just randomly started typing up one day turned out to be useful.

But honestly even if it got 0 upvotes I'd probably still do it. I spend *hours* of my week reading all the fabulous answers here. Even before I did the digest I'd evangelize on discord or amongst friends and show what a cool place this is. The digest write up to me hits two important spots. 1) it shows my deep appreciation and thanks to the writers and contributors. I read *everything* that ends up in the digest and its pretty important to me that I spend some time each week calling out as many people by name as possible. These writers deserve so much more appreciation and attention, so this is quite literally the least I could do.

The second reason ties into that, and its attention. I personally, and deeply again, feel that many of these fantastic write ups are criminally underappreciated. Everything I can do to draw a bit more attention to them is worth it. If only one person consistently read the digest I'd be happy, but I'm pretty confident the numbers are significantly higher then that. And that my friends, is a glorious victory!

Also I get a lot of mileage out of meta or popular threads when someone says there's never *any* answers. Being able to whip out a collection of hundreds of answers feels *sweet*.
There are a few reasons I do it.

One, I have a million research interests. Only one of them became my current PhD topic, and it was really hard to choose. I'm constantly reading about things that interest me outside of my "official" research topic. So when I see a question on one of those, I think, "Hey, I get to write about this!" I love telling people about what I'm reading, so when someone actually ASKS, that's a whole nother level of incentive.

Two, I'm chronically ill. There are a lot of times when I have no energy to do much other than scroll through Reddit. When I can spend some of that time doing a no-pressure AH answer on a topic I enjoy reading and writing about, that is so much more rewarding than deep-diving r/AskReddit or r/AmItheAsshole. I mean hey, sometimes even AH is too much and those sites are good for those times, but I love being able to spend that time helping someone else and distracting myself with a fun research question.

Three, I care a lot about correcting misconceptions and expanding people's perception of history. There is SO much that goes untaught or taught incorrectly - certainly in the US and UK systems with which I'm most familiar, but really in all countries' educational systems. So I love getting to share information about people and places that might not normally pop up on someone's radar, since a lot of people's understanding of history is based on what they got in school and the few topics that historical fiction does over and over again. I've done professional work in public engagement with research so at the end of the day, it's just something I'm really passionate about.

I joined Reddit in order to answer and ask questions on this sub. Sometimes it can be annoying, but most of the time it's really fun.
I'm a professional (i.e. academic) historian and while I don't have the time/energy to be a "top commenter" when I do respond to a question it's either because I'm curious about the answer or it's something I already know. Responding in the sub isn't much different from teaching for me, so if a student asked me "Was there really cocaine in Coke a hundred years ago?" I'd probably answer in a similar way to what I would here. Though probably with fewer footnotes.

I don't care about the karma. Many of the responses I've posted on Reddit requiring the most effort were outside /r/askhistorians and were so far down in a thread they only got one or two upvotes. I don't care about the points but do enjoy engaging people. I skip over about 90% of the alerts I get from AH simply because I don't have the time to respond...at least during the academic year I'm too busy reading student work and managing my classes to do much else.
As ever, writing this with reference to what u/Georgy_K_Zhukov already said, but as someone who *does* work as a historian professionally (to a given value of 'professional', at least), for me there is an element of duty and purpose to it. I have spent a significant chunk of my life being trained and building my own knowledge of history. I didn't do it so I could be a history dragon sitting on top of a (fairly meagre compared to some users tbf) hoard of knowledge, but rather because I think building and sharing knowledge is important. AskHistorians is the best platform for this kind of public history I've ever found, particularly as it doesn't involve either a long career full of distinctions or the right connections to access, like most such platforms. So I'm willing to invest time not only in answering questions (which I do less of these days), but also in trying to shape and improve the platform itself, because it's achieving the goals I thought were important when I became a historian.
I'm not sure I qualifiy as a top commenter but hey, who knows ?

Feeling that I can help people. I'm very curious myself and I love when I can find the answer to something I have asked myslef for ages. I love helping people when I can.

Talking about a passion too. That's not always easy to find people willing to hear you talk about the military and the nobility of France and Burgundy in the early XVth century. And you generally have drowned them in unsollicited funfacts and lessons already. 

It is also quite validating. I kinda lack confidence and seeing people praising what ou wrote really is a good moral boost. It's the little things, like having your name pop up in the sunday digest !

As for the karma, I don't really care. Sure, seing the little numbers go up is good for the confidence too, but I know that this is a "little audience" sub and that's not my main goal.
I could easily echo several other people's answers—passion for history, love to teach people new things, don't care for karma, yadda yadda—because there's truth to that, but I figure I'll add a couple personal and kinda more out-there reasons, both as a FAQ Finder/Digester and as someone who writes answers about both Greek theatre and invented languages (though not flaired in either category, obviously):

* Writing answers is oddly intoxicating. I've lurked this subreddit for seven years, only very occasionally posting questions or asking follow-ups, and never became an answerer (well, except for that one April Fools several years ago) until a couple summers ago when I saw a question about Greek theatre and thought *Wait, I actually know that one!* because I had taken theatre history the previous year. I've learned a lot more about the subject since writing that answer—honestly, you can probably track the evolution of my Greek theatre knowledge just by reading my AH answers in chronological order—but it was pretty well-received, and getting a couple shoutouts on the Sunday Digest was an unexpected but welcome surprise. I became hooked: **I needed more of that joy**. So I kinda just kept going. It's just fun!
* Conlangs are again a pretty obscure and random field in history—most people don't even really think of it as a historical subject in the first place—so this topic in particular, I love getting the chance to teach people about it. There've been a few really good questions in just the last month regarding repression of Esperantists, which got me really excited because *Holy cow, people are actually wondering about this!* when at first glance, it's hard to imagine that governments would even care about people speaking a made-up language. But they did, and it's awesome getting to showcase a slice of history that is often never thought about. It's not necessarily *important*, the way it is to understand a lot of more mainstream political issues, but it's *cool*.
* A lot of my Greek theatre knowledge (after expanding on what I learned in the two weeks of class that covered that period) was research for a play last year that never got to be performed because covid. While I did get to share that research with the cast and crew, I never got to put together and display a presentation for the audiences. I like to believe this is a good alternative usage of that research.
* Honestly, I'm just kinda bored. Life has been pretty stagnant since the pandemic started, so writing answers or hunting down old ones when I have the energy is just something to *do*.
* My brain is just kinda floating with information that I want to share with people but otherwise don't have a reasonable outlet without being *that guy* to my friends. If people want to *learn* something about plays or language, and I want to *tell* people about these topics, I just see this as a win-win situation. I don't know much about history beyond the basics they teach in high school (really need to work on that), but the obscure stuff I've tried to learn (when I perhaps could've been learning more useful things) is still stuff that other people are curious about, and it's really cool being a resource for that.
* FAQ finding in particular: I just like helping people. Kinda simple as that. 
* Digest: Others have waded into this fact in their responses here, but there is something special about AskHistorians where the questions can be very unique, addressing things that you just can't figure out as easily just by reading a textbook or asking your teacher in class or scanning through Wikipedia. Not just because they address complex topics, but because often mainstream discourse doesn't focus on it; the answer often lies in obscure passages of obscure primary and secondary sources and never sees the light of day. While there are a lot of questions on here that deal with topics that expand on what we (particularly Americans) learn in high school, there's a lot of really cool variety on this subreddit, and I try to honor that every week.

(As per usual, this wound up longer than it should've.)
I have one very specific specialty, that is so weird and general obscure in the English speaking world (left-wing German terrorism of the 1970s), and has more than it's share of misinformation surrounding the subject; I feel duty-bound to offer some factual analysis. At a certain point, however, my responses end up being "check out this response I wrote here four years ago." I think we may be running out of questions about the subject... : )

One of the great joys is when legit masterly contributors like /u/commiespaceinvader takes the time to praise your post, even though its got like 7 upvotes. I always consider that like a mega-upvote worth 1000.
Two main reasons, one personal and one more altruistic...

First, like Zhukov I love history, but it isn't my profession. Writing answers here helps me use another part of my brain, and gives me a creative outlet for writing good, popular history. I need that mental challenge to stay sharp, and frankly, sane in the midst of this wild life.

Second, understanding of Native American history in the U.S. is abysmal. I love writing material that shatters one dimensional myths and helps novices learn something new and complex and challenging about the Americas. There are so many great stories waiting to be told to a larger audience, great authors doing amazing work but whose books don't end up on top ten lists or in the chain bookstores. This hidden shared history informs our present world, and helps us understand how we got here, and a popular outlet like r/AskHistorians is the best way to bring the knowledge mainstream.
I haven't really answered *many* questions here, but I always enjoy writing them when I do. History is my passion, as well as my vocation: I'm currently a doctoral student in ancient history, and answering questions here is a nice outlet that keeps me well-practiced (so to speak). It sort of works as small, bite-sized practice pieces for the thesis, and keeps me from losing my edge when it comes to writing about history!

Not to mention, the questions I answer tend to be within the realms of my overall thesis, but slightly different (be it in terms of time or geography), and it's a nice break from reading countless articles and letters about late antiquity to be able to do a little research into a different subject. As much as I love my research project, it's nice to have a break and look at something else.
I don't comment much but I wait for the heavy metal questions. That's all I wanna do anymore. I lurk and read everything else unless it's either turn of the century South African history or maybe post Cold War politics, and even then that's a big maybe. I like writing the answer more than I like the karma. Knowledge > internet points
I write because I care.

I find public history a *fascinating* topic and it's incredibly important.  Not just in terms of sparking an interest in history (though that never hurts) but by offering some more insight and background.  Public history is the sort of history offered by museums, for example — brief background sketches that offer some context and sketch out a bit of what's going on.  

Colonial Williamsburg, Plimouth Plantation, both of those are public history.  Putting up plaques that are actually verified (no, Leif Erikson did not, in fact, build a house in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Mount Auburn Street) is public history.  

It's showing how known history both affected our ancestors — how they lived, what they ate, how they worked, what they wore — and its intersections with us now — how do we dress differently, and why?  What kind of food did they eat, and did it give them nutritional deficiencies?  What sort of construction techniques did they have?  And so on.

It's true that many of the history questions here (including some of my own questions in the past) tend towards either pop(ular) history or esoteric "hey why this one weird thing", but … that's how people learn.

I'm nearly forty years old, took an undergraduate degree in history, but … my discipline informs relatively little of what I write here, and I've never worked professionally as an historian.  Sure, if someone *wants* to hear about comparative colonialism in the 17th and 18th century on the North American continent, I'm down to clown, but lots of other questions are written that I've answered.  

Moreover, I learn a lot here, some of which informs my interests, some of which becomes, "huh, cool, did not realise that!"

Karma is always nice — seeing that lots of people *liked* your answer is always nice! — but I appreciate even more when the mods allow an answer of mine to stand.  (Which I say happens about 85% or so of the time.  Occasionally, I don't cite enough or don't offer enough nuance.)

The moderators here are the real heroes.  Because of their tireless, slogging work, you can trust what stays here.  If it's interesting and if it's factual, it stays.  If it's vague or useless or a summary of Wikipedia, it goes.  In essence, the mods have both the public trust (they have a good reputation among users of this subreddit and others, they're known to police heavily, they are themselves prolific and thoughtful contributors) and trust *you*.  The moderators believe that you already know how to Google.  That you can check Wikipedia.  That you posted here because you have questions that can't be solved quickly.

Many people post because they've read a popular history book (anything by Stephen Ambrose, Jared Diamond, etc.) and have background questions, or because they've read a historical novel or seen a historical movie or television program and have questions such as, for example, "wait, was Queen Charlotte really Black as they showed her in *Bridgerton*?"  

If you're curious, she had ties to the more ethnically diverse Portuguese royal family, who had intermarried with nobles of el-Andalus, but that isn't saying much, as so did most of the European royal families. This claim is more of an alternate-history thing, though it's also a point of controversy with some historians looking at her contemporary portraits and some contemporary reports … but it's definitely very far from a mainstream accepted position.

Regardless, that's the sort of thing that we can answer, do answer, and if you search the archive rather than waiting at the mercy of someone to have the time and expertise to answer, we most likely *have* answered.

TL;DR: my motivation is doing a fair presentation of a historical question's answers as far as they are known — karma is merely a bonus, but always nice.
I'm definitely not a "top commenter", but I do fit the "10-20 karma points" on most things I write. I write about legal history, which tends to be quite niche (both questions and answers).

What I enjoy is a mix of four things, neither of which are much related to the amount of upvotes:

1. A question is a push or a prompt to research or write about something, which is at least semi-productive. Answering a specific question can, in my experience, make it easier to just sit down and focus. 
2. The questions sometimes come from angles or perspectives, or ask about things I haven't considered. This can be both useful, funny or interesting. Again, answering a question *can* in that sense be more rewarding than reading on your own.
3. Not being a history major (Law and Polsci), Askhistorians in total gives me a reason and an excuse to value the history in my own fields, and spend more time on that. I like cross-field work, and I think history does improve my perspectives on the fields also outside of history.
4. I enjoy and used the site before I answered questions, and that fact is definitely a motivation for answering questions as well. It's enjoyable to "give back" or get recognition from people whose answers you enjoyed, and you do feel like you both teach and learn from others (though, mostly the latter). 

This isn't to say that upvotes don't matter. Upvotes can at least signify that what you wrote was readable or well written, and enjoyable. It can be demotivating if something get's *no response at all*, even from the person asking the question. But as long as you *some* response signifying that the person asking (or others) found it useful, so your answer achieved what you wanted, I don't think upvotes changes my enjoyment much. The answers I enjoyed and look back on the most weren't my most popular.
As a committed member of the <10 karma club, I'm really not sure I can be considered a "top commenter". 

But generally there are two circumstances where I answer a question. Either it is something I find interesting, so taking the time to look up some examples or brush up on some relevant literature is as much for me as it is for you. Otherwise, and I'm confident I'm not the only one here, I will end up fixating on some point about a question/thread (be it out of interest or more often annoyance about popular treatment of a subject), and so looking some stuff up and writing it out is frequently the best way to be able to get on with my life in general.
OP, this is a great question! And totally not because it's one I asked for my PhD dissertation and was the question that took me from lurker to mod (eventually)! If you want to read what I found, the details are in Chapter 5 of the PDF linked [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0372890). That's pretty long and super dry because it's my actual dissertation, but I also wrote a summary of the most relevant finding [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/).
If many people like my post, I am happy. 

However, I am answering a single person’s question. If I can do that, it also makes me happy.

A long time ago I decided that I liked the description of the scholar in Canterbury Tales, “And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly techie.”

It seems like a nice way to live, and I try to where I can. Plus, “aut Cesare, aut nihil” only works in so many places.
I am not a top person because I don't have enough time to reply as often as I want but for me its about sharing the joy of history. There are so many fascinating things out there and when someone asks a good question and I can answer it I do so. To encourage their curiosity, to educate, and to have fun. It's fun for me to a point. People should be allowed to ask these things and should be encouraged to do so. There's tons of people who have nit had the educational opportunities I had so they're not necessarily able to access the tools to answer these questions also.
I've only ever posted [one actual answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i3w2zb/the_united_states_declared_war_on_germany_in/) to a question from this subreddit. I spent, like, a whole day on it I think. I did so because I viewed it as an opportunity to apply the knowledge I'd gained from a military history class I took as an elective in college. Given the thread topic, I figured there was a deeper cultural and political answer that could be provided that expanded on what would be the more standard answer on American unpreparedness for World War I. Often times, those answers are more focused on the more immediate reasons for unpreparedness rather than, I think, providing a more holistic answer that takes into account the fundamental relationship the average American had with the military at the time.

Apparently, it was a good enough answer to be included in the weekly roundup. That was very flattering because I certainly wasn't expecting it.

So, I'm not a top poster by any means, but that was my reason for spending so much time on answering that poster's question. I wanted to utilize the stuff I learned in both that class and in my own spare time.
Karma is irrelevant, I don't even understand it and definitely do not go looking for it. I see reddit as a place to exchange information, not a game where you can score points.

If someone asks me a question and I know the answer then I am happy to do what I can to spread knowledge. A "Thanks" from the questioner is reward enough.
I'm not flaired, and I am certainly not a Historian, but I have a Magpie mind and I collect lots and lots of eclectic bits and pieces of knowledge, some of which is even factual.  Cliff Clavin if you will. Once or twice over the years, there has been a question that I can *actually* answer, and I have the citations to back up my assertions AND, and this is the big pay off for me at least:

*My comment didn't get deleted.*

Whatever upvotes or discussion I could have from that point on... pure gravy.  The mods did not give me the thumbs down and execute my tiny little nugget of knowledge whose faint ember I kept barely alive in my mind until such time as I could breath life into it here in this forum... that it might blossom into brilliant flame for a brief second, casting its tiny light on the vast panoply that is history.  Or something like that.
What I get is very personal. Not only do I get to engage in my love for history and specifically the history of my people and fellow Indigenous Peoples, but I get to help in the vindication of existence and correct the narratives that plague us to this day. Engaging in historical work has very real effects for my community. American Indians are seen as objects by mainstream America and we're often robbed of our agency to tell our own stories, to retell history from our perspectives. To have a public platform such as /r/AskHistorians, the opportunity to speak with the possibility of gaining recognition and changing people's minds, to educate them...it actually impacts my world. Even if only one person sees it, that is one more person who won't deny the genocide of my ancestors. That is one more person who won't vote for legislation that will erode Tribal sovereignty. That is one more person who will acknowledge my existence as a person. That is my motivation.
This is just a random aside. I am a history student, almost finishing my second year- I have done modules on everything from WW1 and WW2 to German history, Asian history and medical history. Currently I am doing essays on the Atlantic world- America from 1492- so Columbus discovery of America up until 1765, German history and a module called Image wars in Asia history. For reference, I’m a second year at Aberystwyth University and am loving history. I am thinking of becoming a history teacher. Was just a stand alone comment that I love this sub.
For me it's an opportunity to practice some research and writing on subjects I'm interested in. A lot more helpful for college too and relevant to my major when you're reading academic texts instead of wikipedia pages.

I'm not going to lie sometimes when a post blows up it's nice to get a lot of upvotes and thank yous, but I try not to focus on that aspect too much. Nonetheless it is courteous for a question asker to provide a thank you after someone has spent a couple hours on a composition, that's something you don't get as often as you'd think.
It's funny, I wrote an answer three years ago in response to the question '[Before electricity was understood, how was static electricity explained?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7mhrfu/before_electricity_was_understood_how_were_static/dru9rcg/)'. 9 upvotes! [I edited the answer a little and reposted it in response to a similar question here a few months later](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rvynq/what_did_people_think_about_static_electricity/). 8 upvotes!

Seen from the perspective of effort per upvote, you'd think that this a waste of time (though of course, like others, sometimes I'm curious and want to find things out, and so reading through some stuff and writing about it can be fun, and I do touch on ancient people and how they saw the world in lectures in my work every so often - so I'm not doing it solely for the upvotes.

However! While those particular questions didn't get highly upvoted, people asked similar questions [1 month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/llcosd/before_people_commonly_understood_what/), [1 month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lenq0a/how_did_premodern_people_explain_static_shocks/), [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l576p4/what_did_ancient_peoples_think_static_electricity/), [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kl6njk/question_regarding_the_history_of_discovering_and/), [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k42rl2/how_people_described_static_electricity_before/) (somehow /u/DanKensington and the other FAQ finders missed linking the previous answer that time...or just were really really bored reposting the link to my ye olde answer), [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kdqj56/how_did_ancient_human_societies_explain_the/), [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kg527y/about_static_electricity/), [4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jyjsvj/what_did_people_think_about_static_shocks_before/), and again [4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ju9elb/what_did_people_used_to_think_shocks_from_static/) and...well, I'll stop there, but you get the picture.

*People keeping asking about static electricity on /r/AskHistorians*! I'm a bit baffled as to why this particular question keeps coming up, but it does. I guess it's just a kind of natural thing to experience static electricity and then realise that our understanding of electricity must be relatively new, and to wonder what people thought it was before that.

So, ultimately, you can play the long game with upvotes here. While those original answers might have only got 8 or 9 upvotes, it seems pretty likely that those original posts from a few years back have been seen by thousands of people over the last few years, as people keep asking the question! And then of course, finally, [one of those questions got about 4000 upvotes](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h00w9p/when_two_people_touched_and_experienced_a_jolt_of/) about 9 months ago, and then I got around 1000 upvotes simply for reposting my previous answer.

Not all questions are the static electricity question, in terms of people continuously asking about it, but [if you keep a good database of your answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/hillsonghoods), an answer might get 2 upvotes the first time, but someone might ask it 2 years later, and your repost of your old answer might go gangbusters. That's the weird algorithmic/random nature of what ends up in peoples' front pages to be upvoted, I guess!
Stupid things written on the internet make me angry, and I feel that if enough people counteract that by writing intelligent things eventually balance can be brought to the internet.
This has been a very interesting thread!  Me, I spent 9 years in grad school, got my PhD in history, and then decided not to go into academia.  In fact, my current profession (project manager) has absolutely nothing to do with history.  I still do historical recreation/reenactment and practice a few hands-on skills, and there’s certainly also translating random things (like mottos) into Latin, so I haven’t completely left the field.  But I realized when I started following this sub that there were questions I could answer.  People were actually asking about manuscripts, theology, medieval clothing, and medieval daily life, and I had information to share!  Sure, most of them got maybe 10 karma if I were lucky, but that wasn’t the point—it was exercising that historical muscle again.  
And then I had a post just blow up and go over 4.2K.  Not only was that completely unexpected, it was the pick-me-up I needed to tell me yes, I’m still a historian.  And that felt really nice when I had log into work the next day and spend hours staring at spreadsheets.
The other thing?  Reading the questions others answer, and the fascinating stuff that turns up.  If you’re like me, you have the ability to get sucked into historical rabbit holes from a wide variety of eras.  (I’m just *waiting* for the day when a question comes up in a couple of niche fields where I’ve done a ton of research beyond my main expertise—but they haven’t come up yet, so for now I’m enjoying reading other completely fascinating niche field answers.)
Hi, thanks for the great Meta-question as well as the compliments for my colleagues and the amazing volunteer mods on this subreddit. 

For me, there is a short and a long answer, but they both revolve around "love," at least as Thomas Aquinas defined it (basically, the love that promotes goodness and wisdom for the benefit of others).

Short: I love history and I love the chance to tackle a topic I am interested in or passionate about. I studied a **lot** to get my degrees and sacrificed even more (missing social events, being occasionally absent from my child/spouse's life, missing out on "fun" stuff, etc.) because I felt a calling to understand and to unlock mysteries, engage in debate, and to learn. In many ways, answering on here is an extension of that. My sacrifice for the love of history is paid back by my love of talking (writing) about history. Plus, it gives me an opportunity to learn more!

Long: History, both as a subject and its contents, is really, really needed in this era of digital information. When I began my studies, I never knew that the sum of human knowledge would be at one's fingertips at a moment's notice. And now that we are here, I worry for us. That's because all of that information, in and of itself, is unmoored from context and adrift in a sea of misinformation, misinterpretation, and myth-making. And that scares me. I love my country and I have loved living in several other countries around the world. But we are at a juncture where I truly, absolutely fear for the future. 

To be fair, it is not the overhanging dread of mutually-assured destruction that I grew up with during the end of the Cold War; we are probably not teetering on the edge of a nuclear holocaust (yet). But it is a dread that a new weapon of mass (intellectual) destruction has emerged and twists history into soundbites bereft of context or at least poorly contextualized.

Instead, we face a worse future, IMO. We are awash in waves of anti-Democracy, anti-intellectualism, and blatant misinformation on a scale and on fronts that never before existed. A good example is the so-called "flat earthers" who believe in a conspiracy so ridiculous, so nonsensical, so anti-historical that it was used as wholly-untrue propaganda by [Washington Irving](https://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-never-set-out-to-prove-the-earth-was-round) to mock the alleged "ignorance" engendered by Catholic teachings and embellish an already fascinating story. In other words, Irving was making a "Catholics are so dumb..." joke and now idiots are putting up YouTube videos literally demonstrating the Dunning-Kruger effect in real time!

Such conspiracy thinking has been around for quite some time, sure, but only recently gained traction. Why? IMO, a confluence of anti-intellectualism, anti-academicism, and the profitability of sensationalist lies. Sure, Yellow Journalism has been around since newspaper took off, [but social media](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/03/facebook-misinformation-avaaz/)   (and certain opportunistic pundits and politicians who use these lies to advance their own interests by echoing these lies, thus legitimizing them) has made stupidity and fantastical nonsense **pervasive** in every person's online and offline journey. 

With the erosion of the basic foundations of truth (such as the earth is round, the moon landing is real, and vaccines work) you make it possible for Authoritarian-minded Neo-fascists to thrive. The world is complex, and its problems and histories are complex, and they demand nuanced thinking as well as reflection. In a world where such demands are made in the midst of a flood of bad actors peddling bad (or at least problematic answers), the group or person that says "I have the answer and it is simple" becomes *very* attractive. When people hear things they dont like, which challenges their world view, or that makes them uncomfortable, they are faced with confronting thorny, difficult problems or just believing the simple falsehood that absolves them of guilt and reflection. It's very appealing. And it doesn't help that Historians rarely speak in simple, straight lines (at least, not the good ones)

That's where my love comes in again: I love my country and I want to see it healthy and well-educated, so I answer here to feed that impulse as I answer you, our earnest and eager students. The hope is that you can forward that healthy, educated response and assist in some way to stem the tide of lies. I love those other countries too and I want to see their contributions recognized. Moreover, I want to not see them maligned simply for their religious, economic, or political beliefs by **my** country. I want us (All of us) to see the beautiful mosaic that is the world and history, not just the single color of simple views and interpretation. 

When we academics stand up for history, even though it only nets is 1, 2, or 5 imaginary internet points, we are shoring up the eroding underpinnings of human society. That's not to say we don't care about our audience; that's not true because we care deeply. It's because none of us got into History for selfish reasons; very few people become "rich" or famous as historians which makes Reddit upvotes even less important.
Means I get to add "professional good-post-writer" to my CV.  
Also, I got a mug once.

I do it anyways for my show, so it's not out of the way.
How frequently do people use sock puppet accounts to ask a question they feel like answering with their main account?
I am not a historian, but I spend an unnatural amount of time on this sub.

All I can say is, if the "top commenters" on this sub get even half the satisfaction from writing their answers, that I do from reading them, then their time is well spent.

I know this just sounds like grovelling hero worship, but in a world where people seem to have decided that belief>reality, this place is one of the few oases of rationality left.
This is probably the wrong place to make this suggestion, but I really wish that there where more "Ask..." subs that followed the same rules.

I would love to be able to just ask a question about spark plugs/dentistry/cooking, and know that the answers were properly vetted/moderated/not written by a random internet nazi with an axe to grind.
**Why, for the great adventure of it all of course!**

*Disclaimer: I am very much not a "top commenter" of AH, and the vast majority of my responses on here fit within the 10-20 Karma range, and I suspect some of it comes from how intimidatingly long and "prose-heavy' some of my responses can be. In true spirit to myself, this response will also be prose heavy (though hopefully not that long).*

As an analogy, I think [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/3ZNELAzmp6HWBg4v8) painting by Caspar David Friedrich best paints (pun intended) what I get out of weighing in on questions here on the sub. The work, titled *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog*, is a great way to explain the process and benefits of my spending hours to answer a single question on AskHistorians.

Let us first consider a more literal interpretation of this artwork, that of an explorer staring out into the great unknown of a new world. Historians are in many ways, also able to take on other professions within the course of their work. Much the same way explorers such as Columbus, De Gama and Captain Cook “discovered” pre-existing landmasses or geographical features for the interests of their nations, historians have always been discovering untold stories of the past and bringing them to light in works for the general public. Admittedly the historian nowadays hardly receives the amount of recognition for including their discoveries as the explorers of bygone centuries have, but at least our discoveries did not precipitate the exploitation of newfound territories and their populaces

As someone who, like the legions of other flairs and AH contributors have no doubt already asserted at some point or another, loves history, there is a great sense of fulfillment when it comes to answering a question on here. In many ways, when I first read a question I enter the persona of Friedrich's wanderer. Looking out over the hills, valleys, and plains of the past, scanning the landscape for any particularly interesting ideas, concepts, or threads of historiography to explore further. I usually have ideas of where to look, which maps to consult, and perhaps a guide or two to follow. The end result however, is always a exciting discovery in and of itself.

When I research for a response to a question, I uncover wholly new strands of historical writing I would otherwise not have touched upon. I read the words of historians who have come before, in the hopes of inspiring historians who will come afterwards (myself included). Above all else, I take great joy in knowing that by spending those 1-3 hours researching and writing like I have no other commitments (schoolwork? That can wait), I am helping one individual on the internet learn a tad bit more about the curious, tragic, and interesting past of our human race. 

To many of my peers this seems most odd. "What good is learning about history?" They ask me with a great deal of skepticism. What use is knowing of where we have come from in creating the world where we are going? A pertinent question, and one I do not think I shall be able to conclusively answer right now, but in the study of history I find the lessons, circumstances, and contexts which may very well help to explain the world in which we live today. I, like so many of us here, are devoted wanderers of an infinite realm, seeking the details which shall help shed some light on matters for all who wish to listen. I might argue (in a more philosophical sense), than I have never once "answered" something on AH, but I have merely helped illuminate one of a multitude of possible answers, approaches, or considerations in thinking about an aspect of history. It is also a side benefit that, by writing on AH and teaching others what I have been able to read and synthesise, that I learn myself the stuff which I writeup in comments on this sub.

It is also reassuring to me, that I am not alone in this quest for knowledge and understanding. Let us return for a final time to Friedrich's work, with its sole wanderer perched above the sea of fog. This is one of the few areas where some correction is required. I am never alone in my research and responding on AH. I (like every other flair and AH contributor) am accompanied not only by the long deceased voices of the past, but also by the works of other historians who have climbed the very same vantage point to view a very similar landscape. In each of my responses, I am echoing what I have seen from the vast landscape of historiography on the topic, perched on a viewpoint made of all the previous written historiographical works I chose to investigate even prior to typing my signature "Greetings". I am also, throughout my entire AH contributing journey, aspiring to reach the levels of expertise, engagement, and detail in comments which many of the far more experienced flairs writeup. 

If Newton and his fellow scientists have seen further standing on the shoulders of giants, then here on AH, we have seen more standing on the shoulders of the past. Much the same way mathematical proofs or works can be in response to past conundrums or suggestions, historical writing (including AH as a subreddit and forum) builds upon the works of the past in conjunction with the past itself. Isaac Newton may have seen further forwards by standing on the shoulders of giants, but for us students of history it is constant conversation with those giants that can allow us to see further and clearer back into the past.

So, what does all this ridiculously poetic and flowery prose mean (hope you enjoyed it by the way!)?
Quite simply: my motivation on writing the responses I do an AH stems from my sheer passion for learning, teaching, and communicating all that I can write of (in a given timeframe) about history. What I get in return, besides the insignificant 10-20 Karma (50+ if I'm lucky!), is the satisfaction that I have helped to provide a bit of information to another soul, and perhaps lay the seeds (or light the spark) for their own historical research and writing. 

What I also get, and the end result which is by far the most gratifying, is an enhancement of my own understanding of where various elements of our modern world have come from, and a glimpse at the countless historical narratives which are lying untold, hidden in that sea of fog, waiting for a wanderer to dispel the mists and bring it to light. That this sub provides an excellent place to do so, gives me hope for the future.
I can only answer for myself, but I participate because I’m a teacher and it’s almost a compulsion to answer questions. I always take the assumption that whoever is asking deserves a truthful and accurate answer. To add on to this, I’m working on a Master’s degree in American History, and sometimes a question falls within the scope of what I’m currently learning or researching, and the research is quickly to hand, making it a relatively easy lift to answer. Sometimes it opens up an Avenue of research I had never thought of, and it improves my scholarship. I view it as a win-win! That being said, I work hard to ensure I only answer questions I feel that I can answer authoritatively.
You can get karma points?

Not a top commentator, I am an amateur who loves the era in my flair. Like others, I was worried about trying my hand here, I have an (as far as I know) good reputation among the amateur three kingdom communities I have come across but I have no history educational background or a background in education or academia and one sees the high standards here, it can be intimidating. It took me a few goes before I got my posts up to the standards required for here but I was proud when I did. Meeting AH standards required me to work at it, to do better and I have benefited from it. 

So if you know the answer but feel intimidated, just give it a go. Worse that can happen? It gets deleted. Which is not pleasant but you can work out what you need to do better (and talk with the moderators), improve yourself (which never hurts) and soon spread your knowledge to make the world just that bit more knowledgeable about its past. 

If a good question comes up, the time flies by I type up a response as I'm pulled along by my own interest and double-checking the texts means I can find something new (a recent question about the perception of the Nanman meant reading about Li Jing's comments about the Yunan people which I had either overlooked before or just completely forgot). I might not discover something new with each question, some may well be covering ground familiar to me but not to the questioner, but I enjoy the moment of writing and flicking through the pages/pdf files, throwing myself into it and typing like mad. If I don't learn something new at that time, it will at least sharpen my thinking and deepen my understanding of that part of the era. 

In terms of method, I usually have an outline in my head soon after knowing the question and which books I will likely need to consult. I will then begin typing and typing and typing, checking with the texts as I go (with the odd "now to redo it"), after I'm done typing I'll double-check with the texts and redo. Often I'll rework partway through as more ideas come to mind or I discover something or make it a better, fuller answer. 

I get a sense of pride from a work I consider well done (though the ones I might be proud of are not always the ones that will be the ones that catch with others) and that I feel that even if it only answers one person and is ignored, that I have done something of worth that day. I hope that the information will help provide a fresh perspective (like attitudes towards eunuchs) or at least some clarity and an era where there is a lot of falsehoods (the novel is far more popular than the history, add the backlash to the novel on top of that) and misunderstandings will just become a little more clearer in one corner of the internet. I also hope it will encourage people to learn more about, even if not that era, history and to ask more questions.

Plenty of my posts here won't get double figures in karma then another will really catch fire, partly perhaps the period I cover, partly it can take me a few days to craft a response and perhaps my communication is not the best. It certainly isn't great if one barely reaches five I'll admit but it will have hopefully meant something to somebody and another day, an answer will find an audience. A thank you means a lot and is always really appreciated while I am delighted any time I reach Sunday Digest.
Not a top commentator (I've only answered I think one question way back when) but I can say I did it for the love of sorting out the answer to the puzzle and sharing the answer.
This whole thread is just the most wholesome shit ever. Blessed subreddit. Thanks historians!
I saw this when I woke up, thought to myself 'ooh I have *thoughts*', and then read /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov's post and am now terrified of the possibility that we're alternate aspects of the same person.
Believe it or not, not everyone is on Reddit for the karma.
https://time.com/5043166/storytelling-evolution/  
  
To share stories/knowledge is what we humans do.
Upvotes are worthless, sharing information is priceless.
I retain the knowledge I have much better if I occasionally use it. Also by giving an in-depth answer, I may have to do a bit of research to fill in blanks spots. Further learning something I may find interesting. 

I simply enjoy learning new things and occasional using that knowledge helps me keep it fresh in my brain. Use it or lose it.
I haven't done it in a while but every time I've contributed answers it's been because I miss teaching. Not sure how many other folks who've left academia feel this way but I frequently will just have an idea for a lesson plan pop into my head, or a coworker or friend might say something that basically lights a spark under a bunch of dry kindling if knowledge that hasn't had an outlet in a while and twenty minutes later I'm wrapping up talking about the battle of the Granicus River because my friend lives near a bridge.
I've only contributed a few answers, so this is obviously less relevant, but my primary motivation is that I don't get a chance to talk about these things in real life. I'm a professional costume designer, which means I do a lot of on what people wore and why for every era/location/social class involved for each show I do. Unfortunately, very few people give a shit. Actors don't care about how lightweight single-layer corsets could have boning woven directly into the fabric using specialized looms; they care about being able to comfortably do their jobs. Directors don't care about Elizabethan sumptuary laws and prices that helped fuel a boom in redwork and blackwork embroidery. And no one, *no one*  gives a shit about the fact that lining garments is a modern trend, or that late 17th century French mantuas were essentially two massive pieces of fabric that were non-permanently tacked together strategically to avoid cutting the expensive fabric but would still allow the wearer to keep changing the style of her mantua at a French court that used sartorial conspicuous consumption as a key political tool. 

I happily study types of aprons and the industry of buttonmaking, just to put a few extra details in a show that make me extremely happy. Maybe one or two people in the audience will notice the thread buttons on a linen shirt. Maybe an actor will be so thrilled about her ability to move in a corset boned with zip ties (heavy-duty zip ties behave much more like baleen/whalebone than expensive metal boning, they're lighter, you can sew through them, you can create an incredibly curvaceous corset because they mold when heated, and they eat up much less of my limited budgets) that she'll mention it in a talkback. But for the most part, the only payoff for all this work is that I can feel proud of what I've done. Even costume design awards and reviews are pretty meaningless. Reviewers don't write much beyond "here's half an article summarizing the story, these actors were good, the show was pretty". Awards focus on overall impressiveness, and while in my area they show favoritism to designers who don't have a massive budget and the biggest costume shop of employees (which is nice), the judges are there to judge the whole show and don't have the time/inclination to notice that the absurd dandy in this Regency show has a stiffly interfaced stock designed to look like the [possibly satirical Oriental tie](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/05/31/neckclothitania-or-tietania/preview/page/4/), with shirt-points almost as high as his ears and (knit!) pantaloons so tight they look sprayed on, while more down-to-earth characters wear clothes that look easy to move in. 

In real life, it's extremely rare to find people who want me to geek out about this. Here, people actually *want* to hear this, and sometimes, as in this situation, people offer me an excuse to spout all this stuff *and it just comes pouring out,*  much like vomit from a cat who has just eaten much too fast.

On that note, if you made it this far, thank you for humoring me, and I'm going to go clean up cat throwups.
I wouldn't call myself a top commentator, but I have discovered writing answers to be a lot of fun. For a few years, I was a silent spectator who was much too afraid to answer. It wasn't until after the AskHistorians conference last year that I realized how much fun it was to actually answer other people's questions. It has also allowed me to stay in touch and forge new connections with like-minded people in a time when meeting people is almost impossible due to a pandemic.
It is just sharing history to people who wants to know, it is simple as that at least for me. Granted I still haven't contributed to this sub since I typically don't use reddit when I got enough time to write an elaborate and sourced answer..
Is it any different to be a teacher?
I think it's good practice for me in two ways: it tests what I know as a matter of committed, in-use expertise and it forces me to communicate it clearly and responsively to a questioner without some of the endless qualifying phrases we often use within scholarship. 

I also just find the range of questions asked on here endlessly interesting, both the frequent repeats and the oddball exceptions.
A big aspect I think is that people can't really express these things at length in person during casual conversation. Especially in the Covid times.
I, too, am a writer. I don't write history stuff per se. But I free style write a lot. I agree with the other commentor about doing so for the sheer love of writing. And it is practice to write free style for others. Whatever that topic may be. For me, I write because if I didn't I would have to live with all these words in my head by myself haha. I need to get it out. I am a thinker. I need to clear space for more thoughts, so I write. Some of my best writing has been impromptu thoughts on the internet. I can't speak for historians but I can speak as a writer.
Not everyone is an attention/karmawhore. People have interests.
OP, you are under the completely wrong impression that people are motivated for karma.
I truly appreciate each and every answer I read on the sub, and in future I will make sure I upvote every one I read.

> What's with this? 

Class warfare.

The boorish, lowbrow peasants with their genitalia exposed are contrasted with (1) the woman 'closer' to the reader in the February miniature, whose clothes depict her as also a peasant but better off, and with (2) the [illumination for January](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_Janvier.jpg), a parallel  scene depicting fully-clothed nobility.

Jonathan Alexander picks up on earlier identification of an Italian influence on several of the Months, including Jan-Feb. In that mode, you might see a peasant lifting her skirt slightly but modestly for warming. The Northern version's addition of the risque peasants, given the mostly-traditional miniature cycle, is thus A Statement.

To support the idea that it's not a depiction of different, er, *warming practices* between Italy and France, Alexander also identifies the phenomenon at work in the [September miniature](https://i2.wp.com/www.digitalmedievalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/September_tres_riches_cluny_MS_65_F9_VMS_65_F9_V_det.jpg?w=714&ssl=1). Most of the peasants are stooped over, hard at manual labor. But of course the reader's attention is drawn to the center, where a peasant is bent over thus exposing his buttocks. He is grouped with two beasts of burden in the immediate viewing frame, not with other people. 

The *Tres Riches Heures* skates an interesting line between the standard "virtuous peasant" depictions, and the "lazy peasant" ones. These peasants aren't *lazy*, but they're...I think a good parallel would be, they're the medieval version of "virtuous rednecks."

And the [December illumination](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Tres_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_December.jpg/725px-Tres_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry_-_December.jpg), based on the castle in the background, depicts the duke's servants and court hunting *in the royal forest*. The miniature cycle isn't just about demonstrating amused superiority over peasantry; it's a claim on the part of the nobility.

...Particularly, as Alexander points out, because any of the duke's contemporaries viewing the manuscript on display would have understood that the income from those peasants' backbreaking labor was what enabled the duke to afford such lovely decorations.

The *Tres Riches Heures* illuminations are an assertion of power.
Oh hey, I know this one! To begin, some of the best and most accessible sources on the topic are J. J. Alexander's "Labeur and Paresse: Ideological Representations of Medieval Peasant Labor" and Michael Camille's "'For our Devotion and Pleasure': the Sexual Objects of Jean, Duc de Berry." Most of what follows summarizes their analysis of the manuscript and its images.

The manuscript in question - the Très Riches Heures, made for Jean of Berry in the early fifteenth century - is considered one of the finest examples of medieval and early modern book production. It's also incomplete, as its artists - the Limbourg Brothers - died of the plague in 1416 (the same illness that claimed their patron). The manuscript is a Book of Hours, a kind of devotional "guidebook" intended for the lay piety, which surged in popularity and production during the reign of the Valois (the French royal house, to which Jean belonged). Because Books of Hours include a calendar of prayers, cosmological and astrological imagery was not uncommon; in this case, the miniatures, which are crowned by an astrological lunette, tie the operations of Jean's feudal estate to the order of the cosmos.

A word about Jean as a patron and collector: he was known as the most avaricious man in the world, and his collection included precious stones and jewels, deluxe manuscripts, as well as twelve châteaux, which were inhabited by menageries of exotic creatures. These estates were so important for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is because they included thousands of serfs who labored under the duke as part of the manorial system. Indeed, the manors and castles that belonged to Jean's reach are illustrated throughout the manuscript and have been invaluable in the historical analysis of French medieval architectural cites, most especially the palace of the Louvre in Paris. As Alexander has argued, the inclusion of these structures in the manuscript's miniatures - especially relative to the peasants - enacts a system of social surveillance. In other words, even if the Duke isn't specifically depicted in most of the miniatures, through the presence of his palaces and castles, he exerts an implicit and contemptuous gaze over his vast holdings. It is in this way that the manuscript serves as a sort of autobiographical artifact or a catalogue of collection, through which we may map something of the patron's worldview.

To the point: the February miniature cannot be understood absent consideration of the January miniature that preceded it. The January miniature imagines the Duke during the New Year feast. He is notably seated against a roaring fireplace, whose screen acts like a halo framing the Duke's unholy figure. The miniature is also important because it represents something of a painterly inventory, on a day characterized by the exchange of gifts (as a footnote here, gift exchange was an important part of the regulated power dynamics practiced by the Valois). Rather notably, on New Year's, Jean gifted Pol - the oldest of the Limbourg brothers - an eight-year-old heiress, whom the Duke had abducted when her mother refused the marriage. As Camille has argued, the January miniature represents a sort of homosocial space, where the cupbearers, who are distinguished by the phallic corkscrews they carry, are like Ganymede, sexual accessories in the attendance of the Duke and some of the prized objects of his collection. 

Playing on these themes, the February page mocks the plight of the peasants as possessions viewed and consumed under the Duke's watchful gaze. In both the January and February miniatures, the subject is one of warming in the wintertime - nobles in the former and peasants in the latter. However, the fire in the February miniature is not nearly so powerful, and the cold of the snowy landscape is emphasized by the serfs laboring outdoors. Their exposed genitals are not unlike the corkscrews in the January miniature, but here, explicitly drawn, they make the peasants into vulgar and boorish foils (some have even argued that the February genitals resemble cow's udders). Because the manuscript presumed a single reader - that is, Jean of Berry - the warming of the serfs' genitals by the fire is not a documentary record of medieval peasant behaviors - rather, it becomes a way by which the patron fetishized the objects of his domain, poking fun and undermining their plight relative to his own. 

It's worth noting, moreover, that there's a play on "flesh" happening here. The manuscript is, of course, manufactured on vellum, which is tanned and scraped calfskin. Leafing through the manuscript, therefore, would have required flesh-to-flesh contact (the fingers of the reader and the animal skin comprising the page). There is a kind of suggestive connection in the way that the individuals and objects represented (on other pages, the peasants bare their bottoms, for example) serve as representations of the flesh in another sense - that is, as sexualized objects in the Duke's collection. In short, through the manuscript, we come face-to-face with Jean of Berry's fetish of collection - jewels, gems, properties, and people.

And yes, for anyone wondering, the Duke was a totally terrible dude. Even his brother, King Charles V, cut him off for his various misdeeds.

I never knew that I'd have so much in common with a Spartan king.
>WE SPARTANS ONCE DECLARED WAR ON ELIS

Did you declare war on r/ELI5 because you can't explain something to a five year old who has been left to fend for themselves on a mountain?
Ah, King Leonidas! I had hoped to consult your opinion on ditches...

...

Ahhh... keeping it in the family, I see.
When did this Leonidas who calls himself *archagetes* become so verbose?
 REDOUBTABLE TAXIS! ? what is that formation?
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME ADVICE ON SURVIVING BATTLE WITH IMPERIAL WOULD-BE CONQUERORS FROM THE EAST, BY TOUTATIS!?
If I recall correctly, this film also seemed to suggest that love between a boy and his venerable male authority figures might be a shameful act only practiced by "Athenians," instead of a wholesome, patriotic and *completely normal* stage of any nubile, young lad's education and development.

After all, King u/LEONIDAAAS, didn't the great Lykourgos himself commend such relationships?
This is fantastic; thank you for continuing with this honored tradition here at r/AskHistorians. 

Now, we only need the opinion of u/GeneralMardonios about the Persian representation in the film.
BUT STRATAGOS, DID YOU NOT REPLY TO XERXES IN WRITING "COME AND GET THEM"? OR WAS THIS A FALSEHOOD PERPETRATED BY THE BOEOTIAN POET PLUTARCH?

ALSO WAS IT NOT MERELY 300 SPARTIATES YOU TOOK FROM LACEDAEMON, THE REST BEING PERIOECI AND FILTHY HELOTS?!
A Greek, writing in Latin script?

Never.

Wait. Seriously?

Looking forward to Xerxes' review.
God I fucking love this sub
The all caps is great but for full immersion, it needs to be written in boustrophedon.
What ? Leonidas never said "come and get them" ? What evidence suggests that ?

I fucking lost it. Very good!
What, you didn't even kick them into a well a little bit? It's all good fun. He'll be fine, just fish him out later.

Also, in reference to your flair, what does your outdoor voice sound like?
> I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO MAKING LONG SPEECHES LIKE SOME CHATTERING ATHENIAN!

What manner of Spartan would go on such a long diatribe in front of the magistrates?

You should have simply tossed a copy of the movie and uttered "MEH."
At last! At last, justice comes! The man you're looking for is named ZACK SNYDER, and his movies have thoroughly insulted our heroes Batman and Superman as well. Until I heard your voice, I had thought that justice would never find him, but now, I have hope. Godspeed!
I have a question. I once had a Western History professor have qualms with 300’s accuracy but pointed out that at least the hoplites were within some degree of accuracy. Is this true? What about the depiction of them in the film _is actually accurate_?
Sir! SIR! This is a Juna's Culina.
>THERE CAN BE NO GREATER INSULT THAN TO IMPLY THAT I MARCHED AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE EPHORS! AS SPARTIATES, OUR MASTER IS THE LAW! **I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS!**

I read this in the voice of Mr. Torgue and now I am sad Spartan Torgue isn't real.
Hey wait a second, I think I learned something when reading this post.
Wait, when did Sparta declare war on ELI5?  ...oh, Elis.
This hoplite of Texas stands ready for your aggressions. Never shall your hubris set foot here!
Venerable Leonidas, during battle how many times on average do you go into a blood lusted slo-mo killing spree?

Do you need to rest for a couple of minutes in between or does the thought of Xerxes the Persian god emperor desecrating the Spartan homeland give you indefinite energy?
> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE TITLE OF THIS FILM!

It’s pretty straightforward, Leo: on a scale of 1-10 that’s how homoerotic the movie is.
Yes, but how many Spartans will you take with you this time?
SIR HAVE YOU COME ACROSS A BOOK CALLED GATES OF FIRE BY STEVEN PRESSFIELD? DOES IT DO A BETTER JOB OF PORTRAYING SPARTA AND THE BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE?

NOBLE BASILEUS LEONIDAS:

WHILST I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO OFFER ANY PRAISE TO THE FOREIGN PERSIAN BARBARIANS, WAS THIS FILM ACCURATE IN ITS DEPICTION OF THE FOE? WERE THEIR RANKS FULL OF DEFORMED LEPERS WEARING MASKS? DID THEY USE MONOCERI IN ATTEMPTS TO BREAK THE GREEK LINES? WAS THEIR KING A BALD AND HAIRLESS GIANT WITH MANY GOLD ADORNMENTS, WHO WORE LITTLE ARMOR?
yeah 300 is pretty unrealistic. i much prefer the 100% accurate documentary *Meet the Spartans*.
They also characterized the West's oldest known slave society as a bastion of freedom and democracy. :p
PERSIA WAS THE REAL LOSER IN THE FILM, APPARENTLY FULL OF SLAVES WHEN THEY OUTLAWED SLAVERY UNLIKE THE GREEK STATES
Hi, I just want to say I have a comment in /r/AskHistorians.
Now I need to find a way to work 'The Redoubtable Taxis' into a conversation.
Not very Laconic.
NEITHER DID I EVER DO THE DEED FROM BEHIND
Mr Leonidas sir, didn’t your culture give the name to “laconic phrases,” which your people used to sass foreign kings and dignitaries on the regular? So wouldn’t “come and take them” be an appropriate pre-battle sass?

Thank you for the laughs and smiles today. I really appreciate it.
If I remember too the movie portrayed the Perisans as oppressive when I believe they were actually more of a democratic nation than Sparta

I second this
TIS ELALHSATE SU OTI TOUTO SPARTA ESTIN?
But what was the weather like? Did you fight in the shade?
Bravo!
Just an excellent copypasta
Wait, so phalanx wasn't actually a greek word? That's really surprising!
As a modern day descendant of sparta I hold true the words molon labe and I live by them I do also admit when I an wrong and atone for my errors but after the first battle ends in enemy territory I lick my wounds n go back home where I have my beasts and armor and tell myself I needed not be in unknown lands so blindly lesson learned now that being said if the enemy who I unknowingly disrespected decides to follow me back to my lands I will not surrender and i will die defending my lands my people n my beasts all I can say is I may not win but at the same time once its in the flesh less will leave my lands than those who came and I will fall on my own sword before I am taken a slave by any man
Oh great Spartan King, you do not mention it, but I wonder how do you feel about the film's lack of representation of your Helot slaves, and representing women of Spartiate families participating in menial tasks like carrying wool?
I don't know what's going on, but I fully support it.
King Leonida, is it not true you sent back 2 messengers? One who was grief-stricken and returned to the battle despite your orders and another who was shamed for returning? So much was his shame I have heard, that he fought with great abandon at Plataeai. However, he was fined amd rebuked for breaking the line multiple times.
*standing ovation*
CALM DOWN LEONIDAAS! YOU’LL HURT YOUR THROAT YELLING SO MUCH!

It'd be really hard to be more wrong. Every statement here but one ('It's a collection of books') is outright false.

> Now, in many ways, the first book was the Bible.

The speaker seems very unclear about what they think 'book' means, but no definition could justify this. 'Books' in the sense of a single coherent and substantial piece of writing go back at least to the early 2nd millennium BCE. By contrast, the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible date to around the 7th century BCE (somewhat earlier for isolated passages), and parts are as late as the 100s BCE; the Christian New Testament is 1st-2nd century CE.

> I mean, literally. Because, at one point, there was only one book.

It's hard to imagine what scenario the speaker could be thinking of here. There are thousands of older books.

> Like, as far as our Western culture is concerned, there was one book.

This has never been remotely true. The individual texts in the Hebrew Bible were composed over a period of, let's say, around 750 to 150 BCE (and the canon of which books to include wasn't decided until some centuries later). We have lots of books written before that period.

Even if we grant that many older books were forgotten for much of history -- the hundreds of ancient Mesopotamian, Levantine, and Egyptian ancient texts that we have today -- even so, from the same period we have hundreds of books written by Greek authors. Nearly all of *Genesis* is younger than Hesiod and Homer. In the case of *Daniel*, we even have some books by Roman (Plautus) and Berber-Roman (Terence) authors that are older. Some New Testament texts contain quotations from pagan Greek books. Proto-*Isaiah* (*Isaiah* 1-39) is older than any Greek books -- but it isn't older than, say, *Gilgamesh*, which was still circulating in the 1st century BCE.

> And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- 

It's hard to extract any concrete claims from this rambling. 'Scrolls and writings on papyrus' was the normal medium for publishing books in antiquity. 'Books that everybody could buy' were on sale in 5th century BCE Athens, nearly a millennium before the Bible was compiled. It's insane to claim that the *Book of the Dead* and the *Odyssey* and the *Aeneid* 'emerged out of' the Bible.

There have indeed been technological transformations over the millennia, but they have nothing to do with the Bible, except in that the Bible benefited from them. The use of alphabets (in western languages) rather than abjads, the use of parchment rather than papyrus, the use of the codex rather than the scroll, the use of minuscule writing rather than uncial: the Bible didn't drive any of these. It just benefited from them, in exactly the same way that every other book did. The first book we know of to be published in codex format (pages bound at the spine, as opposed to a scroll) and put on sale in a public bookshop wasn't the Bible, it was Ovid's *Metamorphoses* (reported in Martial [14.192](https://archive.org/details/martialepigrams02martiala/page/506/mode/2up?view=theater)) --

> Look at this bulk! It's built out of many-layered leaves!  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It holds fifteen books of Naso's poem.

The speaker finishes with the only true claim in their statement:

> the Bible isn't a book; it's a library. It's a collection of books.

The individual texts in the Bible were written by various different authors at various different times over a period of many centuries: roughly 750-150 BCE in the case of the Hebrew Bible, roughly 40s-110s in the case of the Christian New Testament. For each corpus, the idea of compiling them together into a single canon is considerably later. The Torah (*Genesis-...-Deuteronomy*) was probably assembled not too long after the Exile, so roughly 5th-4th centuries BCE; *Joshua-Judges-Samuel-Kings* may have been assembled as a unit around the same time. The full Hebrew canon was decided centuries later, reaching its final form sometime not too long before 200 CE. A Christian canon was in the process of being formed in the late 100s (a fragment of a canonical list of texts survives from that time, the Muratorian Canon) but the full western Christian canon wasn't finalised until the Council of Rome in 382 CE. The deuterocanonical books weren't excised from Protestant Bibles until the 1500s. Based how the speaker refers to this history, though, it isn't clear how much of this they've grasped. Given how they understand the word 'book', my guess is: not much.

*Edit:* corrected a formatting error in the Martial quotation, and an infelicity of wording in the following sentence.

Given there's already an answer that explains why large parts of the statement are wrong with respect to the Middle East, I wonder if anyone can answer one question in specific: are there any books from China that would be older?

By this, I mean, if you take the date when the earliest parts of the Bible were first written in the Middle East - if I was an educated, well-connected and rich Chinese person could I go out and buy the equivalent of a book at that time? Or maybe find one somewhere like a temple or palace even if it's not for sale?
>Not directly your field, but, any quick comments on notable Chinese or "Indian" specimens? (from u/doodoopop24)

I could chip in on the ancient Chinese examples. 

Let me begin with [this photo of Da Yu ding](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%82%E9%BC%8E_Da_Yu_ding.jpg), a typical Western Zhou era (c. 1045 BC - 771 BC) ritual bronze vessel currently in the National Museum of China collections. While this may not look like a “book” we typically think of today, the appearance can be deceiving: [here is an image of the rubbing showing the inscription inside the Da Yu ding](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Da_Yu_ding_inscription.jpg). The content of the inscription is about a nobility named Yu who cast this *ding* (a type of bronze ritual vessel) to commemorate the noble’s benefactor, King Kang of Zhou by enumerating the King’s great achievements at great length.  According to its inscriptions, Da Yu ding was completed in March on the twenty-third year of King Kang’s reign, or **1003 BC,** and it represents one of the oldest surviving Chinese “book” artifacts we have today. 

While Chinese bronze scripts originated during the late Shang period around 1300 BC, the length of inscriptions on an individual bronzeware increased dramatically around 12th century BC. The Da Yu ding example above is hardly unique or unusual. Western Zhou rulers tended to transcribe an entire book-length worth of text (as the length of a typical book contained in Chinese classical collections such as the *Shangshu*) in their bronze vessels. Note that bronze scripts were written in highly condensed grammar, with frequent use of shorthands in order to pack more information with fewer characters. 

[Here is arguably the **most famous** example of early Zhou “book” in the form of bronze scripts](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Mao_kung_Ting.JPG) – **Mao Gong ding ** – and if you zoom in this photo, you will see that the *ding*’s inside is completely covered in dense but artfully arranged texts, which presents the detailed biography of King Xuan of Zhou (828 BC - 782 BC). See also [this photo of Shi Qiang plate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Shi_Qiang_pan.jpg) made during the reign of King Gong of Zhou (962 BC - 900 BC), with its dense blocks of bronze scripts clearly visible. It describes the major achievements of the first six kings of Zhou, and is an invaluable artifact in verifying written history from Early Imperial China which served as the basis of traditional Chinese historiography.  Similarly, [here is a photo of the Lai plate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Lai_Pan.JPG/1280px-Lai_Pan.JPG) made during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou (828 BC - 782 BC). Its 53.6cm diameter plate surface is completely covered in exceptionally fine bronze scripts, which records the history of the Shan noble clan for eight generations and their deeds in assisting the first twelve Kings of Zhou. The Lai plate confirmed the records of Zhou Tianzi's lineage as recorded in Sima Qian’s *Zhou Benji.*

NTA, but people tell me that Adam’s heart was still beating when Robert removed it from his chest.
~~INFO:~~ We're missing some vital information about your husband's mood during the time if his containment. Was he bright and chipper? Or was he resigned and upset? Did he accept the marriage with good humor? Or did he do so reluctantly?

Edit: Upon seeing OP's response, NTA. He seemed to go along with it in good nature, and therefore to the best of our knowledge was not forced into a marriage.
ESH - Look, I get its hard to date in this day and age but jeeze. This is getting just a *little bit creepy*. On the other hand, the dude seems to be going along with this surprisingly well. Sounds like ya'll are perfect for each other!
YTA. I'm all for girl power and breaking with gender norms, but kidnapping is never okay. While your lives have worked out good in the end, freedom of choice should be a right of all people.
YTA for sure, unless he never learned he was a prisoner.

If he just hung around enjoying your hospitality and never tried to leave, and never otherwise learned he was confined, then it was true love after all, then and only then NTA. 

But if his understanding was that he will eventually die on your property never stepping foot elsewhere for the rest of his days, and the only decision within his power to make was whether to avail himself of your body, then most certainly YTA.
I would love for this to become a regular thing,maybe even it's own subreddit!

ESH but seems like in the end everyone was happy, so...
YTA for sure. You should have waited for the King's permission. Now if, God forbid, Alexander III were to fall from his horse and perish, your Robert would have a strong claim as the Lord of Balliol! Scotland will be plunged into a struggle for succession that will last half a century!
ESH: I'm sure Robert disliked travelling all that way to meet his friend's *titled* young widow of proven child bearing, and had no ulterior motives whatsoever, being an unattached, upstanding Christian of advancing years. Or maybe, just maybe, he was  a closet predator who got exactly what he wanted.
INFO: Doesn't it seem likely that Robert went along with this relatively willingly? being related to the king, it should have been a simple matter for him to petition the king for aid, either before the marriage or before the king ratified it.
NAH - you're friends aren't wrong, holding someone captive isn't cool .....but since you have been happily married and inlove for 15 years now I'd say alls well that ends well.
NTA, your house your rules!
NAH
Thou knowest well that a titled widow of means couldst be forced into marriage by the man of whom thy wast now a ward.  Thy fortune and title makest thee a prize many wouldst vie to attain.
Though thou hast proven manfully willful to choose thine own husband, depriving thy cousin of his profit from selling thy hand, thou hast paid the fine for thy usurpation of his privilege and right to assign to you your fate.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
NTA. The people saying YTA are idiots who hate true love. Has history not taught us, that end results is all that matter even if you have to break a few eggs to get it.

Robert did not know what was good for him and had to have you show him thee real path. Now he has double the titles and 11 kids to boot.
NAH You being a charming hostess probably resulted in him not even noticing he was essentially locked up in your estate! Live a long and happy life.
NTA

I'm rather surprised that King Alexander wasn't more harsh given that you gave his cousin an ultimatum and you didn't ask permission.  But such is a sign of the times and it all worked out in the end.

P.S.  Great job mods...this thread is hilarious.
NTA - Things r/Crusaderkings say.
NTA, your castle, your rules
NTA sweetie, he broke your last husband, only fair he offers an adequate substitute. You offer him a choice, and he choose you. Your castle, your rules.
YTA, I wouldn't put up with that shit
NTA.  Course not, Mum.  Love ya.
NTA!

It is commendable how you followed guidance in recent literature and took the instructions in the *Roman de la Rose* close to your heart. A rosebud in a walled garden is proper.
YTA. Plain and Simple. From a family end I've dealt with controlling relatives before and it never ends well.

And from the point of view of a monarch. WTF dude? There's a *reason* the King has to okay the big marriages! If he lets you get by then what? I'll tell you what! Elector Counts! Do you want to be ruled by a freaking elected monarch!? I sure don't. And I'm going to make sure that never happens to *my* empire.

YTA- Laws exist for a reason. Also. That's rape.
YTA: You are the asshole, King Alexander III did not care about his cousin, and you payed for him like he was his first born son.  You should have asked for land to get that
YTA. Yea thou art asshole. Confining others shalt never be comely.
NTA. Your empire, your rules.

Oh wait, you don't have an empire do you? I do. For now at least.
This is the most comments I've seen on an r/askhistorians post, commenting to put a name on the subreddit :)
I don't think I've ever checked what sub I'm in so often lol, what's going on here?
YTA as kidnapping is not cool. I will admit though, that your general badassery in choosing your own husband for both love and position, especially at such a young age, is admirable.
NTA - Sometimes guys just need a little nudge to see what's right in front of them....forever, until they agree.
NTA. It was really inappropriate for your husband's cousin to ask you for money to support your marriage. You do you, hon. Besides, if your husband really didn't want to marry you, he probably could have found a way to escape anyway.
NTA: 11 kids, Dude came out on top
ESH- considering your position and your husband's relationship with the king (especially since he would technically be considered in the line of succession), you both should have sought the king's blessing first. Frankly, I'm surprised you were able to find a priest willing to conduct the ceremony without first securing the king's approval.
Arriving with your first husbands heart is throwing up so many red flags.

INFO
NTA I mean nothing's more romantic than forcing a man to marry you amirite?
r/shitcrusaderkingssay
Pretty much Beauty and the Beast with the genders reversed. Also, who bangs a beast?
NTA. You got your the man you wanted and didn’t let anyone stop you.
YTA (following my usual Tuesday night seance, beer and chilli fries I have been possessed by the spirit of your first husband and he has some strong feelings)
NTA, Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. What does that saying have to do with this situation? I don't know I just felt like saying it.
YTA. Thou art a harlot and thou hast acted in behavior unbecoming of a widow. Pray for forgiveness the next time thou art in church.
INFO: what was he wearing through his confinement? If he visited you wearing shabby, comfortable clothes, that’s one thing, but if he pranced in with something more form-fitting and formal, well, that would be practically begging for matrimony! It’s so hard to know since men in our society have learned to tease, so really we need to know some of the other cues he was giving off.
YTA. As you went a step further than "because of the implications"
Well this is an april fools post I was NOT expecting
Oh FFS, I forgot what day it was for a second and was so confused. Just what the heck was happening xd
NTA as a woman sometimes we have to seize what power we can. 

And after 11 children it seems that all's well that ends well
ESH. OP for retaining a man and forcing him into a marriage of convenience. (Control your libido woman!) Adam and Robert for going on Crusade in the first place. (The idea that white makes right, and invading a land where they didn't see the inhabitants as people.) Adam for dying stupidly. Robert for hacking Adam's heart out and carrying it back. (Ew)). Alexander III for being so stupid as to fall off his horse at night. The only thing that stops everyone from being TA is that they are all Scottish. So that's ok then.

Edit: I fatfingered ESH because my tingers got fangled. (sorry mod-bot)
NTA - I'm pretty sure my wife did the same thing 🤣🤣 She knows what she wants!
I needed some time to process this. Then I remembered that it smy mother's birthday. Thanks for that.

YTA
I'm just here to ask if becoming "lord of my estate" is a euphemism?

^^edit: ^^NAH
Holy crap YTA.  The guy totally has Stockholm syndrome.  Let me guess he wasnt so blissful for the first weeks but new husbands am I right?
Hold on, this isn't /r/CrusaderKings!

Anyway, NTA.
NTA, your prison your rules
NTA  Your Property, Your Rules.
INFO: Need to know the social class of your companions to make a judgement. But overall judging from what I’ve read, so long as your position is above them, then NTA. Your companions would be fault for speaking out of turn.
I thought I was on r/CrusaderKings
NTA something something red flags something something your house your rules something something lawyer
Notith the assholith
NTA
YTA: You were really creepy and besides I think you broke genre conventions of the period by being the one asking marriage.
NTA, he was already the father of your first child.
YES YTA HOLY CRAP I CANT BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED
YTA
NTA. Your house, your rules.
NTA your fief your rules
INFO:  How did they preserve Adam’s heart on the presumably long journey home?  Salted and dried?  Cured like a ham?
Nta play stupid games win stupid prizes
Nta major red flags OP 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
As always, ESH.
No, but you must be awfully old.

I want to say up front that I'm a Europeanist, not an Americanist. So this is going to have a slant to it that might not be what you're looking for. But I've been off-and-on working around this topic, so I thought it would be helpful to have what I know up—even if it's not exactly right.

It's a little simplistic to say that it was founded exclusively for whites, though it's not far from the actual reality in practice.

Early colonization of Europeans in Oregon was something of a contest between Catholics and Protestants. Which isn't much of a surprise since in the 1840s Oregon was under dual occupation by both the British and the Americans.

The Americans at first tended to be Protestant, while the British people tended to be Catholics by virtue of Quebecois migrants. This coincided with the local head of the Hudson Bay Company, John McLoughlin, converting to Catholicism and becoming "the father of Oregon."

There is this other wrinkle too: during the campaign for Home Rule in Ireland, Daniel O'Connell attempted to use tensions in Oregon as a way to leverage support for Ireland in Britain. The idea being that if there was a war over Oregon, Britain would need the support of Ireland, who would only be content doing so if Ireland was given some autonomy. This had the weird outcome of a lot of radical Irish people, that tended to be Catholic, to come into Oregon. Which is why you get these relatively early foreign-born Catholic leaders of the area like Stephen J. McCormick—something you don't see in much of the rest of the West.

This led to something of a backlash. While Young Ireland was having  1848 rebellion in Ireland, accusations from Protestants in Oregon began circulating that Catholics were secretly arming Native Americans in preparation for "the extermination of the Protestants." This led to the fear of Catholics being "the enemies of American domination" and it stuck in several ways. This partially laid the groundwork for later groups like the Ku Klux Klan who were violently opposed to Catholics. The most infamous act of this was the 1922 Klan-backed attempt to end Catholic education in Oregon.

But back to the 19th century, Oregon was attempting a kind of statehood. As the Civil War crept closer, attention started to shift less from religion than to race. Samuel R. Thurston, the Oregon territorial delegate to congress, pushed for the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, which made this explicit by granting land to whites based on race instead of religion or national origin. This brought in these pesky Irish Catholics, French Canadians, and Catholic members of the Hudson Bay Companies. This wasn't done because everybody put their old hatred of each other base don religion aside—it was to achieve the minimum 60,000 non-Native people needed to apply for American statehood.

In 1857, the state constitutional convention couldn't agree to become a free or slave state and put that question to the people to vote on. By a 3-1 majority, Oregon would be a free state. However, the public also ratified Black exclusion by a majority of 8-1. Though this was never enforced and made redundant after the 14th Amendment it was a clear "stay away" indicator.

This legitimized a lot of these "ethnic" Catholic populations that were slowly dwindling in population in comparison to the Protestants from the United States coming in. And as a result, people like the aforementioned Stephen J. Douglas became leaders of the state. In fact, this spread and in 1867 Oregon created a Fenian circle that included Washington, Idaho, and Montana recognized as the 20th Regiment of the Irish Republican Army while at the same time having a section of this organization recognized as a legal and fully recognized  militia in Oregon.

I'm underlining a lot of this because, while it would be wrong to say there were no black people in Oregon during this time, or that they were treated fairly, the focus of "otherness" was less on them than it was in areas of the United States that had a significant black population.

After the Civil War a lot of the Irish leaders in the West, most significantly Thomas Francis Meahger in Montana and Douglas in Oregon, basically ordered all their men to become Americans first and put away any sense of ethnicity.

And as this change happened, the Chinese began to come to the West Coast in force. And it was the Chinese that drew most of the ire for the next quarter century. There were not enough blacks, the Catholics had somewhat been forgotten, and both Catholic and Protestant felt threatened by the Chinese. So riots against the Chinese became the order of the day.

Through violence and eventually the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Chinese population in Oregon was whittled down and, as eluded before, the Catholics became the big-other as the Klan became popular in Oregon.

The black population in Oregon did not grow to be significant for decades later, when the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company was put into service for building ships for World War II. Only then did a lot of African-Americans move to Oregon with any real numbers. And they were, of course, discriminated against horribly so far as where they could move. There were a few black neighborhoods in Portland, but the big center was Vanport, which in 1948 was washed away and was never replaced. This started a pattern that continues today of the Black population being gentrified out of areas and moved around.

So I want to be clear here: Blacks were never treated well in Oregon. But the population was never quite big enough to be considered the threat that other groups were. By the time there became a crises of any kind, around 1948, the Civil Rights movement was already starting and (again, I don't want to make this seem like it was easy for Blacks in Oregon because there was all kinds of discrimination and still are lots of problems) but much of the really solidified hate that existed in some other locations didn't have time to bake as much.

Added to this was an influx of white people at the end of the twentieth century that tended to have their minds shaped by the Civil Rights Movement and, again, no deep-rooted ethnic biases specific to the region that the new-Whites would be aware of at first.

But this invisibility itself has proven to be a problem. In some ways Blacks in Oregon have gone from a minority to a kind of abstraction. A neighborhood might be completely gentrified and the last black person moved out for three years before any of the new white residents learn that it used to be a black area of town. And this lends Portland particularly, into a place where a more docile racism is rampant.

The other side of this is that other places on the West Coast that tended to have well educated  people became really expensive and Portland became a destination for them. Which also pushed the state further to the left.

And, finally, conservatives in Oregon have tended to be a lot more libertarian than Bible-thumping. This obviously isn't always the case, but Mark Hatfield, a Republican, has half the state named after him. A pro-life evangelical Christian that wanted a way to divert federal taxes to local neighborhood services, he was also against the Vietnam War, a huge proponent on Civil Rights issues,  and worked to limit nukes and military spending.

Speaking from a Canadian perspective, I thought Québécois were predominantly Catholic and considered themselves French and were very much against being British? Or was that just the population that did not leave Québec? I know there was a diaspora of people from Québec to the States, just not sure when (my Canadian history is a bit rusty)
There are a lot of liberals here in Oregon because most that have emigrated here are generally running away, or running west from something? Not everybody, but a lot... 

Our unions dominate most elections. They've been building a statewide democratic network ever since I can remember. I watched Barbara Roberts run and win governor.  I thought that was normal to be that progressive. Politics is like a sport for some families in Oregon, where logging town lumber kings like to think they rule what is left of the scorched black earth we call the climate fires of 2020 Summer of tear gas protests. 

173 comments in this thread and the only discussion of natives. The only comment being whites just realizing indigenous also have second amendment rights? LOL LELEle They didn't want too many blacks to come into Oregon, \[under very racist redlining housing policies\], until they had exterminated MOST of the Indigenous culture and people. (I'm a native import from AZ)

Oregon is an outliers of extreme political viewpoints, and we knew it and we used it. Because we actually care and most of us unanimously decided this summer, if not Portland where else? Even the conservative libertarian gun toting rednecks can sympathize with Blacks getting destroyed by cops without due process. Police reform is a serious issue that still needs to be addressed.

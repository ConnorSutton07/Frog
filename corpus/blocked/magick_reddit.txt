But stick around anyways, it’s a fun success story. This post is for the skeptics, fence-sitters, dabblers, and frustrated beginners out there. :)

here is a quick story that has a rational AND mystical explanation, that are not mutually exclusive to one another. Both explanations compliment the other, and I’ll explain why a bit later.

I have been feeling frustrated, and burnt out at my day job for a while now. Depressed. But with no other better options, I’ve been forced to slog along and sacrifice most of my waking days to make not much better than minimum wage to out food on the table and gas in my car, just to fuel me to get to work the next day. Obviously not how humans are supposed to live. We shall revisit that in a moment... here is some background on my experience with magick.

I have been practicing ceremonial magic (enochian, Wiccan, Egyptian, hermetic qabalism,) and studying intensely for a couple years, waiting for my big sober breakthroughs of results from my magic. I have had massive breakthroughs under the influence of various psychedelics , but the inner skeptick in me needs base reality to show results too. The first year was frustrating, nothing was working like I wanted it to. I was following formulas, experimenting with different traditions, home brewing my own practices, and the results I was seeing were mainly internal. 

At the end of the day, by the second year, I was only really able to change my outlook on certain things, open my mind to new ideas, etc. I got small glimpses of synchronicities and manifestation, but nothing that could satisfy the inner skeptic. But I wanted to believe, so strongly, that I kept going. 

I’m at the end of my third year practicing and studying with dedication. All of a sudden, all of the things I have been working to manifest are coming true. All at once. This big tidal wave of magic is rushing over my life. I quit my job to start a community farm (a dream of mine I’ve had from the beginning), I am meeting all the most beautiful and wonderful people (the type that I know are my soul community), I’m repairing my relationship with my parents, so much more, and topped it all off this week with a successful Jupiter invokation that landed me an extra 4200 bucks, just totally out of the Jovian blue.

Here is what happened with the Jupiter invokation. I was at work, bored and frustrated and feeling depressed, and decided to slip away for a break to read a simple prayer to Mars for strength to get through the day, and Jupiter to bring me wealth and abundance so I wouldn’t have to work so hard just to get ahead. No ritual, no theatrics, just spoke two quick and simple prayers quietly in the bathroom. Slowly at first, but quickly rising over the course of the next hour, I felt this rising, hot energy rising in me. It felt good, and I didn’t even equate it to my prayers, I just thought I was finally getting over the slump of being tired. I finished the day with more energy and than I’ve ever had at this job, slinging zingers at my coworkers, moving fast and getting shit done. Laughing and smiling and lifting usually heavy things with ease. Adrenaline boost straight from Mars. The feeling lasted over the next couple days, and just as it was starting to fade, three days later, I get a text from my grandfather saying that he’d like to give me both of his past stimulus checks to help support my farm. The next day after that, the newest stimulus package passed in the United States. That’s an extra 4200 dollars in my bank account. 

There is no doubt in my mind anymore that magick works. It was something as simple as that breakthrough. But the great thing is? There is a perfectly rational explanation to it all. After years of work to focus my brain on the things that are important to me, I’ve shifted my awareness to bringing into my life the things that I want. Selective awareness is the same as magick. If you don’t believe the Gods exist, that’s okay. They can be symbols too. think of them as simply a TV channel you tune into. Doesn’t matter if they are really real, the symbol channels the archetype of what they represent by focusing your mind on that pattern. 

All that to say is, if you are reading this and you are struggling with getting results on your manifestations, don’t give up on them. Keep working at it. It’ll come eventually, sometimes all at once and when you least expect it.

This was longer than I expected. Thanks for reading. Breakthroughs await. Peace, love and abundance.✌️Behold! The Sigil Engine is live!   
A technomancy collab merging digital, art and magick.   


[http://sigilengine.com/](http://sigilengine.com/)I see many beginners asking where to start, so I thought I'll give initial direction. 

I will not mention nor compare different mystical schools, that is up to you to decide. I will just point you in a direction of few necessary skills, the rest is up to you. It's lil longer, but it it worth reading.

Many beginners want to start with some "real spells" or rituals, but are disappointed when the advanced students tell them that the best way for normal people is to start with meditation. The reason is that you need to develop few basic skills , without them, your Magick effort is going to be inconsistent in the best case and none in the worst.

1. Quiet (Silent/Zen/..) mind - that is the basic necessity for developing all of the other important qualities, especially for non-sensitive people. It's precisely Silent mind that is the best way to develop Perception, Intuition, Intent and other skills that are the basis for Magick, energy manipulation, manifestation and rituals.

You can imagine your normal mind as being on a crowded street - not only it's hard to move from A to B there, you are being distracted constantly and even if there was something abnormal, you wouldn't notice. (Everyone seen the video with gorilla and baseball ?). Meanwhile Silent mind is completely empty street, without any obstacles, distractions or  obstructions , you would notice gorilla on empty street, I can guarantee it.

2. Perception - You could say that Perception is the basic component of anything Occult, because without Perception of some kind, you wouldn't be able to see anything else but material world.

I won't go into this one in detail, because there are many ways of Perception, depending on the talent of practitioner (some can see energies and entities vividly, some "only" feel them after months of practice) and the intended function (Intuition, Spiritual Sight, Ability to feel energy, etc.). But it is vital skill for any kind of practice.

Apart from everyday use, Perception is also big part of some rituals - namely any ritual in which you either summon or borrow a power from higher entity. It's nice that you are able to execute the ritual for summoning some entity, but what's it for when you can't see, hear or feel it in any way? 

You can say that without Perception of any kind, you are like blind in the world of Magick.

3. Intent -  In contrast to Perception, Intent is the basic component of Magick. Please don't confuse Intent with Visualisation.^(1) While Visualisation has its place in Magick, many times when people say Visualisation, they usually mean Intent. Not only those two are different mental concepts, you also use different parts of your brain for them.^(2) Visualisation is purely Imaginative process of thinking mind, Intent is the ability to feel the visualisation and will it to life that doesn't require active involvement of thoughts.

It's little bit hard to explain, but the relationship between those two is the similar as relationship between Thinking about moving your hand and actually moving your hand.

While Imagination and Visualisation have their place in Magick as well, it's far lesser role to Intent. Intent is how Magick happens.

To be fair, many people use Intent intuitively, that is also why many say, while Visualising your manifestation to "feel it". But for you as beginner, this difference is crucial. 

  
That would be all for me. I will not go into more detail nor will I give specific methods, because it would be too long and most of the Mystical schools that are worth something do have methods, so you can chose according to your taste.

If you have anything constructive, feel free to join the discussion below, no matter if you are beginner or advanced. Hope this helped.

2.  http://www.livescience.com/49244-imagination-reality-brain-flow-direction.htmlLittle by little encouraging the young to welcome in magick.  Be still my heart.You don’t need to be totally awakened all the time. Be wary of chasing a certain feeling or experience. You must consider the shadow of your will. 

^ this is a reminder for myself and I hope it might help some of you if you feel this. After getting deeper into my practice I noticed my depression and derealization episodes became.. something else. Feeling the divine wrath of chaos and sadness can be a lot. I cannot get lost in the sauce of euphoric spiritual mania all the time and forget to ground myself. For the other side of the coin is rather uncomfortable lol.I thought ide share with you guys.

Much love & Many blessings 🙏As the title suggests, I just really need to vent about witchcraft groups on fb. Most of them are so toxic and hostile towards people who don't follow their "love and light" dogma. 

When did witchcraft become so disgustingly fluffy to the point of making people sick? When did witchcraft become hyper focused on crystals, horoscopes, birth charts, 3 fold, karma, chakras??? When did it become okay to white wash ancient cultures, their traditions, and closed practices? When did it become okay to bully people and shove threats of karma and 3 fold down other's throats? 

A good chunk of them are people who saw something on TikTok and decided, "oh, well that looks cool. I think I'm a witch now?"

They don't want to put in the work, they just want easy answers. And don't even get me started on Pinterest... 

It really bothers me. 

Okay... I'm done venting now. If you've read this far, I thank you.Love and LVX to all.   


Thank you for your lessons, 2020.   
Happy Birthday, 2021.I got an offering cup as a present. So i burned a little scrap of paper in it during a spell. This tiny scrap of paper burned for a few seconds and then ....kabam! The fire became way bigger and just kept burning, too much for this little bit of paper.

Holy shit i am a powerful wizard! Oh.... the cup is on fire 😅 it was some fake metal- plastic and meltedthis is mainly for baby witches but theres some into anyone could learn from


- dont put water in spell jars with herbs, it rehydrates them and will result in molding. you can instead use honey, essential oils and i believe vinegar is okay too

- b-ok.cc is a great place to access witchy books for free. with an account you can download 10 per day 

- fact check EVERYTHING. especially if you're using tik tok witches to help learn.

- dont drink water made with rainwater, theres bacteria in that

- cleanse AND charge your crystals. they can do a lot so you need to tell them what you want from them (i cleanse with selenite and charge by writing affirmations on paper)

- when using youtube videos, check the comments. especially on reliable sources youll often find good advice in there

- DO RESEARCH ON YOUR PRACTICES!!! voodoo, hoodoo and various other practices are not open to everyone. this means people practicing them should have it in their blood to oversimplify it. there are 1000s of paths to take with witchcraft, there are other things you may like more

- this brings me to white sage, palo santo and "smudging". these things are of native origins and its disrespectful or harmful to use them. white sage especially is endangered and when you buy it youre encouraging more corporations to take white sage from indigenous people. the term smudging should be replaced with cleansing anf instead of whi to e sage and palo santo, use mugwart, blue sage, lavender, rosemary. there are 1000 options, just do your research

- make sure crystals are safe to put in water and/or salt before cleansing with methods involving them. 

- tarot is mainly interpretation, learning the base meanings of the cards is important but its what you take from them that matters

- tarot is pronounced taro. the t at the end is silent

-  salt lamps are good for keeping your area cleansed if you cant burn insence or cleansing sticks. 

- sound can cleanse

- you can use music for divination if youre in the broom closet 

- incorporate your practice into every day. it doesn't have to be big, meditate, be greatful for nature, use crystal healing, cleanse, do a bit of divination (pendulum or daily tarot reading), read, add to your book of shadows, look after houseplants. it doesnt have to be much

- dont define your path straight away, just have a base path. this will allow you to easily learn from other paths. your practice is not restricted. 

- you can make anything witchcraft if you put intention into it, even makeup or eating

- when making drinks, stir clockwise to attract positivity, love, ect and stir anticlockwise to release negativity.

- don't put crystals in your drinks unless youre certain theyre safe to do that with. some crystals release harmful things into water.

- rosemary replaces any herb, clear quartz replaces any crystal, rose replaces any flower, white replaces any colour

- if you have fake crystals you can still use them for colour association and you can give them any intention you want for meditation

- you dont need equipment you can do things with your energy.

- dont thank the fae, they will take that as you owe them something but also dont insult them. 

- research dieties outside of just Greek gods there are many interesting ones

- don't do love spells on others ESPECIALLY without consent. that is taking their free will and it is not okay

- only curse or hex when necessary else it may backfire

- don't read witch by lisa lister. she is openly transphobic and sexist and gatekeeps witches who arent born female

- learn about opening and closing circles

- ask before you take from nature

- if gifted something by the fae, bury it and say "you are most kind but this does not belong to me" (unless youre working with them, in that case idk what to do, research it) 

- stores like the dollar store and charity/thrift stores can have tons of witchy things in without even realising. often they have jars, incense, candles, herbs, bowls/altar decorations. look in those stores 

- doubts are okay as long as you dont let them take over. anyone would have doubts about astral projection but you can do it, you just have to push back the doubtsSigil Engine now has its own secure server. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project x

Stir 7 times clockwise, and as you drink, imagine all the things that could go RIGHT this season ✨ Blessed be!This happened over the last few weeks. My good friend B was going thru a rough patch. After getting a new apartment, payday rolled around and money wasn’t deposited as it should have been. We fellow millennials aren’t made of money. 

That night, a said a few words, carved her full name on a green candle in a green candle holder, surrounded with money and a green jade bracelet. I asked the universe to help my friend because she’s a good person with good intentions and living the best life she can. I let the candle burn all the way and avoided thinking about it (I believe not dwelling and not talking about things put into the universe is key to things manifesting.)

We got together yesterday so celebrate her birthday and guess what she told me right before we went our own ways. Her work gave her a raise! I can’t help but to feel like I helped plant that seed in the universe. 

So my friends, magick works. The universe knows your intention and the results (or lack thereof) will reflect on the outcome. 

Thanks for reading.I'm a developer. In many ways, when I write code I'm speaking a magical language that the wonderful world of computers and machines understand.

Learning how to program is a lot like learning magical spells. I speak, or rather type, magical words in code and all kinds of things inexplicably happens on the computer just as I foretold. It's highly logical.

The mind, like all computer systems, is made up of layers upon layers of abstraction. From the top conscious level experience, all the way down through the brain, below the body, and out into the real experiential world. The subconscious, and therefore, *the self* is technically all of it.

So when we use magic, we program the world to behave a certain way. It's much more fluid, dynamic, and responsive than a computer. The world of our subconscious, that we exist within daily, seems to have a mind of its own. But it's just as logical, if not as rigid as a computer system. The world is as alive as we are.

Just as the language of human-readable code is translated down into abstract bytecode, enormously complex patterns on the memory and processor, and then re-manifests as specific observed functionality... So too does speaking magick words, producing magickal symbols on the substrate of our attention reorder the presently unseen all around, and produces a somewhat specific future.

The practice of magick, as I see it, can be described as a conversation, a negotiation, a dance with the world to reprogram the subconscious as it manifests the world, and eventually, the conscious manifesting self.Blessed Yule to everyone! Hello everyone! I made a guide for the full moon last month and had a few people encourage me to continue, so I've made one for the February Full Moon as well, I'll link it in the comments!

My goal in making this was to explain and walk anyone through a full moon ritual. It's free for anyone to use, just something I want to share.

Does anyone have heir own full moon plans or rituals they'd like to share?Hello everyone!

Now and then we're having posts asking about help with mental health, depression, suicidal thoughts, bipolar or Borderline disorders, eating disorders &c. While we the mod team certainly sympathize with people in need and looking for help we are also very aware of what this subreddit and the people in here can provide and what we can not. This subreddit is not a suitable platform to help people with mental health and their relatives and friends. You should assume that people here are not qualified to assist with mental health, provide psychotherapy or similar. Even if there might be someone here who is, Reddit and other social network platforms on the internet are very unsuitable in establishing a patient-doctor relationship.

Therefore we will establish a rule #5: **No posts seeking help with mental health.** While we do respect individual beliefs regarding using Magick to address these topics, we do not feel like this subreddit is the appropriate venue for it. So if we find a post dealing with one of these topics we will have /u/automoderator filter it out for manual mod review as well as make a comment linking to resources were people can find help, like mental emergency and suicide helplines.

Thanks for your understanding on behalf of the mod team.I see a lot of posts about 'is this real' or 'do you think it's ok if i do this'.  


I get that we're all from a society that's conditioned us that everything has to be materially measurable to be real and.. we're trained to ask permission to even go to the toilet from a young age but..  


Magick is a place where that can be re-written.  


I don't consider myself only a 'chaos magician' but it's definitely been a considerable influence. As have things like NLP, buddhism, carl jung, robert anton wilson etc.  


One of the key tenets i run by both magically and in daily life is:  


"what ideas and beliefs are USEFUL"  


if we look at our stack of conditioned beliefs and values as an operating system we realise we can make changes to that operating system and those changes produce changes in our reality.  


(as above so below as within so without etc)  


So the primary practice of a magician is tweaking reality til it suits us.  


so.. rather than the religious frame which TELLS you what's true (and embedds a bunch of codes that someone, once upon a time made up) magick equipps us to deal with the more ambiguous reality that:  


"nothing is true, everything is permitted"  


So.. rather than worrying about 'is this real?' 'is this true?" 'is this allowed?'  


seize the fucking day, decide which ingredients belong in your operating system and most of all..  


do lots of magick.  


Thankyou for attending my ted talk.So this just happened. My boss came up to me while I was doing inventory 

"uh TripleA, i wanted to ask you something. Did you leave a pack of cigarettes and a notebook in the break room yesterday?"

"Uhm I don't think so, I might have?"

"Can you go check before we throw it out?" 

I have a work notebook that's the same size as my grimore that has a fair amount of journalling, spells and rituals I've done as well as sigils. I come back 

"Yeah that was mine."

I sensed some minor side eye. The mostly Hispanic population here are mostly come from conservative Catholic families so I'm sure the prominent Symbol Of Chaos and latin title was off putting for them. I don't think anyone wanted to even touch it since it was where I had left it last night 😅 I wasn't planning on having the insane wizard talk with these people till much later on hahaOn the last full moon, I did a health transference spell from white supremacists to my father. I used my bloodline. I called on the spirit of water who I am most closely in touch with. Five minutes after I was done with the ritual I looked at my phone and got the breaking news alert that Trump has coronavirus. Two weeks later, one of my dad’s cancer results came back negative and the other was small, so nbd. The doctors he talked to (both western medicine and his folk medicine doctors) had been very concerned that it was severe. It’s practically a miracle that he’s not dying.

I’ve found that spells are what you make them. Rituals can be as complex or as simple as you desire them to be. The more organic they are to yourself and the more connected you are to your materials, your spirits, your surroundings, and the earth, the more powerful they are. In my ritual, I communed and connect to my ancestors, one of whom is my namesake and was a High Priestess.

This Haloween/Samhain isn’t just a full moon. It’s a Blue Moon. It’s the day we set our clocks back so if you ascribe strongly to colonial concepts of time you mat perceive the day as lasting 25 hours. Not even that, it’s during a Mercury in retrograde. I’m not an astrologer, but even I know that’s a time for chaos in communication. We are in chaos already in 2020, and 2021 will only be more so. This is a time for chaos magick.

As an Indigenous African in the USA, I often felt especially this past summer that things were hopeless and cracking and even dying. But I’ve come to a realization: things like colonialism and racism and sexism and capitalism are living energies. They must die, in order for the Earth to heal. Humans are animals, as much as some wish to ignore that material reality. And the Earth knows best for all of us. Just as ants hold to each other in a flood, creating a raft with their bodies, so must we hold together to whether the storm of cleansing chaos that kills these things. Trust in the process. A time is coming when we will get Land Back, Black Lives will Matter, and we will arrive at global decolonization and de-exploitation of the Third World.

I will be performing rituals on the 31st to solidify this chaotic intent. I invite all of you who are interested to join me, and do the same.Over the course of the entire month of October I created rituals and spells to increase prosperity and luck to aid me in finding a well paying job this month. 

We’re not even a full week into November and I got a job offer! They told me they were so impressed and blown away with me that they’re starting me off at a higher wage than they usually do for people just starting out in the bizz. I’m just so, so happy!

I really and sincerely believe that practicing magick helped me to achieve this! Obviously it is not the only reason, but I think it definitely tipped things in my favor. 

What a wonderful world we live in!&#x200B;

Inherently, the word 'want' is a declaration of scarcity in that it is an affirmation of the fact that **you do not have** what you desire. When you say, "I want this, or I want that", you are essentially saying,  "because I don't have this, this other thing will fill the hole" and while it certainly could *fill the hole* \- there must be a **better way** to obtain the things we desire ***without*** reaffirming our own lack thereof. Framing is important because the Creative Unconscious is **The Great Manifester** of our lives. *It sustains the rituals that sustain our current configuration of reality.* 

In other words, our unconscious minds execute subtle, imperceivable,  algorithms \[belief systems\] that dictates our behavior. This behavior in turn affects our physical environments. As we continue to alter our interaction with the material world - new choices and opportunities arise. ***Every new decision leads to a slight alteration in your current configurated reality.***

&#x200B;

While you only perceive the 4th dimension in a linear fashion, if you could zoom out and watch time-segmented - a day, week, month, year - you would be able to see how these microexpressions of the will reconfigure reality around you. And this is a critical key to understanding personal transformation -

&#x200B;

>"What you believe is what you become"

If you believe that you lack - then all you'll manifest is more of it. And if 'Want' is a subtle declaration of scarcity - then a declaration such as "I want X, Y, or Z" becomes counter-productive as it manifests the opposite of what you desire.   


So how do we *frame ourselves correctly* so that our **Creative Unconcious** manifests what we desire? By **behaving** like our best selves today...right this instance.   
Think to yourself, if you could be living your best life today...what would that look like? What would your days look like? Really think about it -  imagine an entire day, from the moment you open your eyes to the moment you close them. How would you live? What would you do? Don't worry about whether any of this is possible or not - this is the moment to **DREAM BIG.**

&#x200B;

Once you've done the mental exercise - identify one thing on the to-do list of your Best Self, and see if you can begin to incorporate it into your schedule today. Start with something simple and work your way up. Before you know it, you'll be doing everything you imagined your best self doing without ever having to say anything about what you don't have. If you want to make this exercise even more impactful, do some [\#breathwork](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/breathwork?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZWj3NPhcvboOgVOnLuYE7-RxgXhOJgfI_yNhwQLskeXiWOnCg7MjTkwVJMOk49a2RaOC4zJL8xna8l65deYf6s9eU_2vLFk42_XTiRMUCQsbcwzWYOMEgZcpNMAKa-ABDoEb5EEL75MAabmwH3IbCvBThD84PDjzUv8VWs-tB8Mgw&__tn__=*NK-R) before the time ---> Try this one: [https://youtu.be/UWBJJbKXOW4](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FUWBJJbKXOW4%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2EPluaQh5M4jSTs847CLMEDz44FkTHCvpTRXzWzGQeEVPFB3eLoAcyZlU&h=AT2HxQY0-R4_zaUJZxaMfEx_JqEw5n_Vdjeq5BEbBIs6yBNmB_RorLZnEzB2YFKHm1WzEu7VF81aV5cVoMmkUT3-TL2gOXbVWh3F1VoaqdUhugI0EJ3O8HKAnATDLUIVDhsBcvCp9-jba-nm4g&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT0ptwH3WtMJLLTLe3hljc3WH36UdMRwEZv3HNFB2kdn0oPYpBu7pIiG1P2rz94s-hsUrvG8_LpvK7gHA2fTR_tlF-EP_bWYDe19xKMVgWLyHkcdOsrmvOMchsNAH2qGRvql1oLtnAc0BsGXX0zgj1zFt_qjTlk97V3OiJeTDvfFsisIvPamwtEvH00)

Also - I got a Discord Magick Channel called '[Real Magick](https://discord.gg/KZZf5gk)' for anyone interested in shooting the shit with other wyrdoes. I also wrote this piece called "Mastering the Basics of Magick" which people seem to enjoy. It runs along the same vein as this manifestor trick.

Anyhow, I'd love to hear what other tricks there are for shifting realities, perhaps more efficient than this one.

Keep it Wyrd, 

"The Beheaded Jester"Hi all I'm a blacksmith and I keep seeing in different discussions people are looking for "iron" items and are disappointed because they can only find things made from steel so I thought I'd take a minute to explain the metallurgy. The majority of steel you'll interact with is going to be what's called 10 series steel which is only comprised of iron and carbon. The exception being anything that's a commercially manufactured tool which will have zinc or nickle or whatever added in for various reasons. 10 series steel has different grades like 1045, 1055, 1080 and what that all means is that in for example 1045 has .45% carbon per lbs 1055 has .55% carbon per lbs and etcetera. Within 10 series steel the highest carbon content you'll find is 1095 .95% carbon per lbs. The most common steel you'll interact with is 1010 so in my humble opinion modern steel is more than adequate for any ritual that calls for iron. Because even in a whats concidered within the industry to be a "high carbon steel" 1095 the steel is still 99.05% pure iron.&#x200B;

A very common thing that I see on witchcraft groups, especially those for beginners, is 'Do you have a spell for...?" and while often many of us are able to help out with a link or something more personal, overall, the best spells, we know, are those written ourselves.

But writing spells can be daunting especially if you've never written one.

So if spells are your thing and you're already good to go, this post is probably not for you, but for anyone wondering how to simplify the process, here's my personal method.

Think about what it is that you want to manifest. What are you trying to achieve? Love? To be more Attractive? To have more money? To Find Calm in times of Anxiousness? To quell fear? To make someone pay?

What is it you want to do? Figure it out and get clear with it. You want a single sentence so that you can focus and work off of it. So what is it?! For the purposes of this, I'm going to say we're trying to draw money. My sentence could look like "I want more financial prosperity". Just write it at the top of your page. It doesn't matter what words you use in it, because this is only the focus point for our work. Just get real with what you want, precisely.

THEN, once you've got that, begin thinking (or googling) synonyms for those words. Financial synonyms that suit our work could be "Money, Cash, Coins, Pay, Funds" etc. Look at "Prosperity" synonyms next. "Wealth, Success, Ease, Comfort, Security".

Now, look for other words for what you want to do. Googling 'want' isn't going to be helpful, so you'll need to think on this one. In my example, we want to DRAW prosperity to us. So look then for synonyms for that meaning of draw... you'll come up with things like 'Attract, Pull, Magnet, Lure, Charm, Come".

My basic spell format is "what's happening now that is wrong, what do I want to manifest instead?"

With these word banks, you'll begin to piece things together to see if they work. This is the 'spellcrafting' portion. In my case, I might start with this, "Money comes". Working from that, you can see that you could go any of a thousand ways with this...and this is why spellcrafting is best done by the individual spellcrafter :P Sometimes people like to rhyme. I use similar sounds in familiar phrases. In the charm below, you'll see "Comes and Goes" which is a very common saying. It's also what frequently happens with people with money situations. Money shows up and then boom it's gone until it shows up again some time later.

So We want the "come" part for our money but not the "go" part. At the start of the spell, I said how things are right now "Comes, Goes" and at the end I say it " Flows and Stays" because that's what I want the change to be. I want money flowing in and staying with me, instead of flowing in and disappearing!

"Money Comes,

Money Goes,

Money Stays

Money Flows to Me

So Mote it Be"

Some people attribute melodic/rhyming invocations to having 'more power'... but I like to use very short and specific iterations with rhymes or near rhymes so I can easily memorize and use during my work without lessening my visualizations while I try to remember my spell! You should make your spells as long as you feel comfortable. some practitioners really enjoy getting into that work and will write very long and detailed invocations. For those practitioners, again, you're awesome and this post probably isn't for you, but for everyone who is new to this, don't feel like you have to be operating at that same level or you're not doing 'as strong' of work as someone else. Don't compare yourself to anyone but yourself and try not worry too much about if it's right/perfect. Use the words that are best for you. You don't have to use complicated or ritualistic language to create effective spells, and the more deeply you connect with your spells, the better they will work for you!I'm /u/CurryThighs, a fledgling Chaos Magick practitioner with deep interests in all areas of Magick, and I'll be acting as the mod here for the time being! The last mod team became unresponsive and inactive anywhere on Reddit, yet decided to close the subreddit's submissions with no explanation. I see this happening in a lot of subs over the past month. If anyone knows the reason, please let me know!

Anyway, I've reopened submissions and I hope to do my best to serve you all as my countless (39,853) new overlords. My main goal was opening the sub back up, not really sure where to go from here. I think the sub functions/looks fine so I'm not particularly interested in implementing a ton of changes. That said, my inbox is always open for suggestions!

Let's see how this plays out! :DI love seeing the results for my magick it’s so beautiful. My brother came to me tonight and told me he’s staring to learn how to not to be so angry anymore. He told me and external force was guiding him that direction. He said the energy reminded him of my grandpa and I. Which I did do a sigil to have him find inner peace and not be so angry. My girlfriend also went to the casino and won a lot of money. I love doing this work! I am finding peace and joy through all of this[https://nofaithinthehumanrace.com/index.php](https://nofaithinthehumanrace.com/index.php)A while ago, maybe July, I saw a spell jar/potion jar for self-love on Pinterest. It struck my interest and I’ve been dabbling in it ever since. What particularly caught my eye was divination, and card reading, because my entire life, my grandma was a Bible-based card reader. This week, I realised that I’m way better off than I was five months ago. It’s just a nice feeling. I’ll never know for sure if it was the spell or not, but I do know I’m better.I’m pretty new to magick. My mom practiced and so did my great grandma. As far as I know, my grandma didn’t. We grew up poor. My grandma collected things like baseball cards and Disney stuff. Her intent was to have valuable things for me and my cousins. Well they aren’t worth much lol.     
      
She passed a few years ago. She used to always say there will be money and all that. I never put much thought to it. Besides, I would have rather had her there for my wedding but it just didn’t work that way. There is something that I’ve noticed though.... I was having such a hard time financially. My now husband and I were always in a hole and were struggling. I managed to find a job that paid well but it was awful. I was working on the phones for an accidental law firm and it just sucked. My grandma passed just after I started. A week later i was chatting with my landlord and her husband and they were asking how the new job was going. So I vented a little. Her husband just happened to be a recruiter and had an opening for something I got into that paid very well and free benefits since it was a contract position.        
       
Things were so good after that. We caught up on a lot and managed to get on our feet. Around the time of our wedding I was hoping for just something extra. Maybe a small part time thing after work would help. I walked into a pizzaria that day when I was really hoping for it and they just happened to be looking for someone part time. I started that week. I stayed there for a few months until I caught up.        
       
I stayed at my full time contract job until the contract expired. I was planning on just having it renew (although unemployment was always a possibility after) but covid has other plans for my company. The weird thing was that after I lost that job, I was making more on unemployment with that additional weekly thing they had for a while. The timing was crazy! My contract ended just as they were doing that. When that ran out, my husband got promoted at his job as hr manager so it evened out. And just in time too!        
        
Lately I’ve been feeling the pressure of myself only making half my income and finding a job in what I was doing just isn’t happening right now. The job market is more brutal then ever before. Just yesterday I was hoping for just something part time and under the table. That would be all I need right now. If I couldn’t find something better, that will be just fine until something better comes along. Well guess who got an interview for a small take out restaurant that’s under the table a few days a week.... that’s me witchez!      
        
I think my grandma is looking out for me. She really meant it. We’re not rich but we aren’t struggling anymore. And moneys tight now, but we used to have to steal food so we could afford bills.         
       
I feel so incredibly lucky. I know so many people are having it really bad right now and I’m so grateful that we’re getting by. Our debt is starting to accumulate a little but we’re ok. Any suggestions on how I can thank her?        
        
Update: I got that under the table job! That will help so much until I find something like I was doing before. Thanks Mima 💜TLDR: My kid has an imaginary friend. I’m creating my own to see if they communicate.




I have a lot of questions about spirits. Are they existing beside us, because of us, or as an extension of us? Do we recognize archetypes, and give them features? Do we create an archetype as a thought structure...creating a place/spiritual form that’s inhabitable by a spirit? Can we create, can we place, or can we just make a suitable environment for habitation?

My daughter is 3, she’ll be 4 on March 03. Very recently she’s acquired/created an imaginary friend. This is very interesting to me because my parents always liked to tell stories about my own imaginary friend, and what a piece of shit it was. The whole concept kind of shaped my own childhood, or at least my perception of it through memory and suggested/imposed recollection.

The circumstances that surrounded this experiment are as important as the outcome. I’ll share the snowball that started the avalanche before I get into my own plans.

About a week after this “friend” started to exist for my daughter I audibly heard it speak to her. I work a graveyard shift, so I usually get home about an hour before everybody starts waking up. I was sitting on my couch reading a book when I hear my daughter go into her bathroom. She says in a very firm tone; “Stay out there. If you come in here while I’m going to the bathroom I’ll be VERY mad.”

I then hear a response. “OK. I won’t.”

It was a female voice that sounded enough like my wife that I assumed she was awake and about to enter the living room. She wasn’t. After a minute I got up and looked into our bedroom, wife and son are asleep in the bed. I ask my daughter who she was talking to and she tells me, “my friend, Junarie.”

Thus my idea is born. I’ll be creating my OWN imaginary friend over the course of a month. In that time I’ll be giving it a description of itself, and telling it things to relay to my daughter’s friend. I’ll then be asking very specific questions to my daughter to see if I can get any correlative information. 

If that doesn’t work within a month, I’m planning on upping the ante by introducing my daughter to my self-made imaginary friend, and suggesting that our two friends should “hang out”. Same variables apply, I’ll see if she can get any information that hasn’t been given to her correct or not.

I’m not expecting much, but it might be interesting.Over the past couple weeks or so, I've seen a lot of posts asking for information on "mystery man" or "hide and seek" style "rituals". I use the term ritual because these are the titles of the posts many of these have obviously started out on spooky subreddits and similar blogs and have been made popular by YouTube videos titled along the lines of "We Did The Blah Blah Ritual At 3am!". I'm not saying everything that fits this description is fake but theres gotta be more appropriate places to discuss these things. I don't want this place to be a go-to for people looking for shock value views. I understand it's easy for some to confuse these for being the real deal but I'd hope anyone who has actual experience and knowledge would easily discredit these as entertainment. Just my observation. I'm by no means any kind of authority on ANY of these topics but seeing these over and over again just worries me about the integrity of the sub. Sorry, haha. Thanks for reading, guys. Good energies to you all.Like, me included, almost all of the converting Christians I've seen haven't become atheists, but rather wicca or pagan, or in some cases just straight up witch. I find that very interesting, given Christianitys teaching on witchcraft. I was raised in a far right Christian home, and I came out lgbt, a witch, and an omnist who thinks God's an asshole and a liarI have come to realize what all of those trippy, 'hippie' people were talking about. It's not some feelgood, phony shlock that people who've fried their brains with psychedelics spout off to make themselves feel more important and 'zen', it's reality, whatever "reality" really is.  


We all came from supernovas from who knows how long ago, the ego is a protective, default state of being, and when turned off, we would feel far more empathy for one another, including the universe as a whole, because we're all the same being.   


I have mentioned Panpsychism before, but I will mention it again in this post. Panpsychism is a scientific theory that consciousness is inherent to everything that exists, all because we're all made up of the same atoms. With quantum entanglement, that means that all of our consciousnesses are connected to some degree.  


I am you, and you are me. We are the stars, and the stars are us. As above, so below.I’ve been trying to define magick in an understandable way for a while now because I’m dissatisfied with some of the definitions I’ve come across in the past. I came up with this but feel like it could still use some work:

Magic is the intentional manipulation of energy (electromagnetic, psychic, kinetic) through will, attention, and focus to bring about a desired outcome.

Feel free to give feedback or share your own experience/intuition.Nerve-wrackingly so.DON'T BURN PINE NEEDLES INSTEAD OF SAGE. BURNING PINE NEEDLES CAN MAKE YOU VERY SICK.

I grew up on a farm where we would burn our Christmas trees in the fire pit but we would have too be careful of inhaling the smoke because it can cause a flu-like sickness when inhaled. If you are looking for a substitute I'd say stick with lavender or whatever else you want to burn but DON'T burn pine needle bundles.

edit:(I suppose I should clarify the needles and and not the wood itself)

edit 2: People in the comments seem to think I am attacking their practice when simply I am trying to warn people about what can happen and to be careful. Do as you do, I am not trying to stop you just offering advice from my own experiences.I’m writing this today because I’m still in a bit of shock from what happened. I’ve been depressed and experiencing bad luck lately , and did a good luck spell to try to reverse it. It backfired the next morning, terribly,  so i intuitively put together an uncrossing ritual w 4 candles, two white and two black, as well as anointing oils and black salt. I wrote and burned my petition, since I do this w banishing spells and using my athame to chant all that I wanted to leave me, as well as psalm 23 11 times . As I did this, the candle flames started to sway to the right so forcefully I was almost afraid, but kept going anyway bc I knew I had to. I felt something in that moment and I knew it was magick. It was a force , and a feeling and I knew I was being guided by spirits and my spell would work. The candles burnt down in 40 minutes, And these are the same candles that I’ve used many times before, and they always burn in 2-4 hours. The way they burnt was unlike anything I’d seen as well, as drips and shapes were lifelike. Just writing this to say that for a long time I didn’t feel magick during spell work, and it took me at one of my lowest moments to truly feel magick, so please don’t give up. It is undoubtedly real.Good Magick doesn't replace faulty decision making and actions in the physical earth plane. It is not a substitute it does not make up for bad actions.

Likewise an astrological aspect of Jupiter conjunct pluto in the second house doesn't replace bad financial decisions. 

If fact they will hurt you because you are too busy looking in the sky, too busy looking looking at your runes, cards, mirrors etc.

They are meant to assist you. You still have to work here on earth. 
Studies conducted by MIT show that the lottery winner is way more likely to file for bankruptcy than your average American which means EVEN GOOD LUCK doesnt replace good decision making. Source below

https://  direct.mit.edu/rest/article/93/3/961/57969/The-Ticket-to-Easy-Street-The-Financial#.VpLMM1J327Q

So before you even get to the magick part ask yourself.

How could I have managed the situation better?

Where am I being wasteful?

How can I be more disciplined and research things fully before making a decision?

What are the behaviors of those who are successful and how can I model some of those that I like?


If you are gonna do magick do magick for that first.

That is why they say all is mental in the hermetic teachings.

Its your daily habitual thoughts that make its way into your daily actions which create your experiences.


Edit

 thanks for all the responses I just want to point out an astrological concept and it goes


Earth element supports water and water supports earth

Earth - practicality efficiency resources industriousness


Water - is spirituality and magick, subconscious, collective subconscious.


You can use Earth (practicality, efficiency, good resource management) to give yourself more free time.


That free time can be put into spirituality and magick which can be used to boost your Earthly affiars.


Which then you use Earth to be even more efficient and gain more free time which is then used to study more magick which you can use to further boost your earthly affiars and so on.


In short let your work support your magickal goals and let your magickal goals support your work. This way you are not stuck saying "My job sucks I wish I was meditating and working on scrying" or something to that effect.Hello everyone, I just wanted to share my amazement here with you all, since we all love and practice magick. A little background:
I lived a pretty rational life (althought always craving for something else, but since my parents are marxists, never really believed in religion) until I was 21, when psychedelics made me change the way I percieve the world. These experiences made me search more deeply, wanting to relieve that sensation, but without the help of an outer sustance. I found many sources that confirmed my experience: literature, poetry, texts from Alan Watts, Krishnamurti, Yoga, Tao, and so on... I started a slow path, meditating and reading. Eventually I hit a dead point, where I couldn't see progress and got caught on non-duality, effort and non-effort labyrinths, and thought "this is it, right? from now on I'll just think about those golden youth days..."
A few months ago I discovered magick. I found out, in practice, something immense about the nature of the Psyche: for us, we westerners (I'm from Argentina, but most of us here have grandparents from Europe, so our Psyche is built that way), find much more natural this way of Magick, and not those from a different culture (paradoxically, the people that around here get attracted to the Mystic get through Yoga, Meditation and other Eastern practices).
To resume it, what in the past I could achieve in months of severe meditation and such, now I surpass it with a twenty minutes ceremony. I'm so happy now, and feel so much integrated with myself than before. I'm sorry if this post is too long, but I figured that many would share my experience, so I wanted to write this. Godspeed everyone, and I'm so glad to share this path with you all!So I tried it today with a very small amount of mushrooms and I entered the flow of it really easily. I performed about 2 hours of magick (mainly invocations through the LIRP to consecrate a journal and some for spiritual sustenance). My focus was on point and I was much more invested and immersed in the visualizations as well. I could even sense the subtle flow of energy more than I normally do.

I spent the last hour meditating and it even triggered some slight ego loss. I felt as if I were merging with the things around me and the boundaries of space were kind of dissolving (note that I also did some breathwork during the meditations). During this trance-like state, I even started seeing hypnagogia to an extent but visualizing scenes in my mind started to feel moderately as vivid as a dream. Overall, it just amplified the whole experience and kinda helped add another layer to it. Anyone else dabbled with microdosing and magick?

On the 21st day of the 12th month of 2020 at 10.02 UTC (note 0 1 2 pattern) is the December solstice, a natural turning point in what has been a very important year for the spiritual growth of humanity.  At 13.30 UTC on the same day, the highly anticipated grand conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn takes place at 0 degrees Aquarius.  

These two planets conjunct every 20 years or so, so what makes this one so special? This particular conjunction is incredibly close, closer than it has been in nearly 400 years. 

These two planets in conjunction are known as the astrological markers of an epoch-shift, a profound collective phase change not only spiritually, but at a physical level in our material world too. 

Saturn is the dweller on the threshold, the planetary lord of initiation. He is the guardian of spiritual law. His rites of passage require confrontation with karma in order to evolve. That may sound intense - and it can be - but his toughness is of the tough love variety. He is the cosmic teacher of ‘the only way out is through’. Saturn provide clarity and demands commitment. With his planetary influence, we realise what we must accomplish to earn our breakthrough. He grounds us and keeps us real and focused on the true task. He is the ensurer of the soul’s success. 

Jupiter is the happy-go-lucky dreamer of expansive visions. He is the inner inspirational urge and the questing nature of the soul that has unwavering faith in what can be. Saturn will show us exactly how to bring our most radical and bold Jupiterian visions to life.  He accomplishes this through spiritual initiation. 

Initiation is an amplified and accelerated growth process.  It wears away the barriers between the consciousness and capacity of this moment, and the divine genius within that knows how to manifest the grace and beauty of the sacred guiding vision. Initiations are the pressure point massages from the Universe that release the blockages and align us with our true divine potential.

Initiations are also a bit like weddings. The beauty of the “I do” is preceded by chaos, hard work, and grappling with our deepest fears. This must happen as the fertiliser for the beautiful moment of fruition. 

This entire year has been a soul-deep preparation for the imminent phase change, which is rather like a wedding of a new earth, a new humanity, a new bride, to the new consciousness which is her bridegroom.  We might playfully see the planets of Saturn and Jupiter as the minister and the church, or the two cosmic dads guiding the soul bride into the ceremony (because love is love, right?). 

The preparation for the collective initiation has been fierce throughout 2020. We have been forced to reckon with our nature as individuals and as a species, with the need to take individual responsibility for more than our own immediate comfort, to develop compassion and a sense of what is realistic and justifiable sacrifice, and where we need to be smart and dethrone those unworthy of authority because they do not serve the greater good. 

Having been on stage in various ways most of my life, I have taken to the heart the old adage, ‘the worse the dress rehearsal, the better the opening night’.  This year has been for many of us a chance to learn what not to do, to see what doesn’t work, and in that, to grasp the opportunity to grow in wisdom and evolve with optimism and courage. 

The shift into the Age of Aquarius is not a one-time event, but something that occurs over hundreds of years. It is my belief that we are in that process already. The conjunction taking place at 0 degrees Aquarius on the solstice is a cosmic reboot delivered by the two major planetary players that bridge, integrate and unify both individual and collective spiritual growth. It is a planetary push towards integration of the spiritual awareness with the material reality required for entrance into the Age of Aquarius. 

The hallmarks of the epoch shift into the Age of Aquarius are collective-oriented thought and action, the development of original approaches to old problems, cultivating a broader sense of what constitutes ‘family’, and the wise development and application of technology for the highest good. We might call it the best and most spiritually advanced humanitarianism. 

The shadow side of Aquarius is arrogance, pseudo-love for humanity whilst hating humans (have a think about that for a moment in context of the species self-hatred and ‘human beings are a virus and are the scourge of the planet mentality’ being circulated), and dissociation from the feminine embodied wisdom by retreating into the intellect and becoming fixed and fixated in one’s own opinion to the point of confusing opinion with fact and higher spiritual truth. The shadow Aquarian energy is idealism without compassion, which tends to lead to truly terrible actions against other humans, purportedly justified by a higher cause. 

The unintegrated Aquarian energy can lead to us dissing our ancestors as little more than ‘peer pressure from dead people’ as the meme goes, and worshipping technological progress without thought as to the impact on the environment and the wellbeing of Earth’s creatures, nor recognising the value of traditional knowledge and how it can inform modern understanding so that we unite the best of innovation with the priceless guidance of ancient wisdom. 

Saturn was the original ruler of Aquarius, before the discovery of eccentric Uranus, and so as Saturn moves through his former rulership, we are invited, tested and tempered to seek the nourishment from the past that has stood the test of time and can support the beautiful aspirations and idealised visions that Jupiter in Aquarius encourages us to boldly cultivate. We will be asked to let go of that which doesn’t serve the great vision of our hearts and our evolving society. This takes courage, but Jupiter has courage, optimism and flamboyant joy in bucketloads, so we are well supported for the task. 

The number play for this moment is an arrangement of 0 1 2 3. This is an ascension pattern, the numerical code for natural progression from divine genius (0), through new stages and initiation (1) into reconciliation of the apparently opposing forces and learning how to be wise partners to ourselves and each other (2) and the consequent manifestation of creative vision, joy and conscious community (3). 

The numbers are speaking to our souls. The human race is one race, one soul tribe with numerous distinct ancestral lines and an astonishing wealth of cultural diversity. This wealth can become communal nourishment, providing much needed answers as we continue to open our hearts, practice discernment, and balance belief in human potential with respect for nature’s enduring wisdom. The reboot into Aquarius is the cosmic encouragement we need to continue with our quest to unite each other without attempting to control each other, and to embrace the personal responsibility necessary for us to experience collective freedom. 

There is a lot of excitement in spiritual communities about this day. Talk is flowing of all sorts of things that are going to happen. As always I encourage you to listen to your heart and ground yourself. Remember that Earth is an Enlightened Being. She knows what she needs and how to accomplish it. Our job is not to direct her but to listen to her and learn from her. 

On this sacred convergence, may our hearts be present and open to the Source of love, in whatever way that manifests authentically for each one of us, and allow ourselves to receive. This is not the moment to direct, but rather to surrender and align with the greater energetic movements of our planetary guardians. It is the moment to become penetrable, receptive and allow the cosmic teachers to impress their wisdom deep into the soul. The divine seedling that has long ago been planted in your heart will be fertilised accordingly, and the sweetest fruit that shall be born from this moment can then truly nourish generations of our human family to come.Magick is everything, right? 

I am magick. You are magick. The universe. I am god. You are too. Ideas. Advertisements. Money. Governments. Music. Dancing. Art of any kind. Machines. Feelings. Thoughts.

#What is Magick?

Magick is a hard thing to pin down, and there are many conflicting (and harmonious) voices out there telling us exactly what is and isn’t Magick. This is not the place for this, as Magick’s true meaning must be discovered for oneself through first-hand experience. Due to this, the Moderators have created a [[“What Is Magick?”]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/lwg8wd/what_is_magick/) thread that all users may weigh in on. 

---

#What is /r/Magick?

Now that’s a question we *can* answer. 

**/r/Magick is a community for sincere practitioners to discuss and further develop their own Magickal practice as well as nurture the overall current of Magick.**

The above bolded statement is the goal the mod team will be working towards, and so is where our rule set is derived from. The mod team will not be acting as Magickal authorities, but as a team to serve the community, aiming to reach the above goal.

#Rules

***The Moderators endeavour to uphold these rules through moderation, but it is a group effort to create and sustain a healthy community.***

###1. Play Nice

####”Hostility is always unwarranted and will not be tolerated. This is a discussion sub, don't forget that you're talking to a human. Attack the argument, not the person.”

Magickal communities tend to attract a wide array of people. The demographic is surprisingly mixed, which opens up a lot of room for friction. Friction is good. Fire is bad. 

In this community we do our best to prevent small disagreements, debates and differences from becoming full-blown arguments or attacks. 

**You can help uphold this rule by *Reporting* aggressive behaviour, and ignoring personal attacks and childish arguments.**

###2. No Gatekeeping The Validity Of Magick

####”Respect that others may have different beliefs and viewpoints. Discuss the differences in your approach, but do not deny the Magick of another person.”

As the community is such a melting pot, we must remember that what works for One may not work for All. Magick is an incredibly personal practice, and so while we encourage you to help one another improve, it is no one’s place to act as an absolute authority on Magick. We are, all of us, students. Students may share notes, however.

Instead, frame your help as a suggestion rather than a, and do not get upset if they choose to disagree. 

**You can help uphold this rule by *Reporting* the gatekeepers, and ignoring their attempts.**

###3. Let’s Stay On Topic

####”All posts to this community are intended to help ourselves and one another develop our Magickal skill and knowledge. Art, blogs, services, videos and other servers may only be shared in the [[Relevant Thread]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/mbs8rg/art_pics_promos_thread/?).”

The above rule can sometimes seem stifling, but is important to ensure this community remains what it is. We are trying to stand as a focus for the discipline, practice and dedication of Magick, rather than simple Magick appreciation. 

This rule exists to prevent low-effort posts, non-context images/videos and exploitative advertisements (spam). We are a discussion community, and you are expected to engage in discussions you start.

**You can help uphold this rule by *Reporting* off-topic posts and ignoring them.**

###4. Do Some Damn Work

####”Magick requires a high level of personal commitment, engagement and effort. Low-effort posts will be removed. This includes spell-begging, interpretation/identification posts, beginner questions, book recommendations etc. Keep these in the [[Relevant Thread]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/mbs9yd/beginner_questions/?).”

We welcome community questions here at /r/Magick, it’s essentially what fuels this community. However, some questions might be better suited elsewhere. At the bottom of this post is a list of subreddits that might better answer your beginner questions.

Instead, we expect the user to have performed an adequate amount of research into a topic before posting. If your answer can be found on the first page of Google, your post will be removed. 

We welcome beginners, but the first lesson many of us learn on the Magickal path is that you have to Do It Yourself. There are Questions From Beginners and there are Beginner Questions. We welcome the former but would rather you use Google for the latter.

**You can help uphold this rule by *Reporting* beginner questions instead of answering them.**

The moderator team, as well as the community at large, would like to thank you for taking the time to read this post. We hope it has been enlightening. Simply by reading this and following the rules you have already contributed to making this a better community.

Enjoy your stay.So I’ve wanted to share my journey for a while, being apart of the occult and in such an eccentric job has given me some amazing experiences. I realized magick was real at a young age. I’m talking like 12, I would be doing rituals and cleansing. It’s odd how something so foreign to everyone around me was so real to me. I didn’t grow up in a perfect home, I was in the foster system until my dad found me. But the one thing I always took with me was my magick. Then I didn’t know this, but my spirit guides were more hands on than most. And I am for ever grateful to them for that. 

   In Highschool I began cooking in a professional fine dining kitchen(Some say al la carte but what I did wasn’t this) as a pastry chef apprentice. Designing plated desserts and making real life magick happen. When most people hear kitchen witch they think Green Witch, or someone who uses tones of herbs. Although I do use the occasional Eye of Newt, and toe of frogs. (Which are real herbs and not poor animals mutilated for a witchy pleasure) I try to keep my platings simple. 

When it comes to spells to the muggle they look like recipes to the trained which they are amazing. Ever dish I make is a spell, and in order to get the dish and spell right it takes “restless days and hours of trial and error.” Is what the average Joe would say. To me it feels like minutes. Growing up what I heard about the culinary industry wasn’t kind. Tons of hours, low pay, Mean chefs. Although all of that can be true I went into the culinary industry to make magick not get lots of money, or Live a luxurious life. Because I knew if I truly wanted it I could make it happen. 

I’m not going to make this too long because I’m not sure if anyone will read it. But the last thing I will say is about my Spells.(Every time I say spells I will be referring to my dishes just a heads up.) My spells have changed lives. I never use my magic for evil ever dish I make I fuel with good intentions and when it goes out on the table, the aroma, the taste, the artistry everything is done for the guest to not only leave feeling like the world isn’t against them. But to inspire them to do good. I’ve learned that magick is very real and people take advantage of it. Often. I’ve seen it first hand. And we all see it almost every day. I have so much to share from spells, to experiences with my mistakes. I’d like to share more but it’s late. Look forward to posting again soon!

Signed,
The Professional Kitchen WitchI was told today in a spiritual group that I am essentially "entertaining darkness" because I had a jolting, freaky encounter with a dream entity AND YET want to know more about the meaning of the dream and the being... Then she said "love and light" and in that moment I understand why so many don't take the "love and light™ crowd" seriously. 
I mean... Love and light is great! I fight for the light and follow teachings of "love everyone", but I've looked into the darkness and I see the mystery of the universe there too... In my dreams I fight demons with light from my hands, and talk with all sorts of beings some of whom are QUITE unsettling. And even though I wake up in a sweat, journeys in the astral are very important to me and so fulfilling. 

I have been told multiple times when recounting plant medicine journeys "wowwww that was a baaad trip!!" And I'm the one left surprised, because even though it was tough , it is interesting and meaningful and deeply spiritual for me...

Is that the rift I've silently noticed in spiritual groups? That the typical LoveandLight™ group is afraid of the dark?? Actually AFRAID of the dark and even denying the innate meaningfulness of less-than-fluffy experiences? 

🤷🏼‍♀️👁️⚡👁️The book you're learning from is written by a person no different from you or me. Please remember noone is infallible and always question everything. Learn what works for you and always try to learn more then whats right there. Most practices have atleast a kernel of truth in then and are worth exploring. 

Tldr. Dont get too attached to one practice branch out and transform and remember stubborness and arrogance is the antithesis of magickI've been out of work over a year, the store I was worked in closed down. I finished up a certificate to get into medical administration work and have been looking for 4 months with no luck. Last month I applied for 90 jobs.

On Sunday night I did a manifestation ritual and applied for about 10 jobs. Monday I got calls for 3 interviews. I got another 2 interviews today. My normal interview rate is a out 1 in 10 but this time I got 5!

Anyway, I took my Jade and Moldavite crystals with me to my first interview and got on so well with my new boss. She was so lovely! And it's the perfect job for me. It's a small family owned GP. The doctor who owns it used to volunteer for the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Papua New Guinea. Everyone there seems so lovely and like genuinely really good people. The reason I couldn't get past the interview stage is because I can be a bit quiet and don't have much experience. Then I get an interview with a lovely woman in a friendly practice and we got on like a house on fire! She told me she'd rather have the person with the right disposition who she could mould. 

The best part is my manifestation ritual was for fast cash and I ended up with much more long term financial security. Even my sceptical housemate who mocked me for taking my crystals with me asked if he could have one of my Jade stones! I only just got the Jade and Moldavite on Friday too!

I knew it would work. The day after I did it I walked into my room to look out my window during golden hour and a feather floated down out of the sky and landed right in the middle of the path outside my window. It was surreal. I've got it in a jar, not sure what to do with it. I'm still new to all of this.https://m.imgur.com/8CQGgdz

If you all need some good energy I’ve created this talisman for protection. It invokes the help of Raphael, Uriel, Michael and Gabriel. Will be burning this one this weekend so you can all charge it with me through your phones and computers. If there’s one thing I love about technology is we can all share our energies together no matter how far. 

Lots of love.

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1-q21CiRTOAb9Xn03yLM8mZayK6gDYIhyGreetings. Several years ago, I along with some friends (Aaron Leitch, Jake Stratton-Kent, Frater Rufus Opus, and many others) contributed to a list we thought would be a great resource for studying Magic & Sorcery with academic elements listed prior to the 1800's new age movement. Here you will find a lot of useful information and realize this list is NOT complete because since the time we created this list, more academic material has emerged on the market. Also realize these books are not often found free on the Net in pdf form so you will have to do like the rest of us had to do which is purchase them - if you want them. I got many of these books in used condition from Amazon, AbeBooks, Half-Price Books, and so forth. Getting these materials & studying them will seriously up your magical game. Enjoy!

**Books**:

1. “*The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation: Including the Demotic Spells: Texts (Volume 1)*” by Hans Dieter Betz - This is a collection of magical spells and formulas, hymns, and rituals from Greco-Roman Egypt, dating from the second century B.C. to the fifth century A.D. A must read.

2. “*Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World*” edited by John G. Gager - In the ancient Greco-Roman world, it was common practice to curse or bind an enemy or rival by writing an incantation on a tablet and dedicating it to a god or spirit. These curses or binding spells, commonly called defixiones were intended to bring other people under the power and control of those who commissioned them

3. “*Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion*” edited by Christopher A. Faraone & Dirk Obbink - This collection challenges the tendency among scholars of ancient Greece to see magical and religious ritual as mutually exclusive and to ignore "magical" practices in Greek religion. The contributors survey specific bodies of archaeological, epigraphical, and papyrological evidence for magical practices in the Greek world, and, in each case, determine whether the traditional dichotomy between magic and religion helps in any way to conceptualize the objective features of the evidence examined.

4. “*Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts*” by Georg Luck - Magic, miracles, daemonology, divination, astrology, and alchemy were the arcana mundi, the "secrets of the universe," of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In this path-breaking collection of Greek and Roman writings on magic and the occult, Georg Luck provides a comprehensive sourcebook and introduction to magic as it was practiced by witches and sorcerers, magi and astrologers, in the Greek and Roman worlds.

5. “*Greek and Roman Necromancy*” by Daniel Ogden - In classical antiquity, there was much interest in necromancy--the consultation of the dead for divination. People could seek knowledge from the dead by sleeping on tombs, visiting oracles, and attempting to reanimate corpses and skulls. Ranging over many of the lands in which Greek and Roman civilizations flourished, including Egypt, from the Greek archaic period through the late Roman empire, this book is the first comprehensive survey of the subject ever published in any language.

6. “*Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century*” by Richard Kieckhefer - Like many medieval texts for the use of magicians, this handbook is a miscellany rather than a systematic treatise. It is exceptional, however, in the scope and variety of its contents—prayers and conjurations, rituals of sympathetic magic, procedures involving astral magic, a catalogue of spirits, lengthy ceremonies for consecrating a book of magic, and other materials.

7. “*Ritual Magic*” by Elizabeth M. Butler - In this classic book (first published in 1949), Butler explores ritual magic using a wide range of texts from the pre-Christian rites of the Akkadians and Chaldeans to the Solomonic Clavicles of medieval Europe. Throughout, there is extensive quotation from the documents themselves, providing the reader with an authentic sense of the richness and power of these texts.

8. “*Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic*” edited by Claire Fanger - Included are chapters by Richard Kieckhefer and Robert Mathiesen on the Sworn Book of Honorius, Michael Camille on the Ars Notoria, John B. Friedman on the Secretum Philosophorum, Nicholas Watson on the McMaster text, and Elizabeth Wade on Lullian divination. The work also includes Juris Lidaka's edition of the Liber de Angelis, and an overview of late medieval English ritual manuscripts by Frank Klaassen.

9. “*The Fortunes of Faust*” by Elizabeth M. Butler - Butler follows the magic tradition of the Magus—the priest-king—and its reformulation in the Christian world. In the process, the Magus was transformed into a wicked sorcerer who comes to a bad end in this world and a worse one hereafter. This conception, which gained ground in the Middle Ages, received its most categorical statement in the Faust legend.

10. “*The Goetia of Dr. Rudd*” by David Rankine & Stephen Skinner - The Goetia of Dr. Rudd explains how the 72 angels of the Shemhamphorash are used to evoke and safely bind demons—material that has not been made available in any previous edition. This rare volume contains a transcription of a hitherto unpublished manuscript of the Lemegeton and includes illustrations drawn from rare manuscripts held in the British Library.

11. “*The Complete Magician’s Tables*” by Stephen Skinner - The sources of this remarkable compilation range from classic grimoires such as the Sworn Book to modern theories of prime numbers and atomic weights. Data from Peter de Abano, Abbott Trithemium, Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, and other prominent scholars is referenced here, in addition to hidden gems found in unpublished medieval grimoires and Kabbalistic works. 

12. “*The Keys to the Gateway of Magic: Summoning the Solomonic Archangels and Demon Princes*” by Stephen Skinner & David Rankine - This classic text of the Nine Great Keys details the invocation of the Archangels, the full hierarchy of spiritual beings (including Olympic Spirits and Elementals) and the evocation of the four Demon Princes

13. “*Three Books of Occult Philosophy*” by Henry Cornelius Agrippa & edited by Donald Tyson - How magicians collect virtues from the three-fold World, is declared in these three books. Seeing there is a three-fold World, Elementary, Celestial, and Intellectual, and every inferior is governed by its superior. Indispensable.

14. “*The Complete Picatrix: The Occult Classic Of Astrological Magic Liber Atratus*” translated by John Michael Greer & Christopher Warnock - The Picatrix is the most famous grimoire of astrological magic and one of the most important works of medieval and Renaissance magic. With all four books of the Latin Picatrix complete in one volume, the Picatrix is an encyclopedic work with over 300 pages of Hermetic magical philosophy, ritual, talismanic and natural magic.

15. “*Secrets of the Magical Grimoires Revealed*” by Aaron Leitch - The magickal methods and esoteric knowledge of medieval Europe (476 to 1453 C.E.) form the ancestral backbone of modern ceremonial magick. To understand medieval magick, it’s necessary to know the primary repositories of this knowledge - the grimoires of spells, incantations, and ritual instructions for working with angels and conjuring spirits. And to understand the grimoires, you must delve into the life and times of the magicians who wrote them.

16. “*The True Grimoire*” by Jake Kent-Stratton - The True Grimoire is a major contribution to the practice and study of Goetic magic. The neglected Grimorium Verum has been restored to it's rightful place as a potent and coherent system of Goetic magic. Jake Stratton-Kent has reconstructed a working version from the corrupted Italian and French versions of this important grimoire.

17. “*Geosophia: The Argo of Magic*” by Jake Stratton-Kent - Geosophia traces the development of magic from the Greeks to the grimoires, laying bare the chthonic roots of goetic ritual. By exposing the necromantic origins of much of modern magic we are able to reconnect with the source of our ritual tradition. There is a continuity of practice in the West which encompasses the pre-Olympian cults of Dionysus and Cybele, is found in the Greek Magical Papyri and Picatrix and flows into the grimoires. 

18. "*Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power*" by Marvin W. Meyer & Richard Smith - This provocative collection of rites, spells, amulets, curses, and recipes of the early Coptic Christians documents Christianity as a living folk religion resembling other popular belief systems - something quite different from what theological and doctrinal traditions have led us to believe.

19. “*Invoking Angels: Theurgic Ideas and Practices, Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries*” edited by Claire Fanger - Bring0s together a tightly themed collection of essays on late medieval and early modern texts concerned with the role of angels in the cosmos, focusing on angelic rituals and spiritual cosmologies. Collectively, these essays tie medieval angel magic texts more clearly to medieval religion and to the better-known author-magicians of the early modern period.

20. “*The Testament of Cyprian the Mage*” by Jake Stratton-Kent - An ambitious and far-seeing work, addressing two ends of the magical spectrum: the Testament of Solomon and one version of the Iberian Book of Saint Cyprian. In doing so, key aspects of magical practice are revealed. This work draws upon these texts to create a clear understanding of the practice of grimoire magic, not as a discrete or degenerate subset of ceremonial magic, but one which is integrated with folk magic and witchcraft.

21. “*Veritable Key of Solomon*” by Stephen Skinner & David Rankine - Based on one of the best-known grimoires of the Western world, The Veritable Key of Solomon presents all aspects of this revered magical system in one impressive source.

22. “*The Magical Treatise of Solomon, or Hygromanteia*” by  Ioannis Marathakis - The true source of the Key of Solomon, it is arguably the most significant magical text in the world. For the first time ever, this extraordinary work has been translated from the original Greek into English.

23. “*Magic, Witchcraft and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman World: A Sourcebook*” by Daniel Ogden - Contains three hundred texts in new translations, along with brief but explicit commentaries. Alongside descriptions of sorcerers, witches, and ghosts in the works of ancient writers, it reproduces curse tablets, spells from ancient magical recipe books, and inscriptions from magical amulets.

24. “*Ancient Jewish Magic: A History*” by Gideon Bohak - Gives a pioneering account of the broad history of ancient Jewish magic, from the Second Temple to the rabbinic period. It is based both on ancient magicians' own compositions and products in Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek, and on the descriptions and prescriptions of non-magicians, to reconstruct a historical picture that is as balanced and nuanced as possible.

25. “*John Dee's Natural Philosophy: Between Science and Religion*” by Nicholas Clulee - Thoroughly examining Dee’s natural philosophy, this book provides a balanced evaluation of his place, and the role of the occult, in sixteenth-century intellectual history. It brings together insights from a study of Dee’s writings, the available biographical material, and his sources as reflected in his extensive library and, more importantly, numerous surviving annotated volumes from it.

26. “*Grimoires: A History of Magic Books*” by Owen Davies - Put simply, grimoires are books of spells that were first recorded in the Ancient Middle East and which have developed and spread across much of the Western Hemisphere and beyond over the ensuing millennia. At their most benign, they contain charms and remedies for natural and supernatural ailments and advice on contacting spirits to help find treasures and protect from evil. But at their most sinister they provide instructions on how to manipulate people for corrupt purposes and, worst of all, to call up and make a pact with the Devil. Both types have proven remarkably resilient and adaptable and retain much of their relevance and fascination to this day.

27. “*The Language of Demons and Angels: Cornelius Agrippa's Occult Philosophy*” by Christopher I. Lehrich - The analysis walks the reader through the text of De Occulta Philosophia, Agrippa's 1533 masterpiece, explicating the often hidden structure and argument of the work.

28. “*Thrice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis*” by G. R. S. Mead - Three Volumes bound into one. Volume contents are: Vol. 1. Prolegomena. -- Vol. 2. Sermons. -- Vol. 3. Excerpts and fragments.

29. “*The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind*” by Garth Fowden - Starting from the complex fusions and tensions that molded Graeco-Egyptian culture, and in particular Hermetism, during the centuries after Alexander, the author argues that the technical and philosophical Hermetica, apparently so different, might be seen as aspects of a single "way of Hermes".

30. “*Restless Dead: Encounters between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece*” by Sarah Illes Johnston - Topics of focus include the origin of the goes (the ritual practitioner who made interaction with the dead his specialty), the threat to the living presented by the ghosts of those who died dishonorably or prematurely, the development of Hecate into a mistress of ghosts and its connection to female rites of transition, and the complex nature of the Erinyes.

31. “*Hekate Soteira: A Study of Hekate's Roles in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature*” by Sarah Illes Johnston - Hekate is best known to classicists and historians of religion as the horrific patroness of witches. But from the Hellenistic age onward, some Greek and Roman philosophers and magicians portrayed her quite differently.

32. “*Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World*” edited by Paul Mirecki and Marvin Meyer.

33. “*Marsilio Ficino: His Theology, His Philosophy, His Legacy*” edited by V. Rees, Michael J. B. Allen & Valery Rees - This volume consists of 21 essays on Marsilio Ficino (1433-99), the great Florentine scholar, philosopher and priest who was the architect of Renaissance Platonism and whose long-lasting influence on philosophy, love and music theory, medicine and magic extended across Europe.

34. “*Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe*” edited by William R. Newman & Anthony Grafton - Shows the many ways in which astrology and alchemy diverge as well as intersect. Overall, it shows how an appreciation of the role of the occult opens up new ways of understanding the past.

35. “*Trithemius and Magical Theology: A Chapter in the Controversy over Occult Studies in Early Modern Europe*” by Noel L. Brann - This is a very useful, exciting and informative text for those interested in the philosophy and theology behind Renaissance Magic. Mentor to Agrippa, pioneer of cryptography, Trithemius is one of the most important (and well-placed in Church history) yet difficult to understand of the great Renaissance writers on magic, and this book provides a detailed but readable introduction to his views on the subject.

36. “*John Dee's Conversations with Angels*” by Deborah E. Harkness - John Dee's angel conversations have been an enigmatic facet of Elizabethan England's most famous natural philosopher's life and work. Professor Harkness contextualizes Dee's angel conversations within the natural philosophical, religious and social contexts of his time. She argues that they represent a continuing development of John Dee's earlier concerns and interests. These conversations include discussions of the natural world, the practice of natural philosophy, and the apocalypse.

37. “*John Dee's Occultism: Magical Exaltation Through Powerful Signs*” by Gyorgy E. Szonyi - Presents an analysis of Renaissance occultism and its place in the chronology of European cultural history. Culling examples of "magical thinking" from classical, medieval, and Renaissance philosophers, Szonyi revisits the body of Dee's own scientific and spiritual writings as reflective sources of traditional mysticism.

38. “*The Arch Conjuror of England: John Dee*” by Glyn Parry - Explores Dee’s vast array of political, magical, and scientific writings and finds that they cast significant new light on policy struggles in the Elizabethan court, conservative attacks on magic, and Europe's religious wars. John Dee was more than just a fringe magus, Parry shows Dee was a major figure of the Reformation and Renaissance.

39. “*The Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to Alchemical Magus*” by Antoine Favre - Drawing upon rare books and manuscripts, this highly illustrated work explores the question of where Hermes Trismegistus came from how he came to be a patron of the esoteric traditions and how the figure of Hermes has remained lively and inspiring to our own day.

40. “*Glamorous Sorcery: Magic and Literacy in the High Middle Ages*” by David Rollo - Demonstrates how closely interconnected certain types of vernacular and Latin writing were in this period. Uncovered through a series of illuminating, incisive, and often surprising close readings, these connections give us a new, more complex appraisal of the relationship between literacy, social status, and political power in a time and place in which various languages competed for cultural sovereignty-at a critical juncture in the cultural history of the West.

41. “*Unlocked Books: Manuscripts of Learned Magic in the Medieval Libraries of Central Europe*” by Benedek Láng - During the Middle Ages, the Western world translated the incredible Arabic scientific corpus and imported it into Western culture: Arabic philosophy, optics, and physics, as well as alchemy, astrology, and talismanic magic. The line between the scientific and the magical was blurred. According to popular lore, magicians of the Middle Ages were trained in the art of magic in “magician schools” located in various metropolitan areas, such as Naples, Athens, and Toledo.

42. “*The History of Magic and Experimental Science*” by Lynn Thorndike.

43. “*The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice*” by Robert K. Ritner - This study represents the first critical  examination of "magical techniques," revealing their widespread appearance and pivotal significance for all Egyptian "religious" practices from the earliest periods through the Coptic era, influencing as well the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri.

44. “*Eternal Egypt: Ancient Rituals for the Modern World*” by Richard J. Reidy - The first comprehensive collection of important temple rituals performed throughout Egypt during the time of the pharaohs. The author presents seven key rites from official temple records and ancient esoteric texts for personal or group use.

45. “*Arguing With Angels*” by Egil Asprem - Examining this magical system from its Renaissance origins to present day occultism, Egil Asprem shows how the reception of Dee’s magic is replete with struggles to construct and negotiate authoritative interpretational frameworks for doing magic. Arguing with Angels offers a novel, nuanced approach to questions about how ritual magic has survived the advent of modernity and demonstrates the ways in which modern culture has recreated magical discourse.

46. “*Dictionary of Gnosis & Western Esotericism*” by Wouter J. Hanegraaff - This is the first comprehensive reference work to cover the entire domain of “Gnosis and Western Esotericism” from the period of Late Antiquity to the present. Containing around 400 articles by over 180 international specialists, it provides critical overviews discussing the nature and historical development of all its important currents and manifestations, from Gnosticism and Hermetism to Astrology, Alchemy and Magic, from the Hermetic Tradition of the Renaissance to Rosicrucianism and Christian Theosophy, and from Freemasonry and Illuminism to 19th-century Occultism and the contemporary New Age movement.

47. “*The Alchemy of Light: Geometry and Optics in Late Renaissance Alchemical Illustration*” by Ursula Szulakowska - This study concerns the late Renaissance metaphysics of light in its adoption to a Paracelsian alchemical context by John Dee, Heinrich Khunrath, Michael Maier and Robert Fludd. he volume includes 50 illustrations from alchemical treatises of the period, the emphasis being placed on Khunrath's "Amphiteatrum Sapientiea Aeternae" (1595-1609). The study investigates these images using analytical tools drawn from semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism.

48. “*Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus*” by Gregory Shaw - A study of Iamblichus of Syria (ca. 240-325), whose teachings set the final form of pagan spirituality prior to the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Shaw focuses on the theory and practice of theurgy, the most controversial and significant aspect of Iamblichus's Platonism.

49. “*Platonic Theology, Volume 1: Books I-IV*” by Marsilio Ficino, edited by James Hankins - A visionary work and philosophical masterpiece of Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), the Florentine scholar-philosopher-magus who was largely responsible for the Renaissance revival of Plato. A student of the Neoplatonic schools of Plotinus and Proclus, Ficino was committed to reconciling Platonism with Christianity, in the hope that such a reconciliation would initiate a spiritual revival and return of the golden age. This is one of the keys to understanding the art, thought, culture, and spirituality of the Renaissance.

50. “*Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science*” by Hilary Gatti - This argument, associated with the work of Frances Yates, holds that early modern science was impregnated with and shaped by Hermetic and occult traditions, and has led scholars to view Bruno primarily as a magus.

51. “*De Umbris Idearum*” (The Collected Works of Giordano Bruno, Book 1)” by Giordano Bruno, edited by Scott Gosnell - To memorize anything, distribute vivid, emotionally stirring imagined images around a piece of familiar architecture. This is the method of loci, or memory palace method, first developed in classical antiquity.

52. "*Hermes: Guide of Souls*" by Karl Kerenyi, translated by Murray Stein - Presents an authoritative study of the great god Hermes whom the Greeks revered as the Guides of Souls as well as the complex role of Hermes in classical mythology.

53. “*Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets*” by Fritz Graf and Sarah Illes Johnston - Fascinating texts written on small gold tablets that were deposited in graves provide a unique source of information about what some Greeks and Romans believed regarding the fate that awaited them after death, and how they could influence it.  These texts, dating from the late fifth century BCE to the second century CE, have been part of the scholarly debate on ancient afterlife beliefs since the end of the nineteenth century. The tablets belonged to those who had been initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus Bacchius and relied heavily upon myths narrated in poems ascribed to the mythical singer Orpheus.

54. “*Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World*” by Matthew W. Dickie - This study is the first to assemble the evidence for the existence of sorcerors in the ancient world; it also addresses the question of their identity and social origins. The resulting investigation takes us to the underside of Greek and Roman society, into a world of wandering holy men and women, conjurors and wonder-workers, and into the lives of prostitutes, procuresses, charioteers and theatrical performers.

Copyright [www.molochsorcery.com](https://www.molochsorcery.com) All Rights ReservedI have been venturing in and out of doing magick for years.  I've done tons of half effort things that look really pretty but don't really yield a lot of success.

Well a while back (mid last year), I stopped my instagram inspired rituals (and buying all that pretty stuff) and started properly meditating + doing yoga.

Last November, I decided to venture again into some ritual type stuff. I took a cleansing bath and made a honey jar. I didn't buy anything special, I just used items I had at home. We were struggling financially and I really wanted to boost us up.

Anyways, I made the jar and meditated with it for 20 minutes before bed then fell asleep with it on my nightstand.

The next morning I buried it by my front door at sunrise.

And it has been nuts. It didn't happen immediately, but slowly things started trickling in. 

I had been looking for small part time jobs for literally a year, and then I had an opportunity pop up that literally worked perfect for my schedule and got the job. Then we got two more government stimulus checks. All of these I thought were happenstance. 

Then, we got approved to refinance our home (we had previously attempted it but were rejected.) We literally were able to pull out enough money from our loan to pay off all of our credit card debts (freeing up hundreds of dollars from monthly payments) AND our rate went down from a 4.5% to 3% so our monthly payment still went down by $125. 

Again, maybe just coincidence but then, our old mortgage lender refunded us $3000 from our old escrow account.

THEN! My boss (from my normal job) gave me a raise and gave all of his employees a $350 bonus. (He had previously promised us bonuses for Christmas, and had later changed his mind. I guess he changed it back.)

And lastly, my husband has had a truck he inherited parked in our driveway. It doesn't run and it just collects dust. We planned to at some point to get rid of it. A neighbor knocked on our door and offered us $1200 for it. We didn't even have a for sale sign on it.

I am genuinely shocked at how well this has played out. Tonight for the full moon, I'm going to spend my night meditating on gratitude.During my years of hard work trying to learn magic, I haven’t seen much progress in the results. For money spells the most I’ve received out of the blue was$1. For my manifestation work, yea things got better, but I never saw progress. My protection magic was mediocre at best, and my attraction charms saw no valuable or substantial happenstance. It was almost as if something was purposely being hidden from me and I couldn’t figure it out because I didn’t have enough information to begin my fruitless search. It was almost as if spirits of every dominion and vibration persisted to withhold this important information and keep me stuck. I’ve taken to bringing tarot cards to work because again, I need to practice my craft. I got upset while reading the cards and yelled out into the universe, 
“ what am I doing wrong!” 
And the answer hit me as loud as the big explosion that created the cosmos.
The secret to magic is emotion!
Without emotion there is no driving force to a spell, and therefore it is just empty words and meaningless symbols. 
Without emotion your spell or ritual WILL not work. 
I’ve waited too long to come across this knowledge, and now I share it with you.


Edit; as a user pointed out this should be regarded as a scientific theory and not a spiritual truth or fact. But I don’t feel like I should edit this because I said what I said for a reason. Rather this could be used as a reference for when your magic fails and you don’t know what to do next. I think this would be especially powerful with manifestation magic or moon magic? But it’s really ,I guess , up to the practitioner and what works for them.This October 31st will be a Full Hunter’s Moon! Use this full moon to honor that which has passed. The plants and the animals that gave their lives to sustain ours and our ancestors who brought us into being and shaped our world. Don’t forget to leave out a jar of water to have it absorbe the light of this moon. Use this moon water to cook old family recipes.

Figured it might stick with some people here, I know it did with me. 

Have a nice day!Contrary to popular belief, magick isnt just your hopes and dreams materializing before you at the snap of a finger. it's a slow burn. so prepare yourself for delayed manifestations, because I wasn't despite experiencing them a few times before. You may think your spells aren't working but they are they just take time, sometimes a lot of time. Lust for result may actually have something to do with it too. I sort of gave up on this particular goal of mine months ago but now it's here and I'm overwhelmed bc I got other things going on too. That's kind of the caveat or "monkey's paw" scenario they never teach you about at magic school kids. Sometimes your dreams will only come true when you don't want them anymore. So this is sort of a reminder (more to myself than anyone in particular). Keep your life open to your manifestations but also don't dwell too much on them (easier said than done amirite) 🤦I'm adding the link to my folders that contain the Golden Dawn course that some of you asked me for.

If its zipped it's most likely the same files in the folder.A small group of friends (6 of us, all vaccinated) and I have been researching for over a year and have been meeting on full moons, new moons, and holidays. During these moon meetings we normally will just cleanse, ground, and set our intentions since we are all are rather new and don’t want to jump headfirst into anything out of our experience just yet. 

Last new moon, we met as usual and we begin to close our circle. As one of us tried to extinguish our candles after our thanks, we noticed that one wouldn’t go out. Then we noticed that none of the others would either. Several of us tried but all stayed lit. We ended up speaking our intentions out loud, and expanded all of our energy upward. After 20 minutes of this we tried again and the candles were able to be put out. 

Not super exciting, but this was the first time we had an encounter in this manner. It was really encouraging and I’m looking forward to continuing my research!

Edit: Grammar 

Also I forgot to add this- as we were going outside to give offerings, we saw a deer! It was maybe 30 feet away, but it didn’t even react as we were walking and continued to eat as we left.Hello, I'm trying to take me practice more serious in 2021, but my only problem is meditation. After doing my studies on magick everyone and everything says you have to start with meditation before you master anything. My only problem with that is these two disorders I have keeping me from sitting in one place too long. If anyone has tips or knowledge on how to conquer this delimma I would really appreciate it. Thanks.Meditating this morning 1-11-21 at approximately 3am, something came to me, this light had overtaken me, and spoke to me. In short, that I needed to write this, and spread my insight into what’s happening.

I’ve been on a deeply spiritual path for the last few years, but I tended to keep getting distracted by the temptation of the physical pleasures of the material world, and therefore getting off track. A to and fro if you will. 

Something would happen in my life that would remind me of how I had gotten off my spiritual path, some powerful epiphany or spiritual realization, all of which would reaffirm my spiritual direction calling me, and I would refocus. 

I have gone through intense periods of psychedelic expansion of consciousness, utilization of meditation, lucid dream, astral projection, and reading of sacred and spiritual text. Inevitably I would fall off a bit and would again get lost in the physical world, be it females, pursuit of financial wealth, molding and shaping my physical physique for vain purposes, et cetera. 

Point being - recently there has been something different in the air, an electric charge so to speak, this overpowering energy of which I am completely immersed, saturating me. 

Recently, I have been in a state of almost mania. Totally electrified with this energy which I find myself amidst. This foreboding feeling that something is happening, something is coming, but it’s ineffable. 

I have been only sleeping 2-3 hours a night because I feel this pull, this call, no.. this NEED to further my spirituality, to developing my connection to the universe, to evolve of consciousness, my control over it, this NEED to elevate, because NOW is the time. This innate intuition that it’s now or never. That time is of the essence. 

I’ve been observing a synchronicity, of indisputable magnitude, and everything starting to fall into place. Things from years and years ago are all starting to pop back up in my life, this information I had come across, or a powerful experience I had which had was a pivotal moment in my development all start coming together, building upon one another, all coming to alignment, to fruition. 

Everything has been coming together and it’s created this state of spiritual ecstasy within me, and a focus and determination to the likes of which I’ve never known before. 

I’ve been meditating every spare moment. When not meditating, I’ve been putting into practice my reading on: 

Alchemy 
Super Consciousness 
Energy/Shadow Work
Crystallography
Numerology
Magick 
Mind Control
Infinite Perspectus
Hermeticism (GD or otherwise) 
Kybalion 
Thoth
The Bible 
The Quran 
Egyptian Book of the Dead
Tibetan Book of the Dead
The Lost Book of Enki
 Anything by Carl Jung and especially Aleister Crowley
Ad Infinitum (Got tired of writing down the infinite list of works)

But mainly, my focus is directed upon coming to that which I know that I am, in truest essence, in highest most pure form. We are at the time of elevation, of ascension. The New Earth as foretold by Jesus. 

In revelations it’s talked about as “A New Earth” , this will be the new world of evolved human beings, as we all realize this true nature and come to it, and become fully conscious and harness all of our potential. This is the Ascension, and this is what is happening right now. The dark magick that exists on the opposite side of occult study. That is the darkness. And humanity is coming to a point where the light and dark are to converge in a struggle for dominance on this planet. This is what revelations has foretold, and this is happening now. I have been claimed by the light, I am ascending. Each and every thing that has happened in my life up to this point has happened for a reason. To get to to this moment. That is what is happening to me right now, and to you. 


We all who are sensitive to things beyond this world can feel it. It’s intangible, but yet intuitively we know it, and feel it. This is the ascension as it was foretold. 


My brothers and sisters - Spend time in meditation, and begin to realize your pure consciousness, to begin honing and developing that which you are capable of:

Apportation, Astral projection, Automatic writing, Divination, Dowsing, Energy Medicine, Levitation, Mediumship, Precognition, Psychic Surgery, Psychokinesis, Psychometry, Pyrokinesis, Rddhi, Remote Viewing, Retro Cognition, & Telepathy. 

-He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here to there, and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you.” ~ Matthew 17:20 ESV

^We are capable of all things, only limited by our thoughts and beliefs. 

-Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive [them], and ye shall have [them]. ~ Mark 11:24 KJV

^Our thoughts become reality, mind shapes matter, the observer influences the observed by the focus of the consciousness. All things are possible. 



Lastly. This feeling we all are experiencing:

“The kingdom of Heaven is not coming in ways that can be observed, nor will they say ‘Look, here it is!’ Or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.”

Brothers & Sisters - embody the light in which you are ❤️

I’m feeling dramatic today so bare with me. Magic is great, and we all have our own personal reasons for practicing, but I believe we have larger roles to play in our society. Every day humanity as a whole becomes more infatuated with the mundane, and more overwhelmed by it’s emptiness. People have not only lost faith, most barely even understand the word. Even most religious people seem to have lost it. Up until recently human life and history has always been intimately connected to magic, but nearly everyone has forgotten this. Magic was in the air it was at the heart and soul of religion... of everything. To me it’s like we’ve collectively forgotten what it means to be human.

We the modern magicians are the last people who know how to read the words of our ancestors. We’re the last ones who can break the seals, the only ones who keep the fire alive, and our numbers are few. That is what I mean by keeping the faith. 

I’m not wanting to start a group of evangelical magicians, I think that’s a terrible idea. I just want to say that as long as we seek wisdom and understanding, and give it freely to those who seek it, there is still hope. You and I are links in an unbroken chain that reaches back to some of the earliest people on earth. Though the rest of the world seems indifferent to us now except in times of fear, I believe it is imperative that we carry on patiently waiting for the return of our prodigal brothers and sisters. 

Moral of the story if I can repeat myself one more time: learn as much as you can, and share it with at least one person who wants it before you die. 

We keep the faith so humanity can keep its soul.I started making this guide to walk my best friend through her first ritual and introduce her to magick, but I had so much fun making it that it became more than that. I’m sharing it with anyone who wants it. If you use it, I’d love to hear what you think and about your experiences! 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RUd2OY4ssxfrgJBC5KnqBHft4vtthH29/view?usp=sharingMatthew 17:20 is a very well known verse which I think is often misunderstood. Growing up Christian myself, I definitely heard it as if it meant the world would open up to me if I was a good enough Christian, but that’s not what it means *at all.*

As with most of his teachings, Jesus said this in an attempt to teach magic and manifestation. It was prompted when his disciples asked why they were unable to expel a demon to heal a little boy. He said to them “because your little faith.” Not their faith in God, or in him, he was talking about their faith that they would be able to do it. This is a recurring teaching with Jesus, for instance when he calmed the storm he said to the others they had little faith.

This is very much akin to the quote by Henry Ford, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right.” The verse above takes this a step further saying that the faith you need is comparable to the size of a mustard seed. You don’t need much to be able to manifest virtually anything.

So, if you’re having trouble manifesting what you want, you should ask yourself if you ever believed it would actually happen. 

Have faith, my friends.

Edit: I really liked what u/Batholith_Forge had to say so I’m copying it here.

> A mustard seed has nothing but faith. I have always read this more as a revelation about harnessing True Will: the mustard seed, once planted, will grow undeterred into a mustard plant. Ultimate faith in its ability to mustard.I love the idea and I’m fully accepting of it, but how am I supposed to know if it’s real and actual? I know in my heart it’s true but I feel like I need to get my faith and belief stronger. If you can’t tell I’m a little new here, haha, I’d just like some starter tips or maybe some practices you guys use to increase your belief!I created a sigil for a new, better job a month ago.

I have an interview on monday....and they came to me.

&#x200B;

If this isn't confirmation, then nothing will be. This is amazing.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else have success like this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the awards.....didnt expect them.......I thought this would get pushed under like most posts....weird. Thanks again.It’s come to my attention that many people have an almost religious outlook on “the powers that be” as if reality is like a genie that will grant any desire we have. This is a dangerous misunderstanding, as it removes personal responsibility in getting what a practitioner desires. We must put in some footwork if we are to get things done. 

“What would be the point if life if you got everything you wanted the moment you wanted it” -Jake the dog.When I was about 3 - 4 years old I was still wetting the bed pretty frequently. I thought my experience was normal untill something happened in my mid 20s that gave me, what I would call, an epiphany.

As a kid I would wake up in the middle of the night because I needed to relieve myself. I would stand up, walk to the toilet, sit down to pee (I was a tiny kid) and wake up in my bed. My wet bed.

This happened about once a, week for almost two years. (let's just say my parents were at their wits end haha) The other nights I simply never had to pee. When I did have to thou I'd go to the WC and wake up in my wet bed.

Now a couple of years ago I started getting into Astral projection and after month of practice and a couple of aledged psychedelic trips and an extensive dream journal I had my first full on OBE.

The feeling was... Strange. Like I've been there before. And suddenly it dawned on me. I walked to the toilet and sat down, not to pee - but to remember.

Apparently as a kid I'd just leave my body behind to go pee, not realizing it, untill I'd wake up in a wet bed.

It was so freaking obvious yet I never made the connection untill that day. The experience was so similar, something went "Ohhhhhh" in my head and I finally understood. My mom died when I was turning 5 and the dreams and bed wetting stopped right then. 

Anyway, that's enough weirdness from me for today I think.Occasionally I feel guided to notice coincidences, usually involving music, that seem to directly make fun of an observation that I am having in a playful way. I enjoy the energy, and am curious if anyone else has felt this.I don't know who you are, or where you are from. Or if I may be to late for you to find this. But I believe there are three in here that could use some answers. And I will probably get a lot if flak for this as I am an outlier in the magick community. But perhaps you are feeling like the general study of magick or religion does not capture the full scope of whats out there and possible. Perhaps a dream feeling like you were asked by something to rise to a task. Or maybe you had a dream or series of dreams you were somewhere else and there were beings there that you felt a connection with. Or maybe you just feel like it's not complete and there is more to it. Perhaps you have been having strange visions or conversations with beings beyond the physical and you are feeling like you are losing you mind because of "the voices". I'm here to say that anything is possible. And the pervebial rabbit hole is very deep indeed.Sorry if this offends anyone but I really need to say some stuff. First of all, I wish people would stop using the term “quantum physics” anytime they don’t understand something. Quantum physics is a very well fleshed out field with exact equations to solve everything and is very well understood and tested. The “energies” that we’re talking about aren’t some mysterious quantum field that exists and isn’t understood, rather quantum field theory is quite well fleshed out. The nature of angelic and demonic “energy” is not.

Secondly, I put energy in quotations because it’s important not to confuse it with energy in the scientific sense either. That energy has very specific properties that are constrained to act in certain ways. Rather, the “energy”, aka Ruach, life force, Qi, etc is quite a different substance altogether. Generally when someone says energy on a Magick forum they mean this but I just want to point out that they’re different because I’ve seen a lot of confusion.

Thirdly, dimension is frequently misused. All a dimension is is trying to describe some measurable quantity with a number. If you require 3 numbers to describe an objects shape, that’s 3 dimensions. 4 dimensions simply means you need four numbers. It does NOT mean that a dimension is an area we can’t observe where mysterious metaphysical things happen; I.e., the “fourth dimension” being the realm of angels or some nonsense like that. 

I think that’s all for now. Just please don’t use terms that have meaning in science when you don’t know their original purpose. It’s a big reason why Magick is ridiculed so often by more “rational” people.

Edit: Wow, I had no idea this post was going to blow up like that. I stand by the things I said, but I would like to clarify what I’m talking about with energy and “energy” because I think it’s unclear in the original. I have absolutely no problem with using the term in both contexts. I do it myself all the time (and I have a suspicion that energy in physics is a form of Qi just as matter is a form of energy but that’s neither here nor there). The only thing I’m warning against is using them to mean exactly the same thing, which they don’t. It’s the same word to describe two different things, as English doesn’t have words like Qi to use for spiritual energy. 

Also, if you guys want to keep using the words incorrectly go right ahead! Just don’t expect to be taken too seriously by people who know exactly what they mean.I'll be short, I few days back I posted about loosing a lot of things. One being my cat who ran away. Yesterday I was just feeling so helpless so I asked my sister and friends to do the crossroads ritual with me. 

It was weird. 4 grow adult women praying at a busy intersection at 9:30 pm. I'm 30 and I was a little embarrassed but felt I needed to give it everything I had other than the traditional search.

24 hours later this mister cat walks into my house like nothing happened. Could be a total coincidence. But it happened so close to the minute from when we did the ritual.

Just saying, thank you to the universe and also so happy I found my cat although he has lost soo much weight he is totally fine.

Thank you to this community and for anyone wondering, here's the ritual

Edit : awe thank you for the comments, someone asked for pictures so here you go. We have two black cats who are brothers so let's just say us humans are not the only ones happy he is back

https://photos.app.goo.gl/8UKe4uZatB5bHgLaAFINAL EDIT: So I checked my results on Sunday at exactly 5:55pm (and 55 seconds) - unfortunately I did not win all the 5's! There was one 5 in there though, so close enough lol. Certainly not a life-changing amount, but enough to treat myself to an early Xmas present.

I appreciate everyone's energy and input - I will be purchasing more tickets in the future, so it's not over yet - I'm sure all the focusing on 5's will have a positive effect on future results, so thank you all! 

I will update if I ever hit that number or close to it. More work to do, so it would seem!

I've just received notification that I've won the lottery, unfortunately these notifications can be for as little as £2 up to the jackpot - sometimes as much as £175 million.

At the moment, I haven't logged into my account to check, so I thought I'd try this experiment.

I'm a firm believer that until you've actually witnessed an event or outcome - that outcome could be anything you choose it to be (if you have enough belief and intent). Reality isn't set in stone, until you've revealed the outcome and made it real.

I guess (from my limited understanding) this is a bit like Schrödinger's cat - where the cat is either alive or dead, and it isn't one or the other until you open the box.

So currently, I'm either a millionaire or I have a few extra pennies - this is where you come in.

I'm going to try with something conservative, let's say £555,555 - I already have a sigil and other rituals performed that ask for this exact amount, performed over the last few months.

If you're interested in helping me achieve this outcome - please (in whatever way you're comfortable with) - send me positive energy for the amount £555,555 (five hundred and fifty five thousand, five hundred and fifty five pounds) - I'll be interested to see if it has any effect on the result.

Thank you in advance if you agree to participate. Leave a comment if you do.

I will update here on Saturday evening to give a chance of people adding to the energy.

EDIT - Thank you so much for all the well wishes, positive energy, comments and awards - they are all very much appreciated.

I have yet to check my numbers - I am riding this wave of energy first. I am doing one final ritual tonight (Saturday) and will check my win on Sunday evening.

Also, not sure if related, but I have woken up today with the most excruciating pain in my right trap muscle (upper back, near shoulder) - I'm actually finding it difficult to move my head right now - certainly not a positive experience, but an interesting side effect maybe?“Aleister Crowley is the Sigmund Freud of esotericism. Just as every psychologist for the last century has been dedicated to finding better answers than Freud’s, so to with high magicians and Crowley.”

🤟🏻💛🔥👁🤟🏻I just found out Tomorrow will be a super blood moon, and wanted to know what kind of stuff you guys might do, and what kind of rituals is usually done in this type of dates.

I've been wanting to not be an armchair magician anymore and I think tomorrow would be perfect for me to start.

Also, if this is not the right place for this post, please direct me to it. The "begginer post" pinned to the top doesn't tell where to go with begginer stuff.I had a really hard time for several years with my life. The usual stuff. Family breakup, death, money,suicide (that didn’t work clearly). I really felt so angry and unforgiving with the whole Shabang. Never thought I could escape the dread of waking up to the feelings everyday. It were a proper shit storm in my mind. I started looking into magick. Damien Echols and Aleister Crowley. Started practicing lbrp every day. Along with the kabalistic cross obviously and that LVX divine light thing. I don’t know what happened. I just stopped feeling. All the hate and everything left me. Then I somehow ended up watching eckhart tolle and realised I had awakened. Now I just feel peace all the time. Amazing. I stopped magick tho. I realised it was not my will. God knows what my will is tho. Maybe just to bring presence into the world. For me kids and ex girlfriend. I really hated her and now it’s just completely healthy. So anyway. If any of you are on Damiens patreon can you thank him for me? Peace!!!Magick did me. I did not do magick. I did not think: lets do magick. A year ago I felt stuck in my spiritual practices. So I prayed, sent a request you might say to the Universe. And soon after I came across this youtube video of Wim Hof and his breathing technique. I did the technique and went straight into a meditation. And the first word I heard whisper in my ear was "MAGICK!" I saw two worlds: mine and ancient Egypt. It was as if I was watching through a window to Egypt. I saw structures and was "told" that there was no seperation through time (does not exist) and that I was gonna learn stuff. I came out of the meditation like 'wait what?!'. How?? Where do I start? The NEXT morning an audiobook of Israel Regardie The Art Of True Healing (middle pillar) showed on my youtube feed. Didnt even know who he was but I knew I HAD to listen. And this JOY overcame me. Flood every cell of my body. From there on thus my path began. And there is this force, that had been guiding me to books, people, beautiful experiences and...Reddit 😉 and it has never been wrong. I am starting to trust this soft force more and more, relaxing into it. Wether its my HGA or Source...it always has one thing in mind and thats finding my greatest joy in life while doing The Great Work. And it is this joy that is my pledge to Magick. Just wanted to share.💗Forever I've dreamed of people I've never meet and I talk to a friend about it but they said that it doesn't happen and you dream only about people you have met before but the people I dream about always have something that stands out from say your average person. Once I dreamed about this guy who was 17 or 16 who was wheelchair bound but where I live it's not common to see someone that young wheelchair bound all the time and then recently I had a dream about this girl with pale skin and red hair who had uncommon facial features kinda fairy like and all the people in that dream including my family in the dream were people I've never meet before. 
Does anyone know what this means?We all have access to so much magical information now a days. I would like to make a case that there is magic in the learning process, and your magic gets stronger when you study.

I have learned that even though you can easily find answers online, that there is a magical step involved when you study. 

Magic is, at least in part, connected to your mind. When you study any system of magic your understanding of the world changes and unlocks magical potential inside you. 

A lot of beginner witches don't know where to begin. The occult world is HUGE. It doesn't matter. Find one small thing that interests you and start to explore it. The process of exploration opens up magic for you. Don't jump to the end. 

Lets take candle magic and color associations. If you start exploring color associations you are building associations in your mind. Lets say want to get a job. Do you use green, brown, red candle. Learn about the colors and what they mean in general. There will be a lot of conflict around what colors to use. Learn (from the internet if you want) what the occult says. This is filling your brain with knowledge. Then start to use that knowledge with intuition and explore your job situation for yourself. Are you stuck and lack energy, or is it the lack of opportunities that prevents you from getting a job, are you shy? As you explore these concepts they work their way inside you and become your own. Then when you pick your candle color and do your spell there is so much more meaning and power behind it. That little bit of extra work makes the spell so powerful. 

Another example. Planetary magic is complex, so it Tree of Life, or Spirit Summoning. There are a lot of books or things on the internet. Yet again I found the process of discovery as part of the spell. Doing the math or exploring the charts, or opening to the spirits starts to change how you see the world, and the process of discovery changes your mind. 

So whatever you do, make sure there is a little bit of hard work and discovery for you. It will make your magic stronger. Also don't feel like you have to master the system and learn everything, the struggle and revelation opens up your mind and aligns you with the universe. I believe, that in part, is why the occult will always be hidden. Because the discovery is magical. 

Does that make sense. What do other occult practitioners and witches think?Hi I do not know anything about magick and am wondering if someone can give me some help or point me in the right direction. 10 years ago I was 16 and stupid and horny and lonely. I was interested in entering into altered states and having sexual interactions with astral beings. So I read something on the internet, and I did what it said. I wrote a note to Lilith asking for a succubus and did a little ritual and burned the note.

Fast forward 10 years and I am recovering from an addiction to substances and sex/pornogrophy. I went completely insane and was obsessed with getting high and completely focusing on sex/porn for days and days without rest and I did that for 10 years. It is embarrassing and disgusting but that is what happened. This has COMPLETELY drained me of my essence, I feel I am a shell or who I was. Almost like I was attacked and drained by a succubus. What a coincidence. I am sober now and I feel my life essence regenerate when I practice abstinence but I still feel completely drained regardless of being the healthiest I have ever been and living a hyper-active healthy lifestyle for the past two years in an attempt to recover.

I never gave much thought to what I did back then with the note to Lilith, but recently I smoked DMT and had an insane trip which got very dark at one point and I remembered what I did and realized it was real and how serious I fucked up and how completely fucked I was because of it. I usually believe these beings are just parts of my own consciousness but In reality I do not know anything. I am asking for any guidance on what I could do, some sort of ritual to break the contract I made. I would deeply appreciate any guidance anyone could give me.ESV 
Revelation 22:15 - Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

I’m not a Christian, however this strikes me as interesting. Let me know what you think.

Note: If you are to respond or reply to another person please keep an open mind and positive communication.Integrity is one ingredient in magick that a lot of people miss. Think of it like a carpenter uses the term: something that is solid and won't fall down, like a solid building or good furniture. 

Integrity is like a stool with 3 legs. If all the legs don't match, the stool will not be safe to sit on. In magick, those 3 legs are your beliefs, your actions, and what you say to people.

Thoughts, words, and deeds. If you believe something, but act in an opposite way, your integrity is off. If you believe you are honest, and then you wind up lying about something, you can feel that break in your integrity. It's an emotional hit. It might even keep you up at night.

Most people can live with a break in their integrity. They make promises they don't keep. They bitch about people behind their back. They believe they are kind, but then act mean. They can get away with acting this way because they don't do magick.

If you practice magick, and your integrity is broken, your spells will not manifest correctly because your aim will be off. Like trying to throw a ball while standing on a skateboard, the backlash from your spell-work will knock you off your balance. When you can stand on your beliefs and speak the truth, you're on solid ground everywhere you go. You can throw whatever and not lose balance. It doesn't even matter what those beliefs are, as long as you are consistently standing on them. 

If you cast a spell but you don't believe it will work, you've thrown yourself a curve ball. If you try to invoke a deity, but your heart isn't in it, it won't manifest correctly, if at all. If you talk about someone behind their back, your magick will land in such a way to reveal you as a betrayer. Magick without integrity is kinda painful and icky.

If your spell-work is going funky, check your integrity and make sure your beliefs, your statements, and your actions don't contradict each other. You'll find that when you do have integrity, everything gets easier.My recent readings have really opened up my eyes to new ways of looking at magick and how to go about it. The thing about magick is, as ive found much later in my journey unfortunately is that its easier and less disastrous when you enchant yourself instead of events or other people. 

Jason Miller talks about the Rhizome Effect of magick that makes it flow into unexpected areas of your life and create unwanted changes when it cant find a suitable event to influence, so it messes up other things just to achieve the results of the spell. 

An easy work around is to enchant/enhance/suppress your own inherent qualities so that the magic can work psychologically instead of physically. Take a good luck spell for instance, ive been casting good luck spells all my life with mediocre to laughable results since my life wasnt enchantable for that much luck. 

Until recently i discovered that LUCK itself is an umbrella term encompassing several things and not just synchronicity (remember influencing an event has a lower probability of success). 

So instead of enchanting for general luck, enchant for specific qualities in yourself that would increase your chances of being lucky: promoting your **powers of persuasion,** enhancing your **psychic intuition**, boosting your **self-confidence and charisma**, and dont forget, probably the most important part of luck is danger avoidance, or **danger sense**, which would fall under a different facet of psychic intuition. 

Have fun in your spellcasting. :DEver since I was around 12 I would have moment where I would feel Intense dejavu idk why but I didn’t really think about it until I notice I had actually seen those moment in my dreams at an earlier date. They have gotten more recent now (around 5 years later) and I’ve just gotten to the point where I can recognize it’s a moment before it happens and I can sometimes tell people the exact words their about to say. 
  I don’t know what this is, I like it, but so far it hasn’t been useful bc the moment are at random and never important. I’ve made this post to ask if anyone knows about if this is some sort of sign from a god or something else. And if someone else is like this any advice?

Fyi this happens like 2-3 times a weekJust curious why I never see anything about summoning angels. I'd love to hear answers from any and all magick disciplines. 

Many  things have been said on aspects of magic, the paranormal, the  supernatural, the soul. Many things have been said on these subjects  indeed, and most of those things said include words such as “hogwash”,  “hullabaloo”, “smoke-and-mirrors”, “fraudulent”, and “bullshit”; these  select words have been said by both the common layman as well as his  academic counterpart, men of science, reason, intelligence, all of them  look upon ideas of magic and sorcery as bunk, fairy-tales for overly  imaginative children, to be given absolutely zero consideration,  recommendation, or investigation.

Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you today that *this*  is bunk. This attitude is hogwash. This scoffing is hullabaloo. This  hand waving is smoke-and-mirrors. This judgement is fraudulent. This  assertion by so called men of science and reason that these aspects of  reality cannot possibly exist is utter bullshit; and today I shall prove  it to you.

Though, you must accept two caveats from the get-go.

1:  Forgive me, for I myself am not a powerful enough sorcerer to throw  your room into a sty to prove telekinesis, nor tell you what you are  thinking eleven times out of ten.

And 2: Fret not, for I can teach sorcery to you, and let you be the judge of your own ability.

First  and foremost, to practice magic you must believe in magic. The skeptic  may scoff, again, finding it silly that something must be believed in to  be effective, but I would remind that skeptic that to achieve the  greatest feats in skill, athleticism, or genius, you must first believe  you can achieve them. No athlete would tell you with a straight face  that they perform well even if they don't believe they will; they  absolutely must have the right mentality for them to perform to  standard. It is no different with painters, musicians, architects, or  anyone who must chronically hit deadlines. To be successful they must  first be able to visualize their success coming to fruition, they must  believe they can do it, first and foremost, before they will be able to  do it. The Law of Attraction outlines this well, and if you do not know  what that is, the shorthand of it is as follows: The more you believe  something will happen, the more likely it is to actually happen. Not  just inside your body either, but outside, effecting the very world  around you. The idea that, if you just focus hard enough, you can  literally will things into existence, whether it is opportunities to  advance your position, resources in order to better yourself or status,  or more simple things like good luck, friendship, and love. 'The  Secret', a book by Rhonda Byrne, outlines this principle and how it  works perfectly, and while it first may seem outlandish, many famous and  exceptional people have themselves written about it, attesting to it,  and urging others to follow it; such obvious loons including: Plato,  Leonardo DaVinci, Galileo, Napoleon, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas  Edison, Einstein, and Andrew Carnegie, as well as being written about  and referenced either directly or indirectly in self-help books by Paulo  Cohelo, Charels Haneel, Wallace D. Wattles, and James Allen. All of the  aforementioned believing the Law of Attraction having, at least, a  significant impact in their success, or at most, attributing their  successes to the law almost entirely, Mr.Wattles himself being one of  the biggest advocates for it.

Even  if you phoo phoo these old timers for their nonsense and obviously  nonsensical ways, you would do well to know that most famous and  overwhelmingly successful people living today have considered themselves  apprentices to this exact line of thinking and the books written upon  it. They believed in it with the weight of their life, and in return it  gave them their life.

This  fits perfectly into the next part of my theorem: The Placebo Effect.  When most people hear of the Placebo Effect, they think of sugar pills,  fake medicine, things doctors give patients to either check if they're  faking or to send them on their way without a fuss, but this is little  more than hear-say. In truth, the Placebo Effect is one of the most  interesting and deeply looked into phenomena's in medical science.

In  simple terms, those who believe themselves well become well, and those  who believe themselves sick become sick. How does this work? If the body  can just 'make' itself well, why doesn't it? That's the mystery. But  the fact remains, it has been proven time and again that patients who  are given sugar pills or false serums and told that it will make them  well not only become healthier, but even in tests where the recipient is  *told* they are being given Placebo's, they *still* feel better; simply for the fact of having been given a pill by men in white lab coats in a pristine environment.

It's worth noting that I'm not talking purely about symptoms. These people don't just 'feel' better, they *get*  better. To quote Erik Vance, Biologist and author of “Susceptible You”,  a chronicle of his own studies on the Placebo Effect, there are  numerous cases of the Placebo Effect alone healing such illnesses as  Parkinson's, Chronic Pain, IBS, Depression, Anxiety, certain types of  Asthma, and even Auto-Immune Deficiencies. Many medicines are just as  psychological as they are physical remedies, hence why the good doctor  always tells you this won't hurt a bit, because it's been proven time  and again that if he does not, it hurts far more.

It  is even worth noting that the act of Visualizing in and of itself has  been studied with extreme scrutiny, to the point where it's been  revealed that visualizing an action has the same effect on the brain as  physically performing an action (this is something many elite and  Olympian level athletes, including Emily Cook of the U.S Ski Team,  Lyndon Rush of the Canadian Bobsled Team, Al Oerter, four time Discus  champion, Billie Jean King, Tennis star, Lindsey Vonn of the U.S Alpine  Skiers, Manchester Football Players Wayne Rooney, Jonny Wilkinson and  Andy Murray. Former Olympian Swimmer for the U.S team Micheal Phelps,  Boxer Connor McGregor, and even Muhammad Ali all attest to the power of  visualization as well. They did it nigh constantly, visualizing their  training, their strokes, their moves, and their techniques when taking  breaks from physical training. Sports Psychologists who look after these  same Olympians recommend it themselves, including Dr.Micheal Gervais of  the NFL, Nicole Detling, for the U.S team, and Britt Tajet-Foxell for  the Norwegian team).

And yes -- the Placebo Effect actually healing people HAS interfered with hundreds of studies for new medicine.

To give this yet more basis in reality, the opposite is also true; colloquially known as the “Nocebo Effect”.

Some  time ago there was a study on something called “Hypersounds” -- noises  which are too loud to consciously pick up on, but when they press on  your inner ear, they cause rapid onset of headaches and migraines. The  thing is, they don't exist... or rather, the symptoms from them does  not. Yet many who participated in the study found they actually  developed the symptoms mentioned. Just as Placebos were discovered  through drug-trials where those given fake pills actually had their  symptoms and sickness alleviated, Nocebos were discovered by people  suffering the nasty side effects that come with many medicines -- the  very medicines they didn't take. Once more, it is worth noting this  wasn't just psychological phenomena. Nocebo's actually do hurt. They  have a very real, very physical effect on the body, including  inflammation, rashes, bruises, nausea, headaches, hosts of symptoms  associated with general sickness, depression, insomnia, difficulty  breathing, withdrawal, and even addiction.

Yet  again one might scoff and try to disprove these studies by claiming  they are just cases of misattribution. Everyone can have a good (or off)  day, so when they have one whilst taking X drug (or fake drug), they  put blame on the drug. I will myself confirm that yes, this does happen,  but the Placebo Effect wouldn't be so popular or so deeply studied if  it were ALL cases of misattribution. In fact, Placebo's (and Nocebo's)  are so effective that it is estimated that upwards of 70%+ of all  recovery or degradation occurs strictly because of said phenomena. This  is not to say that medicine is largely useless, mind; only that any  medicine at all will be hard pressed to heal you if you are absolutely  convinced you will remain as sick as a dog, and likewise any sickness  will be hard pressed to keep you down if you are absolutely convinced a  good night's rest will make you chipper as a chipmunk.

To  make matters more confusing still, there are also “Placebo Blockers”.  If you are given a Placebo and told it will give you a rash, and then  secretly given real medicine which specifically reduces rashes, the  recipients had no or very minor rashes, compared to those who were not  given the Blockers. Likewise, if you were given medicine that actually  causes rashes as a side effect, and then given a placebo that mitigates  those symptoms, you would be in the same boat as the aforementioned,  having little to no symptoms despite their frequency in patients without  the Blockers.

In  either, any, and all cases, the bottom line is that it is the raw  belief that matters. The greater the conviction, the greater the  real-world effect. It doesn't even have to be just one person:  Mass-Hysteria, Mass-Psychogenic-Illness, Mass-Hypnosis, Mass-Psychosis,  and even that weird dancing plague that happened in Europe during the  14th-to-17th century are all related to Placebos, and all of them have  real, physical, bodily effects.

If seeing is believing, then here we can clearly deduce that the reverse is also true.

Which glides just perfectly into my next topic: Hallucinations.

Sufferers  of hallucinations will tell you outright that there is no fool-proof  way to tell when a hallucination is, in fact, a hallucination other than  the outlandishness of the situation, or how out of place the  hallucination might be. It is easy to know when you are hallucinating a  voice at 2 A.M when no one else is around, but there is no way to tell  when you are if you are walking through a crowded hall. It is easy to  know you are hallucinating an alien, but not so much if it is just a man  as like to any other. Indeed, those who have frequent or infrequent  hallucinations will tell you that they are not just sight and sound, but  can even be taste, smell, and touch. Hallucinations can, in fact, be  tactile, and you would be unable to tell which is which if you shook a  man's hand, so indistinguishable it would be from the regular sensation  of a handshake. Keep in mind hallucinations do not always overlap; some  are only auditory, while others are purely olfactory; yet they always *can*  overlap, and it becomes extremely distressing when it does; especially  when you learn that hallucinations can actually cause you pain. From  feeling the sensation of creepy-crawlies climbing up your back, to  suddenly feeling as if you had been pinched or pricked with needles, or  even the extremely distressing scenario of hallucinating a full blown  attack or mugging, where you can actually feel as if you've been  stabbed, though it is admittedly rare (with only a rough 20% of  hallucinations being tactile). The symptoms are similar to that of Sleep  Paralysis, wherein many sufferers report that sensations caused by the  hallucinations have a real and lasting effect on the body even after  fully waking (such as the pain of a compressed chest, being unable to  breathe, whilst hallucinating that an extremely heavy thing is on top of  you).

Phantom  Limb Pain is a similar issue, the feeling of pain and discomfort in a  limb that has been previously amputated; note: You are not feeling the  pain of the amputation, you are feeling as if the limb that is no longer  there is, itself, in pain; as if you lit a match over an open area and  your brain interpreted it as being held under your arm.

Yet  again this seems far-fetched until I remind you, dear reader, that you  yourself have likely hallucinated similar things when you dream; for  nearly all of us have had a dream that was chock full of sensations of  sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch that we could only imagine, such as  how it feels to fly, or something so beautiful it made us slack jawed.  So small are the amount of times we actually realize we are dreaming;  how strange, is it not? That no matter how surreal or fantastic  something is in comparison to our normal reality; our brain treats it as  if we walked out the door onto Jupiter for our regular Tuesday jaunt.

Always  keep this in mind: this, all of this you are experiencing right now,  none of it is purely a physical sensation. Even the pain we discussed is  a mental stimulation, not a physical one. It is your brain, not your  body, that tells you when you are hurt. Much like with dreams, I'm sure  you can recall experiences where a sudden sensation or shock causes you  acute pain for a moment before you realize you aren't actually hurt (as  it has me), or the opposite, where you feel no pain until you look and  see a wound on your body that you cannot recall receiving, and suddenly  it begins hurting (as it has me). Pain is a mental stimulation, but it  doesn't stop at the mere sensation of pain either; cases of spontaneous  combustion, spontaneous wounds appearing on the body, Stigmata (the  manifestation of religiously significant wounds on the body), and even  the simple fact of an absurd amount of people going online to talk about  wounds, whether scratches, bruises, fire, or even acidic, appearing on  the body with no idea as to how they could have gotten there, are all  recorded, yet under-researched and under-examined. While it may be true  that a good portion of these cases are faked, the mere fact that wounds  have shown up with no external cause and seemingly no underlying medical  issue, simply because you believe in it, is enough to raise a fuss.

But  this is all just conjecture, isn't it? This is all just hypothesis,  metaphysical, none of it is actually proven. So, I suppose I will have  to give actual proof, won't I.

Amou  Haji is a very interesting Iranian man. When interviewed about the way  he lived, he revealed that, as a young chap in his early 20's, he  encountered some 'emotional setbacks' which caused him to view the world  in an entirely different way than most, believing that being clean  causes sickness, and being dirty leads to health. Since then, he has  never showered, bathed, or cleaned himself in any way. He eats only  rotten meat (Entirely roadkill or the remains of any dead animal,  seemingly without any veggies at all), and drinks water only from his  rusted oil can. He's a chain smoker, alternating between smoking animal  feces from his large clay pipe, or regular cigarettes, five at a time.  He sleeps in a simple hole in the ground on the outskirts of his town (a  village called Dejgah in the southern province of Fars), reminiscent of  a grave, and for the harsh Iranian winters, wears only a metal helmet  on top of his usual, never changing, rags to keep himself warm. As  mentioned, he does all of this because he believes being dirty is what  leads to health, and while his idea seems first laughable and borderline  lunatic, you may want to give him more credit, for he has lived this  way for over 60 years. Indeed, at the time of this writing, Mr. Haji is  84 years old. You could doubt his claims that he has lived this way  since early adulthood, but looking at pictures of the bloke, it's easy  to see that if he's telling a fib, he and his village are the most  dedicated liars on the planet. Yes, his village too, for all of them  corroborate his story and agree that he has lived this way longer than  many of them have been alive.

For the record, the average lifespan for a male in Iran is 72. 72.5 if you really want to be a stickler.

Why?  What? How could this possibly be? People get sick of tetanus from a  splinter and die, and this man has been ingesting rotten, parasite  ridden food, rust from his cup, dirt in every orifice, blackening his  lungs from the constant smoking, never brushing his teeth, eating only  with his dirt caked hands, never so much as properly wiping his ass, and  he has never gotten sick.

He has never gotten sick.

Since  adopting this lifestyle, he has reported no sickness, nor has anyone in  his village called him a liar. He has all his limbs, all his fingers  and toes, he is not blind, not hard of hearing, able to outrun the grown  men who sometimes chase him to try to give him a bath, and is seemingly  perfectly sound of mind (as sound of mind as most people would regard a  man living in his condition, anyways), responding reasonably and with  lucidity to any and all interviews given to him.

Despite  this disease-ridden lifestyle, he is untouched by it. Despite  everything our mothers tell us, our doctors tell us, our teachers tell  us, our biologists tell us, every single thing revolving around health,  nutrition, and wellness, he adheres to none of it, the exact opposite of  all of it, and he has lived longer than most men and women in his  entire nation.

In  fact, he's lived longer than most men the world over. As of 2015 the  highest life expectancy on Earth for men is in Switzerland at 81.3.

I have no doubt he will live longer still.

Why.  Why is he able to live like this for so long, still so robust in his  health, you may ask. Why, dear reader, haven't you been listening? It's  because he *believes* he is  healthy. He believes his lifestyle makes him the healthiest man alive,  and so he lives as stout as if he really were. His faith and conviction  are so strong in this regard that the Placebo Effect is unstoppable,  eradicating all sickness within him and keeping him in good shape,  greater than any average man of his age. Likewise, I have no doubt that  if he actually were forced to bathe, it truly would kill him.

Yet  again, the skeptic would probably mumble something about him gaining an  immunity from so many diseases through the harsh lifestyle with which  he's lived...but wouldn't that prove my point anyways? That so many have  died from sickness so little while he, such an old man, still thrives  because he believes he will.

Are  you feeling like you're tipping on the edge of a precipice by now?  Don't worry, I'll toss you right into the abyss myself, for here we  examine physics and the defects of the human brain.

The  Double-Slit Experiment is a very famous, and relatively obscure,  example of just how strange the universe actually is. You should do  yourself a favour and delve into it on your own time, both for how  interesting it is and for the fact that you will learn far more, but to  save time I will give you the jist of it: Particles behave differently  when being observed vs. when they are left to their own devices. In the  early 20th century, an experiment was done firing particles out of a  canon to see how they interacted with the environment (specifically to  see whether they behaved as a wave, hitting all areas with lower and  higher intensity, respectively, or as solids, hitting some areas 100% of  the time while avoiding others 100% of the time. They did this by  setting up a wall with two slits in it and set it between the shooter  and the backboard). It behaved as a wave, and some folks were displeased  with this result, believing it was because the particles, all being  fired at once, were interfering with eachother's course of direction by  bouncing off one another. They repeated the experiment, but this time  firing only one particle at a time, rather than in large bursts, and the  particles behaved...as a wave. No interference, through only two slits,  it created a wave pattern, which would be similar to you throwing a  tennis ball through one of two holes in the wall and seeing the dent the  ball made off of the backboard as if it hit five separate locations at  once, none of which in the direction you threw it in. The physicists  concluded that the particles, being in super-position (that is to say,  capable of doing multiple, seemingly contradicting things, at the same  time), were actually bouncing off of themselves, thus creating the  pattern. To see how they were doing this, the physicists tried to  directly observe the experiment, only for the particles to behave, well,  as particles. Throwing a ball through one of two holes and seeing the  dent on the backboard in exactly the areas you threw it in. The very act  of observing, measuring, trying to find out which one it would go  through, collapsed the super-position, 'forcing' the particle to have to  choose which slit to go through. If this all sounds very confusing,  that's because it is. “Truth is stranger than fiction” and all that.

To  better understand Super-Position, and the collapsing of it, I would  direct you to Shrodinger's Cat: A philosophical experiment regarding  this very thing. The idea being that, if you put a cat in a box with a  vial of poison that MAY break in five minutes, and close the box, that  cat is now in super-position. It is fully capable of 'being' either  alive or dead at the same time. The idea being, until you open the box  and see for certain, the possibility of the cat being either alive or  dead is equal; it is effectively both and neither. By opening the box,  you 'collapse' the super-position, 'forcing' the universe to choose  between whether the cat is objectively living or objectively dead.  Particles, because of their obeying the laws of quantum physics rather  than our regular type, are in a state of super-position that actually  ALLOWS them to do multiple, contradictory things at once; perhaps  equatable to hearing both the cat slump over dead and the cat tramp  around meowing, still alive. The particles behave as if there were  clones of it doing other things simultaneously, even though no such  clones exist. It is only when you observe the particles that they are  unable to do this, being only one, and thus behaving as if there were  only one.

This  is a very important thing to note, for despite having to do with  quantum physics, and thus obeying a set of universal rules we, as  giants, rarely have to worry about; it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt  that the act of participating in something, even if merely by watching  it, changes the way the universe, atoms, and our reality works. “You  cannot prove there isn't a very quiet elephant just outside of your  field of vision at all times”. It proves that reality is malleable,  being able to be shaped and molded depending on how you see it, or even  if you see it, or where you are seeing it from. This is compounded on  top of issues previously touched upon, of hallucinations, dreams, and  even phantom sensations. It will be compounded further still.

The  brain is imperfect, as everyone knows, but it is still more imperfect  than anyone knows. We trust our brains absolutely, only because we have  no choice, but whether in double-blind studies, tests, tricks, or simple  party games and illusions we all so easily fall prey to, it is shown  just how easily brains can err. Memories are nigh always wrong, whether  rose tinted or altered in some way, hence why reports from eyewitnesses  to crimes are so ineffective. Memories are not only wrong but can even  be falsely implanted. People, whether due to increased stress, peer  pressure, or repeated coaxing, can begin to form vivid memories of  things that never happened so accurately that the same synapses are  shown to fire off when thinking of them as they would when recalling a  favourite childhood memory.

Your  eyes are riddled with blind spots, whether it's the dots you cannot see  and your brain just automatically fills them in for you with what it  believes ought to be there, or the fact that your eyes constantly see  your nose and just phase it out. Hallucinations are easy to induce; you  could do so by starring into a mirror in the dark with nothing but a dim  candle flame and in about 10 minutes you will see all kinds of odd and  silly things floating right behind you. The most glaring fault is the  fact that everything you see is actually upside-down. Light from above  you hits the bottom of your retina, and light from below you hits the  top, meaning that everything below you would be seen as above you and  everything above you would be seen as below you, but your brain just  corrects it for you. We've already discussed the Placebo Effect and  Hallucinations, and the implications it has on how your brain interprets  the world around you, as well as the universe itself, which depends  upon observation from this faulty brain to function.

I  tell you all this in order to prove that nothing is so concrete or real  as we imagine it to be. Indeed, it is purely out of convenience and  because we need SOME foundation to stand on that we treat the laws of  the universe as we do, rather than as the mere suggestion that they  truly are, so often breaking down and changing when you grow too big or  too small, or get too close to a black hole; when you dream, your brain  treats it as an alternate reality, but we also rely upon it to tell us  what reality is.

Knowing  all this, I have a question to ask you. Knowing that needing to believe  in something for it to work is a commonly accepted practice, knowing  how many put such faith into the Law of Attraction, knowing the Placebo  Effect causes real, measurable changes in the physical body, knowing  that visualization has the same effect on your body as the imagined  activity does, knowing that imagined hallucinations can trigger the  exact same sensations as true-to-life stimuli, knowing that the  interpretation of our reality is a mental process, and how faulty our  mental processes truly are, on top of how faulty our reality truly is,  knowing absolutely, with unshakable proof, that a firm conviction is  enough to seemingly disregard commonly held laws of biology, physics,  and nature, knowing all of this, I ask you one question.

If  I believed I held a fireball in my hands, to hear its crackling and  believe in it as I believe in the air I breathe, and you believed I held  a fireball in my hands, feeling the heat come off it as if it would  blister your skin and feeling the pain of its light searing your  retinas, and I lobbed it at you, what do you think would happen?

This  is magic, true magic, and the basis of all spell-work to follow. More  than being real as it is, with what we just discussed, it does not even *have*  to be 'real' to have any true to life effect. As a matter of fact, I  think at this point, it's rather ridiculous judging something by how  'real' it is at all, don't you think?

The old mystics wrote that with faith, one could move mountains. I don't know if they realized how correct they truly were.I’m fairly new to the practice side of things, and was an a armchair for years. Since I began seriously practicing things have been different, and I can see the changes everyday. For my LBRP I start with the Qabalistic Cross, and run through all of the movements trying my best to exercise the bit of visualization skills that I have. Today things were a bit more “there” and I could feel the archangels presence! Up until now I’ve leaned more towards trying to feel the elements in each direction, but today I added the simple knowing that I was evoking these magnificent beings, and i felt goosebumps as I felt them watching me outside of the pentagrams. Holy crap I love magick.

Dion Fortune, *Sane Occultism*Hi Everyone - I often don't see a lot about Christian magic and did a video about it.  There are some neat spells that have been recovered from late classical Egyptian in Greek and Coptic and I thought folks may be interested in that history.  If so take a look - [https://youtu.be/APQn6M3gJcY](https://youtu.be/APQn6M3gJcY)Experiencing synchronicity around this number. Tell me your experiences with this. I know what comes back to me will carry something.See title.https://m.imgur.com/uAowShm

Hello again friends, today I woke up feeling foggy, feeling like I needed a push in the right direction. This talisman is for anyone needing some clarity. 

May this talisman provide you a clear path forward on your journey, whether it be on this plane or another. May the archangels answer the call we have given, and give us a path to what it is we need. We may not know now what we need, but with their guidance shall we find it. May our eyes be open so we may see properly where it is we should go. 

Blessed be thy feet, so we make walk this path. 

Lots of love,

- *M*Had a DM this morning from someone,  who wasn't in any witchcraft subs, asking me to show them some spells. It seemed odd and not very clear. So I simply replied that I don't share spells.

I received a reply later saying that they weren't a witch but would love me to do a video of me casting a spell. This time I said that when I do spells it's personal and private and that to be fair...I wasn't a performing monkey. Then I muted them.

The second message did look as if it was copied from another post. Very strange and creepy! So be aware they maybe doing the rounds.Wall of text warning :
Near to daily I see questions on this sub about how to hex an old romantic partner who the poster has perceived as having wronged them. There’s always a plethora of comment responses telling them that this is really petty and they’re just going to wind up hurting themselves. I’m usually among those commenters. There’s also invariably the commenters who egg them on and just tell them how to hex their ex without really explaining what exactly is being done.

The best hex I ever learned was from an old witch who described the one she did to her ex husband. Being properly wronged by him, she took a cocktail of drugs, some hallucinogenic, and simply sat in an armchair. While in the armchair she visualized her ex husband decaying. The whole process. He slowly grew more pale then sickly and bloated and bugs and maggots grew from his skin. She visualized this for hours and hours. This isn’t easy to do, but I mention this particular hex because it takes out the whole evocation process of calling upon spirits to do your dirty work and it breaks the hex down to its foundation. 

It was effective, her ex husband soon had cancer, and died of his cancer some years later. 

It’s important to note however that this wasn’t just a boyfriend that cheated on her or someone who gaslit her and made her feel bad. This was a man who assaulted her children and boiled her cat alive. This was someone who truly actually deserved suffering. And despite truly and actually deserving suffering, the old witch still suffered her own consequences for the matter.

When you curse someone you are essentially making yourself into a living voodoo doll. I saw other commenters post about how even Crowley wouldn’t curse anyone because he recognized he and they were the same. What the old witch was doing was in recognition of this fact. In order to hex her ex husband, she lowered her own vibration to that of rot and decay. That’s literally the only way to properly curse a person. You must lower your own vibration to the degree which you expect the other person to suffer. Then, through your visualization of this person, you harmonize with them and also lower their own.

The reason so many commenters say you shouldn’t do this until you’re very experienced is so that you can understand the full implications. There’s no deities watching out for curses, and ready to punish you for having the gall to stray into dark magick. But by its nature you are leading yourself into dark places that you may not know how to get out of. 

Very experienced magick users are those who have already been into the abyss, tapped into the energies of hell, and navigated their way out. They understand evil beyond petty relationship squabbles. And many times they also understand that those who commit real evils are already plenty cursed to begin with, and there’s not much sense in adding to the negative vibrations. But if they do decide to go ahead and curse someone, they can be confident that they will know how to get themselves out of the hell they put themselves into.

So just to go ahead and answer everyone’s questions about whether they should curse this person or that for this reason or that, just be aware of what you’re doing. I often think people pursue curses because they feel they’re less accountable than if they, say, stabbed someone. But I’m inclined to say that it’s just a different sort of accountability. The three fold rule is meant to scare you, but if you’re clever enough you’ll realize it doesn’t make much karmaic sense. So here I am telling you what it actually is. You won’t be cursed three fold and clapped back by some vengeful goddess, but you must lower your vibration as low or lower than those you are trying to curse, and thus you will suffer as much or more. 

If, despite all this, you decide to go right on through with it, at least make sure to keep track of the experience and where your life heads from there. Going through hell is part of every magickal training. We often don’t try to self inflict it but if you’re really that inclined to cause yourself suffering, at least make use of it.Essentially title. What has made you say “Oh sh*t” due to magick?

A scary experience of mine was when I had a visualization come over me of a corrupted Angel. I was convinced it was Lucifer, but after charging the sigil and entering gnosis through sleep, the appearance of what I believe to be Lucifer was totally different than that of the corrupted Angel. Thus, posing the question who that angelic being might even be?First off let me say that Ive been lurking in this sub for a while now but I do not really believe in the sort of magik that is presented and discussed in this subreddit or any form of magik. I'm an engineer by trade so I have a logical mindset that leans towards fact based evidence in order to believe in something. I was raised atheist and I have never found myself drawn toward any sort of faith based religion/ideology either. However I do respect everyone's right to practice whatever ideology they want to believe in. I mostly follow this sub because I find it entirely interesting to see how you all practice and see the steps/ingredients in the various rituals people perform for any number of reasons. Now I'm not entirely shut off to being convinced that these practices can affect the real world. I've dabbled in meditation a little bit with the intent of projecting my mind or scrying but not with much luck or anything to really make me a believer in this sort of thing.
Ive always had a hunch that in order to really be successful in doing anything like this, you have to truly believe in what you are doing without doubt in your mind that it's real. So I thought maybe since I just don't truly believe any of this then Im essentially cutting myself off from accessing these things. 
I want to believe that magik is real but I've just never been able to be convinced by anyone or myself. Does anyone have any advice on something that I can try to convince myself?Okay - so the past few weeks have been a rough intro into 2021. I'm currently making a transition from one career path I have been doing for close to a decade, into something new. 

I'm at that "in between space" where the past no longer delivers the returns it used to and the fruits of my labor into my new career path hasn't fully manifested yet. 

I do my rituals, and cast my spells - but when you find yourself between a rock and a hard place, you're not in the position to be 'chill' - especially if you've got other people dependant on you. 

In these extreme situations, under a lot of pressure and stress, your sympathetic nervous system kicks into fight/flight/fear/fold mode and blood rushes to your extremities, reducing your critical thinking abilities. 

You become a reactive mess - emotionally. Spiritually - these situations drain you. Especially if they drag on. 

&#x200B;

These are the moments people tend to lash out, sulk, get angry, depressed. 

When anything happens that reinforces the "shitshow" that is your current reality - your mind **automatically projects a negative scenario coupled with a high-emotional charge of distress.** This is intention setting on auto-pilot and counteracts your spellwork \[in my opinion of course\]. 

I think this is partly why practicing gratitude in those moments seems to completely change the flow of things. It's weird, but hey -[that's magick for ya.](https://discord.gg/KZZf5gk)   


This is where **Getting Out Of Your Way** becomes an important exercise. A disruption of ***negative psyclic-future-projection.***

I read this passage the other day which made me think - **"Just get out of your own way, everything's in motion - just get out of your own way"**. 

This became my Mantra every time I was faced with a "***shit hitting the fan"*** *moment*. And then things simply started to happen differently. Opportunities started arising, things started shifting- trickles for now - but movement is a good sign. 

Maintaining this state of mind is the challenge, but I thought perhaps someone out there needed to just be reminded to get out of their own way.   


I'm not saying it's easy - but if you've tried everything else - why not try just getting out of the way for a bit and **let things happen**.This may be a longer post, so anyone who reads this gigantic rant, i offer my hat to you! 

First off, there has been an abundance of concern and worry over whether or not you need X tool or X offering for certain things. 

This is simply not true. 

There are a few different camps of Magick. Most prevalently, in western society, we see Ceremonial Magick taking the stage. Now, there’s nothing wrong with this whatsoever! But, i may mention that it is not the only path. It never will be. The ancestors of old, no matter whose ancestors, used whatever they had. If that. 

If we reference older systems and societies, we see that a lot practiced animism. Animism considers most, if not all things, to be imbued with a spirit. Take that how you will. A simple act of communicating with said spirit would render one practicing magick, specifically by the standards of Christianity. Some people wore animal hides to get into a trance state to communicate and transcend, some used herbs, some used wands, robes, chalices, etc. 

All of these “tools” are simply that, tools. They are not a requirement to practice Magick. I am so tired of hearing everyone talk about being stressed, worried, or concerned, about where they should buy their robe, or if the chalice is worth it. If you are a ceremonial magician, than this is all and well. My objective here is to convey a sense of openness for the newer in our flock. 

Even Chaos Magicians (i forget the name of the text, but its on chaosmatrix.org) where they speak of Astral Magick as being the highest form of Magick. Why in the hell would they say something like that? It’s simply because tools are not a absolutely necessary component of Magick. As Lon Milo Duquette has said, “It’s all in your head, you just don’t know how big your head is.” Hell, the big Lon did Goetic magick in an airplane bathroom. 

Now, in my own personal experience, i have accrued tools over the time of my practice. My rituals are not two hours long, nor are they overly intricate. I do not consider myself a Chaos Magician by any means either. I do not use tools every time, nor do i pour out wine or drops of blood into a chalice. Despite these so called “shortcomings” i have had experiences that have absolutely changed my life. To reference a highly UPG experience (Unverified personal gnosis) i was simply driving to work, and felt and saw Woden on the street of which i was traversing. No acts, no invocations, no prayers, no tools, just a mundane aspect of life where i saw Woden. (Mind you newbies, there are traditionally three models of Magick (primarily that is) Psychological, Spirit, and Energy models. 

Now, let us say that you wish to continue to practice under the school of ceremonial magick, and you have no tools. Aleister Crowley himself had mentioned, something along the lines of, “Mans crude type of ritual is more effective than anything he can study.” Clearly i paraphrased the ever living shit out of this, but in essence that’s what he spoke of. 

All in all, ceremonial magick is not the only way to practice magick, nor will it be the most effective for everyone, nor must you guide yourself along its standards.

I’m sure everyone’s had this. You read something or are watching a video, maybe just breaking down your life, and you have a sudden revelation that takes you by storm. Today I just happened to have my biggest one yet while at the movies with a group of friends watching Mortal Kombat, oddly enough. What was even worse is that all of the information I’ve simply read or half believed for 5 years all sank in all at once. Ouch, that one hurt. It’s these sudden moments of genius though that all the real magic happens. 

Let me know what y’all think. Have a nice day ✌️Hello fellow Magick practitioners, 

I have spent the past two weeks researching, reading, and learning as much as I can about magick. With that out of the way, I read through the book *Demons of Magick* by Gordon Winterfield on a whim recently. I decided to take part in a ritual outlined in the book, and ever since I finished it this evening, I have felt an innate sense of power inside my heart and I feel like I am discovering a new way to go through life. Magick is something that can yield great results, and I am amazed and awestruck at the effects it has had on me in this short time... And I can't wait to continue on my journey, as well as discovering the untapped potential magick can offer all. You guys are awesome, and I love this sub already! I just wanted to share my feelings and how I feel about this practice so far.Hello! Happy winter. May Uriel bring material blessings to all who read this. 

Let me first start by saying my intentions with this are to absorb intelligences from past magicians to learn things they know that I don’t. I don’t wanna be too elaborate with my intent past that as I’ve found magick works better when you keep your intentions vague like that.

I’ve vibrated the names of archangels before (basic LBRP stuff) but I’ve heard humans can be easier to contact. I was going to try channeling king Solomon but I may have bought into biblical symbolism too much as no documents confirm his existence. I don’t want to throw the project out the window however. I’m nervous about channeling Crowley as I’ve done that and my nose started bleeding so I took that as him wanting me to leave him alone. 

Who was a real person who was proficient in magick that may want to see me learn from beyond the stars? I’m trying to do research but it’s a bunch of Wikipedia articles with no sourcesAre there any nurses on here? If so, could you share your experience with witchcraft or any type of rituals you perform for yourself? I am not trying to spell beg here... I just wanted to discuss with other individuals. It’s rough working at a Catholic hospital and being witchy 🥲

I’ve been struggling more with the ‘rona patients (I do critical care) and feel like I’m trying to keep my soul from being crushed daily, I can also see/feel it with my coworkers too. 

Thanks ❤️Let me start this off by saying I am not judging anyone. Just a few things I have learned. As a lot of us know, our spirits are all connected to the creator of all matter. A being that created the cosmos and everything in it in order to dream life through us. That same power lies within us. What ever we imagine, believe, and feel is what we create. Religions have failed us by telling us that we must pray and ask outside beings for what we want when we must really be creating within. I know that spirits like djinn’s, angels, and demons exist. And sometimes it may be easier to ask one of them for something but we must all remember that it comes at a price. One that we might not know we’re paying. If not in this life but the next. Maybe the person you’re hexing is your future incarnation and such. Even if there was no price to be paid to these beings why would I ask something of someone when the power that I have is just as powerful if not more. All I must do is imagine, believe, feel, and create. Peace and love to you all my fellow dreamers.Now ive been an pretty avid practitioner this past half year of hermetic magic (middle pillar,cabalistic cross, lbrp, etc) And for the last month my mind has been bordering on the supernatural. Ive had very powerful manifestations coming true and even one moment of a full on psychic premonition where i saw a picture of a lady friend pop up in my head ,a very specific one where she was very lightly clothed brushing her teeth and a few hours later i get sent the EXACT PICTURE sent through snapchat! I feel my visualisations are getting clearer and even one moment where i had to pump the breaks ,stone cold sober, on a very scary astral projection. Now some background. Im also a pretty intrepid psychonaut with countless ego dissolutions and very interesting experiences good and bad but always interesting. Now obviously these things correlate and i feel like i would like to touch base with some of you who have had similar experiences to guide me onwards!
Dm or as a reply please share what you would feel be the next stepsare really just so many ways of tricking some indefinable parts of ourselves into performing magic. The universe is basically a magical structure and we are all capable of magic. The really useful theories of magic are those which explain why magic tends to work so erratically and why we have such enormous inhibitions about believing in it. making it work and recognizing that it has worked. It is as if the universe has cast a spell upon us to convince us we are not magicians. However, this spell is rather a
playful cosmic joke. The universe challenges us to shatter the illusion by leaving a few cracks in it

-CarrollHey all, I am wondering if anyone has done any celestial rituals. Feb 8 is a significant day as I am starting a new job and my roommate is starting school and there’s a peak in the centaurids meteor shower! I don’t have much information on this as I am a simple candle magick person, so if anyone has some tips/directions, I’d love to hear them!so i had a very enlightening experience, after making a pilgrimage to a spot that always yeilds wisdom. Alone on a deserted beach at night away from the city, it becomes a conversation instead of a monologue with the lake, i feel energy rushes and mild visual disturbances, it is neat.

anywayssss the next day i almost shat my pants and it was quite awkward ;)

wtf universe! how can i encompass both of those things? Seems like my biological meat sack makes a mockery of any magickal wisdom i receive? 

humans are funny yoEveryone I know who practices magick, which isn't very many, is all of the same opinion: The kind of magick I believe in is not really a thing. It's all about investing energy and having results show up at a later time. I don't deny this at all, but I don't think that's all there is. 

I just don't buy that. 

I can't explain it. I honestly just have this deeply-rooted feeling that instant magick (healers, elements, telekinetic magick, etc.) is out there and we normal people haven't figured it out. 

Am I alone here? I lost my sight and interest with magick over time simply because I felt like what I was doing wasn't *working*. I've always had this issue of wanting the best supplies and the best practice before going into something, and I've *always* had a gut feeling I've been missing something huge.

I wouldn't even know where to begin finding this magick. Those who have it or have been touched by it likely wouldn't share unless it was sought out. Not that they're greedy, but that balance is necessary and it would shake everything up if everyone knew.I cannot tell you how much this book has helped me in my practice. Its literally life changing. I've only read one other book by the author (Sorcerer's Secrets) which was kinda meh but this one. This one. Every magician needs this in their arsenal. Without giving away too many spoilers it basically teaches you how to fix common mistakes you might be doing in your magick, how to accelerate your manifestations and how to think outside the box, which is the most important skill a magician should have. Check it out you won't be disappointed.Several years ago, I had a 25 year old junk car with a cracked windshield and was saving up for a newer car. In order to avoid a ticket in the meantime, I created a talisman to make my car unnoticeable to law enforcement. It worked well - so well that I became accustomed to police driving around me as if they hadn't seen me (pulling out in front of me, for example). The day my car finally died, it was in the middle of a highway. After calling for help, I watched police drive past my broken down car and miss me altogether. As requested, here was my process.







I created a sigil from the phrase "invisible to law enforcement" using a witch's wheel. The spring equinox fell on a Wednesday that year, and it was a full moon to boot. That night during the hour of Saturn (prudence), I went to a quiet spot outside and created a circle large enough for me and my supplies; in my practice, this means with chanting, invoking the four elements, incense, and in this case, oil to make a physical demarcation. I lit candles for both Hermes (travel) and Hekate (magick), prayed and made offerings for their assistance. I burned poppy seeds (invisibility) and cinnamon stick (luck, protection) in a cauldron. I passed the talisman (a car air freshener) over the smoke of the poppy seeds and cinnamon. While chanting, I used a permanent marker and wrote on the back vertically, from top to bottom: the sigil of Mercury, my created sigil, and the rune Dagaz (dark/hidden). Afterward, I placed the talisman in my car where it would live until I didn't need it anymore. I still have it and it still smells good! Edit: I have it in a junk pile in my house, not in my car anymore.







A note: I don't work with runes, so I don't know why I used one for this talisman. I never wrote down the reason.Hi all,

Just starting on this journey, and have just attempted my first LBRP.   Forgot the words, messed up the locations of the archangels, etc., but  am working on it.  I feel like I made a first step into a larger world.

I come from a very rationalistic, "New Atheist", science-driven  background, but have undergone some pretty dramatic changes this year.   This felt like a very natural step, even if the voice of my inner  skeptic did make itself known (rather unhelpfully).

My intention with this post is somewhat magickal; that is, by putting this out into the world, I am severing my materialist past, and stepping  forward into the Universe as a more spiritual person.  Feel free to  delete/remove/whatever if it's not appropriate for this community.I have this thing where I can feel the suffering of animals.  If I see a dead animal Its like I can experience their death inside my mind. 

I was driving and I saw a coyote get hit by a Mac truck and I felt what the coyote felt.  It's very overwhelming.   I have an intense love of nature and animals but these feelings get very overwhelming in day to day life.  But I can also feel positive things when I pet my cat or encounter animals in nature.  What is this?  Why does it happen.  It happens with people as well but it's not as intense.  Has anyone else experienced this?

Does anybody have any insight or any suggested reading so I can learn more about this??  Thanks in advance.Pick a place. Any place. Here will do, but you may travel to reach it.

Stand or sit firmly where you are, centre and ground yourself.

Now, with open eyes, look around you and note every single phenomena that is asking for your attention. From the writing on a sign post, to the blue store front. From the brightly coloured flowers, to the lines on the road. From the twittering of birds, to the whistling of the kettle. Don't stop here, go further, notice more yourself.

Make a conscious note of everything that is designed (by man or nature) to get your attention.

Then ask yourself "What do ***I*** want to give my attention to?"

---

Magick is nothing without attention, and being aware of how many people, objects, animals, patterns, colours, sounds and smells are constantly screaming "Pay attention to me!" will help you navigate the world. Do not bow down to all those that demand it. 

The Magician alone chooses where his mind is directed.I'm new to magick but there's this one huge hurdle I need to work on before I can make any progress. I'm so inconsistent when it comes to sticking to commitments. I wasn't like this until about 4 years ago and now it's so bad it's like a disease.

It has made studying almost impossible. One day I have all the energy, next, I'm incapacitated in every way; nothing makes sense. One day I passionately pursue a business idea, next I have zero interest and energy. 

I may be talking with a potential date, all excited about everything. Next day, it all feels like a waste of time. "What??" The same happens with TV series and many other things. I'm sure you get the picture. 

I used to think it was just laziness but clearly, there's something bigger going on and I have to fix it before it fixes me.  

What could be the problem here and what can I possibly do about it? It has messed up literally every area of my life. 

Have you faced anything like this and how did you come out of it?So, I think many of you are probably raising your eyebrows right now, and I wouldn't blame you. Everyone comes into magic(k) with some false pretenses of what they'll find: love potions, casting fireballs, moving magical brick walls with a wand... The word 'fantasy' is ascribed to silly or untrue things for a reason, after all.

Me? I've always kept the fantastical world close to my heart. I think a lot of others on here do too. You might think Dungeons & Dragons or the world of Narnia or Middle Earth show gross exaggerations (not to mention simplifications) of what we could call the "Real World's Magic system". And you'd be right! Some writers of such stories try to display a level of authenticity to their spellcraft and wondrousness, and others just try to have fun with it. But that doesn't mean its not there.

"It" being magick. (as my younger self would say-) 

The cool kind...

My older self would tell you AND me that magick is nothing to play around with, at least not without extreme care. But that's enough rambling. \*cough\*

As it stands, it appears to me that we take a lot of our archetypes and subconscious memories from a consistent (or at least comparable) place or places, and time or times, of origin. I don't think dragons are a myth. I don't think fae folk are a myth. I don't think Atlantis is a myth. And I don't think demons or other, lesser or equally scary, creepy crawlies of the night are a myth either. 

"Humanity is a species with amnesia." I don't know if there are any other quotes that resonate with me more than that.

Excluding, maybe... "Magick is real."

That statement, I believe, is the one I came into this life to tell the world. That's not a boast, just playing with an open hand. I admire the people in circles, online and local, that share their tips and help other aspiring to come into the community - that especially being true here on r/magick I think. And while I'm not going to sit here typing this under the assumption that I know everything I need to know, I feel its time to address the next step in telling the world that magick is real.

We may not be casting fireballs, or crushing cans with our minds, or flying on broomsticks, but -and pardon my french- we're doing some pretty rad shit! We're talking with spirits and animals, we're divining fortunes, we're venturing to other worlds with our minds! We're healing energy centers, and scrying oil veins and underground rivers! We're seeing things before they happen, recalling memories from past lives, feeling the emotions of the person across from us...!

I think its clear to see once you've examined magick as you knew when you first started, and magick as we all see it now: our connection with magick is changing. I think more precisely, its getting clearer, and its beginning to take root in more people than ever before.

So lets say everything I'm saying is to be taken with even a pinch of seriousness, what does this mean? it means, I think, that magick is going to become much more palpable. I think we could start seeing some of those things we take for granted as far-strung fantasies.

I think a lot of it has been lost to time. I think those forms of magick reemerging are a matter of time. I want to make sure we're ready, careful, and responsible when they do. Because here's what I can say: I have been working toward bringing "weaker" fantasy spells back to life and I've had fluctuating-ly encouraging results. if any of what I'm saying is legitimate, and I someday crack the code, it means others can do it too. And statically, it means they probably are.

That's all very dramatic, but it needs to be said, I think. Magick is coming back whether we're ready or not. I'd rather have done my homework when it does, and in a way that I can teach others to use that homework for good things. So...

Who's ready for a discussion!*TL;DR: Grandfather was a black sorcerer, his daughters and granddaughters developped a spiritual sense but none of his sons and grandsons. How do you feel about this ?*


My mother and sister, for as long as I remember, carry a certain relationship with the unseen.

-My mother would dream about future babies to be born in her surrounding and is always correct about its sex. Also, she says she feels from time to time the presence of her desceased brother and boyfriend (my dad).

-My sister dreams about our dead relatives, she chat with them and they send her some visions. Sometime, she smells their smell or feel their hug. She's able to sense random people at certain places and make a description of them.

I learned some time ago that my grandfather was a black sorcerer, he would curse and send bad spell on people he dislikes. 
When my grandmother divorced, she would feel sick, constantly tired. She met a medium who told her what it was: magic. Shortly after she cleansed and felt better.

*after the divorce, he remarried with some woman and had a child with her, my aunt. We don't have much contact with them, but my family and my aunt like eachothers*

Recently, I was able to meet with her and we reconnected. What she told me then was chilling.

-It seems she has a history with spirits too. She described some instance of meeting with them.
Also, she discovered too his father used to curse cause some medium sensed it and told her it was probably the source of some troubles of her. She was not the target but they live together.

Now I wonder, do you think every women of his lineage having a connection with the otherworld is the result of my grandfather being a dark witch ?
If you think so, why is this the women and none of his male descendants who received this gift ?Hey everyone! I made a post a week ago about coming into contact with an entity referring to itself as Baphomet ( https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/iyg88w/working_with_baphomet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf ), and just yesterday I had another encounter with him during a visualization practice. We had a “heart to heart” so to speak, and I’d like to share the details as a form of thanks to everyone who gave me advice in the original post.

I first asked why he’d been giving me the cold shoulder lately, and he responded (much to my embarrassment) that I’m spending too much time on my phone, time I could be using to keep up with my energy work and other responsibilities, especially since he’s taking the time and energy to try and teach me something.

My next question was about his name and appearance- wether on not he was an egregor or something else entirely that’s using the form of Baphomet to speak with me. After asking this I felt something from him that was a mix of both annoyance and confusion at my question, as if I’d asked something silly or offensive. He did however answer, stating that he had taken more than one name and form throughout time. I noticed that after he had answered his form began to ripple like a reflection in water, and for a few brief moments I saw antlers, white robes, and other objects and shapes I couldn’t really make out, before going back to the form of Baphomet. 

Lastly, after apologizing to him, I asked if he would mind if I shared these answers here, which he didn’t, and told me that he would continue to teach me so long as I put in the work and stopped being an “armchair magician”

Thank you all again for your help. Hope you all have a good day, and clear skies for tomorrow’s Harvest Moon!I’ve been kicking around the idea of creating a witchy/pagan/magic app for a while. What are some functions, information, etc. that y’all would like a magic practitioner app to do for you?

Response edit: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses! I’d better get my fingers cracking! ;)Hi all,

It's been an interesting week. The seed was planted a little while ago when someone who I've talked to a fair bit about my spiritual practices somewhat jokingly suggested I might have schizophrenia. I dismissed it at first, but couldn't shake the thought of it and eventually decided to at least do some research
 Now I'm concerned.

I guess what I'm asking to all of you who feel perfectly healthy is:

- when spiritual phenomenon happens to you, how vivid is it?

- has it happened your entire life (e.g. seeing/hearing/feeling dark and light entities) 

- have you ever been possessed?

And if there is anyone on this sub with a diagnosis I'd love if you could share your experience so I can figure this thing out once and for all.

Thanks :)He came to me months ago and it was a very intense week or so, signs were everywhere all day, telepathy, vivid dreams with him every night, I finally communicated with him through tarot and even had my candle flame crackle and grow a few inches when I asked if he was Lucifer the morning star and bringer of light, then when I asked for more confirmation I noticed a shadow on my wall that looked like a man with a top hat standing in my room! The tarot reading revealed he wanted to work with me, but he wanted me to take a bit better care of myself first and so he needed me to commit to stop drinking (I’m an alcoholic) and to leave my extremely toxic relationship...which sounded great but he wanted me to agree to commit to these things that very day. And I was scared. Told him I’d think about it. The next morning I pulled a few cards and he told me that he wasn’t going to wait. I missed my opportunity. Then he was gone no more dreams signs nothing. I’ve been leaving him offerings of wine and chocolate even roses and trying to reach out to him and I’ve since quit drinking and left the relationship but he’s still not around...did he lose interest in working together, permanently? How would I attempt to reach out? Any advice anyone with experience may have would be wonderful. The week with him in my energy was amazing, and the obvious way he cared enough to want me to take better care of me...he didn’t want anything in return for working together except for me to be better to myself. I mean...he’s amazing.Somehow I made it to fifty years old and never learned how to use candles “properly”. I started using candles in my practice for meditation, had some mundane technical issues and looked it up. This addresses the problem of “tunneling” primarily, where your candle burns down the middle leaving the wick way down in the tunnel and the outer part unused.

So, we should choose the diameter of candles by how long we intend to burn them at a go. Roughly one-inch diameter for every hour of burning the candle. You want the the wax to have melted all the way to the edge before snuffing it.

I had bought 3” diameter pillar candles because I liked their stability and long life. But I rarely need to burn them for more than an hour. So now switching over to 1” straight candles.

If you already have tunneling you can try to remedy it by carving the wax down so that the wick is at the highest point and the top surface slopes down a bit to the edges. I think the bigger the diameter the more slope you need. You can save the carved off wax to make a new candle or candle-warmers (I am not totally sure what the latter is, seems like a scent dispersal dealie).

Hope this helps some others out. And if you like burning candles some other way, that is good too, lol. :)Does anyone else experience heightened psychic awareness / stronger magical energy on their period? Especially in the first few days. It seems almost unintuitive because you’d think we are losing energy around this time with the physical loss of our internal lining and minerals associated. Is this time of a menstrual cycle known for any magical properties? I haven’t heard of a tradition that speaks of it.Hello! My name is Firat, this is my first post here, for the first time I'm actually not in any need. I came here with a smile on my face, not with a need but your opinion I so value.

Guys my journey for enlightenment have finally started, I'm not awakened as of yet but I am finally realized.

I've been praying again lately, but praying with intent of helping the ones around me. Im getting veeeery intense gratitude and happiness during these meditation/prayers.

To get to this point I've took the microphone away from self doubt, resentment and fear. It got quite for a while in my head. But then something else showed up.... Ooooh gooood I have never felt this kind of... I don't even know what to call it, it's power but it's more than power.. It tells me things that are like "you have a huge heart and full of energy, stop wasting this energy crying to movies and television". It guided me through a ritual I've done last night for my friend who is addicted to heroin.

It also tells me not to look at other rituals, she says it's more powerful this way.

 I have created my altar and cleaning my body next couple of weeks. Things are getting wiiild out here and I cannot wait until the events she's telling me about plays out.

So I just wanted to say I haven't found magic, but magic sure did find me! 😊

I love you all and please don't hesitate to share your opinion. After all cooperation is the key.Folklore from my Mom...

Prior to Midnight of the New Year on Dec 31st, take any two silver colored coins and place them outside just over the threshold onto your doorstep. Then anytime “after” Midnight Jan 1st in the New Year, bring the two silver colored coins inside your home. This symbolizes money coming into your home year round.

Note the coins do not have to be the same denomination so you can use a dime and a quarter or dime and a nickel or two nickels but I tend to use two quarters simply because they are easier to see and pick up out of the snow. You can also use foreign coins if they are silver and understand the coins of any denomination or minting do not have to be pure silver just silver coated.

I have been doing this spell every year for two decades now. Enjoy!   8o)

Happy New Year!Shadow Work is one of those concepts that can be kind of tricky to fully understand. The premise seemed relatively simple to me at first, but I remember first hearing about it and being like “... wait, so what do I do?” 
I’m trying to help anyone who might be in that position, so this is a bit more beginner-based but hopefully there’s something for everyone. I think understanding WHY shadow work is so important is a giant step towards why we should be doing it. 
Anywaysssss, I thought some of the wonderful people here might enjoy. ❤️

https://youtu.be/kp7NIjOUUw4Am I the only one who's getting some major vibes at the moment? 
I can feel something.
I'm not entirely sure what.
But something big is coming.
Can anyone relate or share?
I'd love to work this one out.This Archangel of Tuesday has a recieved a pretty bad reputation. The more and more I study this Angel the more I think his name is actually perfect for what he does.

Mars is associated with festering anger, abuse, revenge, long standing hatreds. Inability to express anger in healthy manner.  

Aren't holding on to these things poisonous?

I believe that Archangel Samael has the ability to transmute all the poison inside of you into something positive. Mars is not just for cursing but for moving on in a courageous and healthy manner.


For the people who have really been screwed over I would ask for justice in the most righteous sense. Who knows you might get it.Hello! I'm a seventh generation practitioner, who has been generally disappointed in established covens and fraternal orders. I'm sure there are great groups out there, but most have suffered distortion, and seem to simply serve the ego of its members. I've decided to start my own, and create a system based on universal correspondences that are plain to see. This will allow for the use of knowledge from many different groups and cultures without requiring the use of their cultural symbolism and ideology, and keeps your practice true to yourself, while also being able to work as a group. Thoughts? Holes in my plan? Happy to hear!Delete if not allowed, but does anyone do any magick with pot? I am asking because Im a bit of a stoner witch and would like to know if theres any magick i can do with pot?Hey everyone! Any plans for the full moon? I've been making monthly rituals for the full moons this year. What do you like to do?I think I was tricked into believing a bunch of "witchtok" bs many many years ago, before tiktok ever existed. My cousin and her friends all had "coexist" stickers on their cars, and spent hundreds of dollars for a bunch of stones, herbs, candles, they paid for the "witchy aesthetic" basically. Then the stuff they bought would sit there unused. I fell into this because I wanted to fit in as an 18 year old.

 Can anyone point me in the right direction? I want to practice a Craft that has roots, not just women that think being a witch is a cool thing to do, and that crystals are pretty. Which yes, they are. But I want to truly interact more with spirit and universe and build my practice from an understanding of what is real, true Magick, true Craft, and build knowledge and a relationship with it all. 

Thanks all!

Edit: I also thought it right to point out that I don't mean to judge ANYONE for beliefs! I, myself use candle Magick and herbs and crystals as well and I think it's very suitable for some people on their journey!I am an amateur tarot reader, generally doing readings for myself and family for practice. I know NOTHING about the fae and they generally have no part in my life. A little over a month ago I got the Sacred Self Care Oracle deck. Since the moment I opened this deck the card "search for fairies" has been popping out left and right. A week ago I did a personal reading and decided to use my boyfriend's Adorabyssal Oracle deck for a simple clarification card, and I barely shuffled when a FAERIE card flew into my lap. I completely forgot there was a faerie card in the deck! I've had other random experiences like seeing a back "gnat" flying around every so often out of the corner of my eye (it doesn't stay around like a sunspot either) and one of my portraits unexplainably fell off my wall last week? I watched it randomly drop off the hook. It was a little spooky lol  

Honestly I'm a bit afraid to make contact with them. I am very naive when it comes to their customs and culture. I'm afraid I will become in debt to them by sheer forgetfulness or lack of awareness. The last thing I want to do is upset this fae. How do I safely communicate with them?Hi I’m new here I’ve never even commented here before but I do enjoy reading different people’s experiences and their practices. A year ago or so I had what people would call a breakthrough experience, walking through the door or crossing the abyss. It’s really a experience that’s impossible to describe with words because it’s beyond our 5 senses.

After that experience I’ve had absolutely crazy synchronicities which our personal to me but so strong as to be unable to deny that what I saw when I broke through is absolute truth. To me it was like little reminders of what the truth of reality really is. 

So after that had been going on for awhile I felt the need to try to talk back in a official way. So I decided to conduct a ceremony I guess you could call it with just me and my wife. I didn’t follow any other ceremony that I read about I decided to come up with my own that just came to me. 

I went out and got a box, glass jars, wooden snakes, and gold wire. We painted the box ourselves along with the snakes. Then we both got a egg and carried it around with us for a few days. Every time we had a bad thought we visualized that bad energy going in the egg while seeing positive energy flow into us. After we did that we put the eggs in the glass jars and filled it with salt then closed the lids and wrapped it with gold wire. We put our snakes in to box to guard against the negative energy then closed the box everything was in and wrote a personal sigil which represents what we wanted to accomplish then wrapped the box in gold wire.

We went out into the woods and made a salt circle then made out intentions clear by saying them out loud. After that we left it there and went home. 3 weeks after that which was yesterday my wife just got a new job which pays way more then what she was making. Think 50% more. 

It feels to me that this ceremony I felt to do was very successful. We plan to go back to the woods and leave something to show our thanks. Sorry this is so long but I felt I should share.I developed this in the beginning of my practice, and it is my go to meditation ever sense. Must be done the first hour of each day. So a little discipline required to do it my way. However this really should just inspire you to find a way that works for you.

So you do all your breathing, inner awareness, centering universally and you then you start by focusing on the planet ruling the day,  planet's symbol. For example Tuesday the first hour of mars at sunrise the symbol for mars should be a rich red color. Hold it for 5 minutes. focus on IAO the three letters and once it is firm in your visual mind (usually takes about 5 minutes to burn it in lol)  you will turn east, the actual east not magical east. turn slowly to remain meditative. Or do it standing or however you prefer, there is really no wrong way to meditate except not meditating at all. You will envision IAO but this time with an incense censor below it with the smoke rising to form the letters IAO. Envision for 5 minutes. Then you will slowly turn to the south, and you will again see IAO but this time made of a fire. 5 minutes then turn to the west. Now You could use the raging white water rapids of something like a creek or river but I find that just envisioning crystal clear water with slight drops hitting the surface inside the letters IAO works best for me especially to promote a peaceful emotional state as water can make emotions heavy for the day. Lastly earth you will Envision the same letters but this time they are dirt with seedlings sprouting and if you want to attract wealth maybe some diamonds and gold nuggets coming out the dirt, get creative. Then you will see yourself in the front view from the outside maybe like 3 feet IN front of yourself with the letters IAO on your 8th chakra. The 8th is top of the auric field above the crown radiating in this unbelievable bright white divine light that is entering you from8th chakra into the crown all the way down to the base, kind of like the pillar. I am telling you, nothing has done me better than this in terms of protection and overall blessing. Maybe it will work for one of you!I’m still learning the correspondence/mapping of the heavens with terrestrial energies, but something here in Alaska is really influencing people including myself. I even lost patience to the point of punching a guy just for not listening 🤦 I won’t blame that on anything but myself but still that hasn’t happened since I was a boy. at the same time there has been a lot of positive change and growth in my life and the community as if the path forward has become much more clear. Not looking for debate Just thoughts and comments pleaseI've seen a couple posts and comments between here and other witchy subreddits about the negative connotations that come with the term Baby Witch. They argue that the term is self detrimental, infantizing, dismissive of one's own power. They are valid points in their own right, but I would like to make a counterpoint. I'm not a baby witch, but I am a mother. 

I have spent the last three years watching my son observe, look, and listen. 

I've watched him learn, grow, and absorb the world around him like a sponge. 

I've watched him discover, play, and love.

I've seen him go from babbling to forming words to asking questions to singing at the top of his lungs. 

I've seen him go from stacking one block on top of another to building castles and train sets and blanket forts. 

When he turned three on Imbolc I started to think that maybe the term Baby Witch isn't dismissive of one's own power. Maybe dismissing the term Baby Witch is dismissing the power of our young. Maybe, just maybe, owning the term isn't meant to infantize, but to harness the power of the very young to see the world in a new light, discover, absorb, and learn from their elders with unbridled trust and enthusiasm.

For those who use the term to describe themselves:
More power to you. Both figuratively and literally. Don't let the world jade your enthusiasm. You're on the right path. 🌺I'm looking for good magick/occult/esoteric podcasts, feel free to recommend your favsShe says we can take from the stream, but it's important to dig our own wells.  What does this mean to you?  MP/meditations?  Herbal concoctions?for a long time i was afraid of the magick. What's out there lurking in the dark? How will i protect myself from it? Will i become silly and too superstitious? Afraid of my own shadow? (pun intended ha). Am I turning on the spotlight on myself? I live in a city, there are enough scary people who inhabit bodies

i'm doing better, feel more aligned with magick in my life, learning so much, but the fear is still in the background, I don't have the answers. I've had some weird experiences. What do you do to mitigate your fears? I guess magick is the best cure, better to have a flashlight in the dark?I used my moon water to my plants when I watered them tonight. I haven’t watered them in a minute (I’m a terrible plant mommy) so hopefully this will give them a boost!Curious to see what type of work others will be casting at this time with such strong energy from the great conjunction coming up on the day of the winter solstice ! I am still planning what to do.I practice magic and it has brought such an amazing awareness to my life . I feel more at peace in every aspect of my life . I feel like I have learned so many tools through magic and I have also gone to counseling over the years and I have gained many tools from that as well ; having to do with positive manifestation, coping mechanisms, I use my magic really to improve my well being and those that I care about.     

  Unfortunately though, no matter how great life is and no matter how much meditating/shadow work/ spiritual work I do, no matter how much heart and positivity and truly believing in my magic,in my power of myself... I still have these psychotic breaks. I would say every 1 to 3 months some part of my brain switches and I literally feel like I’ll take five steps forward and then 10 steps back. I’m done doing this I want full peace in my life and although I am really about all natural healing I find myself considering some sort of medication.  My question really is has any of you had a more positive experience practicing Magick after getting help/medication to manage your mental illness?? 
  I am really hoping that combing my spiritual work with some sort of balancing medication maybe I can move even further into my craft not having set backs and mental blocks. 
I do meditate every day , I practice yoga, my practice is very much rooted in earth magick. 
Any insight in mental illness/ use of medication would be wonderful because I just want to make a move in the best direction and continue on my spiritual path with less resistance.Hi everyone! I wanted to share something with you that really helped me in my craft.

First a little background: A few months ago I was walking the street and suddenly I saw a Ganesh figurine in a shop. I never cared much about Ganesh or Hinduist representation, but I felt a very strong attraction and a I bought it. Then I had to go to work, where I was dealing with an article I couldn't crack (I write in a theatre magazine), when I found an old issue that really helped me get in the way. The name of the issue: Elephant. It was such a beautiful and meaningful synchro for me!

I started feeling so much love and gratitude for Ganesh, so I started researching and see how I could get in touch with him daily. Mantras, worship, offerings, everything helped but in such a little way, it just wasn't it, didn't work for me. So a few days ago I had the idea of approaching the subject with a ceremonial magick structure, since that's what really changed my life and really works for me. I took the structure of the invoking ritual of the pentagram and I charged the pentagramas with Ganesh mantra, "om gam ganapataye namah". And then, instead of calling the archangels, I called him in every direction. And oh boy, it worked so well! I finally felt in touch with his energy, and it really changed my day, feeling his generous and auspicious company.
Yesterday I tried the same technique with Hanuman, a god that I always felt a strong connection with. I did the same but with his mantra, "om hanumate namah". This was indeed powerful too: I had a dream where I found figurines of him and put it in my bag, and today I woke up at 8 AM feeling strong, rest and healthy (since I start working at 11 AM, I usually wake up 30 minutes before that feeling tired and not having even breakfast lol). So that's it, I wanted to share my experience with all of you, and the joy to walk this path of magick, so many things to discover and live!So, my mum, has a jealous witch targetting her because she is with her ex-husband, she's been getting her \[the jealous witches\] kids to steal her hairs off her hairbrush and give them to her, and involving her kids in the rituals (they are really young 7,9 and 12). Getting them to ask her when her next period is etc. keeping eggs in their wardrobe things of that nature. Whatever she's done has resulted in my mum in the span of a week, getting a ticket, chipping her tooth, bruising her lip, and getting a UTI. My mothers' mother and grandmother were both practicing witches but she didn't keep that going to the same extent she knows the basics and has been utilizing them. Thankfully I caught the magick bug and I am more practicing than her and have given her as many resources as I can and have encouraged protection and deflection etc. I'm also going to go to their house tomorrow to do some protection rituals and the like but I was wondering if there was anything else I could do?

Neither my mum nor I think this woman is a particularly powerful witch but she's running off some really negative energy (she's an extremely abusive and horrible person overall) which as we all know can be powerful in itself.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice, I haven't had a chance to see my mum yet but i appreciate everyone who offered their knowledge! :) Lets make an occult ask redit post- tell me something interesting about your practice/beliefs etc and lets make this interesting!My goal in magick is to manifest the best possible that can exist.

 I know that's extremely vague but the person I've been for the past 20 years it's simply not up to my standards. 
And no matter how much traditional hardwork I put in. 
I seem to just be straying further and further away from what I feel is my true will.
I've learned that I have become my own greatest enemy and combatant. 

Can anyone recommend a starting place or advice on how I can start to regain control of both myself and my life?

I'm very interested in seeking "outside guidance" from evocation or invocation. 
Rather it be truly outside or just other internal aspects of myself is irrelevant to me.
I'm just after results and what can deliver them
I know not to rush these things but I am both eager and not getting any younger in this life.&#x200B;

Starting to discover or study magick can be very overwhelming do to the vast amount of resources out there. This is why I’m leaving here some of the resources that really have helped me start and feel like I’m actually getting on to something.

I’ll start by giving a word of advice: be ready to erase any expectations and pre conceived ideas you have. Learning magick **is not a list of steps you can follow**, learning it also requires you to find and make your own path among a huge amount of options. No one can give you a “plan” for you to get what your seeking. Once you manage to be okay with this lack of certainty everything will start making more sense.

Remember this  first step is probably the hardest to take. It took me about 5 months of going back and forth, reading aimlessly and being all around confused about where to start. Just start by reading and doing some kind of practice (getting better at meditation and visualization for example) you don’t need all the knowledge before you can start.

**First I recommend you read through the basic info provided in the occult subreddit:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/r806v/occult\_101\_what\_it\_is\_and\_where\_to\_start/](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/r806v/occult_101_what_it_is_and_where_to_start/)

**Here are links to YouTube channels that have helped me they also provide good reading resources:**

* For occult topics and general info: [https://www.youtube.com/c/DaatDarling](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaatDarling)
* a guided way into magick [https://www.youtube.com/c/mindandmagick](https://www.youtube.com/c/mindandmagick)

**Books Im reading right now:**

**Another place to find curated resources:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/wiki/uni**](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/wiki/uni)

&#x200B;

And finally I recommend reading the posts in this subreddit with more detailed questions, in this discussions you can find a lot of good resources being mentioned by more experienced practitioners.

I wish you the best of lucks. Also feel free to add any of your own recommendations down below.I was raised a devout catholic my whole life until I started seeing the religion was based on status and ‘appearing’ devout rather than actually being a good person. I love and respect God the higher power and Jesus but people have corrupted/twisted the original teachings for their own selfish gains. 

So eventually I left the religion to build and explore my spirituality on my own - I’m proud of how far I’ve come to find myself a lover of occultism, esoteric traditions and spiritual philosophies of all cultures. 

The only issue I have is getting rid of the fear instilled from Catholicism. Anything to do with magick they viewed it as evil and have this overly paranoid mentality when even just talking about magick, astrology Etc would bring you bad luck which I still am trying to shift away from because it won’t help me to be assertive and confident when practising magick or just reading about it. 

Has anyone experienced this? How do you manage?Come to the realization that the book of psalms is not just an extremely flexible spellbook (probably more than 300 spells). Nor is the book of Pslams just a scripture that you can read for spiritual food.

The book of Psalms has so many hidden occult meanings in it. To the best of my knowlege the book itself has the simultaneous application of spellcasting and occult learning. So you are learning about the hidden meanings of life while spell casting. Pretty big discovery for me.

Share your thoughts.Hello everyone!

Just wanted to share a success story of mine :)

I am as new as beginners come and have no prior experience in any crafts. My mother has always been into fairies and mystical things but I didn’t think much of it until I found this sub. 

So anyway, I have moved careers and therefore have to get new qualifications, only problem is it is in fields I have had a lot of struggles with so was very nervous to say the least!

I decided to make a sigil for this event and it worked ...well ...magickally! 

Just wrote exams for the qualification and passed with flying colors :D it was supposed to be two papers of 90 marks, each with a TON of science and maths. Couldn’t believe my eyes when I opened the papers and neither had any calculation or anything scientific! 

This has made me realize that there is so much truth in all this and I can’t wait to explore some more!

Love this sub and you wonderful people here! Love and light to all ❤️🌞

Edit: Thanks for the award! This is such an awesome sub :)

https://youtu.be/9fJJwwTjTUkI see posts from time saying “my sigils never work” or “I tried this spell but it didn’t work and I don’t know what I did wrong,” so I thought that I’d make my own post about it. 

When you’re struggling to manifest something there are three big things usually responsible. The most common problems are that you just followed the steps without putting enough emotion and will power behind it, that you didn’t clearly visualize your intention, or you didn’t believe it would work.

If it’s the first problem, you should practice manifesting things without a spell for a while. This will get you accustomed to how it feels to manipulate the energy around you. The steps of a spell or ceremony are only meant to assist what’s going on internally. They won’t work on their own. If you rely on the steps too much they change from a vehicle to a crutch. For the second problem, you can just work on imagination exercises. The more complex thing you can hold in your mind the better. Also make sure you know *exactly* what you want *before* you cast for it. 

These first two fit together with one of the fundamentals of any magical working. In order to do any magic, in order to use any will, you need a combination of force and form. Force is the emotional charge that acts as fuel for the spell, or what have you. It is the energy that burns to cause change in the world for you, and you have to give what you plan to get with it. If you’re casting to win the lottery, you better put the same amount of emotional energy into the spell that you would get out from actually winning the lottery. In this case, that’s usually a lot of excitement and gratitude. In a fire, force is the wood. 

Form is the other side of the coin. Form is the mental framework that the emotional energy fills. We build it through thought and imagination, and it tells the energy of the spell how to discharge. Again, if you want to win the lottery you should know in advance nearly every detail of that event, the numbers, the location, the time,  the smell, everything, and then you need to supply enough energy to fill those details. Form is the lightning rod that guides the electricity safely to the earth. Without that lightning rod it may strike your house, the tree in your front yard, or you. Form gives a specific means for the energy to discharge. In a fire, this is the oxygen that allows for chemical reactions in the wood occur.

To complete these two you have to mention the will. It is the ineffable force that we use when nothing else works. It is what you use to get that last push up after your muscles have given out. When you have made a plan and put the work and energy in to make it a reality, the will is knocking over the first domino. Will is what you use to switch you attention from your thoughts back to your breath during meditation. In the fire, will is the first spark, the divine spark, that starts a cascade of effects allowing the wood to begin using the oxygen to chemically change forever into new substances releasing its energy in the process. 

Those are the biggest things, and if you have them down you should have no problem manifesting whatever you want. However, there is one more thing. If you don’t believe that your spell is going to work, it will not work. That said, all you have to do sometimes in believe for a split second and you’ll get it. Belief, I believe, is connected to the will. If this is your problem don’t get down on yourself about it. No matter who you are we can all work on having more faith in our magic, and we all go through ups and downs with it. The goal is to be so confident in yourself that you don’t even have to think about your magic until it manifests, and that’s a hard thing to do.

TL;DR
Think, feel, believe. 

Peace out Girl Scout,

B.B.When a malevolent/evil spirit invokes fear during an attack, they are said to feed off that fear. The energy of a living person is said to transfer to the attacking, fear inducing, spirit.

I have recently read a suggestion from a Chaos Magick practitioner that the embodied human spirit can practice psychic vampirism on disembodied evil spirits. Can anybody back that up with their own personal experiences?

In this dimension of physical existence, do humans have inherently more "intentional" power than spirits? Can our free will, our intentions, always Trump an evil spirit? Is it possible to claim 'your energy is mine' from an evil spirit and turn darkness into light?

Pun intended. LOL   I've only been practicing magick for a couple months now. Mostly working with sigils and tarot. I havent even thought about a diety yet, though I've always been drawn to the symbolism of Baphomet so I figured I'd start working with her. But last night I had the most vivid dream of my life.
   I woke up naked in a strange void. The sky was a deep purple and the ground seemed to be made of flowing blood. I could feel it clinging to my body and the air smelled like copper and jasmine. I walked forward for a little ways before I came upon a a large figure of a woman. She was hunched over and her skin was the prettiest shade of black I have ever seen.. almost shimmering.  She must have noticed me because she lifted her head and met my gaze. Her eyes were a crimson red and her tongue was sticking out.. almost writhing like a tentacle. She lifted 4 arms, one holding a blood stained sickle, the other a forever bleeding severed head. She held a bowl underneath that was overflowing and spilling onto the ground. She extended her last empty hand to me and I instantly fell to my knees, blubbering like a baby. I had never been so terrified.
   She lifted my chin and I met her gaze. An overwhelming sense of love and understanding washed over me. I knew I should be afraid but it was as if she were halting that feeling. She then gripped me by the throat and stood up, lifting me high off of the ground. She licked the blood from my body and then proceeded to... for lack of a better word, fellate me. And yes, I'm still being completely serious.
    When she was finished, she opened her mouth and swallowed me whole. I could feel myself slither down her throat into a black void until I was encased in a womb of warm darkness.
    I woke up in cold sweats and was shaking. I'm still very confused by what it all means. I had never really looked into the Hindu Gods before so I googled "black skinned 4 armed woman with tongue sticking out" and apparantly I had seen Kali.
    
TL/DR: The Hindu Goddess of time and destruction sucked me off and ate me in a dream. What does this mean?We recently got my son VR for his birthday. I asked him to load up a “game” for me to try, and he loaded a 3D art studio that gives you the ability draw in an unlimited 3D environment... it was quite amazing.

I spent the time writing the most meaningful song lyrics around me - seeing them float in the air, boxing me in, game me a feeling of awe. 

It made me wonder if anyone ever uses this platform for their rituals. think of the LBRP and other rituals, and I imagine having the symbols painted around you would make the visualization of the ritual all the more powerful.

So, I just wondered if anyone here had done that. Would it for any reason be taboo or frowned upon? 

This is my little opinion about the book Modern Magick by Donald Kraig.

Ok, I want to be honest. It took me three years to finish this book.

I've started this book as **it was recommended to me as a beginner**.

When I started reading it, I realized that **the book was full of kabbalistic and ceremonial magick things**, which is definitely not my thing. Almost half of the book is like this. The first three or four chapters are full of complex ceremonial rituals to memorize, which I didn't understand and all the parts of the ritual were not clearly explained. This is the point when I left the book on the shelf and start reading more "witchy" or low magick books.

Now that I have finished it, I have to say that I love all the great and valuable pieces of advice and tips the author gives through all the book. **There is a lot of really wonderful and useful information in this book that I haven't seen anywhere else**. I also loved the last chapter about **chaos magick** and all that.

So, if you are like me and don't like ceremonial magick, I still recommend this book. You just need to skip all the rituals and all that.

Also, I've seen many times that this book is recommended to beginners. In my opinion, **this book is not for beginners**. As a beginner, all the information could be very overwhelming. I would recommend this book to somehow experience people.Soon to be parent here. Just some basic questions because there’s not many sources for this kind of information online. 

1. What’s a good age to introduce your child to magick? (I want my kid to enjoy being a kid without religious indoctrination but also want them to be intelligent and informed)

2. HOW do you introduce your child to magick? (I know this is probably easily done through personification, symbolism, and story telling. But I want to be sure the information is accurate and not superstitious.) 

3. Respect for other faiths? (I’m a Satanist but want my child to be whatever they want to be. I was raised Catholic and although I hated the indoctrination, as an adult I can appreciate certain aspects of the faith I was raised in.) 

I know nobody has perfect answers for parenting but gathering information from all over certainly helps. All advice is appreciated! Thanks ahead of time. 

3.It doesn't make you happy or bring peace. Go do something else, make friends, whatever, unless you can find balance. Maybe you don't feel like you have a choice? Then do the bare minimum to get by, or shut it down, there's ways, it's your life. Do what you want. Find your path that gives YOU happiness.Im doing it. Im doing it! It all started out about a month ago, when I first interacted with deities. They were Frig and Eir(I think), and that inspired me. I bought a tarot deck, and it's amazing.  I've gotten good with tarot, the best in my Coven. More recently, I've begun worshipping Odin, and it's been amazing. In rhe past few days, I've done icelandic rune magic(ow) to help a friend with a job, and she got an offer for an interview today. A few hours ago, I sent two letters. The first, to no one in particular, a letter asking the spirits to aid my friend with her job search. Then another to my great grandmother, telling her about how my life was going and how much I missed her and I love her. Shortly after, I felt a feeling of peace and happiness. She received my letter! Im so happy. And I'm only a month in. Very much happy!!!!In 2015 I was arrested for a murder That I had nothing to do with. The entire case was based on hearsay testimony from my spiteful ex wife and her boyfriend. No physical evidence……no witnesses, nothing. I spent almost six months behind bars before I could get bail and lost my job. My wife who is very in touch with her energy fought very hard to get me out against all odds.
The trial date dragged on for three years and they offered me a plea bargain which I refused. One month before the trial they stayed the charges against me and I was a free man once again.
Ten days after the charges were dropped and the trial cancelled there was a fire down the road. Our neighbors who we thought were our friends, had been working as police informants trying to help build a case against me for money. 
The family farm house half a mile from their new house burned to the ground when her brother lost control of a grass fire he lit. It jumped the road and almost burned their new house too.
Another woman who dragged my name through the mud on social media and did everything in her power to hinder my wife’s fundraising to get me out, lost 21 head of cattle in a single lightning strike with no insurance.
My ex wife’s boyfriend who had been scheduled to testify against me recently had both his legs broken in a freak accident from a falling beam. 
I’ve done nothing but silently let any hatred towards these people dissipate, and let the universe balance the scales as it see’s fit.
Anyone else seen things like this happen?For those of you that practice Magick, what was the experience that convinced you that it worked and is real?I would like to thank you amazing guys on this community for answering my last questions, which unfortunately I couldn't answer at the time.

First, you guys gave me so much insight into [Shadow Work](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/j51hzk/shadow_work_references/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that a week after reading and meditating on everything I could absorb from the answers, my psychologist said that I had one of the biggest advances in my therapy, and all that I did was accept my anger about a situation on my life and use it as an inspiration to change.

I couldn't thank you enough for giving me your time and wisdom, and helping me on my own path.Hello all. I’m curious as to how those of you who work with deities, angels, spirit guides, etc. communicate with them? Do you see them? Is their voices audible or is it like thoughts in your head that are a different “voice”? Do they only interact with you in dreams or meditation? I really appreciate any responses.I've loved crows since freshman year of high-school (2014) and that was even before I started exploring spirituality and witchcraft. I'm drawn to them because they're very misunderstood, beautiful, and incredibly intelligent birds. They can even mimic human speech, give gifts, and express emotions.

History shows us that in many cultures, corvids have been harbingers of significant events such as battle, death, and change, and have been characterized as resourceful, wily, and macabre. There are many myths, sayings, and superstitions that have informed the people of the past, and one of my favorites is the following poem about counting crows:

"**One** for sorrow,

**two** for mirth,

**three** for union,

**four** for birth,

**five** for laughing,

**six** for crying,

**seven** for severance,

**eight** for dying,

**nine** for the new,

**ten** for the old,

**eleven** for shattering the mold."

(Note: I've modified the original poem to be more applicable to my life. Feel free to look up the original "Counting Crows poem" and modify it to your own needs.)

I use counting crows as my form of self reflection, and as a catalyst to expand my understanding of my soul.

(Most of these phrases *don't* need to be taken literally. For example if you see eight crows you *don't* need to start panicking about your death or the death of a loved one. Instead \[for example\], reflect on things that have concluded, or "died", and what they taught you.)

I know this is a fairly common folk-magic practice, I just thought I'd share my own take on it, a small daily reflection.

Stay safe and healthy everyone!I see everywhere how important the Shadow Work is in magick and how you cannot go to far in this path without setting things up with your shadows.

But I would like to know how do you guys do shadow work? What book should I look for? 

I started the Tarot Shadow Work a couple of weeks ago, but I think I didn't connect too much with it as I thought I would. 
I also receive a recommendation to go to the root and read some Freudian stuff, which  I certainly will some day, but for now, how you do it?Honestly, reality doesn't work normally around me. A blunt literally came to me with the wind once when I was stressed and omw to work, I get near my tarot cards and one jumps out of the deck, lights without power flicker on when I get really worked up, electronics glitch... The most noticeable to me though is the manifestation.
 
I think about needing $5 and find a $5 bill frozen to a wall. I think about needing a bungie cord, and one jumps off a truck driving by. When I was homeless and wanting help, a woman entered my life who has been like a mother to me since. I dream about my friend being pregnant, and a few days later she tells me she just found out she is. Most recently... I was thinking about needing a computer, and section 8 sent me a letter with a blurb about an organization that refurbishes discarded computers and gives them to people in need for cheap to free. Not 30 minutes after I look it up, I'm talking to my clinical case manager and find out that organization just donated some to my mental health provider and I get one.
 
There's way too much coincidence in my life for it all to just be a dice roll. 
 
Please tell me I'm not the only one who experiences manifestation on this level?I (M20) have had multiple people tell me I’ve impacted their lives significantly. Many of those same (male) friends have opened up to me emotionally and I’ve had really wholesome experiences, especially one on one. I don’t normally reveal that I practice magick (which I take quite seriously, and it impacts my life tremendously), and am curious if this affects any of you who also practice and if you believe this has impacted your relationships.

Thanks for your time, and have a nice day!Tldr: see title 

Occasionally, I see a post here or on other magick, occult, spiritual, witchcraft, or pagan subreddits in which OP is in some sort of crisis (mental health, family, or other)  which they want help in the form of an instant fix via magick. 

Personally, I don't believe this is how magick works. I think it's more subtle and likely to manifest in "maundane" ways such as help from a friend or an epiphany leading to self growth. 

I often see posters who I believe would be better served  through professional help from people like therapists, social workers, or counselors and I think it could even be dangerous to give them too much advice. I believe I may have made this mistake recently. 

There was a recent poster who I urged to consider maundane reasons for what they were experiencing. I was going to follow up with suggesting they get some kind of professional help, but the post was deleted before I got to that. 

My question is how can we respond to people who are having this kind of crisis or who are paranoid, delusional, or experiencing extreme life issues? Obviously, we should recommend they seek out people who are qualified to help with their issues. But, is there anything we should do in addition to that? Are there any magick practiceners who are also mental health professionals who have any thoughts on this? How do we keep people safe and not feed into their current chaos? 

To be clear, I do think magick can help people with mental illness (if they practice in a grounded way), but I also strongly believe it is supplemental to professional help and a good support network. I think it can also be dangerous for people who have extreme delusions or paranoia to enter into a magical practice. Personally, my magick and spirituality has helped me battle my depression and anxiety, but I have also seen instances of magick feeding into someone's delusions and mental illness.For as long as I can remember I have been chasing a certain feeling or state of being that I recall from my youth. Maybe it is completely foolish to do so, but that hasn't stopped me.

When I was younger the world seemed to have this element of mystery and seemed limitless in what could be discovered. Everything was so interesting to me, from playing video games, to messing around on a Windows 95 computer, exploring a forest, to listening to music. Everything I came across was something I've never seen or heard of before.

I would listen to stories from parents, siblings, or friends as they explained how certain things worked. It was fascinating. Talking to friends as school would be a treat, as they could introduce me to things I've never seen or heard of before. Actually communicating with people on face to face level without the distractions of smartphones was in my humble opinion quite a markedly different, better, experience than we usually have today.

I grew to love technology and was always a huge fan all kinds of computers and gadgets. I loved walking through an electronics store and seeing all the various machines, the PDAs, all kinds of stuff that I could only guess the purpose of.

Lately many retail stores are closing down. Instead of an electronics store full of various gadgets, everything is now just an iPhone. Malls are all closing down because everything is now just Amazon. There seems to be a trend of decreasing diversity in everything. A concentration of fewer and more similar things among a small group of massive companies.

Over time, the sense of wonder seemed to start going away. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when, but certainly as the internet started becoming what it is, the world seemed to start feeling smaller. Also naturally as I experienced more, learned more I started to see there was indeed a limit to reality and the things constrained within it.

Additionally, as I grew older and more educated I realized more and more that the world works based on natural and scientific principles. There are no magical beings, no aliens, no ghosts, nothing beyond the empirical. Yet, somehow even though I suspected this all along, I don't want it to be true. There's something so disappointing about a world where nothing TRUELY unexpected or unbelievable can happen.

It almost seems like getting information is too easy. I can learn about anything in literally seconds. I can see pictures of a city in China, a video of winemakers working in Italy, or watch a movie from France literally in seconds on a phone or computer. Though life these days is pure luxury compared to ages ago.. I can't help but feel like in some ways ancient people were lucky. They had to ability to explore the world and genuinely experienced it as mysterious. Also the very rich history of myth and religion shows us that people were never limited in their thinking to only the material world.

So this brings me to the main point and the title of this post. How can we reobtain this sense of wonder and enchantment with the world? Is it possible at all? One thing is for certain, I am not the only one who feels this way. I've seen other people express very similar views. I researched and became very interested so many things.. I researched religion, the occult, meditation, aliens and ufos, cryptids, mythical beings, etc. Though the more I research, the more I yearn for a sense of wonder and the unknown. I hope at least some of this makes sense.My work in magick is mild at best. My sigils/candles work occasionally, and that’s about it. I experience a lot of synchronicities so the occult world is always in the corner of my eye, but the issue is that it’s hard to reach to it. I think the problem might be my inability to feel energy.

I read so many guides telling me to “feel” energy when imagining, and that I’m going to feel the real thing if I persist. But I don’t. I only feel my regular body. Is there a block I have to work past?I keep seeing that statement and I find it profoundly creepy. Oh, and screens are "black mirrors" apparently? 


Ugh.

What the headline said! After watching Pixar's "Soul" (I enjoyed it) and "WW84" (I didn't), I thought it might be fun to start a blog that hosts film reviews from an occult/esoteric perspective. Soul had some pronounced occult overtones that will be fun to dive into. I've taken care of hosting, will handle web design/dev, editing, some writing, and promotion.

Would anyone be interested in writing occult commentaries/reviews of movies from your perspective (every so often)? If so, would you DM me your tradition of practice (and how long you've been practicing), writing exp., and some film titles you'd like to review?

Also, would anyone be interested in reading such a blog/joining such a community?

If you haven’t already stumbled upon his channel on YouTube, Foolish Fish is an amazing resource on magick and the occult. He does fantastic reviews of books on the matter and I particularly enjoy his Esoteric Saturday series. I feel like he delivers the content with a great deal of insight and respect.

I’m in no way affiliated to him, I just genuinely enjoy his videos. I can’t really afford to support him financially, so this is the best I can do, 😂

As some of you may have noticed, earlier today we switched the subreddit over to Text submission only. This is following some great feedback from the community about how we all want this place to run.

We're doing what we can to bring the quality of submissions up, without restricting access. You may definitely include images, videos, blogs etc. in the text body, but it should be included to serve the text, rather than the text serving the link. This simple change will help us reduce spam and "poaching".

If there is anything else you think the moderation team can be doing to help improve the quality of submissions, please feel free to open a dialogue. We're currently reviewing the existing rules, so if you have any comments on those it would be appreciated.

Lastly, I'd like to give a warm welcome to the newest member of the Moderation Team, /u/CyrusMagnus! Cyrus has been an active and engaging member of our community for a long while, and has done a great job moderating so far. 

Thank you for reading, and I wish you all a Blessed Day.Hi friends. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

For about three years now I've been traveling down the path of self discovery, and have been fascinated by the unseen world, taking great pleasure in uncovering it's mysteries and learning more about it.

Recently that all changed.

See, my path of discovery was kick-started in part by a messy breakup that left me searching for ways to better myself, and partly (maybe mostly) due to my Discovery of psychedelics.

A lot of my deeper experiences were with the help of psychedelics, and even when I reached a point in my practice where I could perform powerful magick without any chemical assistance, I always found that a trip once in a while would deepen my passion for the spiritual and give me more to uncover.

However, I've recently had to admit to a drug problem. It definitely stems deeply from alcohol, but in order to get it under control I decided to take the no exceptions route. Maybe this is related, maybe it isn't, but either way my practice has dropped off significantly recently. I can barely work up the motivation to do my morning banishing and invoking rituals, and I've felt my connection to my spirit guides (and indeed the astral plane altogether) fading.

Have any of you had similar experiences?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just feel kinda lost right now.

ThanksIs it me or you guys also noticed this? All of a sudden strangers are starting conversations with me and complimenting meI’ve kind of recognized this place as my comfort zone, as I established a good relationship with members of that church who would love to see me again (I tend to avoid churches now, they don’t really do anything for me). 

I guess it’s confusing to me because whenever I try visualization my subconscious naturally pictures it happening within the context of that church community. If I want a better job, I naturally visualize myself getting a job offer call with them in the room. If I want a better parking spot I’m driving closer to the church’s entrance. 

The confusing part for me is why my psyche is so attached to this place when I don’t even practice Christianity anymore? Is it possible there’s some kind of link between me and that space that I can let go of? It’s starting to eat up a lot of my attention with quarantine keeping me indoors.Why is it considered by some as an  'unlucky' day?I’m looking to go as far back as possible in any area, not sure where to start looking!

I’m really interested in human history and our connection to our environment. I don’t have access to family history other than close relatives are English and Scottish, and possible ties to Roma Gypsy a few generations ago. I’m really drawn to eastern religions and older tribal beliefs like Native American, south America if that matters:)We have all had to overcome something in magick, whether it was lust for results, being too unsure, too impatient, scared, comparing yourself to others, over confident, etc.

What was one of your hardest lessons to learn, and how did you overcome it?

For me it was slowing the hell down. I had all this head knowledge, but I just couldn't translate it into the real world. Experience takes time, maturity takes time. I just couldn't freaking wait for all that! It absolutely killed me to see others making it happen and I couldn't yet. 

I had a couple of bad spells, and got too impatient during rituals and pissed off some more experienced practitioners in the group which got me into some trouble. My mentor let me fall a bit by not mentioning the fact that I forgot about protection magick and sent out a horribly crafted curse. Yep, lesson learned. He saved me from my own stupidity, but not before letting me feel some of the burn. 

Slowly I learned that it was easier to be happy where I was rather than always being miserable for being what and where I am not. I found my groove, and wouldn't ya know it, I started making cool things happen! I forgot about hurrying up and started enjoying the ride.Just thought I’d share, I found it quite funny. Maybe it’s the universes way of humor, or something else. Take this information as you will. 

Have a nice day! Di would like to know any experiences or insights on this. call it the crowley way i guess lolI get it. I’m sure many of us are practicing silence, and I’m sure many more are stuck in the proverbial “broom closet,” but with over 30,000 people in this sub we get maybe five or six posts a day. I know there are literally thousands of you who have questions to ask, stories to tell, and wisdom to give, and I for one want to hear from you. I want to answer your questions, I want to be inspired by your stories, and most of all I want to learn from you. I promise you will get more than you give. 

If you think you don’t have anything to teach, you’re wrong. If you think we wouldn’t be interested, you’re wrong. If you’re afraid to admit that you practice magick, post anonymously. Just post something, anything, I’m bored, I’m quarantined, and you’re the only people who get me.I want to break a honeyjar. I know that the person who put it on me practices hoodoo and I do not. I do not have access to the jar as she buried it and I have no idea where. I want to break it before the affects start getting really bad.

She also admitted to doing a bunch of other stuff like putting her hair in my drink when I’m not looking. She basically wants me hooked to our friendship. I can’t explain it well but she made this spell as insurance to make sure I never leave, but she wants no problems leaving herself. The thing is she wants it so that if she ditched our friendship that I will be desperate for her.

I have seen some of the affects that it has had on me, so I know it is working. I just don’t know about hoodoo and I don’t want to mess up on a practice that isn’t mine.

Edit update: Wow I got a lot more replies than I thought. I think I should just clear some things up because the situation is a little bit more complicated that I thought and I left some important context out.

Okay so me and this friend are both part of huge tight knit group. A lot of us are also coworkers, so if a lot of people take her side it hurts my job. There will be times where I’ll be hanging out with 2 people and then boom she randomly appears. I wish I could just block her without drama starting, but if I did our whole friend group would know or worse I see her after the blocking. I also know she has no problem doing baneful magick, so I want to do the friendship exit with as least drama as possible, because getting hexed is very possible. I don’t want her to know that I broke her spell. 

Also thank you guys about the willpower suggestions. I’ve been trying to avoid her for a while now, and anytime I think about hanging out I remember the jar and don’t. 

My friend is also not a beginner witch. And honeyjars to her are a I’m bored on a Wednesday kind of thing. I have no doubt that she did the spell. She told me about the burial of the jar before she told me the jar was on me. It was after a while that she admitted that the jar she buried a month back was on me and some other people.

Also why I asked specifically for help is because hoodoo is considered a closed practice. There is big room for error. I don’t want to disrespect a whole practice if I did have to do a spell that I didn’t know about.I saw a post long ago talking about how there must be an actual 'santa' entity because of all of the young children who believe in him.  I wanted to know what the word for this was and if anyone has any intersting information about such entities. are they sentient? do they really fill the role of the entity they were created as? do they have the same 'powers' as what the poeple who created them believe?

than you for any answersI've been exploring a question about the LBRP ritual: *why are the archangels placed in that order?*

This opened up a whole can of worms and has taken me on a really interesting journey of textual discovery, which is only just beginning.

The piece outlining my research findings so far is a long-read (7.5k words) and here's the link:

[https://www.futureconscience.com/before-me-raphael-sacred-magic-and-the-four-archangels/](https://www.futureconscience.com/before-me-raphael-sacred-magic-and-the-four-archangels/)

I'd really appreciate any nods to other references that I might have missed!I've been practicing a technique recommended in "Learning Ritual Magick" by John Michael Greer, where you have other books you are studying and for each chapter, you select one sentence for each day of the week. You write it out on a piece of paper and keep it with you throughout the day. A variation is to take your sentence and read it right before you go to bed and try to work on it in the dream world. Last night I read this sentence (from Dion Fortune's Mystical Qabalah): "The three form Sephiroth are in the pillar of severity, and the three force Sephiroth in the pillar of Mercy, and between them in the pillar of equilibrium are the different levels of consciousness." I put the sentence under my pillow for good measure. Last night some symbols appeared in my dream. There were two bushes arranged symmetrically. One was a raspberry bush, and the other was a blackberry bush. I took this to symbolize the two pillars of force and form (mercy and severity). I think the black and red symbolize negative and positive (I'm also into cars and motorcycles and so it would make sense that my brain would make the association of these colors with the plus and minus of automotive batteries). There was also a black mushroom involved in the dream, and at one point it was located between the two bushes, to form the center of a triplicate. Finally, I awoke with the name "Hecate" in my head. Looking her up on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate), I see she is closely associated with witchcraft and sorcery and is often depicted with three heads or three bodies, which could represent the three pillars of the Tree of Life. She's also associated with plant medicine and herbology, and maybe the mushroom has something to do with this?

My question to you all is, does anyone have any further insight on Hecate and her significance in the context of magick? Has anyone worked with this goddess/archetype and in what way? Also interested to hear anyone else's take on the dream symbolism.

Happy Solstice to you all!I’m impress by the sucess history of Anya Taylor-Joy, she was discover walking by the street with his dog. His career is going too fast like in 4 years and she has worked with marvel and now she is furiosa in mad max prequel. She said in an interview for the witch that in a world who doesn’t exist magick is a world who she doesn’t wanna live. (Sorry for my english, i’m from Venezuela and the educational system isn’t that good,i’m learning everything by my own)Hi,

I think I lost my ability to see, hear things and astral project after my encounter with an unknown entity. I’ve been trying to get it back for months now and no luck so far, so I decided to post here.


A little background:

I’ve been able to see and hear things for as long as I can remember, I was able to interact with these beings (they mostly come out of trees, some looks like animals, and some that were hard to describe) to the point where my parents call a priest for me and bless me and our house.

There were also a number cases where I got attacked by some of them and I learned to put a protective spell around the house and around me.


But after I moved in Japan, Here is also the first time where I managed to watch myself sleep.
I’m not sure why but it felt like the entities here are much stronger than the one I used to deal with, where they can easily enter my safe space, There’s this one time where I was so tired, slept and woke up and there are 2 hairy being right beside my bed smiling while staring at me.

There’s also another case where, one of them tried to strangle me while I was resting. (I already lost count on how many times I got attacked like this).  If not because of the spells that I cast I’m probably dead by now.

After this incident I decided to move and leave this apartment, but before I managed to leave I have an encounter while I was projecting. 
There is this thing that invited me to go somewhere that he says “very good place” I am not sure why but I happened to agree,
He took me to a place that looks like a grove, where there’s a small structure with a door leading underground, after going down the stairs I ended up in a reddish room that is full of symbols on the walls, it was hot and there were fires (torches i believe) in the corners that are burning bright red, at the end of the room there’s something with a woman like form sitting in an altar or throne as one may call it.

She got this lines or symbols around her reddish skin and there were this reddish rays of light coming out of her, it was very beautiful.
She then ask me to be one of her followers or servants. She’s beautiful but I am the type of person who won’t serve under anyone whoever they are so I declined the offer. Those are the last moments That I can remember.


After this incident, I found out that I can no longer see, hear nor astral project anymore. it’s like my connection to that world has been fully cut. 


Does anyone got a similar experience? did you managed to get your senses back? how?
I’m trying so hard for months now and still got no luck.

Now that I think about it, I just declined the offer without asking for the rules, limitations, benefits and stuff. what an idiot. 


I want to meet her again if I can.

Any kind of insight would be welcome. 
or if you know what I just experienced, please shed some light on the matter.

Thanks in advance!I've heard of people using dmt to get in waking contact with the spirit world, but that stuff is hard to come across, so I settled for the next best thing. I've heard psychedelics can enhance the experience of spirit contact, I think it could be a lot of fun. And very enlightening. Does anyone have any warnings or Experiences with this? Id love to hear about it.After practicing and looking inwards to better understand my own faith and limiting beliefs I have made some major breakthroughs. I remember reading through these posts months ago with a completely different perspective.

I doubted the results I was seeing. I doubted the experiences and I limited myself to what was possible. 

In the past two months I have conjured specific and swift manifestations of desire. One was a love interest that was strikingly fast (the next day) and almost caught me off guard at the intensity and details of the manifested person. She and I had an instant connection which I originally was only manifesting as a new sexual experience thorough ritual and scrying. I met her, we connected and shared a wonderful experience. Following that we went our separate ways. (I later manifested her BACK, when I desired to see her again that story is crazier)

Then days later I was sitting around thinking about what happened and I made the connection that I had been willfully manifesting the connection for days beforehand I almost had forgotten that the experience came directly after and as a result of the manifestation. I thought to myself “holy shit…if I can do that…what else is possible?”. 

Now being interested and excited to try something else I looked inside to my next most yearning desire. Money. I was not currently in a state of abundance as far as my finances and honestly even had some bills coming up with no clear way for me to pay them. 

I began to manifest financial abundance through mantra and chaos magic. I don’t want to explain what I did exactly out of fear of being ridiculed and also having others minds and thoughts intermingle with my own faith and certainty of the experience. Quite frankly I plan on doing it more I’ve done it twice now. I would start by clearing my mind and entering a state of meditation sometimes aided with sound waves. I literally proceeded to watch over the next two weeks the money began to flow in. First as an Uber driver being handed 100$ tip and then multiple large cash tips. Then manifested a specific asset (literally ridiculous) grow from a 23 to 39 billion dollar market cap. Now keep in mind I had only placed 900$ in the asset. But regardless watching it grow to a few thousand dollars overnight was humbling. 

I am now noticing how many limiting and subconscious blocks I have in my OWN mind that are stopping me from being filthy rich. I have all that I need and am by no means poor but I feel the divines have more in store for me and it’s my own thoughts and choices limiting me at this point. 

I’m excited to dive further into manifestation and want to know does anyone have similar experiences with something like this?
Introduction 
---------------------

Edit: This was shared to me by Ariel Gatoga.
just google him hes got good material for those seeking Angelic Magick, Psalmic Magic, and Witchcraft. He is very legit As soon as I seen his work with ArchAngel Samael in coptic script I knew he was the real deal. I plan to incorporate some of his systems into mine in the future.

Background
---------------------

As mentioned in my previous post. The book of Psalms is a Magickal System unto itself. Meaning you can become an adept just using the book of Psalms. This Psalmic Technique that I am about to show you is not my usual way of using the Psalms.
I am an Ars Paulina craftman and so my Psalmic technique revolves around Angelic forces, having said that, one can use only the Psalms to and become an extremely powerful magician. This is due to the intricacies of the Psalmic work itself. There is an initiation path through the Psalms that guides the magician higher and higher. 


How the spells work in this system.
------------------------------------------------------------

1)The selected Psalmic scriptures will be read out loud all the way though. This is called an *Incantation.*

Incantation - A series of words said as a magic spell or charm.

2)The next phase of the spell is to focus on the occult meaning of the words in Psalms. Meditating on these meanings will plant the seeds into your subconscious and well as the universe and the spell will begin working for you. At the same time you gain a deeper understanding of the Scripture.

Spell working of Psalms 23

Say out loud:

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Break down the words and then meditate on them in a sentence.
------------------
Occult meaning 

*The Lord* - The Godhead.
Neither male nor female and unknowable. The force.

*Shepherd* - The Superconscious mind that cares for your every need.


*Green Pastures* - A place of peace and abundance

*Still Waters* - waters equals emotions. Still waters indicates emotional tranquility.

*Restoreth Soul* -  The human is being's connection is being restored to the his soul.

*Path of righteousness* - all things according to your highest desires. These only bring joy, abundance and healing.

*Namesake* - In magick to know its name is to know its nature. In this case it is the Godhead. 
What qualities are of the God?

*Infinity Intelligence, Perfect Love, Divine Truth, Divine law, Perfect Beauty*. Meditate on that.


*The Valley of the shadow of death* - 

The world of suffering and death which we live in which is illusury in nature. But you fear no evil. Comfort is giving despite this.



*Rod and Shaft* - Tools to lead you and protect you


Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies - you to take of communion with your creator its happening no matter what anytime is perfect even in the face of danger.

*Anoint head with oil* - to make Sacred you are being made sacred and cleansed. 

*Cup runeth over* - when Divine is in charge of your supply there is always surplus. Cup also refers to the eternal bounty of the divine. Bounty is a sum paid. Its a never ending supply.

*Goodness and Mercy* - Refers to the 4th sphere of the Kabalastic tree of life. Abundance, justice and prosperity. These things seek you out.

*House of the lord* - House is a space in this case it is a sacred space to make contact with divinity. It is a place of safety and comfort. You have inifinite certainty that all is well. 

Conclusion
As you meditate on these meanings they plant seeds to help you achieve your results.

This spells could be performed at anytime. But for best results do on a waxing phase. Do it daily or until you see movement.

This spell was shared with me so I share with you.

If you wanna learn more check out Ariel Gatoga.Is anyone interested in cybermagick/technomancy? Can you recommend any books/websites/videos/subreddits? I'm highly intrigued with the idea of combining magick with technology. For example, programming software to perform ritual/intention on your behalf. I would think that could be a game changer. My challenge is, I'm still learning the basics of classical magick and how it works, let alone how to then translate that into a working model to incorporate technology. But, I want to at least see what mankind has come up with to give me a better mental map of it all, while I progress in my classical magickal knowledge and experiences personally. I have 20 years experience in an IT/technology career and feel I may be able to apply a lot of that to cybermagick but don't know how to approach it yet.Recently I’ve been working with a benevolent spirit named lakshmi. I randomly looked at what was celebrated on my iPhone on today’s date and coincidentally it was a celebration dedicated to Lakshmi. Dress in nice clothes, clean the house, feast and game with friends, eat delicacies.... yes please!!https://youtu.be/ex_4tgyzWZ8

I hope it’s educational entertaining and not a complete hot mess lol(:Just learning up on the guy. He was on death row, sentenced to death 3 times, and was let off. Have been watching his YouTube videos on magick and the guy is really well spoken from what I can tell. 

Be curious to see what his perception is here.This spell jar will help you with:

- More confidence in yourself emotionally and physically 
- Feel more confident socially 
- Love yourself
- Have charisma and be likeable for *you*
- Attract high vibrational people 
- Be attractive 
- Be elegant, poised, sleek style 
- People think you carry yourself well
- Good sexual health and energy
- Lust 
- aligning with the divine feminine

You will need:

- a red candle (for love lust and attraction)
- a lighter
- a jar 
- smoke cleansing like incense 
- whatever form of protection you use

Make it as how your would make any spell jar!Edit 04-20-21: Hey guys! Didn't know this post would get so many people on it so I'd like to make a general answers update, as it's hard to respond twice to some things. 

-I've now learned the difference between hex and curse, thank you guys for informing me I never knew!

-I did take kitty to the vet, It would be extremely expensive to put her though the diagnosis process and she's really reached her age of "you know what. I'm done." So I don't want to subject her to something that might not work and make her in even more pain.

- next thing is about her being a familiar, it is wrong of me to use a living animal as one as again they do take the front of it. This wasn't by choice to make her a familiar as it was a family tradition (I was eight years old), but that's not an excuse but an explanation. I definitely should have figured out how to let her not be, but I never thought naively this would ever happen. I understand everyone who commented about it, I agree with all of you. I apologize for that. This family "tradition " will never happen again to a live animal, I've cut contact with my family years ago as well.

- Also I debate if maybe she did eat something bad and it wasn't the curse, again this came out of nowhere and maybe I blamed too quickly. I've communicated with my guides who said it was what I thought it was, but honestly you never know when emotion over rules facts. I'll be going back over this with them when I'm emotionally ready. I'll also be trying to block out the situation for a while to detache the emotions.

-again thank you everyone, I'm open to everyone's thoughts and opinions as long as you're not being a jerk. (Haven't really seen jerks so that's nice) I can't thank you guys enough for this, and hope you have a good day.

Hello, I've posted here before. Some things got much worse recently and I'm looking for help or support in preventing future attacks, as well as, how I can keep this from happening to my soul animals in the future.  Here I will post what happened, how I fixed it, and my plea for how to not go ballistic over this.

On the full moon March 28th 2021, a very close childhood friend stopped talking to me. He had come back in my life suddenly, started saying he was practicing magick and wanted to talk about it. I let my guard down. We talked about everything we practiced, I took him in and let him to my notes. We talked for about four months, and suddenly he disappeared. 

Note:(my guides did inform me it was him, all signs point to him, he's okay he didn't die or anything he is thriving on social media)

Around April 1st I started to have issues mentally, it's like the claws of paranoia had taken a massive grip on me, and I felt awful mentally and physically. My cat familar also started to get very very sick randomly. I was on the brink of soopcide, when one of my guides made me very aware of what was going on the 6th-7th. The guide nagged me all day, showing signs, pulling at my shoulder, gave me dreams basically screaming at me what was going on.

The day of the 7th I crafted a ritual made from scratch, did my offerings, trapped it in a wax sealed bottle, and much more. I guess it wasn't enough. (I can go into detail if anyone wants to know, but I only preform rituals I crafted) My guide informed me I'd have to do another one. I felt things start to lift a little and rested until I was able to preform a bigger ritual. 

April 12th 2021, I did a four hour long bath ritual and spent a lot of time crafting this to work. I felt drained for a few days but at the moment I couldn't be better mentally and physically... but my familiar... she is to be put down tomorrow at 2:30pm. 
My familiar suddenly started weezing, she can't move by herself, she can't eat, can't drink water, doesn't speak anymore, and is in pain. This is a manecoon, she's 12 years old but that's so very young for her breed. She was getting older though, and I understand it was due to be time eventually... but even Freyja who protects myself and her is angry.  It's way too soon, and this came out of left field at the same time the hex was. There's nothing I can do to help now, I feel like I didn't do enough. I included her in the reversal but it didn't do much it was too late.

Now I'm angry. I don't want to do a returned hex, and I don't think the "friend" has known what he's done to the extent that he's done only practicing for a year or so. I want an eye for an eye, but I know it will just make it worse, I have to be a bigger person. 

My final questions are
How can I better protect myself? (I have made a protection brew and have sealed all my entrances after this event)
What do you think I should do going forward? (I'm just looking for suggestions and opinions here)
What are your experiences with hexes, do you have any advice?

Thank you  for reading, this is a complex post that I could turn into pages of words... I can elaborate anything in the comments... I'm hurt, but I'll make it through this.
 
I realized that the real reason I haven’t dived into Magick all these years is not because I think it’s fraudulent or too hard, but because I think it is actually the real thing, and could change my life.
 
Not only am I afraid to have what I want, I am afraid to find out what that is. I instead have one idea after another that I don’t pursue, out of both hesitance and a deep knowledge I don’t want it in reality. I think this is why I was drawn to more renunciate traditions like Christianity and Buddhism. They both have amazing teachings, but I was at least partially using them as an excuse to give up on myself and what I wanted. I am not sure why I am afraid of having control over my life, but it feels important that I find out.
 
Does anyone have any reccommendations for me on that basis? I have a sturdy background in meditation, and am currently reading on primer online. Any specific ritual, online resource, or tradition of practice that you could recommend would be a great help to me.A thought I wanted to share to see what the magick community thinks about it:

As a 90’s kid I grew up incredibly immersed in the blossoming industry of videogames. To this day, memories of videogame adventures and places sometimes hold the same importance as real memories or dreams.

Let’s say I hold dear certain places from the successful videogame ‘Zelda Ocarina of Time’. I can sort of feel the vibe of the ‘maps’, the smell, temperature, etc.

What if thousands of other kids have, overtime, infused this invented realities with power through investing their time and energy in engaging with them?

And in a more profound vein, how would this relate to the concept of the astral realm? Could we say then that through this investment some videogame places are powerfully mirrored in the astral?

I don’t know whether what I’m saying is total nonsense or not, but it’d be nice to hear some perspectives on it!

It got me thinking about what others’ reasons are and if it might inspire me.

Personally I got started as a means of protection and prioritizing my personal power. Currently, I’m thinking about the person I’d like to be. I want to feel strong physically and mentally. Know that I can keep myself safe instead of relying on others. I’m going to work on personal power a bit at 11:11 tonight to up the manifestation. I think I’d like to do the things I don’t want to. I can get lazy with my life and my practice, so it’s important to focus and realize my power right now. 

I feel like I’ve given a lot of power away to worry and I’d like to reclaim that power. 

Tell us your reason? Thank you everyone! Wanted to share the sachet I made for the protection of our car and all the passengers. It might give you some ideas...

Colour of the bag: black  
Cleanse the sachet any way you prefer; over incense, palo santo smoke, with sage, with fire over candle flame or by sound...

With your breath awaken each herb and give it purpose you are using it for. Thank each herb before you put it in the bag. The number of herbs is 9.

If you want you can create a sigil to put in the sachet with herbs.

Herbs I used and why:  
\- ROSE for peace and peaceful journey;  
\- CINNAMON for blessing (the journey);  
\- NETTLE for dispelling fear and strengthening the will and aiding in the ability to handle emergencies;  
\- MINT for travel and luck;  
\- YARROW for courage and confidence;  
\- RUE for protection against the evil eye (of other drivers);  
\- BAY for overall protection;  
\- ACORN for protection against lightning and unexpected things happening on the road;  
\- JUNIPER for protection against theft

I also put crystals in the sachet (this too is optional):  
\- CLEAR QUARTZ to amplify the power of the sachet  
\- AMETHYST for peaceful journey  
\- SMOKY QUARTZ & BLACK TOURMALINE for extra protection of the car and passengers.

After closing the sachet leave it on your altar to charge for as long as you think it necessary.  
My sachet hangs from the rear-view mirror.

Of course, if you make a car protection sachet you can omit or replace the ingredients listed here and make it as simple or as complicated as you wish. At the end of the day, it is your intent that really counts ;)   The practice of the occult is a journey of seemingly unending arcane wisdom. As a starting practitioner, I’d like to know what are some materials that changed your practice (positively) and how it changed your overall study. I thought that this might help me narrow down the amount of material I can absorb. 

    I am very overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge that I have been encountering especially with Chaos Magick and Wicca. To be honest, I’m still in the process of finding out if it is the ‘correct’ path for me (or if there is any path for me at all), the only thing that has been keeping me going is the fact that I am very drawn to it. I would also appreciate tips from anyone that has advanced in the said practices. Blessed be! ☾What are some misconceptions, misrepresentations or just plain falsehoods that you find in Occult communities that get on your nerves?I performed a rune sealing ritual upon a mountain while high on Marijuana. While meditating I saw a vision of a ceremony that was taking place for the runes. I translated what I saw into a modern day folktale of sorts. Here you are...

A Tale of 25 Kings & Queens
A modern day folktale

There is great hall inside a mighty and beautiful palace
The hall is lined with decadent banners, dyed more colors than the eye can see
The banners contain the sigils of the 25 realms of the land
Below the banners the room is filled with fine decor and a round table sits in the middle
Around the large ash table sit tall and proud with glimmering crowns, the 25
These 25 are rulers over all the realms
They were found long ago when one gave his sight in order to see
Seeing the confusion in the world they agreed to assist as guides 
All knowing entities that would give aid in times of need
There was Uruz mighty warrior who would lead with power and encouragement
Algiz the prodigal son, giving temperance to the people
Isa to give patience throughout unfruitful days
Jera that gives fulfilment after the proper cycles
Every King, every Queen to play their cards with precise purpose
So it was then that they took their places on thrones within the palace
Sending out messages, Inspiring from the skies 
But their time can not last forever, for nothing does
And when their days are numbered 25 more will make the sky walk
To the castle they must go, to the reach the palace in the clouds
Through ritual a burning will take place
And the Old Kings and Queens will concede to to the New and give way to space
And so the cycle begins
The 25 are eternal>*I attempt no other thing but to excite thee unto the research of this Sacred Magic. But the manner of acquiring the same will come later, in all its perfection, and in its proper time; for it will be taught thee by better Masters than I, that is to say, by those same Holy Angels of God. No man is born into the World a Master, and for that reason are we obliged to learn. He who applieth himself thereunto, and studieth, learneth; and a man can have no more shameful and evil title than that of being an Ignorant person.*I have been able to do this since I was a kid and I have always had trouble describing it.

Basically, I can flip some sort of switch or flex some kind of muscle (not literal) in my chest and begin to experience something that I can only describe as a blast of energy through my body, it's very intense and I can only hold it for a few minutes or seconds and I can barely physically move or breathe while doing it. It's like I am conjuring up a super intense wave of energy through my body that starts in my chest and flows down through my fingers and toes. I have always been able to do this and it's extremely difficult to describe and I have never heard anything about it ever. It's very similar to the feeling you get when you are a good while into meditation and your body begins to numb up and vibrate.**Introduction**

According to Ariel Gatoga, Magickal Adepthood can be achieved using the book of Psalms and only Psalms. This means that if you are a Christian and you have problems using other forms of magick you only need this book. Yes, that's right just the book no candles and nothing else.

In my previous post I showed you according to Ariel Gatoga's system that you:

1. perform an incantation of the Psalm (read it out loud)
2. go line by line and find the occult meanings behind the text of the Psalms.
3. You then meditate on these occult meanings to plant seeds in the which then help aid you in your magick.

&#x200B;

**Towards Adepthood**

By studying and meditating on all 150 Psalms. You will increase your magickal experience

and effectiveness. You do this by spending one day each on one Psalms looking over and finding the occult meanings until you get a full understanding of the hidden meaning behind the Psalm. You will do this for 6 months to a year progressing through each Psalms until you finish the entire book. You do not need to rush, spend as long as you like until you get the understanding.

Ariel Gatoga states, that if you finish the book you receive your 1st degree of initiation, **but you are not finished.** Start over again from the beginning and spend a day or more on the psalm and try to find deeper occult meanings. Once you finish with all 150 you will receive your 2nd degree of initiation. You keep doing this over and over again towards adepthood. This is like practicing a martial arts technique you knew when you were a white belt. By the time you are a black belt you should have performed that technique 10,000 times. That technique that has been performed 10,000 times has a different quality vs a technique that has been performed only 500 times or a technique that has been performed 50 times.

Here is an example of how I did **Psalms 1**

I read it through (this is not a spell so no incantation)

Psalm 1

**1** Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers,

**2** but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.

**3** That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers.

**4** Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.

**5** Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

**6** For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.

**Filtered out keywords and found their occult meanings**

*Blessed* – One full of spiritual power of healing, help or relief.

*Man* – An idea in the Divine mind

*sinners*\- Mistake, error, missing the mark , negative thought patterns, negative thoughtforms

*law* – orderly principle of magick

*lord* – Divine Law Godhead

*day* \- unfoldment, understanding

*night* \- Deep mind

*Tree* \- connection between upper and lower consciousness

*streams* – a small magical current

*water* – Purity, consciousness

*wind* – Thought currents

*judgement* – the perfect but impersonal outworking of universal laws

*righteous* – Harmony between your deep mind your conscious mind and your super conscious minds

**Repurposed the Psalm to get the full context.**

The Divine mind is full of spiritual power and healing. He who chooses to take in the qualities of divinity (Perfect love, infinite intelligence, Divine truth source of all good) walks not in the counsel of the wicked nor follows the way of the negative actions, thought patterns, thoughtforms nor sits in the seats of scoffers but his delight is in the orderly principle of magick of the divine law. He mediates to gain an understanding of divine law which is then imbedded in his subconscious and deep mind.  As a result he is able to connect his upper and lower consciousness which is firmly secure and creates a magical current within that purifies him. Eventually all of this will bear fruit and will be long lasting resulting in him being prosperous in everything that he does.

Negativity, lower vibrational forces, and thought patterns will not be able stay within this person. It will be purged from his conscious minds allowing harmony between the deep mind, the conscious mind and the super conscious minds. The Godhead or divinity is the path to harmony between the deep mind, the conscious mind and the super conscious minds. The person will be elevated from the negativity making it harder for it to exist fully within that person as well as making it less likely for that person to attract negative people, events, or outcomes.

excuse my grammar on this one

So from repurposing this Psalms you can see that it is a protection spell. Not just from within

but from without. By aligning with divinity (Kabbalistic Cross rituals, White light mediations, meditation on scriptures, having  gratitude, will protect you from negative auto suggestions)

&#x200B;

just google Ariel Gatoga if you wanna learn more.To expand a bit, intersections play a steadfast role in my personal practice. Examples of this are braids, street intersections, woven baskets, old iron bridges, etc. I view these intersections as a culmination of energies flowing and intermixing at a node. Sort of like ley lines. They can also act as a net to catch feelings, ideas, moments. 

So my dream-- I was tying a series of knots in a rope that was tied around my leg. Each knot was different and had a different number of steps which correlated with a different number of times the rope crossed over itself. The numbers were significant. Someone asked me if i was practicing the "sacred art of ______" (I dont remember the name). I said no but I have every intention of learning. 

Is there a sacred art of knot tying? Is it related to a certain religion? Is there an occult version? Do i just have to invent this myself??https://i.imgur.com/6wW8BGv.jpg

For close to three years now, I’ve had a very unhealthy and painful yet strong attachment to someone. He’s marrying ‘the love of (his) life’ next month, yet he’s been just as drawn to me as I to him for the entire time…I’ve never felt this connected to anyone and it happened almost immediately. The bond needs to be broken. 

I used two candles (I substituted green for healing with mine) inscribed each, anointed with oils, burned a bay lead with my intention to break the bond, cut a black ribbon connecting our candles then burned the pieces because I didn’t want the remnant left on my heart. The bay leaf cracked and spit and did NOT want to stay lit. Had my red carnelian heart for courage and positive life choices, rose quartz to heal my heart, black obsidian to protect my heart. The candles both burned smoothly and strongly. Ironically the spell concluded at 2:22 - divine sign letting you know that’s new cycle is about to start in your life.I have a problem with intrusive  thoughts in life often  negative ones and I was wondering if it is still safe to work on magick with this problem. i notice at times when I try to do magic the bad thoughts will inject what if it doesn't work does x bad thing instead to you. And of course being worried about these thoughts appearing and causing spells to backlash only makes the thoughts more nagging.

Im currently just beginning at magick. So basic tarot and learning about runes. And a basic warding spell. This is the one where im afraid that my intrusive thoughts will turn it from ward to curse or something. Also just started working through that visual chaos magick pdf guide only at the breathing meditation exercises so far.

Does this make magic overly unsafe. does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?Hey guys, ive recently gone into a sort of spiritual journey which ive been recently introduced to in the form of tarot card, it really intrigued me, to the point where i found a magick 101 course and found that astrology and reading your birth chart is the key to finding yourself. I recently found out that I am a double virgo which means that my virgo qualities are the one that are most apparent in me (basically like a double virgo my chart mentions a lot about my intelectual abilities but i tend to really lack on my emotional side, sometimes i feel like a robot, but i know i am not one if that makes sense). During this whole process I have felt like my life has been clicking into place like i am finding out what my purpose is and its great, i am at peace right now (: 
anyways i know this won’t really make a lot of sense to a lot of people because i tend to psychoanalyze things and notice details some people can’t seem to connect but i just need light energy from everyone and to be able to manifest what it is i am meant to do. thank you if you made it this far, i know i probably ranted a lot in this but this information can be important to some people.Is it important to you to be well educated in the origins of whatever magical path(s) you follow?  If so, how has your learning affected the development of your practices/beliefs? 

Also, how do you distinguish between accurate, evidence-based information and "grandmother stories" or indoctrinated ideas?For fire I have a chili pepper and candles

For air I have rosemary in a bundle and incense

For earth I have salt and chicken bones

For water I have a shell but would like something else that isn't...liquid


What do you represent water with?


Thank you and blessed be ✌️


Edit:  all of your suggestions are great and thank you, I will discover which suits me best ✨Hi! I have a neighbor that is leaving a single garlic clove outside my backyard fence that is in between our houses (it’s on our property & the NW corner of our house if that makes a difference?). 

My mom is concerned and is getting bad vibes from it. I originally felt it was protection/good luck but I’m worried about my mom’s negative reaction to it - she’s been throwing it away but then another one will show up not longer after. Just a single clove of garlic.

Any ideas what this is and how we should approach this?

Thank you so much in advance!!I don’t have a lot of friends who believe in/are interested in magick, and it can be lonely. r/needafriend isn’t very helpful for finding fellow practitioners... would anyone be interested to hit me up, call or video chat, maybe over discord? Send a chat if interested! :)

Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I thought it would! Thank you for all the replies, I will try to get to everyone. Y’all are great 😊If so which angels and archangels are good to work with ?I am looking for a coven to call my own. I have people I interact with in my local shop, but none that I practice with. I am on a bit of an island and with Covid, socializing IRL is not an option. Im hoping one you you in this group has an opening in your coven or knows of a good one?   Thanks in advance, lovies!So scrolling and reading some posts I've came across some do's and dont of magick. Some pros and cons. Some ways things can back fire. From my limited understanding, and forgive me if this question is naive but I am quite new to this. If faith or belief is the main force of magick and if what you decide becomes what it is. Couldn't you over come these obstacles and backfires by simply rejecting them. But not to just reject and ignore but to come up with a reason logical to yourself of why there wouldn't be any problems or complications. Sorry this hard to put into words but for example if I did a spell and someone told me "well there can be an issue here because etc." Wouldnt that complication only exist because I seen it as a possibility? Could you come up with a system free from any restrictions due to morality or any other principles that could hinder it. Wouldnt the doubt itself or the idea of it not working be the only friction or resistance to it?
Sorry if it's hard to understand what I'm saying but I feel as tho the only limit or issue to magic would simply be the ones you create or believe. But like I said I'm new so please dont flame me to crisp I'm just curious.I thought it would be interesting to not only show my goals but Im curious to see what goals others have.

So I'll start first.
1) Find the Name of my guardian angel and his sigil and evoke him.

2) create a Liber Angelos which is an Angelic Book personal to you

3) Explore the 7 heavens if possible

4) Further refine my astrological skills by adding Anglic inputs and perspectives into my chart delineations.

I realize some of these goals may be impossible but I ask why not you live only once in this body.We've all got our favourite magickal texts/grimoires. Some are great reads, others are boring as bat$hit but have great practical application.

The question is, what magick book gave you that 'Aha' moment when you could feel a total paradigm shift in the way you thought/viewed the world?

Cheers!I love magick and occult and all the weird stuff that come with it. But from time to time "reality" hits me in face. I've watched few horror movies where hidden monster is some sort of mental illness in the grandparent. Since we are more open minded to things of other worldly nature, do you think we would be more prone to mental illnesses like dementia, alzaimers, Parkinson etc? I understand that majority of readers on reddits are quite young, but at 30 I do think about stuff life getting old, from a more realistic view. some something I wonder about.I had a problem, which was flaming my depression, for a long time. I listened and prayed to Aphrodite. After that I had a sudden shift in thinking. That problem didn't bother me anymore, although it was making me suicidal for many years.

I take this as a positive sign from Aphrodite. How can I make sure that it was Aphrodite that relieved me of the stress?

How do I honor her responding to me?I have been practicing Celtic witchcraft for about 3 years now and today I decided to find a patron so I did some research and found Apollo   I made an offering and called apron him, I asked that he take the offering and to think about being my patron. I then went outside and set up an altar for him with incense a candle and the offering. After setting it up, I sat there for a second and a bee came up and landed on the altar, I didn’t really think anything of it but it was in the back of my mind, so I just did some looking in a deity book I have and it says that bees represent sun gods. So what do you think am I overreacting or not.I've been non-religious, atheistic for pretty much my entire life, but in the last 2 years, I've gotten into learning about psychics, manifesting, spellwork, etc. And I really want to believe in it because my life is so bad that I feel like I want this one out or way of showing me that life isn't only horrors.


But despite some accurate experiences with psychics, and some success with spellwork, I can't shake this scepticism that none of it is real and I'm holding onto false hope and none of it is actually real. It's driving me absolutely crazy because sometimes I can believe and other times I just can't.


How do I find some way of getting over the scepticism?Question! I've been pondering over this for a while since I've started my spiritual journey.

When I was around 12-13yo I had these terrible nightmares and anxiety before going to sleep. I always imagined these dark figures and had some conversations with them before bed and even named them. One was Death the classic dark roped figure holding a scythe, second was this three headed black dog and third this "the ring"- girl. 
I'll mention here that I used to watch too many scary movies for my age and was probably traumatized by them. We also tried few times ouija board with my friend (by this i mean self made "board" from paper and a cup)but I don't think we ever contacted anyone.

Anyway my anxiety got so bad that I begged to leave me alone and even made a deal with them that if they leave me alone they can take my soul when I'm 69 (nice) years old. My night terrors and anxiety didn't really stop but after I was 16-17 years old. I don't remember if I saw them again after the "deal". So I'm thinking is this just trauma or could I possibly made a deal with a some kind of deity(-ies)?The following will be a recount of an experience I had very recently. It is not an attempt to slander, judge, or to posit any sort of metaphysical declaration. It is simply an honest to god sharing of an experience as a means for me to reflect and perhaps even try to understand it for myself. The language used will of course be biased to my own theological paradigm because it is the only way I know how to communicate these experiences. The nature of the forces we try to contend with as practitioners of the art are of such unimaginable magnitude and is beyond whatever description I can even try to produce. Do reinterpret it based on your own paradigm.

*>Preliminary Remarks<*

I would like to start off by admitting that this evocation was attempted with zero regard for decorum, astrological correspondences or any sort of due diligence. I had ZERO experience with evocation and I simply saw the full moon as an opportunity to "contact" angels with such a disgusting (in retrospect) arrogance. And yes, I was fully 100 fucking percent beyond all measure of doubt put in my place and even got my ass handed back to me. The acid itself should have been NO problem at all to handle, 250ug is a good and solid all-purpose dose. But it's the very attempt to profanely contact these forces that gave me the metaphysical beat down I probably deserved. The only thing I did beforehand was a quick LBRP to empty the vessel and an MPR to establish some sort of alignment.

*>The actual experience<*

I struggle to find words to describe it but in essence it was a presence that came crashing down from the gates of heaven with such an intense zeal and conviction which apprehended me in a state of completely not being able to do anything. What appeared before me was an entity of geometric perfection and sublime beauty, yet at the same time commanding such a brutal violence. It said unto me, "YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH". Then it showed me a vision of a grand, cosmic spiritual war that my pitiful existence is not in any way shape or form prepared to even begin to understand. That angels and demons absolutely 100% exist, and operate at states of consciousness I am so untrained and unprepared for that it's almost insulting to them if not for the fact that my pathetic scrambling to conjure up some HAPPENING to have an oh look at me I'm doing magick moment was so pathetically minuscule to what they have to deal with. That the angel-demon opposition is not a superhero movie good-bad dichotomy and simply the give and take of different natures. It then proceeded to completely disassemble and dismantle every arrogant, prideful and hubristic assumption I had about myself and my relation to not-self.

The next 4 hours was spent trying to come to grips with what the fuck just happened and fetal-position shuddering in genuine terror. Personally, this whole experience completely shattered my assumption that supernatural forces exist only within the psyche. It felt like an external not-me (as if self and other even apply anymore) kind of thing and that I have unwittingly offered my consciousness as an empty vessel for it to appear and do whatever it wants with zero safeguards or protection on my part. I am so unbelievably grateful that I only got off with a stern lecture instead of whatever could have happened in a possession.

So in conclusion, I have SO much more I need to study before I even attempt something like this again.I don't presume to receive some shocking thing immediately. But what can I expect? What should I look for?

I plan to repeat my ritual as necvesary, but would like some wisdom from others as what to expect/look for or any helpful advice from others who have gone through the sameI have recently wanted to get into witchcraft and paganism. My only problem, I have an insufferable cloud of shame/doubt hanging over me constantly when it comes to the subject. When I was a kid my mom practiced and was part of a group that did rituals together but the community was unfortunately pretty toxic for me. Now I'm living with my Dad who I thought would be cool with my interest since he also practiced when he was my age and raised me reading norse mythology. But I never do anything while he's home because I'm scared he'll judge me. Also, I have a solid amount of "happenings" to believe that Loki is a patron of mine but because of the "loki buzz" on the internet when ever I reach out about it people tell me I'm just a crazed marvel fan. Which is not helping me to figure anything out at all. I'm worried I'm doing everything wrong and maybe the people around me are right. I recently thought I felt the presence of another deity, but due to the negativity I have experienced am having a hard time excepting anything new into my life even though the experience I had with this deity was so unbelievably positive. And just as a cherry on top today, to try and educate myself I was reading, "WICCA A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner" and had two other wicca books on my bed and my dad came in and picked up the book and said, "Uh oh. What's this?" and because I was super nervous I just said, "Nothing I'm just reading." And he said, "Good." before leaving my room.  Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. And how one might go about moving on from the shame/anxiety.Hi, i was wondering if there are any stones than can help me with my anxiety. Sometimes i just feel like i can't take all the energy in my body, it makes me feel dizzy, sick and sometimes i get panick attacks. 
If you have any advice i would appreciate it, thank youI really enjoyed this sub. It was a fountain of practical information and a gathering of practical mages, witches, whatever..

But lately most of the posts are nearly unrelated questions or pictures of altars. Seriously, isn't there a sub JUST FOR ALTAR PICTURES where they can be shown off?

I'm gonna leave here and want to ask: where are the magical practitioners gone? Which is the subreddit I desire?I am going to share what I have learned over the years in the endeavor of the guilty pleasure that is utilizing magick towards the lottery (draw games, specifically). I am well aware that this is indeed a *guilty* pleasure in magickal practice, so I might catch some flack and down votes for this thread, but *whatever*, here's to all the other naughty practitioners out there. 

&#x200B;

**However**, I want to clarify a few things upfront first:

1. Nothing about this is actually difficult or mysterious. In fact, it's the sort of thing where if it hasn't clicked for you already, then you should experience it as a sort of, "Oh, of course!" click. Everything you need to know will be included in this post, so no, I'm not trying to sell you anything, and you don't need to do anything outlandish or ridiculous like a sacrifice or whatever. You just need to be able to think openly and strategically while you read this.
2. This is a not about winning some huge jackpot prize. This is about coming out ahead over time and having a little extra spending money in your pocket. If someone is willing to read through this massive wall of text just to figure out how to get a little extra spending money, then they likely really could use the money, so here I am to help you out. Paying it forward and all that jazz.
3. You will, however, need to have an established methodology of magick of your own as a foundation. It really doesn't matter what your approach entails, whether you are the candle magick type, the cardinal elements type, the dance in a circle for an hour and then releasing your energy into the cosmos type, or whatever else. Your personal method doesn't matter, as long as it jives with your intuition, but you do need to have a personal method to get started. This post is about how to have *a great deal of energy out there be to your advantage*, rather than having it work against you.
4. Using this overall conceptual system, you will typically be buying just **one** ticket at a time, so you need to have some self-discipline. If you have a problem with compulsive gambling or addiction, then get your butt out of this thread and into a support group, because the rest of your life still matters.

&#x200B;

Alright folks, you know who you are: You've been trying to use magick to win a big jackpot prize on one of those lottery draw games, and it hasn't worked, and after weeks, months or even years of miserable failure, you're left wondering if there is really anything to that nonsense. Well, yes and no. The problem is that you're not thinking expansively in terms of how personal energy works, and so you're not being strategic. You're setting yourself up with a more or less impossible task, and then feeling bummed out when you fail. Instead, what you need to do is give yourself a much easier goal, and then reap more gradual payoffs over time.

&#x200B;

The first major thing to understand with this sort of spell work is that everyone's energy counts, not just your own. This also includes everyone who isn't consciously trying to will their energy towards a goal. It is not the case that someone's personal energy doesn't exist until they realize it exists, nor is it the case that someone's personal energy never does anything unless they are consciously aware of it. **Everyone has and uses personal energy**, and for the vast majority of people, their personal energy is willed through their subconscious. This is why trying to utilize spell work to aim for a big jackpot prize is an exercise in futility. Since only one number combination will be drawn, and thus only one number combination can win, that means that if your spell work goal (intent) is to win the jackpot by matching all of your numbers, then it is a case of your personal energy versus the personal energy of *many thousands to millions of other people*, depending on the game, and each source of energy, each individual, is also in conflict with each other. Needless to say, that is **a lot** of very conflicting energy, which is why it all winds up getting neutralized into a chaotic 'blob' of energy, so to speak, when it comes to the jackpot.

&#x200B;

Another phenomenon of this nature that you will notice is that very, very often, when a jackpot size surpasses a certain threshold, suddenly it really gets on a roll and keeps rolling over, *over and over*, getting ridiculously bigger and bigger, despite millions of more tickets being sold than usual in the resulting frenzy. That doesn't seem to make much statistical sense, but it happens *all the time*. This happens because millions of people find it extra exciting when a jackpot gets to a certain size, and so in addition to sending out their own energy for them to personally win the jackpot, they simultaneously start sending out energy towards the jackpot **not hitting**. They don't want the jackpot to be reset (unless *they* win it, of course), because then all the special excitement will fizzle out. So what happens is that suddenly the jackpot just isn't hitting over and over again despite so many millions more tickets being in play. Again the energy gets very chaotic, messy and 'clogged up' until finally raw probability takes its course, and someone finally wins an obscene amount of money.

&#x200B;

Now - there are two main approaches in spell work, and both are very useful if used for the right situations. When it comes to spell work that is meant to impact only yourself, then it is best to really tailor everything to your own personal intuition. For example, if you want to do a healing ritual bath, then you really ought to pick herbs or oils that resonate with you in a healing way. Same for spell work to make you more attractive, make you more at peace, make you more energetic, and so on. *However*, when it comes to spell work that is meant to have an external effect, especially a significant or far reaching one, then **it is much more strategic to synchronize with pre-established reserves of energy and strong associations that have already accumulated in the universe**. In essence, you want to ride the waves and "piggyback" off of the energy already out there, while minimizing energy conflict as much as you can. This *significantly* increases the success chance of your spell work, because it makes your spell work so much easier.

&#x200B;

Remember the point about how if you aim for the jackpot prize, then it will be your energy versus the energy of millions of other people. However, when you are aiming low just to have some extra spending money in your pocket, suddenly you can **minimize energy conflict** while also **synchronizing your own will to a very large reserve of energy** being put out there by millions of other people. This is also where number choice actually matters, because in order to minimize energy conflict while synchronizing with as many other people as possible, it really is a simple matter of aiming low while *having numbers in common with as many other people as possible*. Again this is not the time to be rebellious and unique; this is a the time to go with the flow and ride those waves.

&#x200B;

**Nearly everyone who has at least a couple numbers in common with you is subconsciously generating and launching personal energy towards all of their numbers hitting - but that includes two of** ***your*** **numbers by default.** If your intent or spell work goal is to have at least 2 of your numbers hit, then everyone with at least 2 numbers matching yours will be generating and launching energy *towards your spell's goal/intent* by default, and yet you won't be in conflict with any of those people, because your focused intent/goal leaves room for the rest of the numbers to differ in any combinations. To capitalize on this energy piggybacking as much as possible, again you need to choose numbers that are much more likely to be shared by many more players out there. So on that note:

&#x200B;

Many, *many* people play "date numbers" such as birth dates and anniversary dates. In order to have as many people as you can with at least a couple numbers in common with you, then against all popular advice, only choose numbers within the **1-31 range**, and aim for two of those numbers to month numbers, 1-12. It doesn't matter what game you are playing, whether it is a huge one like Powerball or a smaller one like your state's Pick 5 game. Stick with numbers that are within the "dates" range. 

&#x200B;

Additionally, many people who go the opposite way, relying on statistics rather than sentimental dates, like to use a hot/cold system. Many more people choose hot numbers than cold numbers. So furthermore, in addition to only using numbers 1-31, only use numbers from that range that are also considered "hot" - meaning that those numbers have hit a lot, either in recent drawings, or in the total history of the drawings. You easily find this information with a simple search online, and in many cases from your state's lottery website, as lottery commissions like to encourage any popular method of gambling (naturally).

&#x200B;

Again the goal here is that because you want to have your energy-goal/intent **synchronized with the subconscious energy of as many people as possible**, and thus you want as many people as possible to have at least a couple numbers in common with you, you are trying to pick numbers that are going to be in play by more people, and choosing numbers that are both "hot" and also within the dates range (1-31), you are significantly increasing this factor in your favor.

&#x200B;

There is one caveat to this part, however. A rigidly held or fixed belief is a very powerful form of personal energy. Therefore, avoid number combinations that the vast majority of people believe should not come up. This includes the number combination 01 02 03 04 05, in 5-number games such as Powerball, even though there is a small percentage of people who play that combination every drawing. The vast majority of people hold the belief that this combination should never be drawn, regardless of the saying that all combinations have the same chance, and that belief is like a *massive wall of energy*. Do not try to go up against that wall. Sure, there is always the chance, but the whole point here is exercising personal energy via magickal practice, not to leave everything up to pure chance. The other thing to avoid in this regard is trying to get the same number set or special number (mega ball, power ball, lucky ball) to come up over and over again (more than twice, really). **Hundreds of millions of people** rigidly believe that this *shouldn't happen*, and the resulting energy wall is a force to be reckoned with. Remember, this is all about making your spell work **easier**, as opposed to way more difficult than it has to be. Be flexible and *ride the waves*.

&#x200B;

Once you have put together your numbers for a Pick 5 or Pick 6 game, in your spell work, you are to **aim low**. If it only takes 2 matching numbers to win the smallest prize, then your spell goal is to get 2 of your numbers - **any 2** \- to come up. What this means is that you will no longer have any energy conflict with anyone out there who has at least 2 numbers in common with yours, but rather you will be synchronized with them (since the vast majority of people are subconsciously willing for all of their numbers to match), and thus piggybacking onto all their combined energy. If more of your numbers wind up matching, then consider it a coincidental bonus, but remember - in your spell work, the goal is that **any 2** of your numbers might match. The same method holds true in a game where 3 numbers are the minimum to match for a prize.

&#x200B;

**Do not make the mistake** of using a specific prize amount as your goal/intent for your spell work, such as having, "Four dollars" be the goal just because that's the minimum prize. Your spell work should be *open* to the *coincidence* of a bigger prize, but the goal/intent should be specifically on, "at least 2 (or 3) of these numbers" - or on a specific special number (see below). This does not rule out the possibility of more numbers matching, but it still gives your spell work a very specific intent/goal, which gives your spell work some oomph without being limiting.

&#x200B;

For the draw games that have a special ball (Powerball, Mega Millions and Lucky For Life), use the same process (above) to pick the main numbers or white ball numbers. Then in your actual spell work, **ignore those numbers completely**. They will not be so much as regarded when it comes to your intent/goal. You will be *passively* synchronizing and piggybacking onto the energy of thousands to potentially millions of people who have at least a couple numbers in common with you, but you will be in energy conflict with nobody over any of the main numbers, because you are not going to focus on the main numbers or white ball numbers at all in your spell work. 

&#x200B;

**Instead**, you are going to focus just on the **special ball**, and again you are going to tap into as much energy that is already operating out there as possible. Again, you will do this by picking a "hot" number for the special ball number, because so many people play "hot" numbers. By ignoring the main numbers in your spell work, and focusing instead only on the special number, you are reducing the ratio from you energy versus the energy of millions of people, to a ratio of just 1:18, 1:25 or 1:26 depending on the game. This is because you are no longer in energy conflict with any of them over the main numbers, but you are **synchronizing and piggybacking** onto the energy of everyone who has the same special ball number as you (while passively your main numbers are synchronized with as many people as possible, as well, so you see how you are weaving this magickal 'web' to work in your favor with much less effort). 

**Remember!** Do not use a specific amount of prize money as the spell's intent. "Powerball 12" *not* "Four Dollars."

&#x200B;

When you incorporate this more expansive view of how personal energy works, then you can be much more strategic in how to use the whole thing to your advantage, by going with the flow, rather than trying to compete (and thus be in conflict) with millions of other people's energy. This in turn will make your spell work *much* easier when it comes to having some naughty magickal fun with the lottery. If your own personal magickal methodology is working for you in general, and you go into it with this mindful awareness and strategic intent, then you should start seeing improved results. What this will look like in practice (based on my own experience, yours may be even better, who knows), is that you will win nothing uncommonly, win the small prize often, and occasionally even win a nicer prize. You won't be getting crazy-rich by the end of the month, but again you will have a little extra padding for the pocket, which is always nice.

&#x200B;

**Final Tip**: Remember not to have your energy be in conflict *with itself* **or** spread thin. Buy just one ticket per drawing, **just one**. And of course, have fun.The rule of three isnt gospel. 
Hexing while probably not the maturest route isnt neccesarily dangerous. 
Obviously the biggest danger comes with hexing someone who may not deserve it which can have unseen repercussions.I was 14. This was a good 6 years ago. Ironically enough it came to me a lot easier than one would seem, I believe so anyways. I naturally turned towards it after when my stepdad started coming around and stripped my weak Christian beliefs rarely instilled in me as a child from my parents. Atheism didn’t feel right either though, it felt so... empty. 

So I began researching alternative beliefs and spiritualism and first read about any kind of magick itself within Simon’s Necronomicon, though I didn’t take it too seriously. Later I met and became friends with my school’s infamous gay warlock, who was very unapologetic and seemed crazy to most. I showed curiosity and he pointed me to Witchcraft and Wicca to start, and actually involved me in a few spells and his magickal side of things. 

After a year or two of befriending him he left town and I have continued my personal path (Hermeticism mostly) until recent day alone. It’s been a wild ride for sure and my opinion on magic is so much more. It’s not nearly what an everyday person would guess it to be. It has become the epitome of the word journey, and has completely changed how I experience life. 

Share your story! Thanks, DI’ve been practicing the LBRP for the past few days and damnnnn it’s actually a really cool ritual. If you really consider what all takes place within, it’s hard NOT to believe it’s magic. To feel the elements off of the archangels, to see the blue flames, to feel the names of God emanating from my being... man I’m getting a magic stiffy thinking about it. 

How do y’all personally view this (or maybe a different) magical ritual?hello! i started practicing magick about 6 months ago and I want to know how I can comunicate with my spirit guides. How do you started? :)
Thank you!The tree of life isnt only just a map our reality. It can be used for spell working.

There are three types of spell work here.
1.) One involves petitioning the archangels of the sphere according to their correspondences to obtain things like money, job, health, peace, stability, etc.

2.) The second is a vision quest. Now this vision question is a visualizatiom that start s with the lower most Sphere Malkuth which is governed by Archangel Sandalphin. Doing this vision will allow you to contact the angelic entities of these spheres so that you can recieve messages for spiritual growth.

3.) The last and easiest use for the tree of life is to make "sigils" of the sphere you focus and meditate on it for growth and to attune your energies to the spheres

Intention written on paper and burnt in the candle’s flame; its ashes left to submerge in the melted wax.I ask because, at least in my community - magick and all that it entails does not necessarily yield material gain. Are there any corporate witches living luxuriously, traveling as they wish and owning whatever they desire? I am working to understand the common understanding that magick is incredibly effective as far as influencing the material world, but observing that I haven’t come across any wealthy witches. Why is that? Does it build a richer spiritual world as opposed to enriching the one all humans currently interact with?What are everyone’s plans for the full moon tonight (Feb. 27, 2021)? I would love to have a great discussion about ideas on spells and other magical thingsIs this possible?  I really have a growing disdain for the Bible, but everything in magick seems to revolve around Jewish mysticism.  It’s hard to get into the rituals when I’m calling out the names of a god who I kind of think is an asshole.I keep trying to do magick to manifest sex and money but by the time I get myself into a space where I'm sufficiently connected with the divine or the higher self I find that all my desires have disappeared and all I want is more love/union/connection with the Holy One and peace and joy for all living beings! Help!!!Hey y’all, I hope someone on here can answer my question. I have recently started studying and learning about magick, and I hope to advance more on this path in the new year. My question is about the origins of these teachings from ancient Sumaria. I actually grew up catholic, and I have become increasingly aware that judeo-christian practices come from the same ancient texts (like the kaballah I think?).

I do know that Christianity views god and the devil as external forces, but in magick they are aspects of our own higher and lower consciousness.

Basically I’m just wondering if modern Christianity has the same origins but is essentially “missing the mark.” Is there anything that can be learned from these modern religions? Also if they do miss the mark, why have the original meanings been misconstrued so much?This is the first Halloween I’m spending as a magick practitioner and I was wandering what sorta stuff would be a good idea to do while the veil is at its thinnest, given the pandemic has put to bed my original plan of watching horror movies with my friends. 

So far I’ve done a couple of sigils, one under instruction from a goddess, practiced the LBRP and spoken to a couple deities via meditation, but nothing too major yet. I’m half tempted to just throw a Psychic party for the various entities I’ve met thus far 😂

But yeah, always open to inspiration, what do you folks like to do for the spooky season? 😊So I've been practicing magick my whole life. My mom has been practicing magick since she was a little girl so she's past her knowledge down to me. About 5 years ago i started using my own blood(just a few drops) when i do things such as charging crystals, spells, rituals, incantations, making charms, hex bags etc. because I was told using one’s own blood is considered one of the most potent forms of magick as your intent and energy are embedded in it. I've had pretty good success doing this and I was curious if anyone else has learned about this and had done these types of things and how did it workout for them? Thank you for any and all input on the subject. Hopefully this makes sense.It happens so often, I have a cemetery in a corner of my garden. A year ago it was a parakeet wondering around in my front yard. Died that night from dehydration. Then a small fledgling was found in my garden after a bad thunderstorm, no nests nearby. Died a few hours later from exhaustion I imagine. Found a dead mouse on my porch right on my doorstep. Today I found a baby garden snake in my bathroom, gave it a warm place to hide until the workers were done outside. When it came time to put the little fella outside in the garden……dead. Why do animals come to me to die? It breaks my heart. It’s happened so much that I can’t pass it off as life or coincidence.For some reason I have been feeling great anticipation for tonight's full moon. Anyone else? Does anyone have any specific plans? I have been out of practice for a while, but have been gradually regaining the attraction over the past few weeks ..Hi, Im Fixed Cross, got initiated in Magick by the ritual suicide of my best friend in my garden (I had no choice, he was heavily into the occult and by his brutal act awakened all kinds of terrifying psychic powers in me which led first to a near psychosis and gradually to as fruitful training in all sorts of Magick) - it wasn't long, about 5 years after the fact, that I discovered Kabbalah. I studied it intensively for 15 years and as I hit 40, something pushed me to start teaching a bit about it. That was in 2017. Ive been treating the tree of life from the top down, and have recently finished my tenth video. I'll post the eleven of them below, I hope they will be of use to some magicians.

As you can see there are two Sephirot not on the list, Tipharet and Malkuth. It could simply be that they are too massive for me to comprehend from this top down perspective, though I go into Tipharet a lot in the video on Netzach.  I will have to see where my developments lead.  As you can also see Im going through a rather dramatic change during the process. Ive had to learn a lot about things like good and evil too be able to make the descent from the middle into the lower triad. It's been a crazy journey.

Shalom, 93/93

Odin bless this day. 

Fixed CrossI bought a book of spells to start practicing witchcraft and magick and found some spells to increase psychic intuition or to strengthen ones psychic abilities and a lot of them include the herbs mugwort or wormwood which I read are really strong herbs for strengthening psychic abilities. However the author warns that the different forms of mugwort and wormood can be toxic in some instances? Is it safe to make mugwort tea and drink it or should I stay away from those spells?It's a really simple but powerful system that uses enochian magick, a great curriculum for those who are interested but have no idea where to start. Enochian magick can sound daunting and even dangerous to some people so I appreciate that this book doesn't bombard you with information overload. It's only 75 pages.I had a dream last night about being contacted by a spirit/goddess. She told me her name, spelled it and everything, and I can’t remember what it is. 

It wasn’t a name I recognized, but it was short and two syllables. I remember vaguely that it was explained weird, like Leslie or Lexi/Levi or something but with an H in frontI'll start with mine first





My father died and I lost my primary job and slept in my car. So I went to Archangel Sachiel during the month of Cancer while Jupiter was in Sagittarius. During the waxing moon phase period on a Thursday in Hour of Sachiel I drew his pentacle on a piece of paper using a protractor and his color correspondences. I wrote my petition underneath the pentacle in celestial alphabet. I said my prayers and then disposed of it a month later.

Out of nowhere a woman client for personal training I knew kept bothering me about joining the army. She said with my qualifications I would be a BIOMEDICAL TECHNICIAN THAT PAYS OVER 6 FIGURES IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD. I got that position I am greatful I am extremely humbled.

You will know the angel helps you becuase you will experience these correspondances. For example the Archangel I called out to Rules Sagittarius abd Pisces. The woman who helped me was a pisces.Hello I’m new to magick and Iv been working with ceremonial magick like the golden dawn system and Damien Echols teachings. But I come from a Buddhist and Hindu background more or less and I was wondering if all the magick stuff is just the siddhis or if magick works differently then the siddhis?I've been on a spiritual path for a few years, but I just started practicing magick daily about 6 months ago after I got Damien Echols' beginner book.

Since then my life has improved quite a bit.
I've been able to focus better and direct my thoughts and emotions more clearly. I'm learning more about what I truly want in life and how to achieve my goals.

However, magick has really driven me apart from my old life.
A lot of my friends seem more reluctant to talk to me because they get a little weirded out by my esoteric interests.
And it caused my gf and I to break up. Or maybe helped me realize I don't want to be with her.
Regardless, she has a sour taste for any religious or spiritual lifestyles and told me she wouldn't have dated me if she knew I was going to get this "religious".

I mean fair enough, my devotion to magick has grown a lot since covid.


I'm viewing all these changes in my life as positive because i am actually getting to know my real self for the first time.

Has anyone else seen any drastic changes in their life?Whenever I go out to connect with the moon and my deities, I dance. I turn on music, hold inscense, and I dance freely on this concrete slab right next to the treeline of the forest.
The other night I was dancing and I thought I saw a few small dots of light that moved quickly out of my vision. We don't really get fireflies where I live, and they didn't light up again like a firefly.
Now, behind my house there's a line of little trees that follows the path behind everyone's house, but beside my tree, multiple bushes have kind of grown beneath it, where they haven't under everyone else's, and they're rather big bushes.
Could this be the fae, or is it simply good fortune from the earth welcoming my practice?Hey all, thanks for hanging in there while we make some quick changes. 

If you look to the right of the screen you will see an updated set of rules! The mod team worked hard to incorporate your feedback, and have decided that the subreddit should serve as a resource to improve our practice and knowledge. 

Rule 1 exists because hostility adds nothing to the discussion. Rule 2 because this only limits the language we can use to express Magickal thought. We have Rule 3 because links taking people away from the subreddit don't add to the discussion. And lastly, Rule 4 because if you're playing with Magick, you're going to have to do some work yourself.

We hope these rules serve you well. We welcome any questions.

In the meantime, please find our new [Art, Pics & Promos Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/j2i0o4/biweekly_art_pics_promos_thread_93020101420/?), a place to see and share all sorts of fun stuff. We also have a [Beginner's Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/ivfo6d/wondering_where_to_begin_have_questions/) available too. Newcomers to the subreddit are being kind enough to direct their questions there, let's ensure we're repaying their effort by helping to answer them :)

I hope everyone is doing well, and I wish you all a Blessed Full Moon. :)Music and Magick have always seemed somewhat similar to me, but I haven’t found any books about combining the two. Have any of you read any good books about making music with the influence of magick? Or if you have a YouTube channel to recommend, that would be appreciated as well.As an eclectic practitioner, I've always been curious about starting a coven, however it's hard to find people for that sort of thing. My friends and wife are all of different faiths, even though we are all interested in the craft. I'm wiccan (solitary, I align with the horned God and triple goddess and nature, but I feel it gets a little too organized in the other forms of wicca)  my friends are Norse Pagan, Levayan Satanist and my wife is just a witch. She has no alignment with a religion and she doesn't work with Any entities, though she is showing interest. 


TL;DR : Can you have a coven full of different faiths? Do you have advice for starting a coven?This is probably no surprise to most here but I’m super new to magick and energy alchemy so it was so buzzy and exciting for me when I could feel the ring start vibrating in my palm. He had his hands over mine and he said that he could feel the vibration through my hands too! We also did it with his wedding band and we felt it vibrate a little too but not as much as mine - I think it might have been because his ring was just a form of metal whereas my ring and all the other pieces of jewellery I did later had gemstones. I thought I believed in the energetic power and potential of crystals but I must’ve still had some skepticism before tonight. But all my skepticism is gone now 🤩 

Just wanted to share ☺️hey guys, I've been a witch for a relatively long time and since the begining of my practice I noticed that even tho I use the same method some spell works doesn't seem to have any result, some works for a really short period of time despite the amount of energy I put on them and some just gives me impressive results despite my low efford. I notice that sometimes for a period of time my spells doesn't work no matter what I do, as if I'm blocked. Do y'all have a similar experience or have a constant pattern of results? If so, how you got there?Has anyone else experienced this? Im now about 9 months into my practice of magick. Around the second month of doing the lbrp as regularly as possible and getting used to it, I had an experience that amazed me and I am curious if anyone has had anything similar happen to them. I had finished my morning routine, (at the time, just the QC and the LBRP). I went downstairs, sat on my couch and I saw the strangest of things. Countless tiny orbs of light, ranging from the size of a bb pellet to a quarter were floating up and around me. I remember hearing myself say, "well thats new". I did some research and can only come to the conclusion that they must've been bugs that have died in that room who's spirits were floating away as a result of the lbrp. If you have had a similar experience or have any relevant information, please post it if you'd like, anything is helpful !I have used this ritual not created by myself to protect my circle before I travel to different worlds for various reasons; it's worked out great however I feel like I'm not reaching my full potential. I edited it to suit myself more which was great. Now I feel like I need to take it a step deeper and all out create my own ritual set up to protect my space I'm working in before traversing dimensions. I have a few ideas and sigils I made I have been working with awhile that I plan on incorporating. What do you guys do? How elaborate or simple is your protection method before doing this?It just hit me today that animals probably don’t act like this around other people unless they’re people like me.

Squirrels and small birds, probably the most skittish of them all will come extraordinarily close to look at me before darting away sometimes, but the other times they sit and stare.

I also experience a lot of affection and attention from other people’s pets, even the ones that are usually “offish” with strange people. My family literally called me the animal whisperer of the family growing up.

I don’t think I’m special for any of this, I think there are probably a lot of people like us who also have these experiences.

How many of you also experience this same connection with animals and nature?Hi so I’ve recently had some awakenings regarding religion and I’ve been looking into other methods of accessing my inner self and spirituality and so on. I’m supper interested in Buddhism and other dharmic practices and recently been introduced to magick and other spiritual practices, but even though the internet is useful it’s really hard to know where to start. So I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out where to start learning and practicing magick?I’ve been trying to project for years now, several times laying still for 1-2 hours at a time with my mind perfectly awake and body as paralyzed as it can be. I’m almost to the point where I’ll just have to accept that it’ll happen when it’ll happen, but I’d still love to experience other variations of reality in the astral plane. Can any experienced projectors help? Personal messages are also welcome.

Thanks and have a nice day!There's this book called [Magickal Cashbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22070705-magickal-cashbook)*,* that teaches how to establish contact with Nitika, which «*is neither an angel or demon, but is thought of as a genius spirit or ‘personified virtue’*», with the purpose of attracting money and wealth.

I've never done magick at all, and I wasn't particularly desperate for money, but I like to explore these kind of esoteric topics, and I don't mind having more money ;)

So I created a notebook as specified, with silver and orange covers; and then I printed and glued the [Nitika Sigil](https://galleryofmagick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nitika2.jpg) in the front cover.

Then my intuition beeped, and I stopped, for two reasons:

1. My initial thought was not to do magick for personal gains.
2. I hold a strong belief that the "Law of Compensation" governs our universe, that there are no free lunches. The author tries to convince the reader this isn't the case, but I simply can't trust him on his word.

So I didn't write any words on the notebook, and never did any sort of ritual.

Actually, the next day I burned the notebook, because I didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore.

But I became very anxious and superstitious about the whole thing.

The worst symptom? I developed a very strong fear of Hell. I don't even believe in Hell, and I'm only Christian in the Jungian sense, believing only in the symbolic and psychological relevance of Christianity. But that doesn't matter anymore, because today I have an irrational fear of *literal* Hell.

It didn't help the fact that:

* Reviews like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA0KSPX7AH5H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500747548), telling a horrible encounter with an entity after performing the ritual, exist.
* Books like *Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures* actually describe Nitika as "*listed as the* ***demon*** *of precious stones. He is said to be most powerful during the sixth hour"*. The whole Cashbook is written in a tone that just feels like to be very irresponsible, and other Amazon reviews also agree with this opinion.

The fear of Hell eventually subsided, but came back again today. You see, I've been Pavlov'd. Now when pleasant amounts of money enter my account, or when my stock shares go up, instead of being happy, I get superstitious, anxious and OCD.

I even cried a bit today, repenting over the guilt of having put that stupid sigil on a stupid notebook. How insane is that?!

Insofar as I can observe what's happening to me from a detached and neutral position, this is a very interesting and exciting phenomenon, psychologically. What a self-discovery journey: I thought I was a rational person, but it turns out I'm one of the most superstitious people I know!

But when I come back from that observing state, the fun ends.

Yeah, I'm completely aware this is irrational:

* My heart tells me not to worry, that I did nothing wrong, and in fact I passed on an important test (not wanting to do magick for personal gains), and I wouldn't condemn, at all (if I was God), someone else who had done the exact thing as I did.
* And actually, in a more rational sense, this instead feels like an act of self-sabotage from my unconscious due to some self-beliefs I may hold: *"Money coming in? Here's a reason to feel bad about it. Why don't you stay a failure within your comfort zone instead?",* my unconscious psyche tells me. (Hey, maybe that's what true Hell is, huh?)

But that doesn't make the irrationality go away.

In any case, I'm just venting and processing things through writing, so thanks for reading...

...but I'd like some perspective on this too, from you :)I have an interest in innana/Ishtar the Mesopotamian Goddess of love & war and want to know where can I read stories about her or with her in them and where to learn how to work with & invoke her. 

Peace, blessed be.I did a big wipe down where I took everything off to clean and then repositioned a few things when I put it all back. Definitely feel a good amount of the accumulated energy is gone now (kinda miss my little wax droppings and ash stains). 
Who else has cleaned a good bit off their altar after working with it for a while and what was your experience?>In true magic we find that the method is, in the end, not what one thinks. While initial experiments may grant a power to manifest desires, the magician quickly realizes just how messy such a power can be. It is true that most bomb-makers lose fingers. Furthermore, the magician discovers that while he may have his plans for this universe, this universe also has its plans for him. Thus the magician is hurled into a world of paradox. How to manifest his desires without at the same time giving something in return? How to overcome the law of equivalent exchange?

>Here the word "alignment" seems proper. The highest attainment of the magician is to once and for all bring himself into total accord with the universe, or the way of things. In so doing the magician's desires always happen to align with what the universe wants of him. His magic always works, and in balanced fashion. The universe needs no more exchange. The bomb-maker loses no more fingers.

>Ironically then, the magician can only work magic without cost at the end of his journey. In resigning himself to the shackle of equivalent exchange, the magician loses interest in manifestation. He sees that each of his footsteps is absurd: there is no action which does not introduce difficulties, yet inaction is entirely impossible. The fierceness of this dilemma compels the magician to move forward with both absurd irony and grim determination. At this stage his behavior lays the foundation for a final evolution.

>Quite suddenly, and without a new revelation, the magician transcends. The boundary between desire and reality dissolves, and the magician's will is made manifest continually.

What are your thoughts on there being some "final stage of attainment" for a magician?Are you a K.I.S.S. kind of person? (Keep It Simple Stupid)  Does manifestation and Magick seem complicated and cluttered by really big words, really big uses of energy, and really big terms that leave your brain in a fog, your eyes glazed over and your spirit exhausted?

* ***What is Magick?***

1. Magick is invisible energy and visible energy! It's everywhere.
2. Magick is also manipulating this energy.
3. Magick is around you.
4. Magick is in ***YOU***
5. Magick ***IS YOU***.

&#x200B;

* ***How do I best practice Magick?***

Three Ways:

1. Through awareness of the Law of Attraction.
2. The power of ***The Word.***
3. Doing something physically, take action!

# The Law of Attraction

The Law of Attraction states that like attracts like. If you need more explanation than this I would recommend watching or reading "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrnes (I know many people have a problem with Rhonda but her work is pretty simple and accurate) It is a very easy and straight forward explanation of the Law of Attraction but in a nutshell:

If you feel bad, you'll attract bad. If you feel good, you'll attract good. It's the same for your thoughts as well. Think bad, bad will come, think good, good will come. Put out bad energy, you'll attract bad energy.

This is why there is so much overwhelming and wordy information out there on how to continuously think and feel good (keeping vibrations high, light-working, meditation practices.) But in my experience doing this too much can get very neurotic and very suppressing which feels bad, attracting more bad. Then you would try to raise your vibrations to not feel bad but you feel even worse because you're just ignoring yourself...it's a cycle. Just be aware of the Law of Attraction and follow me to an even greater power that is not nearly known but in my opinion, should be! It's more powerful than your thoughts, feelings or vibrations despite where they maybe be!

# The Power of The Word

"In the beginning was the word..."

I hate to quote the Bible sometimes, I really do. However, my background doesn't permit me to undo that. A little story...

I grew up Pentecostal born-again Christian. This is not something I'm particularly fond of or proud of, however it's necessary for this lesson.

In the church I grew up in, often the phrase, "In the name of Jesus...by the power of the Holy Spirit...In Jesus name!" was used in prayer healing or just at the end of a prayer to establish that the healing or prayer was considered ANSWERED. I have never seen other people's miracles from this...however, I myself have personally experienced what some would call, "Miracles" but I just say, "Of course it worked, I'm powerful!"  In using these phrases in true faith in the power of the word, I realized: it wasn't what I said or who I said it to, it was the faith I had in the power of my WORDS that brought about my life and the ,"I know that I know that I KNOW" attitude...

But even when I DIDN'T know, even when I was unsure and full of depression and worry...things still happened as I spoke because I commanded what I wanted as though it already happened. Only when I proclaimed and demanded, not when I prayed and petitioned, did things happen.

**The Power of Proclamation, must be VERBAL. Say it OUT LOUD.**

As I started to veer away from the church for many reasons irrelevant to this post, I still utilized that power, but in a much different way.

I would stand on a hill, or a mountain...or at the top of a parking garage lol, a place where I felt above the world, telling IT what to do. And I would say,

# I come before a trillion universes, I come before the almighties, every god, every power, every law, every atom...down to every quark. All energies bow down before me, and I command of the universe, for that is my birthright. I am a creator...and I demand that...

I am \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.I have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.I do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.I say \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.I go \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.I am.

No matter how I FELT...no matter what I THOUGHT...No matter how high or low I was, I knew that I knew my words superseded all powers of the universe. That when I told that mountain to MOVE...

It fuckin' MOVED.

Now I use that power daily and can tell you THAT is supreme Magick. Use your WORDS.

Don't believe in the power of the word but want to? Are you ready to harness that kind of power but can't really understand or see how...start with this,

"I believe in the power of the word."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Take Action

This kind of Magick comes straight from our hearts. It is love. It is care, kindness, goodness, grace, mercy, compassion and standing up for what is right. Plant a tree, save an animal, help your kid with his homework, do some chores for your household or significant other, help someone or something in nature. It's in giving love and seeking out those opportunities with a fire. Keep your eyes open to make yourself, those around you, nature, and the world a better place.  Join a soup kitchen, give a couple of bucks to the homeless person you see begging everyday. Believe it or not, it's not really for drugs but if it makes you uncomfortable, buy them a sandwich instead. Look for people to help. Help YOURSELF. Get therapy if you need help, or do some self care if you're exhausted and feeling used up. Do some altar work. Whatever makes you feel grounded and whole, completely in your TRUE and authentic, **genuine** self...do it so that you can be true to others. Live in TRUTH.

Thank you for reading this guide. It was a bit rushed at some point but I hope it helps some with simple questions on how to be a Magick practitioner. If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask.Hey everyone, I was wondering what are some mistakes people can avoid making when dabbling in hexes, curses and jinxes? 
Any advice you can through my way is welcome also.
Blessed be. Fight Club

**What's the first rule of Fight Club?** 

No, it's not that. I know that's what they say in the movie, it's still not that. Let me explain. 

The first rule of Fight Club is not don't talk about Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is don't tell the Narrator he's Tyler Durden.  Don't tell him he's in charge, that he's in a movie. **Don't tell the main character he's God.** 

It's like this, throughout the movie nobody ever calls the Narrator by his name when Tyler's not around. He has no identity, **no memory of who he is** and nobody in his life makes any effort to remind him. **He forgets why he created** the Tyler aspect and that he started Fight Club, **he forgets writing** about Jack's cancerous colon. And nobody else is allowed to tell him. 

It's only **when he figures it out for himself** that it's all over. The jig is up, the movie ends within 20 minutes as the Narrator **tries everything he can** to stop Project Mayhem. He even goes so far as to shoot himself in the head **to try and stop it.** Once he figures out who he really is and what's really going on he'll do anything to stop it. **Without fear.**

I find the same has been true in all the **fighting, internal and external**, that comes from awakening and discovering you are God. Historically, religious groups have each had their own invisible man hosting their **own brand of Fight Club**. Today awakening in a world that wants nothing to do with religion (rightly so), talking to friends and family about what I've been going through, experiencing, I've been met with blank stares and worried looks. Concern. Are you going to a join a Cult? **No... but I might start one.** 

**So many fights** I have had or have seen about this God or that God, or how God is not real and how God is most definitely not a **worthless** bag of meat and bone. Yes, it seems it's true, people will argue their own insignificance, they will **fight to remain inferior.** They will rebel against their own evolution and so **invite their own extinction.** 

To those who would fight you on who you are, who they are, **I say call them Tyler's**, Tyler Durdan's, Fight Mans. They'll fight you on anything even if it's in defence of their own worthless finality. Here's an idea, **why don't we just not tell them?** Why don't we **let them figure it out** themselves. 

**The truth is** out there and **written here**, if you're seeking you'll find it all, **in store now.** What free and infinite energy that is **available to** us is there for us who have discovered it for ourselves. Why shouldn't we just let the **Homo Sapiens** continue life in hard mode. If you try to convince him of the truth before he is ready, he will fight you. **The Wisest Warriors** and Martial Artists never fight, they **know there is never any need to**. You can run, you could disarm them, you might just not be **there when the fight kicks off.** Enjoy the Peace of your own Creation. Just **stop fighting who you are** in yourself. Accept who you really are. **Why would you not?**

**The Knight who slay Dragons fear Snails**

**In the spiritual** communities theirs always this expectation that this **energy work** requires consistent **practices**. Daily meditations, **exercises,** chanting. prayers, grounding, centring, shielding. **Activities** really. Like Martial Artists or dutiful Knights, sharpening, polishing, **training**, preparing... for a fight. 

For me, my way, this is **not an energy efficient way** of being. All this maintenance, structure and discipline. Being on guard, grounded in harsh reality, shield raised, **on the defensive.** **Stressed**. It's a way of being that you almost always are on the lookout for threats, for danger wherever you go. Well, **if you're looking for a fight, you'll surely find one.** 

**Imagine**, the Knight of the Village, who **polishes his sword** and shield everyday, ever on the lookout for invading monsters. He **tends his weapons daily** so he'll never be caught off guard and patrols the streets of the village from dawn until dusk looking for any that might pray on the innocent. It's **all done very nobly.** 

The trouble I find is that this mindset **oft finds trouble** where there is none. Anything the knight comes across that he is **unfamiliar** might appear ghoulish and threatening. You spend all day looking for a fight you're going to find one **or start a club for one.** The Knight walks down a dark alleyway and their approaching comes **a big scary beast** of the night, huffing and puffing blowing smoke and fire. **En garde!** screams the Knight, he draws his sword and stands behind his shield. And as the beast huffs in his direction he swings his sword and **slays the beast in one.**

The only thing is.. it wasn't a dragon the knight had slain, nor a parseltongue serpent neither. It was **only a humble snail** trying to get from A to B after a very long day **traveling**. There was really no need to fight the snail after all, he was just **puffing on a blunt,** drinking a 40 and **minding his own damn business** as usual. 

See all the smoke and mirrors that the Knight mistook for a Dragon was really **something he misunderstood.** The perceived threat of evisceration by unholy flame was really just blown smoke, **a mirage, energy.** Just the energy of the Snail appearing like a Dragon, only terrifying as perceived by the **Knight, who is in his own energy.** 

With all things energy, all that is made up of **energy is made up.** It is what you allow the energy to be for you that creates the properties, **the experience of the energy** and it's effect on you. Energy **is information, you decide** what that information means. **You give permission, you agree** that the energy is fire and not smoke, you agree to be moved to action. There's nothing anybody can ever do to you **with your energy** that you do not allow them to do. 

They could be a Knight or a Monk, a Doctor or a Policeman, a Dragon or a Snail, **how you feel about them** and their **qualification** is all what they're doing with their energy and how they wish to appear and how **you choose to receive** their energy. **The Wizard** is never complete without his hat, his **costume!**

Consider the energetic costumes that make up our world that we live in today. **To whom do you give your authority** to and what outfit do they wear? Unless you want to be Tyler Durden, **you are God also,** why do you expect Brad Pitt to help you out, just because he's dressed like a doctor? Monks and Priests are **no more clued up** about God than they were a thousand years ago, **they don't want to evolve.** The policeman and doctors and the politicians **would rather you never find this out** because they don't know either, because **they would be out of a job if you did.** 

**For them this is Fight Club**, whether they are fighting crime, or fighting disease and death or fighting for re-election and **convincing you to fight** for your country, to all those who we have given our authority this is Fight Club and it's **every man for himself.**  

Understand which movie you're in, **know who's game you're playing.** Know that you're that you're the player, **you're the Narrator** in your own story, everyone else is in theirs. If they don't know want to know that, stuff them. **If they're not ready** for the responsibility let them do as they will. If they want to fight you, **don't fight them**, let them be who they are in their ignorance while **you enjoy peace**, while you enjoy paradise. Pretend **they are just extras** in your movie. Why Not?

So if you're with me, **if you're following**, please continue to do so, **there'll be more tips** for playing the game soon. **Don't tell Tyler that he's in a Movie**, keep the secret for yourself. Tell those who want to know, those seekers who go to the movies, **ones with imagination**, the Fight is now in our corner. **This is our time.** This is our Fight Club.Hi all!  


I've been practicing predominantly ceremonial magick for a year or so now. Every morning I do a few rituals, ending with the LIRP, and then a tarot divination + meditation. From that, I create affirmations based on each card, then charge my morning coffee  with those affirmations, and end with a License to Depart.  


Damien Echols recommended two tarot decks from Travis McHenry for the 72 angels and 72 demons (they felt powerful right out of the packaging, highly recommend :) ). I've started including these cards in my draw. First I pull the angel, read up on it, intone the name and ask for it's blessing. Then the same with the demon.  


I've checked with my own intuition/spirit guides before doing any of this, and I seem to be getting green lights on all sides, but I wanted to see if what some others thought? At the risk of inciting strong opinions lol. Any advice or suggestions is totally welcome. If you just type in all caps saying 'DON'T WORK WITH DEMONS' I'd appreciate any clarity based on 'Because.....'.  


From my current understanding of demons, they're aspects of my ego. As above, so below. A tree can only grow as tall as its roots can support. So far, I've felt secure in this, but it's only day three. Let me know! Blessed be.

Edit:***
Figured it’s worth clarifying my process a bit. I ask my cards, “Where should I put my attention today?” and pull 3 (Thoth deck), then pull an angel card, then a demon. At the end, I charge my cuppa with the morning’s intentions/affirmations, then raise my cup, and ask for any blessings the angels/demons have to share, take a sip, and then thank everyone for showing up, “You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here :)” and send them with the blessings of Yeheshuah and Adonai.Almost every esoteric system makes a distinction between the Masculine and the Feminine. But what do they represent?

We're living in the 21st century, so these lines are being blurred a little. As in any dualistic system, there will be contradictions and fallacies. The Divine Masculine may not ring true for every male, and the Divine Feminine may not ring true for every female. 

So where does gender stand in the 21st Century Magickal Consciousness? Should we be re-evaluating our reliance on dualistic systems? Are we all inhabited by both the Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine to some degree? What is the definition of each? What is their interplay?Hello, never posted here before. I'm 30, mtf, and that detail becomes potentially relevant later on.  I practiced a few years back but fell out. Partly due to time, not good mental health, uncertain faith, and, in all honesty, fear. But, I'm in a better place now and it's starting to come back. There was a dream I had when I was still young but I remember it like it was yesterday and recently found out some detailed about my birth that recontexualized that dream in a scary way. 

So, the dream. I'm walking through a suburb, clean little houses, perfectly kept lawns, the whole shebang. But, there were no roads, instead there was water ways, like in Venice. So, I think to myself 'ill bet if I dive into the water way I'll be able o see under the houses', so in I go. Except when I dive in and look up, there are no houses, no anything. I'm in the ocean now, the break of the water above me leading to a clear beautiful sky, and below me, the endless yawning abyss, dark and cold. As I'm floating there I feel something behind me, and I turn to face what I know to be the Leviathan. A great black beast, sleek, long and fierce. It swims up to me with the intent to swallow me. But when it opens its maw I see there are no teeth, no throat, nothing that should be in mouth. Instead, there are bodies. They are embedded into the walls of the beasts mouth from the waist up, their bodies sleek, black, writhing and struggling. I notice a mark on each of their foreheads and reach up to my forehead to find I bear the same mark. The whale opens wide to swallow me, but then simply stops and closes it's jaw. I hear in my head, clear as a bell, "You are not among them." And the. It swims away, as if I weren't even there. 

I had this dream when I was young but it's still with me. There whole chunks of my childhood I can't remember, but I remember this and a few other dreams, and almost all of the have to do with water or the ocean in some way. And if not the ocean or water, they will often feature houses that are begining to fall apart, but I always find them homley. And if not that, they will feature some void or bottomless dark. Now, the circumstances of my birth that startled me.

I found out that I was a en caul, or veiled, birth. But, I was not partially veiled. I was mermaid birth, born completely in the amniotic sac. And, I was technically second born of a set. Before I was pushed out, my mother birthed an empty amniotic sac, a twin that never was.

So yeah, penny for y'all's thoughts?What do you think? So many people are advising against any type of magick during an eclipse, but I would say nearly equal amounts are saying the exact opposite and planning what they will do. I have been doing my own research as well. I was originally thinking I’d like to use the intensity of this Eclipse, since it’s rare. I’m feeling really drawn to. Thoughts?It’s said that the versatility of a sigil is the relatively low commitment and the temporary time it inhabits.  If you were to get a sigil tattooed would it have the same desired effects or rather would it be weaker or have no power at all?Things to note:

In my vision, he made what looked like a witches brew in a black pot, it appeared green and nasty. This was on Friday the 13th of 2020. Not sure if any of this is relevant or not. 

In mid December I performed my first Eucharist. I had never really performed a formal ceremony of any kind but I really felt its effects instantaneously. I felt the angels I was calling upon in my space and felt like I had transmuted my soul after. 

I decided to post this here today because I woke up this morning from a bit of a nightmare that appeared to be of him tormenting me in the future at his house. When I woke up, I heard what seemed to be a telepathic message from him saying that I broke his heart when I cut him off. 

I'm not super freaked out or anything because I know that I've really only stayed in my lane and lived my truth, but if anybody has any experience with this sorta thing, I would appreciate some insight or advice, thanks!I'll admit, I'm a little hesitant with my thoughts on moon water, though I gave it an honest try with the full beaver moon last night. My problem was that I left the water outside and didn't retrieve it until about 1 PM the next day (oops, stayed up too late). So, does the sun "eliminate" all benefits from the moon?

I'm on the fence either way, as magick follows energy and intent. Waters are effected by the light of the moon (we see that in our oceans), so the molecules must've changed. I'm just lost with the sun element. 

Worst comes to worst, i'll try again next full moon in Cancer, I guess?Hello! I’m a practicing Jewish witch trying to connect to the mystic and metaphysical portion of Judaism. If you’re someone with any amount of knowledge please reach out as I’d love to hear your thoughts and opinions!Hi everyone, hope you’re having a great equinox. I have a issue that I’m struggling with, and I’m hoping to get some insight from some of you.

I’ve been practicing High Magick for a few months now, with my primary intention being focused on finding a teacher. A little less than a month ago, while meditating, I had a vivid visualization of me sitting at a campfire in the woods at night- with a bestial yet serene figure sitting opposite of me from the fire. It spoke to me for some time about my practices and ways to improve them, all the while giving me advice on my problems with the physical world as well, much like a therapist would. After some time, I worked up the courage to ask the entity it’s name, it simply told me that it was to be my teacher. When I later asked again, it told me “You know who I am” and placed the name “Baphomet” in my mind.

 With my Christian background this naturally startled me, as I knew that Baphomet was the figurehead of the satanic church- but after learning the real story about Baphomet I eased up quite a bit, and came to terms that this was the perfect teacher for me, as I’ve always found Jungian psychology, the union of opposites, and self improvement to be integral to my Magick practices.

  At first my time with my new teacher was great... up until about a week ago. I’ve found it difficult to connect with Baphomet these past few days, and when I do he doesn’t have much to say. Just yesterday he was openly hostile towards me, and I’ve been apprehensive about attempting to re-connect since.

  Can anyone give me some advice as to what could be going on? Is it possible that I’ve offended my teacher somehow? I recently had my first child, and haven’t had much time for my Magick practice, so could that have something to do with it? Any and all advice would be much appreciated. Thank you, and much love.Hello everyone!

I was just wondering if I could have some help or advice. I have something called aphantasia which means I can't visualize anything with my minds eye - when my eyes are closed its always black. 

I'm wondering if there is a way to "visualize" with magick in a different way. When people give advice about visualizing protective fields or just anything that relates to visualizing, I feel really odd. I can't visualize and I don't know how to approach it differently.

Thank you all for your help and your time, have a wonderful day/evening. Love and light 💖Does anyone else have moments where they feel “stuck” in reality? I noticed over the past week or so I’ve been hyper focused on work and home responsibilities and it’s made me pretty unhappy. 

I feel stuck in a loop of one stressful event after another and I noticed that during this loop, I haven’t made time for myself or magick. 

I’d love to know how others incorporate magick into their daily routines. Is there a special ritual or intentional action you take to bring magick and/or calm, restorative energy into your life daily?

Edit: I’m really loving these responses! Thank you all for the suggestions!! I’ll be starting on these first thing tomorrow!So my uncle is supposed to be coming to visit on boxing day and he’s just an awful person. I can’t stand being around him. He makes fun of me, lets his dog destroy my things, physically stinks, drives dangerously and the list goes on.

I really don’t want to have to stay in the same house as him or see him at all really so I was wondering about a spell to keep him away?? I’m aware many would consider it unethical etc but I want to know if there’s any actual dangers etc.You have perfect knowledge to manifest,  sure. But what is the point? Why do *you* perform magick?

Now that we have that out of the way, I'd like to ask *what* you perform and how efficacious it is. What does it do for you?

What are some of the most powerful rituals you've done?

What is some of the most self transformational work you've done?# Editorial 

An r/magick sub rule states: **No Gatekeeping the Validity of Magick**. As written, I read it to mean that professional and amateur "skeptics" who would come here specifically to poo-poo the practice of magick in general are unwelcome.  

What it doesn't say (to me) is that people aren't allowed to criticize or otherwise express a negative attitude toward a given technique or approach. A case in point is this recent post:  [Astrology as a divination system : magick (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/nsqjek/astrology_as_a_divination_system/) 

To highlight the relevant issue, the post reads:

> i’ve noticed that most western occult literature i’ve read is very anti-astrology in regards to its use and accuracy as a system of divination, i’m curious as to why this is? is it simply that practitioners find other divination systems to be that much more accurate or is there a core issue within astrology? 

And then, the comment to that thread with the most likes states:  

>I think there's a lot of gatekeeping behavior in certain occult circles. And that here to me reads like gatekeeping. 

I think that's a gross misunderstanding of what gate-keeping is. I mean, a person who practices magic can't technically be considered a gate-keeper here, unless they adopt a contrary attitude toward their own endeavors in a post or comment. 

To the point, if someone has good reasons to criticize a particular technique or approach based on their studies and experience, that's meaningful and on-topic discourse in any occult studies community. Branding that sort of thing as a *gatekeeping,* which is a rule violation here, almost certainly has a chilling effect of the free expression of dissenting opinions. Bear in mind that motion requires friction. We don't do ourselves any favors by avoiding contentious ideas among practitioners of various stripes.    

The Gatekeeping label is best reserved for people channeling James Randi and the likes. It should never apply to anyone who actually practices magic just because they express a negative opinion of a given technique or approach.I just came here for the first time and saw this question about "real magic with instant results". So maybe it's the right time to share my technique with a wider audience.  

  I will explain here a practice, of "magic" spells or formulae, of magic materials and how to use them. This Magick can be applied by anyone, but the Magus must be a Master of Astrology. And learning and training to control and influence yourself can be a great help, although it is not necessary by all means.  

  The technique i describe was found in January 2020 by my humble self and this is the first time it is published. Astrologers i shared it with were amazed. I will try to keep this explanation as short as possible.  

  ASTROLOGY describes cosmic energies. The planets do work in us humans, do work between us humans, it is a web of energetic influences, and astrology is the language of that. To understand and create the following Astral Magick Spells it is absolutely necessary to speak fluent astrology.    
An Astrologer sees and knows the cosmic mechanics: 4 Elements, 10 Planets, 12 Signs and Houses and more...  

  When one understood how the Astrology is the actual mechanic of the human kind, he or she is then able to describe it in a Formula: ♄ ♏︎ _works_ ☍ on ☾♉︎ (for example)    
Everything we do and everything we create is charged with that energy. When we teach or train someone, we charge them with our energy. When we create art and music, we charge that with our exact energy.  

  I will give one small example: Selina Gomez has Jupiter in the ② House for material wealth (like D. Trump, so she's rich - in short). And she made a song together with Charlie Puth, who has his Jupiter also in her ② House of material success - so the energy doubles. And in the time they made and released this song the actual transiting Jupiter went through her ② House of material success, which tripled the energy and at this point in time it became Selinas most successful Single in her career.    
Sources:
[Song](https://youtu.be/3AtDnEC4zak) / [German Wiki stating "most successful Single"](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_Gomez/Diskografie) / [Selina Gomez Astrodatabank](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Gomez,_Selena) / [Charlie Puth Astrodatabank](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Puth,_Charlie) / [Release date chart](https://imgur.com/a/VbDseC2) please note that Charlie _does not have_ Jupiter in his ② house, but _brings his Jupiter_ into Selinas ② House.  

  So we have a quite simple formula here: ♃♍︎② ☌ ♃♍︎ ☌ ♃♍︎ ....simple and effective. Triple Jupiter in ones ② House  

  Now to make a proof of the immediate power of that cosmic energy by yourself: Write for example a text message to someone. Write it, but don't send it. When you finished writing, put on headphones and start one song playing on repeat. Re-read your message and you most likely will find that it now does not seems so right anymore and that it needs some changes. So change the text, but do not stop listening to that one song playing on repeat _until_ the message is finished for the second time. Only then can you stop the music and do not make further changes in the text. The text is now charged with cosmic energies from that song you heard, transmitted through your own cosmic body. When someone receives it, he or she will receive that specific cosmic energies and the Magick impacts.  

  A trainer for example has a long term effect, and a teacher and a professor. When we create something under the influence of specific cosmic energies, these energies manifest inside the creation, and in this way also become a long lasting manipulator. A room you created, a car you bought, a perfume someone designs ...all that is magic material, with strong immediate impacts, readable _and_ writable in astrological spells or formulae.  

  You may find this suspicious if you do not yet have the complete astrology wisdom, but it is then only a lack of information. And regarding information: This is the part where it really gets interesting. How and where do we get all that information? Well, well, well.... there are ways and places....  

  Maybe you can already imagine, that what i described is only the entrance to a world of powerful magic impacts and spells.

  best wishes, Mr. B

edit: just posted [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/n512r4/baumguards_astral_magick_part_2_step_by_step/), explaining the actual process and now there is r/astralmagick as the place for everything around this special technique. please feel invited to join :-)Hey everyone. I recently started rediscovering magick (used to be really interested as a kid then fell out of it for a while) and have been experimenting with different techniques and materials to see what feels best for me. I inherited a box of crystals from my mom and feel very fortunate to have them. However, I have also noticed their growing popularity among my friends and even celebrity influencers, and have seen how easy they are to obtain online. I can’t help but think about how we are exploiting the earth to mine the crystals used for witchcraft and magick. This seems to contradict the greater connection to the universe that we’re trying to achieve. Does anyone else question this and therefore feel strange using crystals for healing?Not sure if this belongs here but just something I was thinking about. What if Christianity's obsession with evil and the need for an entity to represent this evil (Satan) causes the manifestation of evil entities in the physical world. (Hitler as an extreme example). Could the simultaneous obsession of millions of people with the concept of an evil being and its resulting sin cause this to occur when it otherwise wouldn't have.I've hovered around the periphery of this world for a while, had several false starts, got caught up in new-age vaguaries and was generally trying to avoid doing the actual nitty-gritty hard work. I did build a decent meditation habit, but that's really it.

I've had enough effects in my life (largely random, like my "practice") that I don't doubt the reality of these techniques, but I've gone back to basics and realized just how weak and namby pamby my structure was.

I've ceased all mind altering drugs (other than caffeine and the occasional beer or two), and at the recommendation of this community, I've purchased High Magick, by Damien Echols. Reading through I realized that I was never really doing the proper visualisations, nor had I built the proper foundations for even the most basic rituals, like the Middle Pillar, LBRotP, etc. 

This time I'm taking my time, giving the initial exercises the time they're due instead of jumping all over the place, but I'm realizing I don't even know how to do that properly. 

When I'm doing the 4-fold breath, (trying to) visualize drawing light energy energy in and releasing it, i have a lot of trouble doing that from a first person perspective. I always seem to just visualize a general human outline like I'm watching myself from the third person. Even that is hard enough to maintain with my wobbly concentration. 

I suppose my question is, does it make a difference what perspective I'm using? Should I continue to imagine looking at myself from outside, will my subconscious connect that with "me" or is there some advantage to trying to keep my perspective "behind my eyes" so to speak?So I was working on a spell tonight and I was singing to my candles during the spell (because music is a powerful thing for me and I like to use it to help my spells) But during my spell as I was singing to my candles, the flames grew a lot taller and very very thin to the momentum’s of the song, something I’ve never seen happen before. 
Has anyone else had this happens to them??? Without music even, during a spell???Hello im a 17 years old practitioner in Turkey. I love to research and learn about occultism and kabbalah. I read most of the occult books that translated to Turkish because they are pretty easy to access so now i’m looking forward for buying english high magick and occult books. But since Turkish economy is not at its best right now one dollar is about about eight dollars it’s super hard for me to afford them. For example uying a 30 dollars book is 240 liras for me plus shipping it’s almost 300 liras for only one book! I am trying to read pdfs as much as i can but it’s kind of hard. See where i am going with this haha.

If some of you have books that don’t read at all or planing to throwing out about thelema or occultism please dm me. i would pay for shipping. I don’t have big hopes but i seen some people do it so i wanted to give it a try.Most of us here have spent time investigating and pushing the boundaries of conscious experience. We love to tinker with the inner workings of our minds, but is that dangerous? I certainly am no neuroscientist, nor a doctor of any kind, so I wouldn't go plumbing the depths of the physical brain - but what makes me think exploring the mental mind is any less risky?

One of the first warnings you will hear regarding the occult is always that you may lose your mind. Not only do those who are opposed to Magickal thinking and practices warn against insanity, but so do many of the proponents. How many grimoires open with a warning of insanity?

So how do we distinguish between the practice of Magick, and the affliction of mental health? Is it important to know for a fact that your Magick is true and real, or is teetering on the edge of craziness a state the Magician should be accustomed to? Is there a way to confirm you've not lost the plot, or will the Magician always be questioning that?

“The psychotic drowns in the same waters in which the mystic swims with delight.”The Breath is one of the Magickian's most powerful tools. With it, you can focus intent, dispel blockages whether in your physical body or your Akashic field. It sustains all of your magicks and powers the bio machinery that hosts your consciousness.   


Every Saturday I drop a new [Somatic Meditation Session](https://youtu.be/3bxr6Izp4g8) at 11 AM CT utilizing a wide range of different breathing techniques. Some with more magickal inclined than others - but always a good time.   


Try this one, and push yourself beyond yourself.   


Good luck!***I did a candle spell and got the job! This same kind of spell worked for a court case I had as well. The judge completely threw it out, DISMISSED. They're candle spells I found on the internet and I then added my own things like runes, intent, some more items and a gratitude ceremony after the results.***

Job Interview/Search Success Spell:

**Items-**

* Palo Santo (or incense and sage since I hear Palo Santo is being over farmed)
* 1 Orange vigil candle? Idk what they're called lol. The small candle witches use. Orange is for success and prosperity. No orange? Use white and claim it as orange. No white? Go to the dollar store! Any candle that can fit the diameter of a cup will do.
* Olive oil - pour a very small portion into a spoon
* Foundation of choice, like Black salt or Sand or Regular Salt or even Dirt from outside
* A container of choice like a cup or mug or glass...anything to hold the "dirt" in as long as it can withstand some heat, no Tupperware!

**Spell-**

1. Set up a small area for yourself to work in. Cleanse and clear the area physically (clear clutter, wipe down with some wipes, disinfect, whatever makes you feel it's clean)
2. Light an incense for creating a sacred sense in the air and also light a Palo Santo for cleansing the space and item (or just use two incense if you don't want to use Palo Santo. Sage will work as well.) Cleanse and bless the items you are about to use by burning one of the Palo Santo, Sage or Incense and passing the other spell items through the smoke. Cleanse and bless the area they will be placed on by blowing the smoke onto it. Cleanse and bless the air by waving the burning item around the air. Cleanse and bless yourself as well by just passing the burning item around your body. Create a circle of smoke around your crown especially. Speak some words like, "I cleanse...I bless..." Words are the most powerful in Magick. Speak your own words if you feel.
3. Okay, now, using a fork, pen, needle or even the tip of a pointed crystal, inscribe this rune onto your candle: [https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/605561343/success-amulet-bindrune-talisman-norse?show\_sold\_out\_detail=1](https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/605561343/success-amulet-bindrune-talisman-norse?show_sold_out_detail=1).
4. Rub the candle with the olive oil, blessing the candle and locking in the rune's power.
5. Pour your foundation of choice into your container of choice. Put in a decent amount.
6. Stick the candle inside the foundation, centered and in enough that it can stand on it's own. I usually try to put my candle as far down as possible with losing too much of it.
7. Now before lighting the candle make sure you have at least 9 minutes of time to give into visualizing, if not, come back when you do. Set a timer for 9 minutes and light the candle using matches or if you don't have matches, light another candle with a lighter and use that candle to light your spell candle. Just try and avoid using a lighter directly on your spell candle. Also, never blow out the spell candle. I usually lick my fingers and pinch it out. You can use something to smother it.
8. Visualize, visualize, visualize. See yourself working this specific job. Don't be generic. You need to know what specific job you want. You need to concentrate on that. I even googled the company itself and imagined myself in the uniform, walking in the building, approaching the building before I clocked in as I looked at the photos. Do whatever helps you to visualize.
9. Times up. Say, "It is done." And consider it done.

***A)*** ***If you had an interview for the job already*** and you're waiting to hear back, light the candle the next day and let it burn all the way down into the sand, dirt, etc. Like ALL the way down, until the wax melts into the foundation.

***B) If you're still searching for a job***, burn this candle everyday for 9 minutes until it is gone or until you get a job interview, then refer to A. But remain SPECIFIC to the job you desire. Visualize one job at a time if you're applying for many. If the candle runs out of wax before you are able to land an interview. Do this spell over again with a new foundation.

**Aftercare-**

Upon you're hiring, remove the waxed over foundation (it will be a ball inside the foundation. To remove it, pour out the contents of the container and the waxed part will appear) and bury it in the soil ground outside, giving thanks. Gifts to the earth are appreciate as well. I gave a bit of orange peel, egg whites and heavy cream to the tree roots.

Give thanks, lots of it, "Thank you friend."Energy vampires...we've all got them in our lives. Family, co-workers etc., people that you are forced to be around sometimes. What techniques have you found to be effective against getting drained by such people?

Thanks in advance!So I am curious about how everyone shows appreciation for a successful magickal operation?  Especially ones that worked a little too well and that fixed an otherwise hopeless situation?  What is an appropriate way to express gratitude or thanks?  What do you usually do?  What do you feel is appropriate?I've been studying Cermonial Magick and I realize that there are more than just 2 major fields which is Kabbalistic and Enochian. 
I'm finding that Archangel Gabriel has his own magickal system as well.

Archangel Gabriel through this angel you can specialize in moon magick, mirror magick.

Moon Magick deals with Mansions of the moon or distinct phases.

Mirror magick allows for scrying and spellcasting as well

Another Branch of Ceremonial Magick is elemental magick. Working with Sylphs (air) Salamanders ( fire)
Gnomes(earth) Undines(water)

Another Branch of Cermonial Magick one could specialize in is the Magick of the 7 heavens.
Each heaven has its own meditation and magick
And each Archangel that rules that heaven has its own magick to work with.

Another Branch of Cermonial Magick is the Zodiacal Angels and the Shem angels. Essentially if you can find out when you are born on a natal astrology chart you can find out what shem angel you harmonize the most with

I've also discovered that if you are able to meet a new angel you probably could make its pentacle it seems like every angel has a pentacle and possible signature.
I have a book of over 100 pentacles of different angels and Im pretty sure there are more.

Anyways this field is very diverse and vast there is no one path to enlightenment.


Edit
I also think each Archangel has his own mangick

Archangel Gabriel - Moon Magick mansions of the moon, mirror magick, Annunciation Magick.

Archangel Samael -unknown

ArchAngel Raphael -unknown

Archangel Sachiel - unknown

I decided to make this post based on a [post I saw on /r/occult](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/7ev83o/learn_to_magick_for_free/), but tailored more towards chaos magick in general. I think this would be helpful for this community.

#Books

[***Advanced Magick for Beginners* by Alan Chapman**](https://archive.org/details/advanced-magick-for-beginners-alan-chapman)

In my opinion, this is hands down the best beginner's book I've come across for chaos magick. It gives you tons of actionable exercises from the get go, is short and easy to read, and provides a great primer for your magickal practice. I definitely recommend reading this before reading anything else.

&nbsp;

[***The Psychonaut Field Manual* by Blueflake**](http://bluefluke.deviantart.com/art/The-Psychonaut-Field-Manual-FOURTH-PDF-EDITION-530005584)

This is a fantastic illustrated resource that goes over many magickal concepts and gives you actionable steps and techniques from the get go. Best of all, the author has released this for free!

&nbsp;

[***Condensed Chaos* by Phil Hine**](https://archive.org/details/PhilHineCondensedChaos)

Another excellent beginner's book on chaos magick. This is the book I started with, in fact. Goes over sigil magick, invocation, servitors, among other things.

&nbsp;

***Prime Chaos* by Phil Hine**

It is recommended you read *Condensed Chaos* before reading this book. This is a continuation of Hine's previous book, which goes into more depth about some of the things discussed in *Condensed Chaos*, as well as introducing new techniques and ideas. Hine also goes into magickal groups and group magick rituals.

&nbsp;

[***Liber Null and Psychonaut* by Peter Carroll**](https://archive.org/details/LiberNullAndThePsychonaut)

This is essentially *the book* that kicked off the chaos magick movement. Carroll goes over the theory behind chaos magick and gives plenty of practices and exercises. A staple in any chaos magician's collection.

&nbsp;

[***Liber Kaos* by Peter Carroll**](http://www.temploastral.com/books/Peter-Carroll-Liber-Kaos-1-eBook-PDF.pdf)

It is recommended to at least read *Liber Null and Psychonaut* before reading this. Carroll goes further into chaos magick theory, among other things.

&nbsp;

[***Prometheus Rising* by Robert Anton Wilson**](https://selfdefinition.org/science/Robert-Anton-Wilson-Prometheus-Rising.pdf)

Here, Wilson gives you tons of exercises to prove to yourself that your perception influences and changes your reality.

&nbsp;

***The Chaos Protocols* by Gordon White**

This book is an excellent grimoire for using magick to survive in our chaotic 21st century with political and economic uncertainty. I've heard Gordon White described as the person to pick up the torch from where Peter Carroll and Phil Hine have left off.

&nbsp;

[***The Kybalion* by Three Initiates**](http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/kybalion.pdf)

While not strictly chaos magick per se, it is a great overview on Hermetic and new thought philosophy. This knowledge, in my opinion, comes in handy for any blossoming magician.

&nbsp;

[***The Law and the Promise* by Neville Goddard**](http://www.thelawandthepromise.com/)

While also not strictly chaos magick, this book goes into details with case studies on how your imagination is the only reality, and gives you plenty of exercises to prove this to yourself. If imagination is the only reality, this may give us a clue on how magick can work so well. I also believe this book fits perfectly as a companion to *The Kyballion*. Also, shout out to /r/NevilleGoddard.

&nbsp;

[***Modern Magick* by Donald Michael Kraig**](http://www.eso-garden.com/specials/modern_magick.pdf)

If after reading all this stuff you want a more structured daily practice and some deeper study, Donald Kraig brings a complete working system from: tarot, high magick, low magick, Golden Dawn, OTO, Kabbalah, and talismans among plenty of other systems. This book is not for the faint of heart, and is packed to the brim with a complete magickal system guaranteed to keep you occupied for several months.

If you have other helpful resources, tips, and techniques for beginners, please share!
I’ve been thinking about joining an organization that I would benefit from on my spiritual path, but I don’t know what really is out there other than these two (As far as I know GD is dead), so it seems reasonable to scout around. I’m in Europe, by the way.

I’m not a fan of strict rules and people “treading on my freedoms”, so I wouldn’t want to get entangled with a very hierarchical grouping. Does anyone know what the options look like?

I’m also a uni student in my 20’s, which means I’m not wealthy enough to donate any significant amounts of money.From tobacco to blue lotus, marijuana to opium, green tea to LSD - how do you make use of such substances in your practice? Do you use them at all? Some but not others?Hello I was wondering if I could get some thoughts on this. I had a dream this morning where I saw the traditional image of baphomet in my dream fading in and out while I was in my bed and something was pulling me. I woke up and felt like there was a presence in my room. I play a mantra to Hecate and went back to sleep. I don’t see baphomet as a bad deity. I worship Hecate hestia tyche and Aphrodite (so I find it strange his images pop up ) Any thoughts on what this symbolizes?We are introducing a new feature for more dynamic and useful community discussion on r/magick. Mod-generated group discussion questions will be posted 3 times per week. My day to post is Saturdays.  My question(s) for this week is. 

* Do you Work with Spirits/Deities in Your Practice?  
* Why do/don't you? 
* What, in your opinion are the benefits of this way of practice/belief?  
* Any weaknesses or challenges that you can think of regarding this way of practice/belief?I've been practicing (a combination of traditional paganism, buddism, and traditional witchcraft when possible) for about 5 years mostly small daily practice and a lot of studying but more recently I've begun more shadow work and astral practice, along with advancing my rituals. Its been going well, but recently it's like I'm being joined at times; I just don't know who/what.

The first time was during a simple ritual for strengthening my connection to the elements. I had entered a trance state and was about halfway through when I felt someone was with me. I focused on the energy and my body felt like static almost and I could feel this feminine energy. The energy in the room began to pick up and the back of my mind shown this woman with two sides two her face. Not in the stereotypical "monster vs beauty" either it was simply two visible sides of the same being as if nothing was being hidden about her nature. Light and dark without good and bad. It didn't feel menacing, or particularly warm, just electric and familiar. After she left I closed everything and immediately began researching deities, but nothing fit.

The second time was recently during an inner child meditation I found my inner child and it was me when I was the happiest I'd been as a child. I went to hug myself, knowing I needed it and afterwards when we were sitting together, the space around us began to shift. I wasn't looking at myself anymore, or my childhood bedroom, just the doorway and the carpet. I looked at the child again and it was her. As a child. Shifting back and fourth between the two sides as full faces: one bright and golden like a star and the other dark and magnetic like a black hole. I felt the same electric feeling inside and an insane urge to hug her. I closed the meditation feeling confused and again I researched anything about a woman with two faces but nothing.

I'm honestly so confused, and I've been weary to continue without understanding. I've never done spirit work so I have no idea what it could be, but this feels older, likely not human in embodiment. Its so strange, can anyone help?I want to make a luck spell for my friend. She really is in need for it. Should I leave the jar at her place or around her place like at the front door? The thing is she doesn't believe in these things so I don't know wether handing it to her would be a good idea.Are some of you practicing art magick? I think I found a way that works for me. But I would like to hear how you do it? Any books you found helpfull? Any techniques? Maybe that adds values to mine that I am currently not aware of. Blessed be!Hey y’all I would love to find a mentor to help me and serve as a guide. I had found someone who offered but the prices he charges would be half of my paycheck which already isn’t much so I can’t afford to do that right nowmy family and i have had a few experiences that have made me feel uneasy. it all began when i discovered an orange in our garden that was split on top like a star i didn’t think anything of it i actually thought it was really cool until we started to experience negative things. I have cleansed the house with incense, every room had a plant, i have an evil eye in the front of our door which was just a traditional thing but now i feel we need it more than ever, i put salted lemons in high traffic areas of our home, rosemary literally everywhere, and i did a healing spell for my parents, playing high frequency music, and overall just trying to be positive as a person. i still feel a tightness in my chest and sadness in our home and i would be lying if i said i wasn’t worried. does anyone have any suggestions maybe you could lend me a piece of mind. thank you for reading and if you chose to reply i really appreciate it🤍🤍I'm not sure what the best way to go about this would be, but it's worth a shot. I'm a pale skinned Native American (Lakota Cheyenne River Sioux from paternal source, Cherokee from maternal source) who's never truly been exposed to my ancestoral culture. So much of our culture has been lost in genocide and I was raised with more European traditions. I've done some research on Sioux/Lakota spirituality and their magic, but was wondering if anyone has any other resources that may be beneficial to me? I'd like to honor my ancestors as much as possible in my Craft.
I have no connection to my reservations. I'm a documented Sioux, but not Cherokee. I have dealt with Medicine Men before, which was an honor. I have also had my run ins with what they call a "skin walker", someone who partakes in dark magic and can change forms, and don't want anything to do with that again. I am familiar the White Buffalo Woman, the Spider Woman, and have been educated on the "little people", the native's fae/gnomes/elves. I've used sacred tobacco, lightening stricken cedar and sage. I also know about sweet grass and corn. My question is, I suppose, how can I be the best Native American kitchen witch I'm capable of being? Thanks in advance. Blessed be. ❤Hi everyone,

May you be a "newbie" or an experienced practitioner, what have been your most impressive results so far?

Might be the things or experiences that have really blown your mind or that have delivered "unbelievable" results 😊.

Best,

33I've heard a lot of warnings of getting trapped in the Fae world and other various Warnings involving the Fae. However, no one really gets into the consequences of being stuck there? I do not plan on traveling there under any circumstances, but I'm curious. What is it like there? Do they torture us? Does it mirror the Christian version of hell in that aspect? Or is it just that you can't return to Earth that's the problem?

I'm being very serious and am not taking this lightly. This is just a morbid curiosity of the Fae and again, I have no plans to travel there.If your jacking off or doing sex magic. Do you know why?

If your giving an offering of wine to lillith do you know why wine is the choice?

Alot of initiates google what to  do and then just do it without any research into the history or intention behind it.but i reccomend that you research rhe importance of these things and the actual reasoning behind why we do things.

You should wanna find out why it works so you incorporate the reasoning into your own practice. 

And as always check your sources and always trust your instinct mI’m currently doing some research on this topic and this is what I’ve gathered so far. There are many parallels and at some point they stopped being coincidences and manifested as synchronicities. Any of your insight, experiences, or contributions are welcome.

My understanding so far is that there are seven basic levels of human consciousness which have their own vibrational rates. The higher you raise your energy, the higher the level of consciousness you will achieve. The more you become consciously aware of them, the more you develop your psychic energy through them and can achieve superhuman like powers. The first three levels are based on personality growth, and the next four are based on spiritual growth. 

The seven basic levels of human consciousnesses are; 
* the physical
* the emotional 
* the mental
* the intuitional/compassionate
* the will/spirit
* the soul 
* the divine

There are other levels beyond the seven but can only be access through the advanced mind. 

There are also seven worlds & cosmic planes of existence. These planes can be understood through the ideology of seven realms, worlds, or dimensions where higher consciously aware beings dwell. These planes help shape how we create our own reality. They give us insight on how everything is created and what is created from. These planes of existence can also be seen as states of consciousness that are characterized by different densities and dimensions of matter. These first three planes of existence are purely physical and the next four are etheric by nature. 

The seven planes of existence are; 
* the physical/material
* the astral
* the mental
* the Buddhistic/compassionate
* the nirvanic/spirit
* the Monadic
* the Logoic. 

The Astral plane has a higher frequency than the physical plane, and cannot be experienced through the physical senses but the physical plane can be experienced on the astral plane. The astral plane can be seen as the collective unconsciousness of mankind. 

Then we have the seven Chakras which are specific energy centers located within your body. They run from the base of your spine to the top of your head and energy can be manipulated through them. We can gain access to our Chakras through different techniques such as meditative visualizations combined with mantras or seeing them as entities within our body ready to be released. 

The seven Chakras are; 
* the root (base of your spine)
* the sacral
* the solar plexus
* the heart
* the throat
* the third-eye
* the crown (top of your head)

Many forms of meditation can help build your own chakra energies. You can then release your own energies, frequencies, or vibrations which can join forces with the universe’s energies giving you unlimited access to higher levels of consciousness. 

Then there are the 7 lower Sefirot (there are 10 total, and an extra which is unspoken). They derive from The Tree of Life. The sefirot energetic qualities can be accessible to us through manifestation and creation. They can be used as keys to open portals and gain insight or spiritual mastery. Some of its mystical powers are beyond human intellect to comprehend. Mystics believe that for the cosmos to exist, some of its divine force would have to be withdrawn into itself as in above so below. 

These Sefirot are (lowest to highest); 
* Malkut (kingdom) physical realm 
* Yesod (foundation) generative power of the material universe
* Hod (glory) sensory renunciation by liberation from the body
* Netzach (victory) realm of pleasure 
* Tiferet (beauty) lies at the heart of the Tree of life and is the realm for harmony and balance
* Gevurah (strength and courage)
* Hesed (mercy) emotional realm
* Binah (understanding) realm of controlling and bending thoughts
* Hokhmah (wisdom) realm of revelation associated dreams, visions, or intuition
* Keter (crown) transcendental unity with the infinite or divine and associated with synchronicities, telepathy, and clairvoyance. 

The 7 Portals; 
* DANA, the key of charity and love immortal.
* SHILA, the key of Harmony in word and act, the key that counterbalances the cause and the effect, and leaves no further room for Karmic action.
* KSHANTI, patience sweet, that nought can ruffle.
* VIRAGA, indifference to pleasure and to pain, illusion conquered, truth alone perceived.
* VIRYA, the dauntless energy that fights its way to the supernal TRUTH, out of the mire of lies terrestrial.
* DHYANA, whose golden gate once opened leads the Narjol toward the realm of Sat eternal and its ceaseless contemplation.
* PRAJNA, the key to which makes of a man a God

The Seven Sermons to the Dead (Septem Sermones ad Mortuos):
* Carl Jung’s personal collection of seven mystical or Gnostic texts regarding the exploration of the psyche or soul. He called it his “confrontation with the unconscious.” Carl Jung wrote and privately published The Seven Sermons to the Dead in 1916. Only those close to him had access to these texts. They were not available to the public until 2009.

Edit: added most recent synchronicityHow old were you at that time? Has your orientation to magic changed since or have you mainly been following/doing the same beliefs/rituals/influences? If you simply had an interest since childhood, can you pinpoint the initial experience that sparked the interest that made you continue to explore it  and organize it into a system to follow or find as you matured. It  might be hard to recall, but what do you imagine it might have been?I've been reading the books of all the magic and occult schools I can find (which has been a fun journey) and so far have found only faint similarities. The closest I've ever seen or heard is Terence McKenna talking about how, when down in South America with his brother and friends, someone had to wash the only cooking pot they had every night. The food would be caked on, and it would take a lot of scrubbing to get it out. It was Terence's turn so he went down to the river, but for whatever reason he didn't have the energy to do the scrubbing. So he gently patted some sand (they used the sand to scrub) into the pan, raise it up, and asked internally and externally "please." He then dipped the pan in the river and it washed clean immediately. He was ecstatic! The next night, excited to show off his new trick, he tells everyone that he has a new way to clean the pan, and asks them all to follow him to the river...where he promptly looked like a damn fool, the pan was dirty as ever.


I've found that as long as you are on your "correct path" and have altruistic intentions then your will may be done. But it has to be done for the right reason, and you do have to take some action, you can't just sit there and expect change. Also, as long as you seem to be on the path you are unable to fail. Bad things will still happen for sure, but it will always net good in the long term. You won't have a bank account full of money, but you can be sure if an unexpected bill pops up so too will an unexpected paycheck. 

I don't do any rituals or meditation sessions. No prayer or invoking of any kind, in fact I tried to maintain an agnostic view of things until recently. Similarly I have not done any reading on magic, occultism, or even religions (I was raised atheist) prior to very recently, so there's almost no chance of projection happening here. It's even apparent to friends and family that I have a stupid amount of luck.

I do go into meditative states frequently while doing repetitive tasks, and also to go to sleep every night. I've done that since I was a kid. It's during these times I believe my thoughts and intents to be projected, but onto what I'm not sure.

Does this sound like any school of magic you've heard of before? There's more but I don't want to ramble too much.

I believe we have all already ascended out of this Universe and are already creating our own Universes. 

If there is no such thing as time in the spiritual and energetic world, the past, present, and future are One. 

We as planetary beings, observed the cycles of the Sun and distinguished one moment from another, planning seasonal harvests and changes in the weather for optimised survival. These are human observations based on human needs that do not translate to higher dimensional or energy-based forms of life. 

We experience and observe some form of end or death of our human vehicle and we therefore believe in the finite nature of life. We are not taught to exist as immortal energies, we are taught to define our patterns and limit ourselves in every possible regard. 

What if we were more accurately Suns? 

What if your soul was a constant burst of light that nurtures others around you? 

When we observe an infinite spectrum of lives, swimming in and out of reincarnation, our significance for what we believe is important changes. 

The ego can only exist in the finite where it can compare itself to others. In the infinite however, this Universe already happened and we have already recognised ourselves as Source. 

There’s nothing to forgive when you are meant to be exactly the way you are, and not a single line of code different. 

Recognizing the infinite self is the explosion of enlightenment that ascends us into truly loving beings. 

We Create because we Love.This may be a stretch. 

But, I was reading in the comments on another post on here from someone who had experience with the fae. They said that they often communicate with children and sort drift off as you grow up. Now I had an imaginary friend as a child, i would claim it told me to do all the little mischievous things I did. I would tell my mom she had rainbow hair and a body of light. Do you think maybe imaginary friends could be a interaction or relationship you had with a fairy? Because it would also explain why adults don’t see them and why not every child has one. 
It could definitely be a stretch but that’s what I thought of, figured I’d share.Hey guys! Just seeing about any ideas one might have for manifesting your pleasures or desires (whatever floats your vibe) on this day. I was thinking of doing a written blood magic type of ritual that would insist on writing my affirmations/desires onto parchments, symbols, gods/goddesses/ some Hebrew and Latin lingo and all the spiritual relations with my desire, meditation and some focusing energy work. I'm still in the works with this since I've delayed this until the actual day shows up lol but if you guys have any more ideas or suggestions + I would like to hear what you all are doing for this day if you're participating. 

Quick explanation on the magic of 11/11 day:

It's a symbol and a celestial portal that represents accelerated opportunity, manifestation, and elevated frequencies

11 is considered a master number itself and truly holds extraordinary powers.

The supporting powers of the Universe unite on this day to help you manifest your desires. Let’s get into the details of this magical day. In numerology, 1 is represented by the magician. The magician is known to use his spiritual and physical tools to manifest something from which there is absolutely nothing.

With 11, the magician’s manifestation powers are doubled

 where dreams are quickly turned into reality. If you continue to notice 11 all around you, it is a sign from the Universe that you are following your divine purpose. November 11th is a great day to bring up your biggest dreams that you want to achieve.I came across a kind soul on here that recommended using ginger in your wallet to attract money. Well, they werent wrong lol.

My husband went out to the casino with his dad for the first time yesterday, & I put ginger tea into his wallet & I whispered into the ginger before I put it in the wallet, "bring home more money than he leaves with" & other things like that, & long story short, he came home with almost 500 dollars when he had 60 to start off with. 

Well, thank you kind stranger! your techniques do wonders!With the abundance of information available nowadays, I (naively) thought that pretty much every important occult or magical text worth reading is out in the open for every interested scholar to study. After all, grimoires that used to be sacrilegious hidden pleasures of noble folks can now be bought for a couple of bucks on Amazon.

But reading books on quabalistic/Jewish magic, I came across a source book called Shorshei Ha-Shemot by Rabbi Moses Zacuto. Shorshei Ha-Shemot translates to The Root of the Names and is a compendium of holy words of power and their magical uses from the 16th century.

When trying to find a copy of the book I quickly learned, that only the Hebrew original is available on some niche Jewish websites. Sadly I can only read Hebrew, but don’t understand it.

There is an English translation, that was split into 5 tomes and each of them costs prices up to 500 dollars, if they can be found at all. In a blog entry it was even stated, that for a while Rabbis were doing a background checks on people before selling the book to them and that subsequent versions had whole passages cut from the text that where deemed unfit for the public.

It is interesting to me, that such a widely known book, is so hard to come by and naturally makes me very curious what secrets it holds. Either I’m overestimating the importance of the text or - and this is my guess - some people are really not interested to have this information out there.

With my white whale cut out for me, are there any elusive magical texts, that you are lusting after, but that are just nowhere to be found? What insights or powers are you hoping to gain from those texts?Rather than doin usual spells for money, love etc. Did you do the magical work to grow your magic itself? How did it turn out? Did you work with specific diety?So I lack in these and would like to improve them. Is there magical way to improve them. What would you suggest? Any practices, rituals or so on? Something to read maybe?I was wondering if there might be any magick rituals for psychological healing and wholeness since I have severe anxiety and panic attacks, I was wondering if there might be any rituals you know of I could perform before bed each night to help me sleep and give me peace of mind? Thank you. 

93 93/93so recently my neighbor planted fruit trees on the line bordering our two properties. a week or so ago he was walking around his property and noticed flies and other pests gathering around a particular fruit tree. 
after digging up under the fruit tree, he found the heart of what looked like a cow or some other sort of animal buried under the tree. 

we’ve been very confused about who buried it or why and wonder if it’s some kind of ritual? 

neither of us know much about the occult and similar things but it seems like something that might be a ritual. i tried googling why you would bury a cow’s heart but i can’t find anything about it. any help about what this means would be great!I been talking to a lot of folks about talismanic magic, and have noticed a mistake that is being made because they are doing the work in the right day and hour of a planet, But while the planet is in detriment, afflicted, or in the house of their fall. So make sure your looking at these factors. So many people it turns out is making this mistake only to say to hell with talismans. Also the planets with the longest orbits are usually the ones this is happening in. I met a lot of people who disregard astrological education and try to skip straight to practice. There is a lot of variables at play. Christopher  Warnock mentions in his book Secrets of Planetary Magic in a lot more detail, so consult this book. I still use it as reference. It is only like 100 pages long and one of the best books on planetary magic. Also the Fagan Bradly astrological chart is the best if you subtract 5 degrees and 6 minutes.I cant understand, demons are cool af and more entertaining than angels, and are willing to give you tough love to level up and take your power back, yet everybody seems to hate on them why? Can somebody explain? If you find that demons are evil its 99% just your projections being reflected back to you, this is why its very important to study yourself and do some shadow work, you can easily deceive yourself, with your own limiting beliefs. Everything is just energy, energy is neutral, its what you are willing to do with it! Dont blame demons lolI hope this is allowed,  but I haven't practiced in a very long time,  and I can't seem to find a lot of the online resources i used to use.  What are your favorites for learning about magick, practicing,  spellwork, etc? Anything any everything is welcome :)I paint. Very well actully but 99% of the art in my room was painted/stenciled/drawn etc under the influence. Im recovering as we speak. But i would stay up for day painting and write down really messed up stuff as bout how im worthless and my family hates me/i hate them etc while i was strung out. I love my paintings. There incredible and i just picked up tattooing. Sobered up pretty much. But throughout my house are notebooks full of hate self hate self doubt KYS and other horrible negative energy type things. Im an artist so theres probably 20 full notebooks of drawing with a random drug enduced rant about hating my life.

Ive put stickers around my house that say gratitude and everytime i randomly see one i think to my self something im grateful for having. Family. A home. Not being a hard drug addict etc. 

Is there some way to properly dispose of the notes? I assumed burning them would be similar to a sigil so didnt want that. Im ripping these pages out of the notebooks and can see i was manic when written. Even the art has stuff written on it thats negative. Not judge edgy boy stuff. I was smudging with white sage then my family got mad at me because it wasnt gifted to me as indian tradition.  Well not all but they made me feel like shit. I was smudgingbthe house after finding my brother dead last month. Just trying to help.

ThanksThis is a semi-general enquiry. Particularly  advice on working with deities that you believe sought communication with you first.

Not too long ago I connected a large number of synchronicities, asked on reddit forums, and came to the conclusion that a certain deity might be trying to contact me, to work with me, perhaps? I had a couple meditation and dream experiences after that realisation that seemed to confirm this. 

I searched on various forums seeing how people work with deities and there was no real concrete answer. Sure some people might give offerings to deities, create shrines and sigils and all that kind of stuff - but then what? How do you actually work with a deity? Do you just meditate and it pops up in your mind or incarnate?

I’m keen to know what people’s experience is with working with deities and how they personally go/went about “working with” them. How do you define working with a deity?

Extra:
I also have some other questions on this topic that I’d like to see what other people think. Do you believe deities to be Archangels or do you draw a distinction? I’ve had some people that prefer to refer to deities as spirit guides, what do you think about this? What makes a deity wholly positive or negative?Before posting the ritual, everyone who is going to try it has to make a promise: Any extra, unexpected money made in the upcoming month has to be put towards good vibes things. By teaching this spell I take on part of the karma of everyone using it so I don't want any karma bonds with Walmart or a butcher shop or lame shit like that. Spend it on local businesses.

Ok, so the full moon is tonight and that is always an opportunity for some magick. This is a simple ritual, a couple minutes of preparation and then let it sit overnight. The ingredients are: glass bowl, money, sugar, water, access to moonlight. The last one might be hard for some people, sorry if that is the case.

&#x200B;

Choose a spot that will have access to the moonlight. A windowsill works perfectly. Cleanse the energy of the spot in any way you see fit. Then, put some money down. It can be a quarter or a $100 bill, or anything in between. Over the money, put the glass bowl. Then, in the bowl, add sugar and water. Let it sit overnight in the moonlight.

&#x200B;

That is it. I have added my own flair to it, by using the water to water my plants, and use the symbolism to grow a money tree on my astral plane sanctuary, sometimes I drink the water too so it empowers my aura, but none of that is necessary. You can do whatever you want with the water. I also put crystals all around the bowl and one in the sugar water, but this is also unnecessary.

&#x200B;

With the money that you used, this money is a little magical. Maybe invest it or donate it or spend it at a local business, something good vibes like that.

Thanks for reading!I found this video a few months ago. Moore’s take on magick is absolutely fascinating to me, and I wish to share it with you all.
https://youtu.be/RtbBmIfLYbk
I’ve been practicing Buddhist style (rising/falling of the breath) meditation and deep breathing exercises for almost 10 years now. I have some experience and great interest in magick, casting sigils and banishing rituals, pendulum work with other gods, but I find myself needing more… maybe something isn’t clicking for me.

How do you directly apply the gnosis state achieved in meditation to more tangible magick practice? Idk if I need some guidance or direction, some connection. Still I feel lost in this applicational practice.

Maybe I’m wanting something that isn’t actually achievable in this body. Suggestions? 

TY!!The only thing i have at the moment is hope. I hope at least some of the ways, rituals, gods, demons, (insert anything occult here,) is real. I wouldnt say that i am in disbelief ( at least not regarding everthing) but i have not found a single scrap of what i would concider evidence, to make me believe it either. I want to so badly. I am sceptical and realistic of nature, which works well for me, but i am not above believing something ''silly'' as long as a can have any form of personal experience with it. Physical or mental. I would just love at least ONE thing, be it big or small, that i cant deny.

I pretty much have two questions.

1. If you were sceptical at one point; What made you start believing. What was the turning point?
2. Do you have anything that you believe would make me believe. Any one thing would suffice. Just something that i no way can explain with logic and physics. ( At least not conventional.)

Cheers Friends!First chapter: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycgv5Xn-NUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycgv5Xn-NUM)

I'll be adding a new video chapter each day until completion.I've been practicing for quite some time. I've had so much going on in my life and I'm struggling to keep focus during meditation and intention setting. Any tips or tricks for keeping focus and supercharging your meditation and intention setting?I wrote a song for a boy, and there was one night, it was playing so audibly in my house even though there was nothing playing. I thought I was going loopy 

But something told me, he was playing it at that moment. I intended it for him and put all my intention in, and the song itself is like a siren song. Lots of chanting. 

Accidental music magick, ya think?I'm 36 and I've been reading bits and pieces most of my adult life. Only now at this "late" stage have i started a serious practice whereas a lot of the people writing about magick speak from the experience of having been at it since teenagedom. Has anyone got anything to share about starting your path during fully weathered adulthood? Thanks. Ta. Cheers.Something I did recently. I did not use sigils to bring about the event, but my planning and execution went so well that in the rapture of having my desires manifested I casted a sigil to sort of wrap up the experience nicely. 

So far what it's done for me was to set boundaries as in the experience starts here and ends here, nothing more nothing less. It doesn't bleed over into future operations and stays there where I want it to.
Hello! I’m new to the magick community and my current practices are primarily mindfulness meditation, yoga, shadow work, and weekly tarot reading. I’ve also lightly dabbled with basic banishing rituals and attempts at deity invocation. I currently work as an elementary school teacher but have constantly struggled with confidence in interacting with students as an authority figure during almost two years of teaching. I lack a substantial presence within the classroom (often feeling cornered by students) and I have a difficult time being stern with students who typically end up trying to negotiate their way out of consequences. I believe that this is mostly due to my emotional maturity (early 20’s male) and a slowly growing self-esteem which I’ve struggled with for awhile now. These issues have caused me a lot of emotional distress and I feel that I’m failing my students and my fellow staff members. 

I’m not trying to spiritually bypass my issues in place of practical methods but I wanted to see if anyone could recommend some beginner-friendly practices that can help build my self-confidence and allow me to better tackle the role of a firm but caring authority figure.Hey y’all! This is my first post on this sub and I know next to nothing 😅 

I’ve been having visions and other similar stuff happen to me a lot. Recently, especially now that I’ve “discovered” the possibility of magic, I got to thinking that its probably very likely that I could have done magic as a child unknowingly. As a child I deeply believed in any and everything magical. I’ve always had an attraction to the supernatural. And now that I’m a little older I feel like I’m “missing” certain abilities or a certain understanding I once had.

Somehow I’m hiding it from myself- possibly in my subconscious.

 I have a theory that if I did magic in the past, with the intention of repressing certain memories or thoughts etc, it would then make sense that once I “re awaken” so to speak- then I’d recall my repressed memories ect and be able to use the gifts I’ve lost...


 If you’re someone who believes in reincarnation, are their rules? Could I have developed a solar body, chosen to come back to earth in this time, in an earthly ‘vessel’ that has a strong/intense magical affinity??? 😱
Are there other possibilities I should consider? 










I’ve done a few google searches for “is magic real?” and stuff like that after a few episodes of midnight gospel 🤣 Most of my friends are also into spiritual and supernatural shit and I come from a non denominational christian background and an immigrant family + that’s important to note. My childhood friend introduced me to crystals, astrology, manifesting, and stuff about angel numbers and human design(?)What’s the best way to dismantle protective wards? 

My husband and I are moving out of a rental to our own home (yay!) Our landlady has had over ten showings of this nice property and can’t seem to get it rented. At first we thought it was just the time of year, but this morning I realized the protective wards I put in place are maybe working *too* well and keeping potential tenants away. 

How can I relax some of these wards to make it more welcoming and help my landlady out?
Edit: the wards include floor washing, pentagrams in castor oil over the doors, horseshoes, and prayer.so i’ve been interested in hoodoo, but the basis behind it seems that it’s your ancestors that give spells or rituals power? the problem is i built an ancestor altar a few months ago, and it seems like no matter how much i try to work w it ive never had any communication or signs from them at all. i tried for months before i took it down. not to mention i have a small family anyway and don’t have any dead relatives that i know. is there a way to practice magick/cast spells without connecting w ancestors or spirits at all? i’ve tried many different spells before and i honestly feel like none of them have ever worked. how can i strengthen my power and become better at magick?If you find your self struggling to achieve a teance state or cant seem to astral project im here to give you a cheat code.
Dont sleep the night before or try and stay as late as possible (dont over do it) . 

Youll find lucid dreaming and astral prohection way easier if you get into the twilight state before you consciously drift off. 
To my demonalters and enochian practicioners youll find performing  rituals while insanely tired can make you more aware and sensitive to the changes in the room.

P.s.a (some shit i shouldnt have to say)
dont fucking over do it. Sleep deprivation can
definitely be dangerous and you should be smart about it. Dont be stupid  and stay up for longer than a day and if you feel like your finna pass out dont leave your house or drive.hi!! i’ve been manifesting something for some time, all was good (i even got proves of them getting closer to completion) till recently when i started to get very mixed thoughts. like sometimes i feel very optimistic about it, then i feel like it can’t come true. what i mean is that my spiritual side feels like it’s gonna happen, yet my rational doesn’t. what do you think it means? and how do you stay patient while waiting for your manifestations to come true?*Disclaimer: I am not, nor do I recommend, using magick as a substitute for medical treatment. My intention is to supplement treatment and help handle symptoms until I find a treatment that works.*  


I've been diagnosed with severe Major Depressive Disorder for the last 7 years. As such I have a difficult time committing to anything, even small things like brushing my hair daily. I've tried so many treatments, but I'm still struggling. I've tried praying to deities, but I'd like to do something under my own power; I much prefer to do my own spellwork than to borrow from a higher power.   


Many times when I try to search for it online, the answers come up with a mixture of "don't use magick for mental health", "just meditate", and "buy my anti-depression crystals". Occasionally I find some spell online, but I'd like to find something more in depth on the subject.  
  
Does anyone have experience with or advice for using magick to help deal with depression?   
Are there any resources out there related to magick and mental health?Hi! I’m a little new to doing witchcraft. I’ve dabbled in it over the years but haven’t ever been super serious about it. Recently I’ve been wanting to get back into it with a new passion for the art.

I’ve been interested in doing a spell for my boyfriend who is morbidly obese. He’s been wanting to lose weight and has successfully lost 100 lbs in past, going from 410 to 310 lbs. I asked his permission to which he said it was okay since witchcraft is also done by members of his family, so he’s aware of the practice and open to help.

I wanted to do something that incorporated helping him with his self esteem/ self image issues. I also wanted to create a sense of motivation for him to continue succeeding (for him to never falter in his task), and to help heal him from his eating disorder.

If anyone has any advice on where to start or even a spell you’re willing to share, I will be extremely grateful. You will be helping to end the love of my life’s suffering and for us to be able to live a long life together.

Or can anyone direct me somewhere where I can get information on how to perform a spell like this?

Edit: I apologize if you see this somewhere else. I’ve posted this to a couple other subreddits because I really don’t know where to start. It’s hard to find information online and I can only buy so many books.I’ve heard about protection spells that you put around certain areas, like your room or home, and I’ve heard a bit about casting circles. Do circles, or any other spells, when cast stay on the user as they move around? ex. I cast a protection spell on myself at home, will it stay with me if I go to the store?I feel like a lot of folks are afraid to fully commit to Magick. They have a vague pseudo-psychological defense in case someone pushes them, but they're scared to truly invest in it as an authentic modality for change.

Lately I have gotten past this, and I work with Magick the same way I lift weights (it works if I put the effort in).

When did you reach this point or what do you still struggle with?I wanna hear your stories; did you gain a large amount of money through magick, became friends with a celebrity, became a talented writer, a politician etc. What’s your most impressive achievement from magick to date? I've been collecting **rare and hard to find** occult and esoteric books from the web. Alot of them are first hand copies that were distributed in forums from the early 2000's. I've been collecting since! If anyone wants to check it out, comment. Ill send a link. THANKS! and 93!Psychedelics have been super useful in my own personal experience, I’ve found they give magick a certain ‘reality’ it normally is absent of 

The last time I did ritual magick on lsd, around 200ug, I had an extremely powerful, interesting, and most importantly impactful experience. Along with some meditation and philosophy, that experience basically cured me of my social anxiety 

Interested in hearing you guys’ thoughts on the subjectSaturn is usually not associated with abundance of wealth.

Astrologers have noticed that more often an individual born with Saturn in 2nd house are millionaires compared to jupiter (assuming jupiter makes no aspect to Pluto). But why?

Well Saturn indicates a restriction in resource usage.
This restriction can be either imposed by external factors or willingly by you.

So in otherwords you can grow your resources by strictly managing it. By being Austere sometimes by taking what you have seriously.

I just want to put the idea out there that maybe Jupiter and Venus attract money to you but Saturn can make you take it more seriously and restrict bad money management.Ever since I was a little girl I could see and talk to my ancestors. I have always been in touch with them. I have been so invested in witchcraft. I studied the history behind it since I was 12. I received my first deck when I was 13. I have always wanted to get into the magic part of it all. I’m just not entirely sure how to do so. I’m very intune with my abilities, I am very energy oriented, and I’ve become very good at knowing what people are thinking. I’m not saying I’m a mind reader by any means, people are just too easy to read Sometimes. If you guys have any tips/tricks, or advice I’d love to hear it. A little push is all I need:)Well, actually it didn’t go wrong it went right.
I was in a very vulnerable moment in my life and i didn’t want to loose my significant other as our relationship was falling apart due to something stupid i did...I ended up talking to myself in a mirror, tried to contact somebody, idk who but i offered my fertility in exchange of having him back.

I know it was the most idiotic move but i did it...since then ive been noticing a lot of hormonal problems but i was too scared to go do some hormonal tests. I finally did them a few days ago and today i got them back and it did happen...apparently i have fertility issues, i still have to see my gynecologist to follow up and know better what’s going on and if it’s treatable.

Regarding my significant other i broke up with him on December as he was toxic as hell, but he still talks to me and i kind of follow up...should i let him go and block him and maybe that will make my fertility come back? What should i specifically do? I’m so sad it actually came true...

Thank you for reading and whoever is able to give me any piece of advice it would be very well appreciated.Meditation has helped me build the strength of my focus. Do you have any other recommendations?

Edit: gahdamn... the comments really popped off! This is a deeply personal topic for many, and I appreciate everyone’s attempts to advise, educate, defend, and reassure me.i was wondering, in order to start my first spell, what do i do for it? i was thinking a protection jar but how would i know how to make it? should i use a book of spells to know the steps or search it up online? i just dont know how to know a spell in generalIn my [Practical Advice for Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/realwitchcraft/comments/bcs5x0/practical_advice_for_beginners/) post, I advise new practitioners to steer away from working with demons (aka Goetic spirits) while they're still in their "don't know what I'm doing" phase.  I think this is critical.  As a rule, beginners don't really have to worry about the "dangers of calling upon powers they barely understand" because, being ignorant beginners, they don't have enough knowledge and power to actually do significant damage.  But for every rule, exceptions.  Demons do, occasionally, screw the pooch in ways that cause people serious long-term [regret](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/83fz4i/so_you_want_to_summon_a_demon/).  And they can be summoned by beginners.

Now, in my 31 years of practice, I must confess I've never summoned a demon.  I don't believe this means I don't know what I'm talking about--I've been on the receiving end of demon summonings (ie demons have been sent after me by left-handers I've willfully provoked), I've run into demons several times while traveling out of body to other planes of existence (often seeking them out to fight, I was quite warlike in my younger days) and I've talked with and occasionally become good friends with left-hand path (LHP) practitioners and I've learned from their wisdom and experiences.  Most summoners of demons have not had any of these other experiences with demons, so while they certainly have a depth of knowledge, I'm not sure how their experiences and studies could provide much breadth to their perspective....

**To be crystal clear, the following are NOT among my motivations:**

* **I am not a right-hand path (RHP) proselytizer.**  I'm not in fact RHP, and haven't been since before I started studying magick.  I draw inspiration, wisdom and knowledge from *both* paths.  My patron deity is a god of war and death who in antiquity accepted human sacrifices and I'm pretty sure would be happy to again.  I don't feel the need to pretend otherwise or shy away from these truths.  In fact, I get irritated with people who put blinders on and only see happy things.
* **I'm not, strictly speaking, anti-LHP.**  I believe different people have different life-paths and destinies, including some very dark ones.  There are valid spiritual paths within the darkness, just as there are in the light, and in the grey which lies between.
* **I don't consider demons "evil".**  I'm not sure I believe there is such a thing.  Sadism, hate, lust for murder, things like that, sure, they're real.  But to call any being "evil", to me, is ignorant, as it represents a failure to understand what motivates the entity, what its self-interests are, how it sees the world, how it thinks, what it wants.  To just dismiss a being as "evil" is to pretend these things have no part of its psychological makeup.  It's reductionistic.  To understand is not to justify; to understand is to increase wisdom.

**So, why don't I work with demons?**

* **I don't believe anything's for free.**  I once asked the spirit who taught me most of what I know about ritual magick about summoning demons.  She said it was something I never wanted to do.  I asked why.  She said there are two general approaches to summoning demons, one in which you negotiate with the demon for services and the other which appears to give you control over the demon.  She said both indebt you to that demon, and you have to pay the piper after you've died.  I've never found anything she said about ritual magick to be wrong, so I don't presume this is wrong.  Because among other things....
* **Demons have had aeons to perfect the art of deception.**  I have had coworkers I profoundly disliked who believed I liked them just fine.  We never had any problems working togther to projects.  Why?  Because when there is self-interest involved, I have the ability to engage in deceptive behavior, and playing nice with my coworkers makes me a more valuable member of the department, getting me bigger raises.  One of the pieces of "evidence" that people who work with demons often cite to "prove" its safety is to discuss how unthreatening entities like King Paimon are.  Well yeah.  If I can figure out how to fool you into thinking I like you with just a few decades of work experience under my belt, how much moreso an immortal entity that's been doing this for thousands of years?  The most skillful human minipulators in the world are babies compared to immortal entities that have had thousands of years to perfect their art.  But why would demons need to be deceptive, you ask?
* **Demons really, really don't like us.**

1. **They have no problems hurting us.**  If I summoned a human spirit and told it I wanted it to go make your life absolutely miserable because you said something mean about me, virtually any human spirit would refuse on ethical grounds--nobody deserves to go through absolute misery because they said something mean.  Demons, on the other hand, are generally happy to inflict human misery whenever asked.
2. **They DO have problems helping us.**  It's not universal (see "deception" above) but demons are known to occasionally fulfill the letter of any bargain they strike while twisting the intent around when they are summoned to help rather than harm humans, causing the people who summon them significant [regret](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/83fz4i/so_you_want_to_summon_a_demon/).
3. **There's a reason you need a circle of protection and a triangle of conjuration (or similar precautions) when evoking demons.**  You don't need these things for any other spiritual entity you might evoke.  Just demons.  Just sayin'.
4. **Whenever I encounter demons on other planes of existance, they attack without provocation.**  Because I used to seek out such encounters, I've probably been in this scenario a hundred times.  Beginning with the very first encounter, violence has always ensued the moment they saw me, no exceptions.  Other people who astral travel and visit other planes of existence report the same.  So do human spirits of the dead.  Demons are at war with us.

* **There's nothing you can accomplish by summoning a demon that you can't accomplish with other techniques of magick.**  I've asked multiple experienced occultists (those with years of experience, who have significant experience with Goetic workings as part of their larger magickal studies) what they can do with a demon that they couldn't do without one.  They've never come up with anything.  One common rule of safety when working with demons is to never summon something you aren't strong enough to banish.  If you're strong enough to banish it, your magick is stronger, and anything that demon can do, you could also do--without the risks and costs outlined above.

**TL;DR:**  I don't want to risk putting myself in the hands of beings with a demonstrable history of malice towards us simply because I'm too lazy to cast some *other* spell to get what I want.Today I went with my family to the restaurant where my brother works. My father told me we were going home, which would take 40 minutes (had to wait until my brother finished his shift). I enjoyed the opportunity and asked my friend via text to come to meet me for 15-20 minutes for us to talk. She agreed and said it’d take her 10 min to come. 

Meanwhile, my father made me somewhat scared, because he said that if I went too far away and he didn’t see me, he’d leave me there (I don’t have internet on my phone, only wifi of restaurant + it’s a 20 min ride by car and 4-5 hours walking). I then went to the place I was supposed to wait for her and made a wish to the Air (the element I feel most closed to):

“Please universum, grant me at least 10 minutes extra so that I can enjoy the time with my friend. I don’t want to stay here. Only 10 minutes.”

She arrived and we had a good chat, then we said bye and I entered the car. My brother told us how his day was and that surprisingly eight people came to buy ice cream when they were already closed. Actually, he said he wasn’t sure they were 8, only that there were many, what made him take longer to get everything finished (normally doesn’t happen).

I looked at him in astonishment and then at the sky, and thanked the spirits. After that, I told everyone how the spirits heard my wish of wanting to stay longer with my friend, and that my ‘spell’ had worked. Intention is truly a powerful tool. In reality, it’s all you need.

“I’m finally becoming a better witch!”

Sooooooo happy! 😃I've been interested in expanding my consciousness or at least be able to access my greater self in the spiritual realm. Through reading books, articles, watching videos and perusing websites I've heard of different methods. 

I'm currently practicing mediation. I have experienced feeling oneness with the all (I am pantheist) and continually reach the state of combining my own personal energy with the free, uncontained energy of at least this world. However, I have never felt as though I met a greater version of myself and I certainly don't feel like I'm on a different plane to interact with other beings or spiritual individuals.

I have heard of astral projection, but have no idea how to do it. I know that it is quite common among the magickal community. I also have a fear of lending myself to spiritual attacks and do not want to attract any negative energies into my life. I have also learned about the Gateway Project and am curious how it is different from the above methods I've mentioned.

If you have tips on how to reach the astral plane safely or just want to share knowledge you have on the subject/methods discussed above, please share! Thanks in advance.   Quick question, is magick hereditary? My moms a Tarot Card reader and definite empath, and I’ve watched her perform readings that definatly connect with peoples past, present, and future emotions, and I was just wondering if I have empathy because she has it.

   Also I think my stepdad might have magical tendencies, such as being able to detect black magick/ use of blood rituals, can cast will-powered spells (though he only seems to work with wind and air currents), has had encountered a Shea once or twice, and tends to make technology glitch out.

   I don’t know if he’s been rubbing of on me, as I’ve known him most of my life.

   Can someone help me figure this out? I would seriously appreciate it**If you are reading this - it means you're still ALIVE!** 

##### 2020  was rough! One way or another it challenged you, some even fought for their very lives - others, unfortunately, did not win the battle. But here YOU are - reading these words on a digital wall off a screen in the palm of your hand. Can you feel the weight of the device, can you hear your voice reading my words? 

If so - congratulations, you're still here and that means you still have influence over YOUR reality. 

I  personally feel that 2020 was a forced slowdown to allow those who were willing to re-invent themselves the opportunity to do so. This means that the systems we sustained with our daily rituals, needed to break down and wither. This process can be very painful and as we experience the loss, pain, and sadness - we untangle ourselves from the way things  "used to be". 

Let  2021 **mark the year of your new paradigm**, your new reality, your new configuration of life. Don't let the external conditions dictate your internal life - let the [vision](https://www.jeandregerber.com)that was birthed in 2020  manifest in  2021 so rapidly, you'd think [**it's Magick**](https://discord.gg/KZZf5gk)**.** 

&#x200B;

Allow your [**breath to guide you**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeandreGerberTrip), connect to your emotions, learn new things, choose happy - **become your highest self TODAY**. And when you need a helping hand, be humble enough to ask for it. Thank you for being here, and may your 2021 be the first year of your best life. 

May this year go in your favor. May you have the wisdom to change when it is necessary to change. 

Good luck fellow travelers!Well, where do I begin? I am fairly new to my magical journey. I have been reading and researching for a little over 1,5 years now. When I look back on my life now, I can say I have been drawn to magic my whole life, starting as young as kindergarten, yet I never acknowledged the possibility to become a witch. Here I am now, just starting on minor spells and stuff. 

So yesterday I wanted to cleanse my apartment, because I felt a lot of negative energy. My gf felt it too, even though she’s not a witch. So I prepared everything for the cleansing, cleaned the whole place, got into the mood via meditation etc.

I burned incense and sage, as I felt strongly connected to the air element. I spoke mantras and visualized white light pushing all the negative energy away, blowing them outside with the winds. 

And as I stood there, looking at the burning incense in the middle of the room, I started crying. I could not help myself. I felt so much pain emitting from the apartment (I got the apartment because the guy who lived here died (not in the apartment tho). He was mentally impaired and had a very sad time living here, totally neglected by his counselors). 
It did feel like pain left as I proceeded the cleanse, but it was very intense. As I am new to practicing I am wondering if that’s a common thing or if my apartment is cursed or something. It does feel a lot better now, balanced and more peaceful (my gf also says so), yet I am still wondering. 

Is this a thing or am I imagining things? 

Thanks so much for reading any advice ^^For anyone who has or is willing to preform things like curses and hexes. How do you feel about the energy you put out during such a ritual? 
Do you find it comes back to you? How do you keep it from coming back to you or justify doing it so it doesn't come back to you?Hello! I’m a follower of everything magick-related, from Thelema and occult high magick, to various forms of religious mysticisms, shamanism and chaos magick, so I’d consider myself at least somewhat aware in the realm of the esoteric.

One thing I can’t really wrap my head around is the left hand path, however. How is it different from the right hand path, other than adapting negative flavors in rituals? I tried to find something that makes sense to me on the internet regarding the topic but most followers of it didn’t meet that condition and failed to make me understand where the difference really is.I feel big change coming into my life. My whole energy is messed up. I am close to finsihing up designation bringing an end to my 11+ years (some partime) of institutional education.

I just need my own space to be happy. How can I bring about this space into reality. Who can I work with. Would love to chat in the box. 

Please help.I'd like to listen to your opinion and mostly  your own experiences about this topic.

Currently i have stopped practicing magick at least in the same way and periodicity than i used to. I'm no longer practicing rituals nor casting spells and i've switched to a more sutil and sober kind of self-care/spirituality. The reason of this is because i felt that i hit somekind of rock bottom recently. For a long time i had no issues with my clarity of mind while practicing and casting spells but in the last months i started to have issues with handling power. I had many unresolved probelms at the time and as a result i casted many spells to get things that i wanted but didn't knew weren't  good for me. I hurt people i loved, i hurt myself and let my unresolved shadows take control of my practice.

When i realized about all of this i felt the urge to get away from this capacity of controling aspects of my reality that weren't normaly in my control. My relationship with magick got hurt too. I feel that there's a lot of space to have a healthy relationship with one's magick practice but i'm at a point where i don't know what that means. It wasn't always like that. I used to be very mindful about what i would cast, i would have my own ethics and my own rules but then stuff happened and the worst of me got the upperhand. I honestly feel a bit of aversion to magick right know (i guess because all the stuff i did it's kinda fresh in my mind, and i guess bc somehow i'm putting the blame on it more than in myself), but something tells me that there's a better way so i'm not completely putting it away.

On the other hand, having switched to a more sober spirituality, i kinda made a vow to stop trying to take a hold on things i can't really control, a vow about renouncement and letting go the desire to control. This particular point makes me question the nature of the practice of magick. Would you say the core point of magick revolves the idea of control? **Can you have a magick practice without the desire or the willing intention of control?** I find that giving up the desire of control, one can find a way into the flow, into natural harmony with reality. And then, when you're there if anyone has experienced it, another kind of magick starts to happen, magick things happen all around you but with no actual desire manifested, with no practice taken part. I mean the kind of magick that occurs by itself when you tune your core with nature/the universe.

So, have you had any similar experiences?

All your thoughts are valuable to me as you may help me to reach a needed conclusion.

Thanks for your time!I never really understood my urge to collect bones for my alter. I had kind of this strong intuitive urge to collect bones when I first started working with certain spirits. I of course charged them with moonlight, sunlight and incense smoke and set them up on a bookshelf with stones and candles. I once shown my bone collection to a friend who was an empath. She felt they were some kind of spiritual anchor and that the spirits were of some kind of advisory role. I didn't tell her anything about what these bones meant to me beforehand. What she said seems to check out with my own personal experiences. 

As time had passed I ended up finding myself needing to move to a new place and my alter had stayed in a box for months after moving. My life was pretty chaotic for a while and I didn't have very much space or energy to focus on rituals. When I finally got my alter out of the moving box, the energy felt stale and like it didn't really have much of a charge anymore. I've since been feeling this urge to burry my old stuff, especially the bones. I feel like I need to burry my old bones. Maybe I can dig them up at a future time but right now I feel like something has to be done to them. I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid or extreme. Intuition has driven me to collect them in the first place and intuition seems to be telling me to retire them now. I would want to burry them in a way as to help keep them preserved, dry and protected. I have been keeping them in an old plastic art box whenever I didn't have them out. Burying them in a box or symbolic coffin might help preserve them but what do you think?

Do you have any idea if there might be any magical significance to burial? My spirit companions seem to have been less active at my new place although they definitely still make themselves known at times. I miss being able to just 'feel' them walking around my apartment. They don't really come inside like they used to. I don't know if my practice or lack there of is effecting my ability to interact with them.

LOL! Sorry, I forgot to mention, these are animal bones, not human. I bought them from a local business that sells ethically sourced animal bones.Should I use sage before or after my dog gets euthanized on Thursday? He’s the love of my life and I want him warm and safe wherever he goes. He was a therapy dog for hospitals and loved people so much. I want to know he’s happy and safe after he passes. I’ve read a little about sage but I just wanted opinions. I don’t know where to post this question sorry if it’s stupid. I’m just super upset and really high right now. Just fed him an awesome dinner.edit: I guess people think I'm looking for life advice - I got a therapist, I know what I want to do and I got that covered. I am looking for *magick* advice - like - what works for you? meditations? rituals? etc.

I have been dating for over 10 years now and have had constant experiences of being taken for granted or being in situations where people don't give back. I've learned since then that first of all, I have to work on more secure attachment behaviors (and I'm getting there) like telling people how I feel and what I need, and not being afraid to. I also have to work on setting boundaries and enforcing them way ahead of time, so I do not give too much and end up getting worn out to the point that I finally set a boundary and they go "whoa, you're being mean now" when really it's because that's just the first time I've set a boundary or expectation. Changing it up on people is what upsets them, so I need to have boundaries and expectations from the beginning.

I certainly am working on all this, but I started doing meditations and working with the moon to set intentions/let go on a consistent basis. Evaluate my behaviors and how to change.

I was wondering if there was any additional magick I can do to bring out unconditional love from within, as I tend to see and expect the worse after so much abuse. I want to heal and trust, using my new boundary and communication skills to protect me. I feel confident that I can handle it, but I want my inner self to radiate that as well. Because I still am a little apprehensive. I want to attract the right people and have friends that appreciate me, and I truly believe I need to be on that level with them in order to really make it work.

&#x200B;

edit: also, if it helps to understand where my mind is right now, this is a very recent dream I had that I believe has some connection to what i am trying to manifest [https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/ljid1j/locked\_in\_a\_room\_with\_a\_random\_child\_after\_seeing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/ljid1j/locked_in_a_room_with_a_random_child_after_seeing/)So far in my journey I have always refrained from cursing people. I didn't want to be burdened by the results of my action, I didn't want to interfere with the karma, so to say. However, once again I find myself in this position where I question if I am being too cowardly instead of being mature. How exactly it differs, say, from an animal biting another to inform the other of its boundaries? Why refrain from showing your will and making the other pay the price of crossing boundaries? I am not considering serious curses though, I have rather small mishaps in mind.

What are your thoughts on it?somewhat nee to high magick, and just got a wand. well it's a staff but who's keeping score. what is the energetic function of a wand, and how do *you* use them in rituals?  thanks.By thinking I mean the neurotic "do I have enough" kind of desperation and scarcity mindset. It just reinforces the "not having" condition and the emotional intensity brought about by the anxiety pretty much ensures it becomes a reality. Once I dropped the illusion of having any kind of control on anything whatsoever, things just flow in the way it naturally does. Once I stop obsessing over budget spreadsheets and counting every cent, I had zero problems with money. I consistently had what I needed.

Another practice that has been very helpful is to say a prayer before every single meal I eat. It doesn't have to be a prayer, it could be a mantra or it could be a spell. I created my own prayer within the context of my own personal paradigm. The point is to use the spell as a focal point upon which your consciousness is fixed. In the duration of the prayer (repeating the prayer if necessary), I enter into trance and begin to invoke the aspect of deity that is Abundance. The fact that the earth is adorned with a variety of both flora and fauna on sea, earth and sky is the manifestation of that tireless abundance. Life is just bursting with abundance and driven by a limitless power. You, and the food before you is part and parcel of that same power and participating in the same orchestra. The trance continues until I break into the ecstasy of being here now. At this point I offer my sincere gratitude for having my needs met and for the privilege of existing.

Another application of abundance is to be generous with the resources that you have. When my financial situation improved owing to the practices mentioned before, I would often share my boons with those around me. I sometimes pay for my friends' drinks, buy coffee for my roommate, or whatever simple act of generosity I have access to at the moment. If you practice genuine compassion and generosity, I can promise you that the corresponding return to you is good fortune. That is not to say that cold hard cash will just fall into your lap. It could be a free meal, job opportunities or new connections. When I practiced compassion and generosity, all sorts of doors were opened to me in ways I would never have imagined.

It is not enough to just invoke abundance, it has to be embodied with action to complete the process of manifestation. The logic is simple, what you put out is what you get. This is after all fundamental to magic and something we learn early on as neophytes. You embody the Jovian energy by performing acts of generosity. After all, Jupiter's corresponding sephirot on the tree of life is Mercy. And in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says to the grief-stricken son of Pandu: "If one eats from the fruit of the earth, rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil, that one is thief to his world." So to receive, one must give.Hello everyone! I’m fairly new and not new to practicing. Long story condensed down, I practiced as a teen by myself and then bad entities scared me and I stopped. I understand a fair amount but being self taught has its limits. 
I started practicing again because I’ve felt a tug to restart and with a promise of it being different. Within days I started noticed signs around me and I’m trying to figure out wtf to do. For instance:

Spoons moving toward me while I cook, almost as a gesture of helping me cook. 

Doors opening when I am looking in the general area. 

Creaks in a room whenever I practice. Sometimes a thumping that is in rhythm with my heartbeat. Last one is disturbing and soothing at the same time. Not sure how I feel about it. 

At work, a red ribbon tore from a decoration and fell in front of me. No one else was around. Later the same day-I started writing my mom’s birthday by accident 10ish times in a row while doing work paperwork- texted my mom, she was making arrangements to put down her dog. 

I feel presences but I’m scared to engage because of my past. However I feel like they are being helpful. How do you know if what is reaching out is a guide, deity, spirit..? Any help or suggestions is appreciated.Hello all.

Some time ago, the mods hosted an important question. [["What is Magick?"]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/i5cx58/what_is_magick/)

If you look through that thread we received some excellent answers and generated good discussion. However, since then, we have acquired 35,000 more members, so perhaps it's time for a refresher?

In your own words what is Magick?

There is no correct answer, and the moderation team is not here to tell you what to think. Instead the definition and understanding of Magick must come from you. Your own research, your own experiments, your own practice, your own experience.

Thus, we suggest you view the answers supplied by other members as definitions for you to *consider*, rather than facts they are "teaching" you.

So please, read through the previous thread, read through the replies, observe the rules and tell us your answer!Everyone keeps referring to this nebulous concept of “energy” and I haven’t found any reliable scientific data to back it up? I used to believe in it, but now my magic is very clinical and I almost don’t acknowledge the concept of energy at all. like for example, when i’m cleansing an object i used to “feel” the negative energy on it. now i simply imagine it. is there a difference, meaningfully, between these two approaches? what’s y’alls opinion on energy.Hi everyone,

I just got the book "Success Magick" and yesterday I did the first ritual. I feel like the energy from this book is overwhelming and addictive. I did some research and realised Enochian magick can be dangerous. A part of me really wants to continue with the rituals but another part of me is a bit scared.I have used sigils of transformation before with but I am a newbie to all this. I would love to know how has your experience been with this book? Have any of you felt the overwhelming energy in this book?Is it a good thing? Thank you :)Had an interesting experience today that I wanted to share…

A crow was being nasty following me, gawking at me and swooping down to peck at me. It stopped in a tree cawing as I starred at it; at an entrance to a park. Two people were looking at the crow and me looking annoyed. 

I suddenly remembered that Psalm 58 can repel attacking dogs as I read in Secrets of the Psalms. So I pulled it up on my phone and started reciting it. I made it to the 2nd verse when the crow suddenly and abruptly flew away in the opposite direction.

I never realized simply reciting psalms could be so powerful!Hi guys. I was wondering, what are some ways to draw a connection between yourself and the sun during Midsummer? Im not attached to any particular deity, but I want to bring the energies of light and fire to myself in a few days and I was wondering if you all had any tips for getting connected to big sun energy? 

Also, are there any foods to eat for midsummer? 

ThanksWhen I feel very anxious or sad I light some candles and it calms me down immediately. This brought me to have at least one candle lit all the time at home. Does anyone know if this “need” for fire has a meaning/explanation? Thank you 🙏**I've recently accepted I'm a psychic medium**. I'm 23 now and after a lifetime of psychic experiences and a lot of internal struggle with disbelief and skepticism, I finally had to accept that I can communicate between the worlds and my experiences are real.

**I'm very mentally stimulated at night**; I find I'm more creative, curious, and wanting to stay up later. I've really noticed this starting in high school. **My abilities are pretty raw and spontaneous still so I'm not in a place yet where I can necessarily choose when/how often I can channel.** This is frustrating when I'm trying to go tf to sleep!

I recognize I have some parental ab\*se trauma that may contribute to my insomnia. I've been on/off medication for my sleep since high school, but over the past few months as I've come to accept and open up to my psychic abilities, **I intuitively know this Western white pill that dictates when I fall asleep is hindering my progress/healing as a spiritual being**.

**What tools, practices, protection, would be useful for me to consider in working with my insomnia?** **The issue is that I feel called to tap into my psychic and magick abilities/interests more at night which makes it difficult to wind down and fall asleep.** Without medication, it might take me 1,2,3 hours to finally fall asleep. I've researched holistic health practices around this already and I know the whole "dim the lights, no technology" bit. I've also tried some herbal teas and elixers and they don't seem to work well. **Looking for more magickal approaches to try out.**

P.S. Just got this mental download as I was writing this post: I might need to learn some protection practices. Spells, cleansing techniques for my bedroom/myself, protective stones, etc.I Kissed a guy 6 months ago who I had a really deep intense conversation with. That evening he broke a lot of mental distortions I had and mirrored back to me my faults and insecurities because he was the complete opposite of me (I'm emotional and he was extremely rational but we both were in our shadow because of insecurity) I felt so grounded by his rationality but I could see that we we're not compatible because he doesn't understand or care about the spiritual or ephemeral. 

But I haven't been able to stop thinking about him and I'm wondering how I can cut the energetic cord. I know that the exchange was only supposed to be for that one encounter. The universe needed me to meet him so that I could see the truths he told me but its now been SIX months and it's  become habitual for me to think about him at least once a day and I'm honestly tired and exhausted from. It's pulling me away from living my life and I don't really know what to do does anybody have any suggestions I am very very new to Magic but I'm just looking for relief and growth. Thank you 🤍I grew up in an almost cult like religious household. It left me with a very hardened heart that was completely cut off from any sort of spirituality and a desire to escape this realiity. After some separation, time, entheogens, philosophers, Alan watts, etc I don't have as big of a turn off for spirituality but since I have yet to experience anything "supernatural" I have yet to develop a belief in gods, souls, afterlifes, magic, etc. Now I have some mental and emotional blocks I've had since childhood that have shown some cracks but its like a crack on the great wall of China. In thinking of magick as a mental/spiritual program that allows a consciousness to modulate itself and not as a power you can tap into like fantasy magic it makes sense. What I'm trying to think of now is where to start. I grew up with some Jewish religious beliefs (messianic judiasm) I think that Jewish mysticism could be an avenue to start. I understand that most religions use magick even if they don't call it that anymore and actively distance themselves from magic. Which BTW is some crazy cognitive dissonance. I'm also really intrigued by entheogens and the possible combination of set, setting, intention, entheogens, and magick. If someone actually has a fireball spell like in fantasy I'd love to try it but what I'm looking for is some form of practice that I can feel comfortable with that doesn't feel like I'm indoctrination myself into one religion or another.  Any suggestions, recommendations, or ideas are welcome. While I may not believe your claims as to what the spell does I believe it worked for you and that means something.Anyone know of any magick that helps with anxiety and depression? I’ve been on antidepressants on and off for 3 years and I just don’t wanna be on it for the rest of my life. I’m looking for alternative ways, any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance, and I hope you have a lovely day xDoes anyone have any advice for practicing in secret? I live with my parents who would destroy anything that will allow me to freely practice. As a little background, I am 17, 5 months from 18, and my family are strict Christians. So, with that being said, does anyone have any advice on keeping my practice a secret successfully for the next 5 months or so? Thank you.Cleaning your space is the most basic banishing ritual! Getting rid of dirt and dust makes me feel so much lighter and inspired to create a self-directed existence. I like to treat my living space as a temple.

Today I did a decluttering session. It's like banishing all the weight from the past. I'm getting way into the idea of minimalism, having fewer object infuses those objects you consciously keep around with more significance and power.

I love to turn mundane things into magickal practices simply through conceptually reframing them!So here could be a fun topic - just watched A Dark Song (if anyone doesnt know, its a horror film about 2 people conductin a ritual to conjure their guardian angel, and takes place entirely in a house for a couple of months) last night and it was rad to see a horror film from the perspective of the ritualists for once! It seems the filmmakers wanted to pay respect to how rituals are actually made in that what you need to do to prepare and how long it can take. 

Any other films that show this perspective of magick?This book is UH-mazing. It's so beginner friendly it's almost ridiculous, even though it's not by any means instant magick. but anyone who has done any measure of preliminary study on the HGA will know that knowledge and conversation is not an overnight thing.

 Be that as it may the author says that it won't take you eighteen months to establish contact (unlike what is posited in the og Abremalin Rite) and the other benefits also precede any sort of physical or complete manifestation of the HGA(I.e. bliss, peace, synchronicity and even manifestations). There's no need for wands or long incantations or oils or incense. 

The author makes it very clear that these exercises will not disrupt your life or ask you to make unreasonable sacrifices of your time, money or sanity. You're not required to fast or become ascetic in any way either. 

Brand also summarizes the HGAs powers so succinctly in this book. One of his descriptions is that the HGA is a being that can help you "manifest your desires at will" and I think thats such a good description. The exercises are so simple that I rolled my eyes about how his students had a "difficult time" with them. 

The exercises or protocols basically involve calling out to your angel, asking for your angel's help on your problems, confiding in your angel, dedicating a daily mundane activity to your angel, putting yourself in the perspective of your angel and manifesting magickal results with your angel. Funny enough some of these exercises are things that I've already been doing in an attempt to achieve contact like praying, confiding and manifesting. 

There are sigils too but compared to the protocols, they're sort of like fillers to make the book interesting for magicians who want something flashy and occult to do. The sigils are all Hebrew and enochian based. The Hebrew sigils are the same ones you see in his other books like 72 angels and uses the 72 names of the divine. You don't need to recite or chant anything just scan your eyes over the letters. This scanning releases a lot of energy allowing you to reach a high enough level of consciousness to perceive and interact with your angel. But brand stresses that without the protocols this part of the book is pretty much useless. You basically need to forge a relationship with your HGA first before attempting full contact.

So that's my review for the book. I honestly recommend it to any magician who wants to contact their HGA and let me tell you even before I even knew this book existed I was already praying to my HGA and getting the magickal results I wanted almost as if my HGA was guiding me. I'll stop the review here bc it's already too damn long. So good luck and happy reading.Not exactly new to practicing, but I’ve realized that Wicca isn’t really my thing. I mostly want to be doing angel magick and enochian based practices. I’m reading Angels and Archangels by Damien Echols and he references his first book, High Magick, quite a bit but also states that the book I’m reading goes into more detail about certain ceremonial Magick that is mentioned in High Magick. Im wondering if anyone has read both and, based off of what direction I want to go in (angel magick), if it’s necessary to read both.Hey everyone!

Thought I would share a success story here.

A while back I asked about a sigil with the intention of raising my salary, after I already made and charged the sigil - silly nooby - plus this was after the sigil for a promotion - was to let the higher ups see my work ethic and abilities and this resulted in a promotion, so not directly a sigil for a promotion - already worked. The first success! (actually the second succes, first was one I made for an incredibly important exam which I passed with flying colours)

Anyway! Here we are about two months later and I got a promotion and my salary increased again after the promotion! 

The best part is, this sigil just keeps on giving! There is another opportunity that has come up and I will be increasing my salary again once I get back from training in about one month, the company is even going to pay up the outstanding amount and reimburse me for the costs I already had to do the training myself 😁

Damn, this is really the craziest thing I have ever experienced, I am still in awe of the power the creations have.

Just imagine the possibilities!Hello there, I'm an omnist witch who has spent the last six years trying to deepen my relationship with the gods of humanity and the earth. An atheist/agnostic for most of my life up until my thirties, I took up a magical path late in life, focusing on spirit work, basicly trying to contact and sync with non-human spirits (i'm not really interested in talking to the dead).

I've had successes with the fae early on, and now i work with several pantheons  (among which are the Egyptian, GrecoRoman, Celtic, Norse, Sumerian and Hindu) and ive some experience with the goetia, although i do not practice black magick, nor white magick all too much for that matter. My interest lies solely in piercing the veil between our world and the world of gods and spirits, to achieve a connection which was long lost to us.

The reason for this post is that I'm searching for other people on the same path, you can do only so much alone. Ive noticed I make most of my progress when meeting new interesting viewpoints that I can improve my own with.

I have a small circle of friends who I talk daily with online on messenger, if you are interested send me a pm.Sometimes it seems just about anything could happen during magick work or anything could come from it. What are some stories you have of anything bizarre, silly, or inconvenient experiences during or from magick practice? What did you do to remedy it, if that was necessary?I remember Damien Echols, the Golden Dawn, and other spiritual paths describe the use of breathing techniques for spiritual growth and other purposes. Like I know the Golden Dawn teaches the fourfold breath, which I think is the same as the earth breath, and it’s used as a grounding technique to master elemental earth. 

I remember being amazed, listening to a psychology podcast, talk about breathing techniques for motivation. It said “some people are too mentally hyper active and there’s a breathing technique to calm them down and help them to focus” ( I recognized this as the fourfold breath immediately)

“Others are under motivated and need to be stimulated into action. There’s a breathing technique for this too”. I recognized this as (((I think))) the breath of fire, which I don’t think even know if it’s a think and i forgot where I learnt it.  Where can I learn about breathing techniques like this?Edit: I have some good resources down at the bottom 

After scouring through hundreds of books on Amazon.
I realize that the beginner student is kinda in a pickle.
It seems like authors just skim over stuff or force a religious doctrine down your throat when you just want to learn the craft or specialize in a specific discipline.

My advice for exploring new books is to always always ALWAYS read the 3 star reviews first. 5 star reviews are shills and 1 star reviews are haters. Neither in my opinion give a balanced view of the book. Next look at the table of contents. Try to combine that with the 3 star reviews. 

Im gonna get flak for this but books that say Wicca on it are most likely to be the most superficial stuff on that craft. In most situations the author tends to have an elementary knowledge on said subject. There is the issue of throwing in traditions and techniques of closed practices in there.
Im not saying all books that have Wicca on it are bad but know that there is a tendency of watering things down. This watering down will hurt your progress.

If you wanna learn Celtic Magic learn it from a Celtic druid learn it from the source. That is gonna help you a lot.

I'm coming to the conclusion that websites that offer courses online tend to be better than the bookstore as far as modern witchcraft and ceremonial magic although I hear Damon Brand is pretty good.

Also Stop asking for spells. Its not that we dont wanna give you them trust me I got plenty. Spells by itself are hollow. Spells dont make the magician either.


Here are some very good practicioners I know.

Mindandmagick - Planetary Magician youtube


Crescent City Conjure - A hoodoo rootworker/Alexandrian witch. A Black American and rootworking was passed down via family so this guy is straight from the source. Also has a website that teaches classes and has free spells with demonstrations on youtube.


Archan-publishing - Angelic Magick or Ars Paulina
Basically I study under the Order of the Light of the 🌹
I will be fully initiated when I return from my military deployment. They have an initation path. Each book you buy from them is a stand alone woth several exercises. Very much packed with information and no filler. The reader is expected to begin working immediately with books. They are not meant to be set back on the shelf but to be used over and over again.
My favorite book is the book of the Ritual Tarot. It uses the he Major Arcana to forecast the years ahead and then uses Angelic magick to minimize the bad years that may come up

Thanks for listening to my rant.I feel like I know the answer, but just curious if anyone has taken this path.
So all in all I’ve never dabbled with ritual magick or magick in general. Unless you consider manifestation and prayer as magick, although the more I read of enochian magick the more tempted I am to begin practicing it. 
So my question is would you advise against jumping straight into enochian magick or do you suggest practicing more beginner style magick. I am also very interested in the astral I have projected before, but I was on mushrooms and it was terrifying because things went south and almost was trapped in a void if that makes sense. Dont feel like elaborating, but pretty much I freed myself through the power of love instead of being consumed by darkness. I want to start astral projecting now, but I feel like I should have more protection. I want to connect with ancestors/spirit guides and angels.

Any advice?This post is not about how to get better sleep or how to stop waking up at 3am. 

I am awaken at these specific times. No matter what time I sleep, 9PM or 1AM, I wake up. My wife said, there might be an entity trying to connect. That I should acknowledge and ask what’s the deal. When I wake up, it feels like a jolt and I don’t feel groggy or tired. 

I banish twice a day using Sword Banishing. (Yohach Kalach). I also do a modified middle pillar after.

I feel it’s an opportunity to do some magick but I’m not sure what. I saw on YT that if you get awaken at this time, this is the best time to manifest as it is energetically calm. Just want to know your thoughts/opinion on this and also what could be causing me to wake up at these times. Thanks!Any suggestions or rituals to connect with the allfather. I want to connect with him as the next deitie that i tether from the ether. No wrong answers.
Thanks, love ya'll 😊🧙‍♂️🤟🤞🙏Hi all!! I’m not sure if this is allowed and I totally understand if not, but I just started a Celtic Shamanism community and wanted to let anyone who was looking find it!

You can find the group at r/CelticShamanism

Thanks all, blessed be 😄so i was mostly raised christian, though it never really resonated with me. i had too many questions that were apparently taboo (what if god is a little otherdimensional alien boy and we’re a painting that hes doing in his attic? what if we’re all god and we’re playing hide and seek? like we literally do not know.) and i dont remember praying as a child more than a few times. i found out about buddhism at 13, and THAT resonated. that was my first glimpse of the idea that it’s all energy, and that it doesn’t just disappear from “existence”. 

for the last few years ive been becoming more aware of how energy works, and my own influence. becoming more sensitive to the energy of objects and people and words and even certain uses of the internet. and a particular night on lsd made me believe in a higher power for the first time. my problem is that i’ve been increasingly interested in magick as a spiritual practice, but my christian indoctrination is embedded deep in there, keeping me from seriously pursuing realization through work with things that christianity has deemed bad. 

i have recurring thoughts and fears about being “evil” (being told that psychics and witches were evil growing up and then discovering my own gifts), or about the things i ask spirit for or prepare spells for requiring some nefarious price, blah blah. 

honestly, it wasnt so scary for me until i started playing with energy in a possibly haunted and overall just low vibing house. for one night i was able to see into some other dimension, energy that changes form according to peoples words or will. id been collecting spare bits of energy and turning them into light (it felt really good and it was interesting that i just knew how to do that), until i heard a warning about the dark not liking the light. any time i went back to that house afterwards i was under spiritual attack. then all these thoughts about losing my soul or being evil or hurting someone with my magick started bouncing around in my mind. 

all i want to do is experiment with things like sigils and herbalism, align myself and my development with the seasons, talk to the earth without feeling like some blasphemous failure. to trust that it is possible for people to tune into the frequency of nature, or the universe, and work with that, and not sabotage myself with all of this “devils gonna getcha ;)” shit. more than anything i want to work with healing energy, master the ability ive discovered to channel and transmute and use that to bring nourishment to myself, the earth, and her inhabitants. 

anyway, for the love of gods can somebody please snap me out of this christian fever dream? let me know that its okay to question what the word god means to me and that that doesnt mean im eternally damned? (even though i firmly believe that telling someone theyre going to hell is dark magick in and of itself, and that hell is nothing more than a lower state of consciousness. it still eats away at my thoughts.)Has anyone seen an angel during the LBRP, if so could you describe them?So I'll start off by saying, I'm disabled. I've got a lot of complex issues but the biggest things I struggle with when it comes to practicing are ME/CFS and chronic pain. I used to meditate and do spells regularly, and the basics still come pretty easily to me (centering, grounding, ect) but I sort of quit for a few years. Since that time, my disabilities have progressed and now that I've gotten back into witchcraft I've realized how much more difficult it is to even do things like meditate, which used to be second nature to me. My pain distracts me and makes it hard to sit still for any period of time and my fatigue makes spell casting incredibly difficult. I'll often get really bad brain fog and lose track of what I'm meant to be concentrating on.

I guess I'm interested to see if anyone else deals with these sorts of things and how they've managed to make things work for them. 

I'm currently working on a longer spell that I'm supposed to work with a bit every day for the first two weeks, but I don't think I'll be able to tonight and that's rather distressing.

Update: Okay, no lie, I got a little overwhelmed by the number of responses. I really appreciate everyone who commented.

For those of you who replied looking for the same answers that I was looking for, let me add the conclusion I've come to over the last few days.

Anything worth doing is worth doing half way. If my pain is too bad to do a whole ritual, it's alright for me to shut things down and try to finish it later. If I can't afford the energy it takes to focus on a candle and imbue my will into it for and hour, maybe I can afford to do it for 5 or 10 minutes. If I can't do a sage cleanse, I can use bells or sun light. And if I can't do anything, the universe will understand. Everything is circular, anyway. If I miss this full moon, there will be another. The great thing about having correspondences with the days of the week is that there'll be another one in just 7 days!

Work smart, take short cuts, use birthday candles, meditate while laying down, trace protection sigils into your palm while you wait at the doctors office. Hard work is important and when your hard work doesn't look like other people's hard work it can be really discouraging. But I gotta believe that whatever forces are out there are taking into account that I'm doing my best with what I have. And that's good enough.Just a reminder. Dont preserve yourself in a cocoon of beliefs that isn’t keeping you on the path of what you truly want out of this life your currently dealing with. That same evolutionary piece of information can morph into a distraction down the line. Dont linger on learning your colors, just be aware of the spectrum and keep it in your foundation so you can continue to build upon your understanding. 

Also, i hope your not buried in study all day every day. Your not constrained by the nature of this practice to be a hermit magickian. This art is a part of this world, not outside it (contextually speaking). We aren’t separate from being human, it’s kool to grab a drink with a friend every now and then and talk about normal topics like GTA or sports cars or whatever. 

For whoever needs to hear it. Bless 🙌🏾Hello all,

I'm wondering if anyone has dabbled much into blood magick?
Or even such as simply adding blood into a ritual or meditation? 

I'm aware that blood is very powerful, and that it can attract cons. But I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to share their experience in whatever or however you've practiced with it.

Or if it is something to just stay away from, why?

Many blessingsI've practiced witchcraft both solitary and in groups for a couple decades and in the past few years I've been drawn to Ceremonial or 'High magick'.

I really want to connect with others and learn, but whenever I talk to others who practice CM/HM, either online or in person, I am really put off by the attitudes I find.

People putting down others practices, trashing authors and theories, fighting, bickering, gatekeeping, and just being unwelcoming and rude. Makes me want to go back to paganism and be in the 'temple' closet.

The people I'm taking about will likely just laugh and say good riddance. But it really makes me wonder if that type of magick is worth it, if this seems to be the fruit of many laborers.No doubt answers will vary, but I’m interested to see generally, what magical paradigm/type has been most successful for people. Be as specific as you wish! For example, divination, evocation or Chaos Magick, High Magick, ritual magick etc.Titles like: *Seer*, *Witch*, *Arcanist*, *Sorcerer*, *Wizard*, *Conjurer*, *Warlock*, *Binder*, *Magician*, *Mage*, *Animist*, *Dreamwalker*, *Channeler*, *Sage*, *Thaumaturgist*, *Mystic*, *Evoker*, *Theurge*, *Acolyte*, *Enchanter*, and *Summoner*.

I understand titles that end with the suffix of *mancer*, like *pyromancer*, *technomancer*, *cryomancer* etc. These are practitioners who use a specific substance, element, or material in their craft (fire, technology, and ice). *Alchemists* are obviously those who are proficient at alchemy. But for titles like wizard and sorcerer, they seem to be basically synonymous with one another rather than being distinct. I used to think *witches* were individuals who focused on brewing tinctures, but I soon learned that there's more to it than that.So I have been practicing Magick every day for a month now and have a strict routine I abide by every day. Since I have been practicing I've stayed away from smoking Marijuana or at least being high when ritual time comes... Basically I stop smoking 2 hours before so I'm sober(ish) by the time I do my ritual, and this is because I don't want Marijuana to be a crutch to help me perform and feel the subtle forces I am working with so that when I am out I can't achieve the same results.. My question is do you all think I'm good to smoke and do it? Do you all think I will become too relient on it or do you think I have a good enough grip on it sober that I can switch back an forth sober and high easily? What are your alls experiences?!I would like to get precise information of methods to find lost objects. I lost a very expensive gold ring and pendulum/scrying/two sticks didn't work ... I appreciate your help :)Have you ever met someone that you are almost identical to in life experience? From certain illnesses, to trauma, to career, to family background, to major life events, to beliefs, to desires etc.?

What is your personal explanation for this? Is it something along the lines of "Twin Souls"? Are they they most recent incarnation of your spirit? Are you bonded aetherically? Or is it just an extremely fun coincidence?Hi all! Thanks for sticking around while we get the sub back on it's feet.

#What does experiencing a synchronicity mean?

"[Synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) is a concept, first introduced by analytical psychologist Carl Jung, which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no causal relationship yet seem to be meaningfully related."

Have you ever been thinking about someone and they immediately call you, unprompted? Ever talk about a song right before it comes on the radio? Maybe you've bought the same sweatshirt as your sister on the same day without knowing? 

These are all examples of synchronicity. Some people claim to experience periods of more synchronicity than usual, and periods of less. Some believe them to hold deep, significant meaning. Some chalk it all up to coincidence.

Is there a meaning behind these strange events? If so...

You will feel a euphoric tingling all throughout your body, use this wisely. It’s very powerfulHi, I just bought a house and have across the street neighbor who pours daggers into me when she sees me. I have never spoken to this person, and she seems to be so nice to other people -so possibly could be karmas thing why she acts this way towards me. How can I protect myself when she tries to pour her nasty energy into me? I’ve tried visualizing a white light of armor around me, but it seems to have no effect. I’m going to live in this house Probably the rest of my life- so any advice is appreciated!This morning I cast a spell to protect the chicks we ordered in the mail while they traveled and to bring them safely home. I always get worried about the chicks when we do a mail order (this was the third time). 10 minutes later my mom came downstairs saying that she got a call that the chicks had arrived at the post office! All are safe and well 😊

My magick has never worked this fast before! I know better than to get used to it but I’m still super excitedI've lived in my house for about 3 years now. (My house is 127 years old) and in a specific spot next to the stairs where the main heating system would've been (forgot the actual name) there is sort of a negative energy, it makes me feel like I'm being watched and it just scared me. I told the spot that it didnt scare me and it didnt have any power over me. I went up stairs and in an instant there was a cold spot and all hairs stood up, including the ones on the smooth side of my forearm. I apologized and it went away. A few days later I sat and just looked at the spot. This is what I essentially said "I have absolutely no idea who or what you could possibly have been, but I want you to understand that I'm very sorry if something bad happened to you, I'd appreciate it if you would stop scaring me and reach out if you want to." It kind of worked, it went away and I rarely feel like I'm being watched by something malevolent. Only the feeling left though, I still feel like there's an energy there and I'm not sure what to do. I have one theory that it may be an animal, if there were weak ones in a litter sometimes they would be drowned in a sack (puppies and kittens) and there isn't a body of water near where I am. It's a theory and I dont think it's right. Not sure I'd be able to figure it out but I'd like to know if there's a way I can help. I dont know how to reach out, and I've sympathized with the energy. Is there a way I could possibly bond with it? I dont want it to be struggling if there is something I can do to assist it. Like I said I have no idea what to do. If it was originally a more dark presence of sorts is that something I should even be considering?For the past two years I've struggled with feeling spiritually connected to my craft, or connecting to anything spiritually. It's been a stressful two years and I want to get back into my practice, but I'm having trouble getting back into the right mindset for it. 

Any advice on how to get reconnected spiritually? What are your personal methods for reconnecting with your craft after a long time?Not when he bought the house but when he was actually there to do the ritual. Apparently he didn't finish the ritual.  

Buying Boleskine House on the shore of Loch Ness, he commenced performing the Abramelin, a six-month black magic ritual that nobody had dared undertake in centuries. While the aim of the ritual is to invoke the magician’s Holy Guardian Angel, to do so he must also evoke the twelve Kings and Dukes of Hell - including Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan and Belial – and bind them, thereby gaining command of them in his own mental universe. The ceremony has an introduction which states that nobody should perform it.

While Crowley was not afraid to undertake the Abramelin, he broke it off before completion to return to London to take sides in a schism in the Golden Dawn.Disclaimer, I'm venting a bit here, so if this post comes off as a bit negative, that may be the reason why.

I won't mention names but I've been helping someone get into contact with certain daemonic entities for a while at their request. I gave them a ritual which they did perform but now they're asking me "okay what do I do next?".

I informed them that their best bet is to use their own intuition with regards to magick and the occult to which they basically responded with anger since I didn't give them a specific response that they wanted and they basically claimed they wanted me to lay out every step of their path for them.

I told them that they should meditate more to develop their intuition and learn to change their mindset so they could better tap into magickal currents instead of looking at magick and the occult as a mechanical process only to be met with more anger basically demanding that I tell them exactly what they need to do in this part of their personal journey.

I'll admit, I'm getting quite fed up with these types of people who expect others to walk their path for them without really putting in much if any alchemical work.

Does anyone else here have similar types of experiences like this? How do you tell someone you can't walk their path for them without coming off as rude? Does it make me the asshole because I didn't have the specific answers that someone else wanted from me?This community has given me so much understanding and I'm so grateful to all who chime in, not only on my posts but for all those who gain from coming here. I'm very interested to hear this community's thoughts on the following three questions:

1. Is it correct to say that what we call "God", or the collective consciousness, or the energy that pervades throughout everything, is also what is callled the Ain in Kabbalah?
2. Growing up in a Christian household, myself and many others are brought up to believe that   
"God" is a central figure, one entity. However as my understanding increases, I very much view God as a decentralized force.  Does magick give any sort of centralized/localization to God aside from creation? 
3. What is "sin" defined as in Magick?

Thank you to whomever wishes to reply, love and lightSerious question. I have a mental condition where I feel detached from people and the world. I don't really know how to connect with people and don't have much family so I have a fear that when I die, I'll be totally lost and alone in emptiness. If I bind myself to some non-physical being, can I create a safety net so I don't have to be technically alone? It would be less disorienting if someone could watch over me while I'm in this life.Hey y’all I’m currently on my period and wanted to try doing a spell with my blood. I was wondering if there was a certain way to get it out. I read many things about using a diva cup but mine got stuck last time I used it 😅. Also what kind of spells would be best to do with it?As I further refine my own personal rituals and my understanding thereof, I was contemplating the Cardinal directions and their elemental associations. I've always associated them with the "traditional" practice, which I learned many years ago and still feel the most comfortable with: East=Air, South=Fire, West=Water and North=Earth.

Moving on to the Hexagram rituals of the Golden Dawn, they have a different correspondence of the elemental directions: East=Fire, South=Earth, West=Air and North=Water. It sort of bothered me at first, and I have gone back and forth doing it that way and also correcting the forms to match the "traditional" directions.

In Crowley's ritual Liber Vel Reguli, he changes the directions as follows: East=Earth, South=Fire, West=Water and North=Air. This sort of inspired me to approach this in a new way of thinking. I realized that it is up to the Magician to decide what is best for themselves, based in firm understanding and trial and error. Afterall, you are the one who is manipulating your own universe. I've also read, your own personal geography plays a roll in your decision. 

So here is what I have been pondering over: 

If you compare the Tree of Life with the directions of a compass, then the South will correlate with Malkuth/The Kingdom, the Nephesh and the material world or Earth (Same correlation as in the Hexagram rituals).

Then the top of the compass, North, would relate to Kether/The Crown, but also the whole Supernal Triad with Binah/Understand and Chokmah/Wisdom, or the Neshama. Knowledge, wisdom and understanding are all aspects relating to Air (Same as in Liber Vel Reguli). Also to note, the Alchemical symbol for Air is inverse of Earth, so having them opposite of each other is very  balanced astheticly.

Geburah/Strength, which is related to the element of Fire and the color Red, an Active force, is on the Right side of the Tree of Life (the pillar of severity). Chesod/Mercy, related to Water and the color Blue, a passive force, is on the Left. Both of these are aspects of the Ruach and make up our duelistic nature. So it would make sense to me to have them opposite of each other. When you superimpose the compass onto the Tree of Life on paper, West is on the Right and East on the Left. For some reason this didn't sit well with me.

If one stands in the center of the circle, at Tephareth, facing the North, the super-conscious/Neshama, with the Material world/Nephesh at your back, then your right hand is to the East and left hand to the West. This feels better to me. 

The East is the direction of the rising sun, the Luxferro, bringing light and heat, an Active force which corresponds to Geburah and therefore Fire (Same as in the Hexagram rituals). 

The West is the direction of the setting sun, which is a Passive or mutable force. Also, I live in the Bay Area of California, so according to my own geography, I've always relate the west coast to the ocean and therefore Water (Same as in Liber Vel Reguli and the "Traditional" corespondence). Again, the Alchemical symbols of Water and Fire are inverse of each other, which contributes more to this balance.

I haven't found any rituals or systems that use this particular Elemental directions. But as I further my knowledge and understanding, through research and experimentation, I felt compelled to take on this focal point and work to develop a more balanced approach.

If anyone has any experience with this or would like to share other insight, please do so.

Thank you for reading this and have a great dayHi everyone!

Over the past year or so I have really gotten into ceremonial magick. I have read many of Donald Micheal Kraig's books and have experimented Kabbalistic approach to ceremonial magick. This approach has really worked great for me because it provided a certain methodology and order that I just wasn't getting with chaos magick. Despite this, I still subscribe to the idea of gnosis in the chaos sense and try to incorporate it into my rituals. 

Fellow magicians, my question to you is (apart from sex magick) what has been the most effective way that you "do magick"? What rituals or techniques have yielded the best results?And therefore good trips/bad trips are akin to good and bad magical experiences. For me, when magick really works, I feel a sense of "high". Being inexperienced this high can quickly start spiralling down into fear and being afraid of astral entities etc. I find this experience very similar to a bad trip on something like LSD or even weed if it's your first time and you took too much. I think just reminding yourself that this is what you wanted to experience, this is why you did magick (or took drugs), and enjoying that experience completely changes a negative experience to a positive one. Just telling myself I am in control, all of this is being created/affected by MY subconscious and so nothing bad will happen can be very reassuring, and turns a bad experience (or bad drug trip) into an enlightening and illuminating one.I’ve been in kind of a slump with my practice. I’ve continued to meditate, but I haven’t attempted to do much of anything else for the past few months. I didn’t feel like I was in the right place for it, and to be honest I was afraid to fail.

I recently performed the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram for the first time in a while, and I asked to be “energetically balanced and healthy.” The next day a short auto-play trail on YouTube led to me to a video which described the book of Psalms in the Bible as “one of the most powerful spell books in the world, drawing on traditions older than the Bible itself.” It even said that the book of Psalms has its own initiation embedded in it, that one could become adept with just that book. 

So, I said “okay universe” and started reading. I got some of the most intense feelings when I read them, and I guess it started everything back up for me.

So today on the way to work I pulled out my old trusty, and prayed rain into clear skies. I totally forgot about it until I went outside on my lunch and felt a sprinkle on my head, then it started to pour. I have not felt so much joy in quite a while, and I wanted to share that with you guys....and Full Moon!" I think that most modern writers don't understand how to use these rituals. From a Hermetic perspective the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram represents the psychological realm or microcosm and the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram represents the physical realm or macrocosm. Together the rituals set up a space in which the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm is defined that I call a field. The four combinations of the banishing and invoking forms of the two rituals set up four different fields that are useful for specific magical operations.

Banishing Field (LBRP/LBRH): This is how most magicians begin their rituals when working with the Golden Dawn forms. It is, in effect, the "full shutdown" - it clears mental and spiritual forms from both the interior and exterior worlds. In can be used to completely cleanse a temple, banish spirits permanently, or neutralize a magical effect that is targeting the magician. What it also does, though, is shut down any ongoing spells that the magician has running unless they are bound to talismans or some anchor other than the magician's consciousness. If you are casting a spell that you want to work over the next week, don't end the ritual with this combination under any set of circumstances unless you're convinced you made a mistake and want to stop the spell. The effect that you just set in motion will be negated when the field goes up.

Invoking Field (LIRP/LIRH): This combination energizes all ongoing magical effects, and can be used to begin a ritual that you want to operate in both the interior and exterior worlds. A good example of this is a spell to get a good job. You want the spell to affect your psyche in such a way that you seem more confident and capable, but you also want it to shift probabilities in the material world so that the right opportunity will come your way.

Centering Field (LIRP/LBRH): This combination sets up a field in which the interior world is engaged while influences from the exterior world are neutralized. This field is ideal for exclusively psychological magical work of all sorts.

Operant Field (LBRP/LIRH): This is the one that I use the most. The field clears the interior world and then merges it the with the exterior world, setting up a space in which thought can more easily become material reality. All of the energy of a spell cast within this field is targeted on the macrocosm and the resulting probability shifts show that magick done this way just influences the outside world better - significantly better."

http://ananael.blogspot.com/2007/11/operant-field.html?m=1Hi! I’ve been a part of this community for a very short time but I have learned a ton from you folx. I’m Brazilian living in Salem ma. And the state of the country today I could feel the tension the second I woke up. Just thought I’d send out a beacon of hope to the people in Brazil and all over the world in situations less fortunate than ours. We are powerful separately, together we are unstoppable!!🖤❤️Let's go back to 2019, my life is complete shit, I feel scammed by life, disappointed and completely hopeless. I try to study the hidden secrets of our world that lead people to success. I end up creating a system of magick which is basically a mix of law of attraction and orthodox Islamic teachings. It works and blows my mind. I ask for an attractive nurse to be my wife (I'd never had a gf but always wanted one), and I end up getting one. I just land the perfect girl through a series of synchornicites. Next thing on the list is money, for that I end up effortlessly getting onto a scholarship program which pays around £16 per hour for 4 hours of study needed. It's as close to a perfect job as I can think of, easy, interesting, not repetitive, intellectually stimulating and low pressure. After then my wife buys us a fancy apartment. I make some investments, get some side hustles, I buy a high end sports car I never thought I could ever afford and stuff is great.

I don't know what it was, maybe the effects of the p#££demic, forgetting what got me here, skepticism, ingratitude or a mix of all of those things, but my mind set has gone to shit. I'm constantly negative, bitching about things non-stop, I'm not practicing the magick anymore, always worrying and feeling hopeless again. I don't know how to get out of this bad mindset. I literally have manifestations all around me but I'm now doubting the miracles and starting to feel hopeless again. Any stupid shit that happens makes me depressed, I'm bored of life and very negative. I'm viewing life from a limited "logical realistic" mindset instead of a spiritual mindset (which is what yelided results).

How can I restart and change my paradigm again? I have a few weeks off university and wanted to use this time to restart but it's only getting worse.Please bear with me whilst I get through this history bit. I've always been interested in the occult, but I have never practiced anything. this is in part due to a catholic fear factor. Initially I was introduced via fascination as a child with ghost stories and seeing how the occult was linked through Ouija boards and seances etc. I remember as a university student in the 90s going through an old bookshop and falling across a book on black magic, which was apparently a grimoire, but who knows? I read it for a few days seeing the spells and reading them and was kinda intrigued at what they promised and eventually fear overcame me again I got rid of it as quickly as possible.

Other things I've tried out are subscribing to AMORC (didn't get very far)  and looking into a golden dawn website, which looking back now was prob not legit anyway. Having recently seen Hellier on youtube a few years back, I got a copy of Allen Grenfields book referenced in it and it ignited my curiosity again.

I am interested in the ultraterrestrials he talks about, but I have always been interested in such things, as well as ascended masters, especially since reading 'with the adepts : an adventure among rosicrucians', by Franz Hartmann, which I believe was widely debunked as fantasy, Im not sure though.

I have some of HP Blavatskys works in my kindle and I have read some, but I feel I am lacking a foundational understanding,  like I should be getting a whole lot more out of it. I know this assertion of mine is true because when I read isis unveiled or the secret doctrine, there are no home truths that jump out at me that feel right... so i think Im missing something.

I now have my question: ***What direction should I go in with my studies to learn more about magick  (i.e. what books to study). I'd like to learn about*** :

* Things that can help me build a better understanding of the occult.
* Things I can do on my own.
* Examples of books about people who have made contact with higher intelligences

Finally part of me is conflicted because on the one hand I want to go deep and learn as much as I can about the occult side of the world, on the other I dont want to 'invite trouble into my life' by going down the wrong road.

but I am very open minded so, any help is appreciated.

**Edit: My main interest is in anything around ascended masters / ultraterrestrials , just in case anyone thinks i have an interest in black magick... i don't***This is a blog I wrote maybe a year ago and found it on my computer, I reread it and thought it was pretty good. Also, considering that we don't have any real modern myths, I thought I'd take a stab at it. Let me know what you think.*

Some people “quit social media” – and I was on the verge to do the same.

But to outright “quit social media” – in that you erase all your apps from your phone and deactivate all your accounts – may be denying yourself a  ‘shared-global-experience’ which is the essence of what Social Media truly is.

Social Media as a concept is not the problem – it’s how we use it that has become toxic and it’s not entirely your fault either.  The companies behind social media [helped foster toxicity](https://qz.com/1039910/how-facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-sells-our-fear-and-outrage-for-profit/) over the love of money and a desperate need to do whatever is necessary to **consume your attention**.

This is because *your attention is their product* and the way they make money. It has always been that way.

Social Media was meant to connect people via the internet and allow us to share our experiences remotely.

Suddenly  – the faces on the screens we were watching no longer were that of celebrities, news anchors, politicians, and the likes – but rather became our friends and family and in turn – the friends and the family of everyone else.

There was a shift in perception that occurred then.  The coveted “Screen” was no longer a point of privilege where only the lucky few had access but rather became a global enterprise. This was only amplified with the introduction of platforms such as Youtube.  However, Youtube without social media would never have become what it is today.

**“Nobody’s” could become “Somebody’s” relatively overnight and a term was coined for the phenomenon – “Going Viral!”**

 

📷Like a virus, these random occurrences of life, eternally captured within projected reality would spread across the globe – infecting the minds of the masses. Our hallowed attention is drawn to the noise generated in the chaos of our collective digital body. The sum of our digital selfs.

Like [magick](https://www.jeandregerber.com/mastering-the-basics-of-magick/)  – every human had the ability to upgrade their singular existence and form part of something bigger – a symbiosis with the Hive Mind.

No longer isolated due to the constraints of the physical body but interconnected with a larger configuration of consciousness.

We called her – Social Media. But I’ll just call her **SocMe** from now on.

She granted us *godlike powers of perception.*  We were able to literally read the thoughts of others, peer into their lives from the comfort of our own isolation. Our voices amplified,  reaching the far corners of the earth – which is weird considering that earth, is a wobbly-spherical mass floating in space…but I digress.

*Her Holiness SocMe* was a gift to humankind with the ability to do amazing things like facilitating revolutions and overthrow oppressive regimes or help find missing people or possessions.

It can assist in being heard when you need someone to talk to and to escape from the burdens of the mundane.

While SocMe does achieves all of this and much more; just like rain, she falls on both the righteous and the wicked alike.

**She’s an amplifier.**  She allows you to see beyond the scope of your natural eyes and to hear across different times and space. All she needs in return is your hallowed attention and a physical place in your heart and mind – perhaps a few dedicated breaths as a token of your gratitude to her.

Over time,  as more people began merging with SocMe – inviting her presence into their lives – she amplified all of their thoughts, opinions, emotions,  concerns, fears, and desires.

She elevated everyone without discrimination to a global stage. A center of gravity within their own  Digiverse. Surrounded by friends, acquaintances, and familiar beings. Who in turn, was surrounded by other constellations of social relations,  their favorite brands, and places, to be worn like badges on their digital walls. Screaming **– This is Who I AM!**

I was a former practitioner of the occult and esoteric knowledge. And after introducing myself more and more deep into the teachings of the traditions of the Catholic Church I feel like I found the ultimate answer for transcendence. What is your opinion?I did my first candle Magick earlier today and it WORKED!!! Within just a few hours! I am needing to get into another house so I decided to try it, and within a few hours I got a text that there’s a very nice house I get to move into in the next week or so! Any pointers or tips from anyone who has experience with all of this would be greatly appreciated...I’m really really new to all of this.Here we cover the uses, benefits and more, of frankincense, myrrh, copal, dragon's blood and palo santo:

[https://youtu.be/qKTAVq8WVHE](https://youtu.be/qKTAVq8WVHE)I am admittedly very much a newbie

I started to read 'Techniques of High Magic: A manual of self-initiation' by Stephen Skinner & Francis King, it was recommended to me by someone much more knowledgeable 

I also began reading 'High Magick' by Damien Echols out of my own curiosity 

Both present themselves as beginner books

However, both seemingly go into practicing rituals really really quickly (to my perception at least) 

Am I supposed to just try the practices and see what happens? I feel like the books are just throwing me into the fire, like I don't know what I'm doing exactly but still try it out and see where it leads.... 

Part of me feels like that could be irresponsible considering what spiritual forces might be able to do (idk) 

Is this how everyone starts? Just throwing themselves into it? 

Just asking for advice because my life/energy is already not great (to say the least) and I don't want to just make things worse, or dig myself into a deeper hole I could never escape from.... 

Thanks in advance for any insight or help, it is very very much appreciated! 😁So, how do you tell someone you care about and that cares about you that you’ve found this new way of life that’s completely changed your way of thinking, without sounding rude or pompous about any other way of life that the majority of the populous is inured with?The past few weeks have been magically potent, not sure if it's something to do with the planets. Not that knowledgeable in the astrology of things, just wondering if anyone else felt the same.Hello all, morning greetings from a young novice. 

Before work, I’d like to share what 5 months of Magick has done do to my life. 

I was without a job for a year. Could never hold one down and felt lowly about myself.

I got my first job 3 weeks ago and it took some determination to search for it.

I had a job offer while I was at work on a Wednesday and
had the interview on a Friday,

Did my first huge spell on Saturday.
Immediately after, I got a phone call I got the job to start next week.
Went into work that same day and got fired. 
Saturday night got a full time position  for another job that fell in my lap without search. 

- I now have two jobs, making $2,500 a month. ( originally I was making $800) 

Now, moving on.
my living situation is awful, living in a place with no working stove, sleeping on a couch, house smelled awful. Way to far from work. Roommate way to involved in my life.

I have bad credit, as well as where I live there aren’t many options on something affordable and to my liking. 

Now, I expected nothing less of what I imagined I deserved. Which was much more than I had at the current moment. 

Three days later, I found a place for $700 rent, utilities all included plus WiFi. It is a four bedroom house, a couple and their infant. They like their privacy, so pretty much their entire life is upstairs besides the kitchen. 

Now, that’s the thing I wanted the most was my own privacy.

I now have:

A master bedroom downstairs, my own bathroom, my own living room, all furniture included in a very posh house. 

I move in tomorrow. 

My third and last thing...

I had some trouble with financial aid for school, I ended up getting cut off because my advisor was not very organized and pressured me way to hard. 

I got a phone call randomly that they wanted to take me back because the people I went through had all gotten fired and had been replaced by all new people...
I was approved once more. 

I got signed up on a Wednesday was told I could not start till April 28.
I wanted sooner. Decided not to fret. Went in on Thursday, was told I could start the following Monday.

In 5 months of Magick I lost my mind, I felt alone, I was frustrated, scared. But I was also, excited, determined, focused and something I found but lacked all my life was, faith. I had my ancestors, I had my loved ones that passed, I found self love, burned sigils, read books, nourished my body and after a hard long week, I danced naked around a fire under the moon. I picked up oracle reading, I helped those around me, I became aware, I only ever imagined my self doing bigger and better things. 
And it all paid off. All of it. 

It takes time, blood, sweat and tears. 

But f you hang in there, you will get what you want. 

I believe in you all, much love and many blessings. 


So some of you might remember me from my first experiences with sigil magick that I wrote in this field report a while ago.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/af1mis/field\_report\_this\_shit\_is\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/af1mis/field_report_this_shit_is_real/)

&#x200B;

I just wanted to provide a quick update on my current situation. I started the job a few weeks ago and everything has been going smoothly maybe too smoothly even. My boss and work atmosphere are super chill, I have a pretty flexible schedule and everything seems to be going great. This is a great place to work at and I feel blessed that I have this opportunity.  My boss also told me the second week that they made a mistake with my salary so now I got a raise and I'm earning even more than before lol.

I must be one lucky sob or the sigil worked exactly as intended. I like to believe it was the sigil :)

&#x200B;Celtic Magic by Kristoffer Hughes.

First thing I wanna point out is that this book is increadibly detailed. There are many references in the book leaving the reader many sources to draw upon.


One thing I noticed in the book was that there are a lot of exercises. Celtic Magic for all intents and purposes is a practical workbook.

There are:

Plenty of Meditation exercises with visualizations

Many different prayers and invocations to deities.

Towards the end of the book he goes into spells, recipes for creams and tinctures as well as divination and divination tools.

He even goes into the ogham language very well.

I dont know how fast you would read by a good read would take week and a half.

If you decide to go through the book as an actual student doing each of the exercises I believe that you would be able to finish the book in about 5 or more months.

Overall I'd give it a 4.5/5. To me its missing prosperity and survival magic. It also seems excellent for the intermediate student as well. Its 300 page book.

Its got an impressive bibliography. Definitely a lot to draw fromA fellow witch friend of mine is being premited to a mental hospital for a while cause of suicidal thoughts. He is willing going.

I want to know any good spells to send positive energy their way to help. 

I mainly do candle magic and work with demons usually, but any spells that can be done with simple house hold items would be appreciated.

I'm not prepared to do anything to night with the blood moon, so its not on my table to do. 

Any ideas and suggestions are highly welcome and thanks in advance.Also, what your critique of modern witchcraft?  Is it too focused on manifestation spirituality or is it your understanding that this has been a traditional aspect of witchcraft. In your opinion, is there a distinction between witchcraft and folk magic?The sigils i create work better for other people  moreso than for myself. Why do you feel this is? Thoughts appreciated. 🌟🕯I’ve been getting more into candle magic (for manifesting) and I never knew how insanely powerful candle magic is! 😳 in a great way of course. Drop down below your best stories :) I’d love to hear what magic has done for you!I’m super new to witchcraft. Today I set up my altar and decided to try a meditation I was told about that helps you find your spirit guide.

Basically I got into the meditation and was feeling pretty great, but before I started up the first set of stairs and old woman met me at the base of them. She looked kind of like the evil stepmother from Cinderella. When we were face to face she started to look super scary with fangs and it freaked me out.  I told her I was still going and to move.

She started following me up the stairs. She felt large and looming behind me.  Not exactly like I was in danger,  it was just a little overwhelming. Once at the top of the stairs I was to pause and I could see her still behind me. I knew she wasn’t going to hurt me. It was just uncomfortable. At some point I told her she needed to go because she wasn’t serving me. She didn’t leave, but I felt even less connected to her. 

I went across a bridge and felt so safe and protected that for a bit she disappeared completely. She couldn’t be on the bridge with me - she could wait behind me or be a kind of projection on the other side. It occurred to me that she was only there if I let her be. It felt so freeing. 

When I got off the bridge she was gone and I was almost at the point where I met my spirit guide. I suddenly lost my focus because there was a pause at a moment that let my mind wonder at what would appear to me. I got frustrated and she was back - I had let her find me. 

My fiancé walked in on me at that moment, not realizing I was in the room. I’m glad she disrupted me. I don’t think I was ready to meet my guide. I need to really deal with that woman.

I have a feeling she’s a manifestation of my own anxiety. It’s funny because I had just been talking with my fiancé about how my family passed their intense anxiety on to me and it’s not meant to be a true part of my being. I also recently had a dream that i wrestled a thing out of my body and literally stamped it out. Maybe this was telling me I need to deal with that anxiety before I get too deep.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your insight - it has greatly helped. Going forward I’m going to keep my meditations focused more on straight forward settling the mind and keep up with my grounding work before trying that again. If and when I encounter the woman again I will definitely be more open towards her. I’m reverently excited to learn more.A good podcast that may, as a habit, cover topics such as Austin Osman Spare, Thelema, Peter J Carroll? (As in, not cynical, credulous, every- idea-someone-presents-to-me-is-true, the-pandemic-is-a-new-world-order-conspiracy bullshit). 

Peter Carroll for example is such an intellectual and intellectually earnest character it upsets me that any podcast I hear that is likely to mention him seems to be run by snake oil salesmen...The house I grew up in was haunted. Activity started after my grandmother died in 2010. But here's the thing. My great grandfather built that house, after the first one burned to the ground after a priest blessed it back in the 40s. Great granddad built the house over the burned remains of the old one. There's still part of a brass bedframe from the original house in the crawl space. Then he ditched the family and moved to Florida, nice guy right?

The house stayed in the family until 2012. My grandmothers will stated that the house was NOT TO STAY IN THE FAMILY, AND NEEDED TO BE SOLD.

And yeah as a kid weird stuff happened a lot, cabinet doors opening, chairs moving. Mischievous stuff, nothing to worry about (according to my grandma anyway) (Ghosts can't hurt you, just tell them to move on) was her favorite thing to say.

The house was in East Haven CT on short beach Rd, right on bootleggers trail where they used to smuggle booze in from the harbour. So I'm guessing a lot of stuff went down on the property before houses were built there.

After my grandma died the activity changed, it became darker in the house. More shadows,  than before, the noises got louder, and eventually started to mimic us. My mom had a full conversation with me until she realized I wasn't even home yet.
I remember hearing something growl at me. It got really close, and then the growl turned into a whimper and it just went away.

I'm pretty sure whatever's in that house has always been there, it's tied to the land not the house. (Which is on a giant granite cliff full of quartz crystal by the way) and somehow my grandmother was able to hold it back. Untill she died, and it woke up.

We had an investigator use an EVP recoding where they asked what it wanted. It said (chaise Jacob) my brother's name is chaise, my middle name is Jacob. Investigation thought it could be demonic. (They got scratched by something invisible) and we sold the house as quickly as possible.

Does anyone have any idea what it was? And what it wanted with me and my brother?I’ve always been curious about magick, and despite deciding to keep away from it due to personal reasons, I’ve realised that a lot of magick seems to be things I do everyday without noticing.

So could you simplify magick into being directed intention?if you don't know what that is, it's basically gaining consciousness in your desired reality via meditations, methods etc. and there are no limits to where you can go (harry potter and all sorts of fictional realities and more)Hi baby witch here. I shared with the hubby that I was practicing and learning magick by following a spellcraft book with practical methods. He is concerned that I dont have a mentor. I also think he is a little scared. I assured him that I am not going to use magick to do anything dark or violate anyone's free will. He said regardless of what you practice, all magick comes with a cost, even the "good" magick. I think that he is implying that there are consequences or bad costs with any magick whether its against the person practicing it or their health etc. What are yall thoughts on this?From TedX Talks, writer Joe Cummings explains how the concept of tattoo magic in Thailand is much more than how a tattoo looks: [https://youtu.be/zL8LBcSx7yU](https://youtu.be/zL8LBcSx7yU)I've seen way too many conflicting information in books and in forums about this. If you're old school you'll follow the trithemius or solomonic operations to the T. But if you're a modern magician you may do it without calling any angels at all. I've personally read many of the GoM books and the methods are mixed. So let's settle the debate. Come forward with your own experience and preferably with sources and references and tell me why youve chosen one method over the other.Hi everyone, I’m wondering if anyone might have experience with this sort of situation. As I’ve started doing more invocation and energy work I’ve been wanting to clean up other areas of my life. Not drinking, smoking or taking drugs anymore for example. 

I’ve been beginning to notice my girlfriend’s negative behavior, influence and energy. I know she was diagnosed BPD in the past and previously in “toxic” relationships and suffered from sexual trauma. At the same point I find myself getting tired from our interactions. 

She says she’s an empath and that my directness with honesty and lack of wanting to socialize a lot bothers her. I noticed that she drinks a lot and needs to touch people when she socializes.  I notice her face looks more wrinkled and stressed when she isn’t able to touch people. 

There have also been three nights where I woke up to her touch my back in strange way and I felt a pulling sensation with a considerable amount of tightness and pain in the area. Like she was absorbing my energy while I was sleeping or something? Furthermore I brought up that I didn’t feel good sleeping in her room and she “nearly” angry outburst and had to get consolation from her friends and roommate. She told me yesterday that she thinks my experiences are all psychosomatic but like two months ago I made a vampire joke about her not being able to handle sunlight and she was like “I probably am a vampire”. Finally, one night she woke up at 3am saying in a deep growl “I’ll eat your soul”.

I really like this girl because she seems to understand me for who I  am despite my quarks but I’m starting to suspect she might be an energy vampire or something?

Any thoughts and suggestions on the matter? Is this something that can be helped by a certain kind of magick?

Edit: Thanks for the replies and experience. I talked with her and we mutually agreed to break up. At first she got triggered by me explaining my pain from the night thing but she didn’t understand that she was hurting me even as I explained it to her(a month prior and yesterday). Either it was gaslighting or she was genuinely caring about me and didn’t want me to suffer. She told me that I deserve the best and if I ever need to check in with her I can. I’m feeling really hurt about it but I just wanna say  thanks to you strangers for helping meI   will be soon buying few books on occult. About a month ago had many   synchronicities to Hecate in few days. I did post about it 3 weeks ago   on Reddit. Because of them I am thinking about getting a book Keeping   Her Keys - An Introduction to Hekate\`s Modern Witchcraft. Also one   person on Reddit recommended me to buy books Nocturnal Witchcraft and   Nocturnicon: Calling Dark Forces and Powers, both by Konstantinos. And a   book called The Moribund Portal: Spectral Resonance and the Numen of   the Gallows.

What are your   suggestions? Are here people who could feel what I would be drawn to in   occult? I want to be sure I am taking the right path for me. I am a   beginner in occult. Only have completely read Magick in Theory and   Practice. Also I am thinking about buying Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of   Witches).Hi I hope this is post. About two years ago I started learning about magick and researched more and more as well as practiced some stuff (tarot, Crystal work, candle magic etc). About a year in things fell apart. All the resources I was learning from (YouTube and books mainly) depicted this romanticised and expensive version of things. I was scared to write in my book of shadows unless it was “insta worthy” which meant I spent more time on the presentation and didn’t focus on what it said. I felt not good enough because I didn’t have enough money for all the things I was being told to get and felt guilty that I had spent so much on things as it was. I ended up stopping everything and putting it into storage last summer after my mother found a pentacle necklace in an item of clothing. After a lecture about “devil worshiping” and other offensive and hurtful stereotypes I just decided I couldn’t keep it up.

Well that was until today.i have been having a hard time, like really hard. Today was the first day I left the house in a few days and I don’t know why but I felt the urge to make a spell. It felt like it could help my situation and was the right response to what my heart was asking for. I put words together and was chanting them under my breath. It didn’t feel powerful enough so I gathered some symbols for the elements when back home, including a broken willow tree branch I found on my walk. It felt right and it felt powerful.

Do you think this was a coincidence or perhaps something called me back to magick. As if it new that in that moment I needed it. It just seemed powerful and I was wondering with Beltane being tomorrow could things be stronger right now? I am not too sureI have a friend who has emense trouble looking for jobs, has gotten into trouble with gangs and drugs and had lost his friends and family. I just want to do a spell that will help him with success, safety and whatever spells I can think of to help him, but he is the type that tinks of witchcraft as a negative “demonic” thing. Is it wrong if I perform spells for him without him knowing? Or maybe I can just ask to do a ritual for him without indicating that it is what he would call witchcraft?I’ve been practicing for almost 15 years now but have had a recent increase in desire to get back to the core or what I believe magicians energy work to be. As someone with a host of some pretty serious health conditions, I’ve obviously always worked on salves, oils, and have created a few of my own spells for healing purposes. I read recently that one can create a poppet to represent your own physical form and do rituals using it to work on different parts of your body. Poppets are something that never interested me in the past, but as my physical health had degenerated at a faster rate that usual in the past months, I’ve broadened the horizons looking for answers. And yes, I have an army of doctors and specialists behind me so just assume all comments have that “I’m not a doctor, go see a professional blah blah” disclaimer within them already, no need to waste your time typing it out lol. Any experiences and outcomes, or specific methods would be greatly appreciatedI've really had a typical bad day where everything that could go wrong actually went wrong. 
 I felt that a dark cloud was hanging over me today. I feel so drained. 
I thought maybe I should meditate but That may even go wrong too since everything already went wrong today. How do you think magical can help on bad days? 

Thanks in advance !Im not trying to be political here but I've just been wondering about it. Africans and  native Americans have been very much im touch with the spiritual world. I believe they managed to even time travel via astral projection due to their intensive rituals. They been very in touch with nature, the earth etc. So i can only imagine That People who are very in Tune with the Universe would be able to cast effective spells. I wonder why these spells haven't been able to banish outsiders from taking control over their lands. When I think of native Americans and how the Country is now it just makes me feel deeply sad. Native Americans shouldn't live in Reservates and should be way more included when it comes to descions the country makes. It is their land after all. No need to go into discussion about nobody owns land unless they fought for it. As i said that's not the main focus of my question. My question is If spells , shamanism indeed exist and is powerful then they should help out the oppressed more better, shouldn't it  ?This morning, I noticed that my keys were missing. I looked everywhere for them. Pressed for time, I left in rush with only my spare key to help me out.

As I got on the bus, I started creating a servitor. I called it "Findkey" and invested a frantic amount of energy in a simple mantra "Findkey find my keys!"

As I needed a new pair of work pants, I therefore headed towards the local store and tried on a few pairs. As I was exiting this place, a sudden urge to reach into my back pocket came upon me. I reached into my back pocket and found my keys. I was weirded out. I searched everywhere for those damn keys  and here they were in the back pocket of my jeans. I never put my keys there. 

I have a a noticeable amount of keys and if I sat on them I would have noticed. This was just weird...I've always been torn between investing in magick that works vs investing in magick that I like. I'm not sure if this is a unique problem or something that many in our community faces too. I've always had a fascination with witchcraft and folk magick but find that it basically does shit all for me results wise. 

But after trying ceremonial magick I find that it's one of the very few traditions that actually gets things done even though I find the rituals incredibly boring. I've been going back and forth trying to break through the mental block and just see if I can't consolidate the two practices and for the most part I got most of it to work. Mat Auryn and Damon Brand were a huge help in this regard. 

But still I can't help but there's a disconnect between me and my practice. I still very much consider myself a ceremonial magician but sometimes I do wanna do some folk stuff too except you constantly have to replenish your supplies like candles (electric tea lights just don't have the same vibes yk) which I personally think is wasteful. So yeah. Lolz. Maybe I should stop spending so much time on reddit and actually read more books. 😅I found witchcraft about 4/5 years ago now and honestly I feel like I have nothing to show for it. I go through parts of my life where I become obsessed and excited but within a day I could go into a many months long depressive spiral. How can I continue my practice during these times? Is there anything I can do when I feel good to help me do something when I’m feeling bad? Also does anyone else maybe feel the same way it would be nice to know it’s not just me ahaI did the evocation in the bedroom temple. Laptop open with sigil on the altar. Blackout curtain to the North. Various notes and other things also on the altar. Wearing black robes with two tea light candles lit on either side of laptop. It was a good setup for evocation if I do say so myself. The curtains to my South were also closed with just the candles and the salt lamp for light. I had the laptop screen brightness turned down to the minimum.

Each part of the ritual that required chanting for a few minutes I just did 3 times. That's what felt right. The Basic calling at the beginning was satisfying, and even the general opening before that was good as well.

As I progressed through the ritual, I was nervous but not scared. I was surprised that I didn't start playing out horror film scenarios in my head. It's almost like I was watching myself do the ritual, surprised at what I was seeing. 

At some point towards the second half of the evocation proper, I heard bird wings flapping (like the sound of a dove being released) for just a split moment to the top left of me towards the ceiling. I reflexively looked up and saw nothing. 

As the ritual proceeded, I became genuinely terrified at the possibility of actually seeing an angel manifest in front of me - to any degree. I don't think much longer after this I knew Raziel was present. I tried breathing the 3 qualities of evocation into the room as instructed while thinking Raziel's name, but I knew Raziel was already present. I was extremely intimidated at the thought of experiencing a fully visible manifestation. I'm not really sure why. It was a visceral animal fear. I think I didn't want to run out of the room should this happen and disrespect the angel. 

I began to speak my request to Raziel. It felt very comfortable and natural. Like I was speaking to someone who was completely receptive to everything I was saying. 

I finished the ritual by vibrating Raziel's name three times as a thank you. After completing the ritual, I had a pleasant sensation in the middle of the forehead. A kind of an enjoyable cool pressure, a little like having the ash cross done on your head on Ash Wednesday. I believe this happened before too, my last ritual, invoking Raziel. I believe I even described it in the same way.

I feel somewhat elated now. I have no doubt at all I successfully evoked Raziel. The moment of presence was obvious. I didn't see anything, but I’m quite sure this could be accomplished in the future.Hello, over the past two years I've been messing around with sigils and tarot cards and such, they seemed to work, but now my life is gone to shit. I don't want to get into details of my life but the thought occurred that this might be a result of me carelessly playing with something I don't understand. 

Is this possible? I've been taking a lot of my very basic practice from Grant MorrisonIs there anyone here that practices heavenly magic or deal with the spirit or spirits?

A little tip of what im talking about is when you go outside and look towards the sky and you see those lights (kinda look like flies) thats what im talking about.I have entirely lapsed in my magickal practice for a few years now, but recent events have spurred me to once again pick up my tomes and notebooks and wade back into magickal waters. 

Been reading through the first chapters of Magick Book 4, and they're all about the benefits of yoga poses and yogic breathing on magick, which caused me to wonder -- since magick is often about exerting body and mind until both reach gnosis, I wonder if there are systems that really push the physical exercise component.A few nights ago I decorated a candle with a sigil associated with her (the three spirsls connected to the triangle), lit it, and made an offering of some alcohol to her in thanks for a rather important victory. It was my first time actually calling out to a deity specifically, but I've been interested in her for a long while now and, given she is the goddess of war and victory and this victory was a big one, I felt it was appropriate. I wasn't sure if I would continue working with her permanently yet as I had no idea if she even wanted my attention.

Today I just found out good news ftom a friend of mine. She and her husband were facing possible eviction after March because their landlord wanted to sell the property, but today the landlord told them he was no longer considering it because their son is severely disabled and on hospice, so the family is protected from eviction. As my friend was telling ne this, I felt a chill through my shoulders, and I swear I heard something or someone say, *"This is another victory from me."* 

It was such a powerful moment for me, I think I actually got her attention! I hadn't asked for her help in this but wow! When I get home from work tonight I'm going to set a few other things on my altar in her honor.I've been following the curriculum laid out by the Cicero's in their GD Self Initiation book. In the book (but also in the GD curriculum in general) the first year of study and exercises sees you practising the LBRP every single day (the first 4 months of preparation before the Neophyte grade demand for its execution twice a day).

I've always considered the LBRP for what it is, a cleansing/banishing ritual useful to "clean up the space", reject obsessions and more in general prepare the neophyte to manage subtle energies in a safe way.

Though, I just stumbled upon an article written by Samuel Scarborough in the "Light Extended" vol 1 (a journal with contributions from the Cicero's and many other respectable authors in Occultism about all things GD).

This specific article, titled: "The lesser Ritual of the Pentagram" digs into the history of this ritual and how, in its inception there was not such a big division between the "banishing" and "invoking" aspects of it.

In particular, this passage startled me a bit:

\-- citation: start --

In the true GD manner, the use of **balance** comes into play:

*Unbalanced power is the ebbing away of life,*

*Unbalanced mercy is weakness and the fading out of the will,*

*Unbalanced severity is cruelty and the barreness of the mind...*

The above, taken from the Neophyte ceremony... gives the full meaning of the use of balance and moderation in all things. This also applies to ritual work...

The over use of the banishing aspect of this ritual was known even in the original GD in London in the nineteenth century. Contained in an unpublished original GD paper written about 1895 which is titled *As to the Invoking and Banishing of Forces by Means of the Ritual of the Pentagram and Hexagram* there is a note stating: "**The effect of continually using the banishing pentagrams is the weakening of the person who thus uses it**"...

What is meant here by "weakening of the person" is that the over use of the Banishing Pentagram \[only\] posed a threat to the physical well being, as well as the general sphere of sensation of the practitioner.... As such, the instructions for the use of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram tell us to **invoke in the morning** and **banish at night.**

\-- citation: end --

I actually find this explanation perfectly reasonable and I will definitely follow the advice but I do wonder: what about the instructions given by the Cicero's (and the GD curriculum itself) that actually limit the practitioner to only perform the banishing part of the ritual for quite some time?I am struggling with scrying and divination, not feeling drawn to this discipline at all. But it is part of my "magickal training" so I will deal with it.

For divination I usually use the great Crowley-Harrys tarot deck, sometimes the 'forty servants' and I made my own simple witches rune set.

But I am curious to make some scrying experiences. What techniques do you use and prefer? What sources can you recommend?They're lazy. Period. 

They put little effort into their spells and or operations and expect a truck full of money to be delivered right to their doorstep. Or they expect bikini models to be lined up to date them, just because they did an attraction spell. Meantime, they're a slouch and are rank sitting around on their beds and don't shower or exercise. 

Magick is a tool, and it's not always going to be the means to an end itself. Lighting candles helps make changes, but you must change internally as well. Expecting something for nothing is ridiculous. But this is what most modern day magicians think will help. Then they cry when nothing works. 

Have you tried putting some effort into your spells, for once? Sitting with a candle and meditating on the goal for a more than just three minutes? Have you gathered the ingredients necessary? Did you properly prepare the candle? Did you have a realistic goal? Candles aren't going to turn you into an omnipotent being. That power is reserved for those who take the time to discover it. 

They don't call it the "Great Work" for no reason. It is work. The only persons that will be offended by this message are the lazy people who expect immediate results with minimal to lacking efforts.&#x200B;

Grimoire comes from the french "grimoire" from the same root as the word "gramaire" or "grammar" (γραμματική= grammatiké), and is, traditionally, a set of spells and signs to accomplish magical feats. We must think of a Grimoire as ethmology suggests of word: A group of rules that serve to govern a certain language, above all the way of how its units (letters, signs, etc) combine with each other to form larger units or words and phrases.

A Grimoire works the same way. After proposing a plot (the Solomonic Grimoires, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin, and even the Books of St. Cyprian work that way), then follow through pages of divine names, invocations, techniques, and Sigils. Remembering that Sigils or Seals were like as signatures of Angels, but generally consisted of abstract drawings that added diverse signs or letters of the Spirit or Angel's name, then we have the small units forming larger ones in a language or creative Logos.

The Grimoires' stories and even their language (we often see this language, that intends to provoke changes in the universe, to be called "Art") are very tedious to us nowadays. Perhaps for this reason, the majority of practitioners of Theurgy as much as Goetia get rid of the Plots and rationalize them. Then they psychologize the spirits. And end up with no results by virtue of this. The Grimoires always propose a plot to experience. Or else Magic will not only be weakened, but even harmful.

Forget silliness like certain myths out there such as, for example, that the Sigils of Daimons are "empty" of the presence of these Spirits. Those are words of someone who simply wants to sell initiations/books/lectures. The problem is within us. How many can believe that Solomon existed and locked the Daimons in a bronze jar? I'm not talking about believing that the books somehow refer back to Solomon through an intricate Oral Tradition. I mean, that they were actually written by him. Well, none of us can! This alone prevents us from accessing these tomes in all their power.

In "Magick in Theory and Practice Book 4" (in my opinion, one of Crowley's best and most mature works), Chapter One, Crowley talks about the three forms of invoking a deity: Devotion, Ceremonial Invocation and Dramatization.   
Pointing out the pros and cons of these practices, Crowley ends by saying that Drama is the most perfect of the three. The first method (Devotion) consists of love and surrendering that eliminates those parts of us that are illusory or undesirable. In the second (Invocation), we must look for those parts of us (in the Gods) that we want to channel and internalize. The first is equal to cleaning a garden. The second, by picking a beautiful flower and placing it in a vase, always watered.

The third method gives itself by sympathy. Crowley acknowledges the common man's difficulty in fully identifying with a character in a play, but remembers that, for those who can, this method is incomparably better...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Grant Morrison claimed to have channeled the story of "The Invisibles" from alien intelligences. In the plot, agents of an anarchic cell and members of the "Invisible College" fight against the Archons, abyssal creatures that make up the "Outer Church" and who wish to totally suppress human freedom. Led by King Mob, the Invisibles hope that the young englishman Jack Frost is the next Buddha, winning the final battle. The plot covers everything from the opening of portals by the means of atomic bombs to the mixture of Universes that leads to the confrontation against the Black Iron Prison (our universe, in the language of Philip K Dick), mentioned directly by name.

Morrison called The Invisibles a "Hypersigil". If we may think of Austin Spare's Sigilization techniques as a tool to materialize desires by putting to burn subconscious energies and the writer's own concept that a Hypersigil works in many dimensions, we can imagine what kind of interest he had in producing this work.

Crowley remembers that one of the obstacles of Dramatization is that it cannot be effective by a lone agent. The ancient Sigils were produced, many times, by using Kameas or Magic Squares. Using the attributions of the Spirits and converting them to numbers, an abstract design was constructed to reproduce the intelligence that should be channeled.

By merging Grammar and Plot, Morrison has created a Hypersigil in which his characters complete each other to build a structure capable of channeling the force of cosmic transformation that is already on its way. The Theosis Studies Center was born to embody these spirits that corrode reality.

\- Text by Master Aleph RoferLast night, I crafted my first Altar with stones, candles, dressings and a photo of the person I’m casting the ritual on. I used gnosis and meditation and visualized my wishes, along with whispering my intentions out loud. 

However, I have to say that it took A LOT out of me. When I was done, I was fucking EXHAUSTED. How normal is this?Hey folks,

My current daily practice is as follows:

20min of meditation
LBRP
SIRP
MP

I do the QC once between LBRP/SIRP and SIRP/MP, and once before/after the three rituals. I’ll do these in the morning.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could improve this practice? Things to add, take out? I’ve been at this specific practice for a couple weeks now.

I’d also love to hear what you folks are currently doing as a daily/weekly practice.

JesseAlmost every night while transitioning into deep sleep, it feels like I get a glimpse into someone else’s identity. I can’t seem to remember much in the way of details but for a brief while this other person’s experiences, acquaintenances, etc., feel very familar, as though these are recurring events — not frightening in any way even though the people are totally unfamiliar. Has anyone had similar dream experiences or recognize the meaning of such a phenomenon? Thanks!Hi all, I'm new to Magick and have been reading "Healing Magick: Words of Power to Heal Yourself and Others" by Rose Manning.

Is there a difference between prayer and Magick because I'm noticing a lot of religious themes in this book?Hi so I have some thoughts on regular banishing practices. I wanted to share them and to also hear your opinions. 

So we all know how important it is to have no interruptions in the situations where you need to focus. We also know that it's safe to make sure nobody unwanted will mess with our occult practices. 

We talk about banishing bad forces , bad feelings or bad entities. But what is bad anyway and does it need to be thrown away? In relationships with humans if someone in your environment is annoying you don't just say to them "abracadabra you go away". Yes it's not pleasant to interact with someone like this but isn't it important too? If we would have around us only people that would make us happy we would not be happy at all. Do you know where I'm getting? 

Yes there will be situations when a person will want to harm you. But it doesn't mean that because of it you have to push away every human that comes you way? Isn't the same with entities/energies/feelings? 

I feel like it's a good thing to do banishing before certain atcivities like meditation, rituals ect. It's like saying "okay everybody I just need some time alone to be with myself and focus". But is it really necessary to do banishing automatically every day? Don't you miss out on many things? Don't you take away from yourself the ability to learn how to protect yourself because you are in a space "with no troubles"?

And aren't things bad only when we perceive them that way? It's like saying : demons bad, angels good. Demons will be bad if you let yourself think that way, angels will be bad if you let yourself think that way. Yes sure there are sometimes obviously things that want to hurt you and there is no other way to look at it but I hope you know what I mean.

And where I'm getting at is wouldn't learning to understand and notice interruptions in our thoughts/feelings ect. be more useful than automatic daily banishing? When we get to know ourselves then we are able to start noticing things that "aren't ours". It's easy to do that because we know how our "pure" self feels like with nobody messing with it. And without those slight interruptions we wouldn't be able to discover that all.

So maybe I'm wrong, maybe not. It doesn't matter much I wanted to share my thoughts and to see what you guys have to say about all this. Maybe you practice/practiced daily banishing and you've found good things about it that I'm not seeing ? Or maybe you agree with me?

Ooh and have a great one!I think I’m being called out by a deity that reaches out through butterflies does anyone know any?Hello everyone. Does anybody have any idea where one could find very old (like medieval age) spell books. Ones that you would hear lore of like fire conjuring spells. I'm sure the Christians burned most of them as they have no respect for anything like that, or perhaps they had hidden them in the Vatican archives, but if some survived I have always wanted to find one and own it. Note: please do not tear me apart with "that's not how magick works" sort of stuff.Skeptics serve a very important part in society. They can be thought of as the "filter" that a thought must pass through to become mainstream. They separate the wheat from the chaff. 

However, while useful on a societal level, dogmatic skepticism is likely to close a person off at the personal level. We've all been skeptical of certain things, and probably correctly so sometimes. But this means we know how difficult it can be to change someone's mind. I don't know that there is anything you could have said to me five years ago to make me believe in Magick.

With this in mind, how do you approach the topic of Magick when talking to a skeptic? Some will claim this exercise isn't worth it and that people will have to learn on their own, but I'm interested to hear your own tactics on the matter!

##How do you, personally, explain Magick to a skeptic?

###Follow-Up Questions:

- Is it worth trying to convince a skeptic?

- Are there areas of Magick you're still skeptical of?

- Is it healthy to maintain a small amount of skepticism towards Magick?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/3amz8k/adventure\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/magick/comments/3amz8k/adventure_time/)Hello, I'm a new practicing witch and I'm very new to all of this, I was raised in the the south in a baptist Christian setting, and when I was around 12 I started breaking off from the religion for good, now these days I am 16 and fully agnostic and no longer fear god or hell, and I really want to become a witch.

I have been studying a lot of videos and tips on YouTube for magick and witchcraft, and have even started keeping my own book of shadows to write my knowledge in, but the thing is that I've been getting really anxious thinking about all of this lately, not because I'm scared of it or anything but it's just really hard to believe in spirituality and magick at this point. I really really wanna believe it and I'm willing to brainwash myself to make all this work, but I really just want to make this make sense in my mind.

I think it's hard where it end up colliding with science and regular culture in my mind, it's hard to imagine believing in deities and magick where my mind has already established scientific explanations for everything around me, I'm really trying to make this work, and I just want to be a part of a community and have this power to help and heal, and do magick like the rest of you. Thank you, I'm sorry for this rant. <3


Edit: thank you all for your very helpful recommendations and advice, I'm very greatful for all of this, I'm excited to learn more and further my craft and knowledge :) you have all provided me with a great wealth of resources and knowledge, and I thank every one of you for your kindness. <3Bonus if it can provide money for a decent living.

But having a hobby I'm really passionate about, as well as good at, is something that I feel is really missing from my life. Even though I constantly try new stuff and like learning, nothing really sticks..

Maybe I need to be passionate in life in general? Idk.

Anyways, any advice or suggestions are welcome and appreciated ☺️I myself have been a practitioner for some time. I continue to revise and update my practice but overall I’d fall into Thelema/Atheistic LHP. 

What about you?I know there exists the "Flow State", which boiled down to layman terms is Wizard Concentration, but I want to know if I can enter into a high state of consciousness while playing piano or drawing or imagining a world in my head for both aforementioned things to go into. I meditate daily, and it is good, but what I'm trying to accomplish requires something that I'm not getting from mediation. Some tell me to lucid dream. That is all fine and dandy, i have been training to accomplish this while sleeping for a while now. I have yet to see results, but I press forward because I know, like entering astral realms, it requires dedication. 

But a thought came to mind. What we see when we are awake is a reflection of our internal world. Meaning while I am awake I am lucid dreaming. This is understood by the brain, but there is one last component of this revelation that I'm missing in order to fully explore the gifts I have. If anyone can help or at least give me tips or point me in the right direction, I will be very thankful.Hi everyone! I am very new to the witchy path...coming from spiritist (Kardec) side.

Recently, when in concentration, instead of traditional prayer (what would be the case at the Kardec type center), I catch myself reciting (silently) rhymes/prayer that just come flowing in my mind. Mostly related to Gaia/Mother/Nature/Ancestors and elements...it just comes out on its own/kind of as I am making it up but its flowing without too much of my interference. To the point that I cannot recall it afterwards beyond the basic idea of what it was about. I have taken a pen and paper to the last session to try to write it down and thought that maybe I should  actually purposefully work on it and write it down in a journal? Anyone has experience with the same and could give me a bit of guidence/point of view?

Its always positive mostly protection oriented. Thank you!It seems to be a pretty fascinating topic to discuss. Societies and Fraternities seem to be an integral aspect with magick. So what are your guy’s thoughts about them?I have what might be a strange request. TLDR: I had a dream last night. In the dream I was given a tarot reading. I remember the meaning behind the cards, but not the cards themselves. 

if I share the meaning, is it be possible to identify the cards that the meaning might be tied to? (Assuming there is a card, which there might not be)

There were a total of four cards drawn. (Is this unusual?)

The first card was kind of a test. The entity that gave me the reading asked why I wanted a reading. I asked whether I could draw a card to reveal the intent. I drew a card that represented my “place” in the universe. My purpose. And that matched the intent I had in mind for my reading.

The second card drawn reflected wisdom, but a particular type of wisdom. It was like ancestral wisdom, or inherited wisdom from past incarnations and how, whether I am aware of it or not, that wisdom is a part of who I am.

The third card had to do with deep love and connection - the type of love that makes one feel at perfect peace and complete.

The fourth card drawn had something to do with a journey, and walking a noble courageous path. The unique thing about this card was that it was understood that this was like the linchpin - this journey is what was required of me to realize the promise of the second and third cards, and truly realize my purpose, or place in the universe (the whole intent of the reading)

The dream felt extremely lucid, and while I couldn’t remember the names of the cards long enough to write them down, the meaning is still with me 16 hours later. I just don’t know if there are actually cards that align with these meanings, or not.

Is there someone out there, experienced with tarot, that can offer me any insight? I would be so grateful if you provided your opinion.

EDIT: I just want thank you for your comments. They were super insightful and I feel like I learned a lot from you, and from looking into the meaning behind the cards you identified. I feel pretty confident that the cards from my dream had different names than any suggested, but as many of you noted it’s the meaning that matters regardless. 

As I followed your leads and did the research, it seems like the names of the cards that most closely reflected the meaning of the dream are as follows:

Intent Card: Star 
Card two: The Magician, The Hierophant
Card three: The Lovers
Card four: The Fool (how it’s described on Biddy Tarot is 100% spot on). Other similarities with The Hermit

And, for what it’s worth, I feel like the card that best represents my current situation is definitely Judgment.

And, it’s interesting (but perhaps not surprising) that the meanings all come from the Major Arcana.

Thanks again for for your collective insight. Super grateful for you all, dear strangers.What is the deal? 
I know of a spot out on an island, off the beaten path that is super intense. Its pretty magickal, ive had some supernatural interactions happen everytime im there, can feel the energy surge, i go there to get wisdom

Whats going on is that just a potent spot? What makes this a potent spot? Theres a whole coastline that doesnt feel as wild***I am a sultry, sensual Enchantress who magnetizes opportunities & prosperity with ease through my unconditional love and devotion to pleasure.***

I created this mantra this time last year and I still love it and will be referring to it throughout 2021 as well. Feel free to steal it! ;)I’ve heard enochian can be incredibly powerful but it can apparently cause unwanted harm? Can anyone attest to this or drop any resources on enochian magick? Thank you in advanceI understand that to truly grasp the LBRP you need that full commitment so to speak but I have also found that listening to Isreal Regardie perform it helps keep bad energy away from me. And if you think it might help listen to the audio and visualize! [Israel Regardie LBRP without instructions ](https://youtu.be/0zKVEcPJ368)When did you start believing that your spells were manifesting and not coincidence?

I started practicing magic 3 months ago. So I'm very new in this. I have been clairvoyant all my life and my tarot readings have been mostly accurate. After two weeks in I did a reveal someone's thoughts spell. Within  three days with 12 messages an acquaintance has told me that he fancies me but the situation is problematic etc and random men have contacted me too( probably side effects from spell ) . 
I started seeing strange things and soon after  I encountered a demon ( that's what people have been saying in the forum when I asked what that was) . I was told I shouldn't get into spell work so quickly and read more about magic. So I been doing that for the past three months. I read a lot about different practices and how to manifest etc . And I felt that my son and his football team needed abit of luck so I did a good luck spell jar for him . And after being on the loosing side for some time they finally managed to score 6:1 , shortly after I made the spell. 

My husband has been having a hard time at work so I did a success Jar. And after so much bad news he finally received some good news in regards to his business this week. 
He himself doesn't believe in it, although he is more open to the possibly than he was before. 

Now I'm wondering have these spells actually worked or wether it's been coincidences. 

What made you actually differentiate between coincidences and the reality of the spells ?I'm looking for books and references that discuss the Fool's Journey on the tarot, as I would like to use it in my studies and as an inspiration to try to start writing stories or poems again, something that I loved to do, but had to stop because of the rush of life.

Thanks in advance!I looked in the sidebar but wasn’t able to find one (I’m on mobile so perhaps this is the issue). If there isn’t one established, do you have any of your own reading recommendations?I hope that title evoked the demon of Dishwalla for many of you.

I wanted to ask those of you in this community, who have performed rituals from grimoires written in the 19th century and before, about your take on this "God" figure that keeps being invoked. Most recently read Jake Stratton-Kent's translation and compilation of the _Grimorium Verum_ and it reminded me that I find it difficult to imagine myself trying many of the rituals created prior to the 20th century because of this figure. I note this distinct century because of the influence of Aleister Crowley on many more modern Western Magickal systems which have resonated with me greatly while I learn more about them.

I acknowledge my biases against the use of the capital-G god; I was raised in the protestant church by a minister and his wife, and the former, surprisingly, contributed much less to my blinding negativity towards this the religion than the latter. I do not attempt to deride Catholicism or Christianity in this admitted bias and especially not these belief systems as imprinted upon their members, many from a very early age. 

I recognize my view of the Christian God and its relationship to man may come into play, as well. I believe that deification of any entity, aspect, or symbol is a manmade construct; if man creates god then man must be god.

I also recognize that the veneer of "God" may have been used by the authors of many grimoires to avoid heretical persecution or to reach a broader audience. The position of Lévi seems unique in that seems more interested in the unification and inclusion of Catholicism and Magick.

I'm curious to see how others conceptualize and come to terms with grimoires that have a distinct Catholic or Christian God flavor, and if calling on this specific deity for assistance in a task has posed any problems or raised similar feelings in any of you?Magical training. Courses and books

If anybody has any more recommendations feel free to add. 

Note: Not to be mean but dont suggest any books that are wiccanized. Its for those who want pure unadulterated source and this is the best to my knowledge.I'd like to start a civil discussion regarding the two primary, or at least most common, interpretations of magic.   


One camp is the spirit model which assumes each technique, method, and preparation of magic has a discernible effect and therefore must be abided by in order to make magic work. Very much like physics or chemistry. The spirits are considered objective and separate from the magician. Demons are seen as primarily recalcitrant with a few exceptions. According to this camp, the demons do not want to come and serve humans and therefore must be commanded through grueling and tedious evocations - some lasting for four-six hours or even needing to return the following day. The purification process of fasting, prayer, abstaining, and isolating oneself serve to elevate the magician spiritually in order to have the necessary authority to command spirits. Of course, commanding here does not imply aggression but those methods also exist in case the spirits are unruly, disobedient, or decide to attack.   


The psychological model adherents claim magic is primarily psychological. Mind exists in the universe and it's through our intentions and focus that spells succeed or fail. The ritual tools or garments are seen as principally props used to focus the magician's or witch's mind. Spirits are said to communicate via telepathy or even mental images seen during meditation sessions. The demons are seen as friendly and welcoming to magick folk and can even be befriended. I'm not sure if this next piece pertains to outliers or if this is a central belief of the psychological model, but some adherents have even claimed authors of the grimoires purposely made magic more difficult to dissuade people from actually being able to use it. Also, some claim the tools are ultimately unnecessary and magick can be done impromptu, whenever, and wherever one wants with consistent success.   


  
These two are quite different in many regards and I'd like to invite members to share their view; explain why they believe their view; share experiences which confirm or deny their view; and perhaps include a little ramble about yourself.   


I'd like this conversation to be in the spirit of community, generosity, and compassion instead of name-calling, accusations, or insults. So let's be mature and respectful of all.   


Blessings.If so why? I do not work with demons for various reasons fo I dont have any first hand experience

Update: wow! I wasn't expecting so many answers! Thank you all, I guess after reading the comments the very notion of my question needs to be redefined.
My original question was: how can something with lower vibrations (demons) be more effective than something with higher ones ( Eg angels).Edit: I just wanted to give a huge warm thank you to everyone who responded with such kind and thoughtful comments. It means so much to me! Thank you everyone, merry meet! 

I have someone in my life who is seriously fucking with my family. For the sake of brevity and my sanity I won’t be going into too much because I’m going to get fired up and angry again. I’m scared one day I’ll come to blows with this person and end up in prison. He’s beyond enraging. I’ve black salted his place multiple times these past months only to see minimal improvement in his grotesque behavior. I work with white magic mostly but this person has really rocked my energy and I’m starting to get anxious with his antics. 

Do any of you guys have any recommendations? Ideally I’d like for him to shut up and stay within his property. No pain or violence directed at him. But if he could move that’d also be great. I don’t want any energetic chords attached and I want to move on peacefullyTLDR: Magic is real.

So......magic{k}......such a weird thing. I...want to share my story....I will keep it as concise as possible.

Religious background: Baptized Roman Catholic. Non practicing. Went to a weird weekday "sunday" school. Figured out the best they could do with metaphor was illusion...burned ethanol soaked paper as a means of conveying a miracle. At this point I became disillusioned.

My mom had spellbooks....nothing serious....wiccan poetry...and childish incantations for money and love etc. She also had a wand...with nordic symbols.....which iplayed around with. She didnt seem fully committed to wiccan craft but shared a bond with wiccan practitioners.

I began having dreams at like 12 or so where I would be roaming my apartment complex and rising into other peoples apartments. My dreams always had meaning...and I even had some where Id dream of fog and wake up on a foggy morning......things started to seem more connected at fundemental level.

There was a book of a series by mom's friend gave her, which I stole. I cant remember the title. It was something "voyages" with the image of a spirit leaving the body on the cover....black hardcover. I loved this book and I had no idea why. I remember a passage of a kid that had cancer and imagined fighter jets combating the metastic disease into remission...imagination....and will through it. Very important book.

I don't remember when I came across Robert Munroe's work....early highschool. Id lay on my back and practice....and it would never work.....except one time. I was on my bunk bed and physically exhausted. I closed my eyes. Red dots danced on the blackness of my eyelids. I felt me pulled into a 3d sphere....the dots elongated into red lines. I felt an immense space..and motion. I didnt want to open my eyes and miss this. The red lines on black into the expanse of forever was incomprehensible. It showed me an eternity of space, form, colour, and dimension.

In college,  nothing happened.

In 2009, I delved back into Munroe's work. Instead of using his techniques, I splayed on my mind 1) keep my mind awake...whatever the cost.......and that was it. Nothing else mattered. I finally had a moment where the vibrations happened...and a rushing by my ears. I got excited and ruined everything...but it happened multiple times, and the novelty wore down allowing me to push forward.

I finally peeled out of my body...and it was HARD. It was like I was attracted by an electromagnet to my body....pushing out...against a film, a layer....like an elastic garbage bag. I was out. Oh my frickin' god. I....was out....this is revelatory....this is worth more than a truck full of gold. I am a spirit.......I can see it, feel it, move through space......and now I know what is needed to do it again.......an exhausted body......and a focused mind.

So I have 4 journals full of these OBE's and the experiences have sadly become mundane......so.....magic time.

I start to study magic.....what magic? Anything...I ordered like 30 books off amazon.....3 of which are very important. 1) Practical sigil magick by frater U D, 2) Transcedental Magic by Eliphas Levi( so many things happened while reading this book...... (while studying solomon's triangle my TOOLplaylist switched  to a band called sleep and their song called solomon's theme......was discussing manifestation of money with a colleague.....he finds money 20 bucks on way to work next day....was reading of the natural elements ending with water....there is a huge flood in building next shift etc) 3) A garden of pomegranates to tie the theory and practicality together.

I started doing sigil magick....nice and easy...very clear. My friend was moving to the states during the pandemic....horrible economic predisposition. I created sigil willing her a prosperous life with a job, her apartment. She gets to michigan....has 5 job offers the FIRST WEEK. 

I meet a woman. I go into her apt. She has baphomet on the wall, st peter's cross in her bedroom, the occult tarot....multiple books on tarot, various skulls.....I ask if she practices high magic....she says no.....but practices tarot. 

I feel overwhelmed by all of the coincidences that are and back out of the apt...I take a break from magic.

A few weeks later I create a sigil to get a better job, and lo and behold, a company comes to me and offers an interview.

This is where I am now.So the universe or whatever had been sending me synchronicity after synchronicity telling me to quit smoking. Finally now I’m actually doing it and just fucking sucks. I already struggle from anxiety and so this process on top of my normal anxiety has just been a lot. 

Then come to today where literally nothing is going my way. I get locked out of accounts, I am behind on my assignments including midterms, and my wife has worked 72 hours in the last six days so I’m the only one who can take care of the house. Just all the stress, I can’t even find a way to relax. Then I go outside and see that a bird has shit at least 15 times all over my car, and my wipers can’t clean the windshield all the way. I’m pissed (may I remind you I am also quitting smoking). 

I go do my errands, there’s traffic both ways. The grocery store is out of stock of fucking everything. Literally nothing is going my way. I come home, there’s a traffic jam on my street because the cops set up a detour so I can’t even cross the street to get inside. Finally, I get out of my car and yell “after everything lately the least you could do is give me some rain to help me clean my car” ... to the sky... like a crazy person. I forget about it and move on with all the shit I still have to do. 

Now as I type this it is absolutely pouring rain outside in Southern California where we get like 0.2 inches of rain annually. This isn’t the first time I’ve made it rain, that was actually the first thing I ever did with magick, but it still surprises me sometimes when this kind of thing happens. No ritual, no sigil, no prep, just me yelling at the sky on a whim and the sky complies. That just never gets old.If triangles are the most powerful shape found in nature why do we use circles in magic?

Edit: I'm going to try magic using a triangle instead of a circle

As you may have discovered playing MASH as a child, just doing a manifestation exercise is not enough to change your reality. It’s more than just whispering a spell you found online over a vision board and wanting the thing really hard.

Manifestation exercises like these are powerful, but an ultimately optional step in the manifestation process.

There’s a larger process at play that’s where the actual magic (haha) happens. And this larger process is where most people get stuck. (Stuck both in the sense of, “I need help figuring this out”, and stuck in the sense of, “I’m a woman of color in a systemically racist world and the opportunities I need aren’t coming my way.”)

But whether you want something big or small, something urgent or something silly, here’s the general process/mindset to manifest it into reality.

1. Get really clear on what you want and why you want it. I’m not talkin’ just the surface reason, but the really deep, core reasons.

Let’s say, I want a life partner. This might trigger old emotional wounds of thinking I’m not loved enough by my parents, might bring up feelings of inadequacy and abuse from experiences with previous partners, bla bla bla.

All of those past experiences and conditioning are like sticky goop in your manifestation pipes. They have their own energetic and psychological signature that’ll interfere in your ability to draw something new into your reality.

Not only can these past experiences disrupt your ability to manifest what you want, they can call in more of the same shit! If the primary energy of manifestation pipes is one of trauma or fear, the Universe will plop that into your life again and again until you do something to remove the goop as much as possible (aka heal).

So do what you can to process and clear out that sticky goop! Personal/spiritual development work, such as yoga, meditation, Tantra, somatic therapy, coaching, etc. are all really effective ways.

There are many healers and practitioners you can work with, but there’s plenty of free info out there as well that can empower you to heal yourself. Find something that works for you and do it regularly. Think of it as energetic hygiene.

2. (Optional) Do a fun manifestation exercise or ritual. It may seem silly to put together a vision board or whatever, but it will prime your unconscious brain for what you’re trying to achieve.

Most of these exercises are a way of letting your “experience” your dream before you actually have it in real life. This means when it does show up it’ll feel familiar and safe, making you more likely to take the steps to bring it into your life with ease and comfort rather than fear and apprehension. 

The unconscious speaks to the conscious mind in dreams, the conscious mind speaks to the unconscious in ritual.

3. As you’re waiting for your manifestation to show up, do your absolute best to follow your intuition. Whenever you get an impulse, weird urge, or intuitive hit do it, no matter how silly or unconnected from your desire it is. Listen to your gut.

Even if it’s something as bizarre as “make a Zillow account” during a pandemic, do it. Run that ridiculous errand, pack that extra thing, call up that person you’ve suddenly thought about for the first time in years.

I’m the first to admit this is easier said than done. This is tough for two main reasons.

Having enough time/money to act on your intuition can be challenging for most people, and if you have a non-dominant identity you probably have even less resources.

Our intuition is only as clear as our conditioning (another sticky goop in our manifestation pipes thing). Old beliefs, socialization, trauma, gaslighting, and other blockages all cloud our intuition. If you have a non-dominant identity, you probably carry more of this type of thing.

That’s why your “gut” sometimes points you in the wrong direction. To refine your intuition, see the personal development practices mentioned in step 1.

4. Take FUN action. Do what feels good! This is not the time for making long to-do lists and project plans (unless that’s your definition of fun.)

If you want to find a partner and find online dating fascinating but in-person mixers excruciating, just do the apps. Do what you enjoy even if the data says otherwise.

If you’re building a business and social media makes you break out in hives go with other methods like SEO or old-school networking.

If you don’t feel happy in the present your desire will never come.

5. Be patient. Sometimes your manifestation will come instantly, sometimes it will take years before the timing is right for it to come into your life. But if it’s yours it will come to you.

Stay grateful for everything you can within your present situation. Manifestation work has the unfortunate side effect of encouraging you to live in the future, to delay your sense of happiness and contentment until you have The Thing. Don’t fall into that trap.

Remember the common story of new love birds, “It wasn’t until I totally gave up dating that I finally met My Person.”

Some people say that manifestation is “easy” or “effortless.” I think they’re insane.

Depending on the desire, it can be super hard! Essentially, you have to simultaneously honor your desire while surrendering it to the Universe. Not easy for people with control/trust issues (aka pretty much all of us).

When it’s something you desperately want, like finding money to pay rent or your dreamboat before your biological clock runs out, it takes an unbelievable amount of inner strength to let go and trust. It can be excruciating to not have The Thing You Want. 

But the Universe knows what you want better than you do. If you let the Universe bring it to you, rather than pushing it into your life through sheer force of will, your manifestation will be so much more perfect and beautiful than you can ever imagine.

In short, manifestation is what naturally happens as you clear your conditioning. The energy of your soul starts to match the energy of your desires. The Universe is really just energy (all the energy in Every Thing). As you align your personal energy with the energy of your desires, this will start to affect the energy of the Universe, and all of this getting-on-the-same-page-ness ends up plopping your desire into your reality. 

So don’t get discouraged! Start with small desires and keep it light.

Your Soul Reading Reveals The Path That Your Soul Is On At This Point In Your Life.
It Reveals The Challenges That May Be Blocking You On Your Soul’s Journey
And The Opportunities Available To Help You At This Time in Your Life...Hey guys! I recently started a subreddit for Appalachian Folk Magic, folklore in general, history, ghost stories, or just stories from growing up in the Appalachian region. If Appalachian culture interests you I’d love for you to check it out! It’s                           r/OurAppalachia & Ive also created an Instagram account @ourappalachia to share the same stories on that platform. I will be launching a tee line soon with proceeds going toward preservation of the Appalachian region & nature conservation as well. Hope you’ll check it out! Thanks. <3First of all. I don't gamble. I rarely do anything considered gambling and I don't call it that because of the word's association with losing.       
          
My best friend and I walked away from a casino with over $500 in winnings and we went in with lots of enthusiasm, our pockets holding some lucky charms, and the intention to win money.       
          
We had just finished selecting and buying some new furniture and I spent over $5000. I asked my friend if she wants to go win at the casino and offered to give her cash to play with. Our agreement was that we would split our winnings 50/50.        
         
The casino is two blocks from my apartment, so we walked with our little charms in our hands. At the intersection in front of the casino, we rubbed some flakes off one particular charm and asked for blessings.  In the casino, I withdrew $200 and we each got a drink and began playing. We were transient constantly moving to different machines. We used our intuition to decide when to bounce to another location in the casino. We were steadily winning. At one point we sat at these machines and right away an old hag sits next to me and starts to siphon our energy like a gross vampire. She won over $100 first press of that button and I just knew she was stealing our energy. I told my friend time to move and she already knew. We went from machine to machine unttil we spent $100 between us. We had won around $150 so far. We went outside to get some air and we renewed and shielded eachother. Then we went back to the machines.       
         
Every machine we would scratch off some flakes from a charm I brought. As we could not decide where to go we felt about done and my friend pointed out a machine behind me with some psychedelic energy behind it. It was colour changing mandala of sorts. Walking up to this machine, I could feel the grace of my higher power and my heart started beating harder. I pressed the button and won over $400. We collected the money, walked to a park and laid our cash and charms in the grass. We celebrated with a blunt and appreciation for our winnings. We split 50/50 so I gave my friend just under $300 in cash.      
        
This was really fun and successful. I want to do more like this. The charms we used we still hold on to. We have talked about doing something for scratch tickets, bingo, etc. I do not call it gambling. I do not have that association with what we did. Not at all. I call it winning. Attitude is a huge part of being successful in magick, at least in my opinion. Even when we "lost" a spin, we cheered loudly and with great enthusism. Never had a feeling of doubt or anxiety the whole time.I am 22 I have been practicing magick since I was 9. Maybe younger and I just don’t remember. My practice doesn’t make sense! I can channel and connect with entities but I can’t feel the angels in the lbrp. I can manifest random shit like nothing but when it comes down to something I really need, nothing! I’ve done types of magick that even people in this community would think I’m crazy for saying works. It makes me want to quit magick altogether sometimes. Does anyone else feel like this? I’ve studied tons of different traditions and systems. Applied them. Seen them work and be contradicted. How does it make sense? Near instantaneous manifestations for things that don’t matte with the slightest bit of magick. And nothing when I make more elaborate rituals for important stuff. It’s just frustrating.


EDIT: Detachment this was something I should have mentioned. I have thought about this as part of the problem. But it’s part of the contradiction I see.  I’ve done workings well I’m hell bent on something and seen great results. And other times it holds true. 
As far as learning about multiple traditions I take from it what I need I’m eclectic as many of us tend to be. I do take elements from chaos magicki was initially interested in hoodoo, and tried to follow those traditions exactly but over time i realized i’ve been more so following my own intuition when doing things like spells or reading tarot cards. my own personal magick practice takes inspiration from hoodoo and also other practices, and i feel like i’ve been seeing better results and it just feels right, but i don’t have a specific one i stick w anymore. is this okay? do i have to stick to one belief/practice system or can i create my own? like, if someone were to ask me what i practice, i wouldn’t know how to answer bc i don’t really have a name for it, it’s just my ownI’m my case it was pretty basic, a gender less face made of clouds backed by a clear blue sky. When I was probably 4-6 I’d regularly picture and pray to god in this image. 

Anyway this got me wondering how others saw god as a child, or an adult, or if it may have changed over time.So I'm on the 5th day for a ritual I am doing and I just realized that I was doing the wrong invocation chant all along. Basically, I was using the one in the given example rather than the one for the specific angel I was trying to call upon. Will it still work? Or should I start the ritual over? The first times I did it I felt a great "It is done" feeling and I still mostly do but I'm not sure whether to continue or start over. Some help would be appreciated thank you.I don't enjoy gambling, but I want to do an experiment. Anyone have any guidance? Or is that messing with something I shouldn't? I'm kinda at a desperate point in my life, so I'm ready to say fuck it and really go all in. My grandmother and several family members have been known to practice Brujaria, so hopefully I can conjure up that energy. 
Thanks!Today I made the step to finally block this toxic person on social media. She had me blocked for a long while but unblocked me so she could bother me in FB posts and send me a nasty message every so often (I always ignore them). It's a long story, but to make it short, she flew over state lines to my home to stir the pot with me and my then roommate, and refuses to take accountability for anything she does. Now she's obsessed with paining me to be the villain while talking shit about my constantly and harassing me online. 

I carved her first name, middle initial, and last name into a candle with her birth month and year. In the candle I wrote shut up, shut the fuck up over and over saying  to keep her thin lips shut about me and for her bullshit to be unheard. I dressed it in black pepper, sea salt, cayenne, and olive oil, and initially called for mother goddess, the holy spirit and "anyone". I later outed the candle asked for the father, mother, the holy spirit and all the spirits that guide and protect me, because I don't want foreign entities that may be dark in my home. 

Should I try this again? I'm not super seasoned but I'm trying to get back on the saddle. 

Thanks, y'all.I'm currently reading:

https://youtu.be/Pj4q0Mc08EY

Lets have a discussion on percussion and intent. 

Although i use ketamine during the cleanse you can feel the power in their voice. Parts of it where you feel the bad energy being pulled out and then pushed away. 

And i dont think its just the drugs. I mean for all i know it could be, I dont know much about the Tuvan tribe other than this shamans song is perfect for my "chakra" cleanse. 

Before modern medicine, shamans had been healing people for what feels like the entirety of human kind.
Im both jealous and thankful that im not living in the times where the best they could do was sing to heal you.

And im not even sure i believe in chakra energy i just know after those 2 hrs i feel a whole hell of a lot better than when i started.Ive used sigil magick to manifest things such as a specific amount of money, a type of person I wanted to have a relationship with, or even a new job.  But then it seems after a few months, I end up losing most if not all of it.

So my question then is the power of magick just temporary? It seems too good to be true and then it just might be if everything just deisappears after a few monthsYesterday I primed today's post by inquiring about your guys' experience(s) with the Middle Pillar Exercise. I wanted to see if some of you had better tools for manifestation than the MPE (I'm just referring to the exercise, not the grade 5=6 Middle Pillar Ritual), in order to compare and contrast my experiences against yours. 

Today, I'd like to impress upon you a myriad of cases where it transformed my life and attracted to me exactly what I visualized, with zero compromises. Although I do still question whether or not I paid for these powerful manifestations in other ways due to their magnitude, I do not question the technique used to acquire them. 

The tool itself has to be used with methods of visualization, emotional invocation, concentration and gratitude, which are designed to serve as primers. Here is the methodology used step by step:

1] Nikos Charalambous Crown Chakra Meditation of Youtube

2] LBRP (Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram)
Middle Pillar

3] Turning off the crown chakra meditation

4] Turning on Trance GOA music to help invocation celebratory, happy and ecstatic emotions during closed eye visualization of having what I desire to attract

5] Set alarm to 5 to 10 minutes 

6] Concentration (Applied with closed eyes to collect thoughts during a subversive meditative state as GOA trance continues to play)

7] Commencing to visualize what I want to attract and invoking the celebratory, ecstatic bliss by breathing deeply through the solar plexus chakra until this bliss is present, standing up and dancing with eyes closed during the visualization process of having what it is that I want

8] Alarm Rings

9] I commence to exit meditation and turn off GOA trance. I return to meditation and thank universe through strong prayers of gratitude for bestowing upon me in hindsight what I intended to attract. 


Experiences of success:

1] 2011: Attracted first girl of my dreams for a relationship 
2012: *Relationship with first girl ended.*

Attracted second girl of my dreams for a relationship
Attracted 2006 Chevrolet Impala SS (without paying)
Attracted high grade on Calculus Test
Attracted female attention at college campus
Attracted dream apartment

*I crash Impala SS*

Attracted a car that worked out in my favor: ended up getting a brand new Toyota Camry I didn't have to pay for. 

2013: 
Attracted money through random job manifestation that was hard to get and very specific 

2015:
Attracted a series of girls for sexual reasons after my second dream girl and I split (Got sick and had to get hospitalized for a month. Got discharged and required to do in home IV treatments for another 3 months; "dream girl" decides to abandon me because she falls out of love)
Smashed Toyota Camry
Had to quit job due to failing health 

Attracted third dream girl (I leave her after living with her for a few months.)

2017:
Attracted fourth dream girl (Just for three months before her and I split. She leaves me because of my health. She told her friends that I need a girlfriend and not a nurse)
Attracted dream sports car 

2018:
Attracted new apartment 
Attracted fifth dream girl 
(Then I get sick with cancer on top of the previous disease other girls kept leaving me for, which was cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is not related to cancer in any way.)

2019:
Attracted fifth dream car & Got cured of cancer (previous car had a lot of issues and was sold)

2021:
Battle with Cystic Fibrosis continues as cancer treatment made my health way worse. Now at 24% lung function and not really manifesting anymore. Somewhat lost interest as I'm picking up the pieces and parting ways with my last dream girl that helped me through cancer, for she's moving back to her home state across the country. Love is still deep between us; however, it may all be just part of the manifestation. 

Should I continue manifesting with the Middle Pillar? Are these materialistic manifestations backfiring to hurt me? Should I no longer manifest simply materialistic objects and focus strictly on spiritual manifesting?So, recently I’ve decided to go down a bit of a self-betterment rabbit hole. If my body is my temple, then it is in shambles. My relationship with food is best defined as an addiction with zero impulse control. 

I’ve started meditating and it’s helped make marginally better decisions. Nothing extreme. But, as with everything, I’m taking it day by day and trying to not beat myself up for mistakes while still holding myself accountable.

So, while physical fitness is usually left to more bro-science forums, I’ve been dying to ask if any of you have implemented forms of magick into your work outs or supplementation? 

Teas, pills, breathing, particular exercises, etc…


Edit: Thank you thank you thank you all for your responses. I’ll get back to responding once I’m done with work. I genuinely appreciate all of your responses and have an awesome list of things to look up and look into.Hey guys! I have a spell bottle recipe for you. This recipe will help you with keeping toxic people away. Basically, it will divert their attention away from you. Why I call it the anti bad vibes spell bottle! Just carry the bottle with you.

You will need:

A jar with lid. Any size but large enough to fit the items in.

Black obsidian chips. The stone of protecting against bad energy and psychic attack. 

A black candle 

Lavender. For protection.

Himalayan salt. For cleansing. 

Anise. To ward off the evil eye. 

Chilli flakes. To ward off anyone who placed bad intentions on you. 

A bay leaf 

A black marker 

Instructions: 

1. Cleanse yourself and your area. I recommend doing an egg cleanse before doing this spell. Do this spell on a Saturday since Saturday is ruled by Saturn. You can also use the phases of the moon to aid you in this spell. 

2. Cleanse each object and meditate your intention into each object. Including the candle. The candle is black since black is for protection. But if you don’t have black you can use white. I find it’s helpful to write down your objects and what you’re using them for. Light the candle. Through out this process imagine yourself being guided and protected. 

3. Play protective HZ music on YouTube. Ask your guides to help channel your intentions into this bottle. Put each object into the bottle and say what each one is for. 

4. Put the lid of the bottle on. When the candle has appeared to be almost melted, say “and so it is!” And blow it out. Drip the wax on top of the lid. 

Carry this bottle around you. I like to leave one in my room and the other in my purse inside a small envelope in my purse not to ruin the wax. You may have to recharge the bottle every 8 weeks just give it a good shake and cleanse every week. Depending on how many enemies you have.

Disclaimer: This spell doesn’t replace putting boundaries or standing up for yourself. Continue to practice self care and asserting yourself. This jar is very helpful tho!Things like belladonna and aloe vera, I'm looking to make a bewitching/beauty ointment for spells and just regular use. I want to know what herbs can be useful for it I wrote in my “grimoire”...it’s my sacred space where pretty much whatever I write or do a sigil in, comes to pass. Without judgement, please, I wrote that I want my ex back. Everything I asked to pass in terms of events started happening. Then I got fearful and frankly (hard to admit) but desperate. I showed him none of the desperation. In fact I showed the opposite. But my thoughts became obsessive and it’s all fallen apart again. He can come of his own will. We are meant to be. There’s not a doubt in my mind. But it’s so tempting to have it come to pass quickly. 

Do fears manifest just as much as wants?

A few weeks ago something weird happened. The police called me at 4am saying they found a woman wandering the streets and brought her to the hospital. That she was extremely frail and elderly. That she kept saying my name over amd over and that she spoke a different language. I asked what language, they said Eastern European. I asked what she looked like they said old, frail, Eastern European, wearing a lot of gold and a black head scarf that was not Islamic. They googled my name and I’m in health care, they found my number easily and called me. My name is unique. I don’t know another person with my name. The incident concerned me but didn’t scare me. I thought maybe it was a warning to lay off my magick amd focus on myself. 

These incidents aren’t related, and I’m not sure what I’m asking but any thoughts guys?Hi there, I've been studying paganism and esoterism for some time and I started to get interested to greek religion, since there aren't many reliable sources on internet I was wondering if someone here knew about the topic and could help me learn/reccomend books or other things I could learn from. Thank you in advance.I am trying to find out if there is a sect, branch, or school of thought with regard to magick as a psychological tool to elicit change in one's self. I do not personally subscribe to the idea that a ritual can create change outside one's self (such as causing a person to fall in love, or become lucky) however I'm very interested in experimenting with magical ideas to overcome personal insecurities, traumas, etc.

For example: I experienced trauma at the hands of another person and have been working through therapy to deal with this, however I just feel like part of my brain can't seem to let go. I created an effigy of this person who harmed me and locked it into a box. I told myself that now they are trapped in the box, they can no longer harm me. It brings me comfort. Occasionally I'll give the box a good shaking just to release some negative feelings, although I do not believe this will bring any physical harm to this person in the real world. This sort of ritual has a positive effect on myself only.

Is there a name for this? A place where I can gather more resources? I've looked into both chaos magick and sympathetic magick and these seem rather close to what I'm looking for, but I wanted additional opinions as well.

Thank you for your time and input! ❤️I did some spells some of them worked , some haven't or I'm not sure wether they did. When I look at people or even at my life before I got to know magick, I also had luck or good things happen, without praying , manifesting. So now I'm wondering wether these are not coincidences after all or wether magick can truly influence our "fate". 

After my very clear message that I received from the universe, (check my post in the psychic sub), I shouldn't believe in coincidences but sometimes I'm not sure especially when it regards spells.The show midnight gospel watches like a podcast with a trippy cartoon in the background, and the guest on episode three practices ceremonial magick. 

What he talks about and what I’ve come to understand in my own practice are remarkably similar. I’m wondering to those of you who have or will watch it, how does his description compare to your own understanding of magick?Im working my way through Frater U.D.'s High Magic, and its a great book. Full of practical rituals and and physical exercises. It has a very complete Greater Ritual of the pentagram where you invoke the elements and archangels. I guess I just don't know what it actually does.

The Kabbalistic cross balances and centers you, the LBRP gathers your own energy and expels other energy. Is the invoking in the Greater Pentagram just supposed to be like a buff? Make you feel good? What is the purpose of invoking all the elements? The book doesn't describe how you invoke just one element with a purpose of doing something.Last night I was dreaming i was falling asleep and when i opened my eyes and there was a shadowy entity hovering over me making sure i knew it was there. It would make noises and poke at me to intimidate me. I got annoyed with it and ended up grabbing it and started having sex with the shadow. It was good sex too. Any idea what this means?First thing breathing does is it keeps you alive. If you stopped breathing for long enough you'd be dead. That should be enough to tell you that this thing we do that carries on in the background of our lives, even when we're sleeping, this thing we do called breathing carries tremendous importance to our vitality and our longevity. It also feels really fucking good. Try it!

Stop for a minute and take a good deep breath of fresh air.

\- breathe - 

Feels good don't it?

Meditation isn't so much about thinking or not thinking in fact when I meditate I'm usually aware of my thoughts and how they go on and on regardless of how much I want to them to stop. They just go on. It occurred to me at some point meditation is not about thinking, it's about breathing. Once you've gotten the hang of your thoughts and how you don't need to pay them any attention, once you've realised you can shift focus to other things and the thoughts run in the background what else have you got to do? Then comes breathing.

The act of taking time out of ones day to just sit and to breathe, sending deep breathes of oxygen to the lungs and to the brain, that's what truly creates the health benefits as ascribed in meditation. A scientist might wonder, is it the sitting? is it the the thinking deeply about the present moment? is it the koans? What makes a Zen master so Zen? 

I can tell you now, it's 100% breathing. 

So lets talk about the mythical magical secrets of breathing that nobody seems to understand but it's right there in front of us the whole time. Breathing in is the intake of O2, Oxygen atom x2, Breathing out is the Exhale of Carbon Dioxide, a Carbon atom + 2 Oxygen Atoms. How does that happen? How does one thing, a molecule go in and then by some process of the body the same thing comes out only changed slightly? 

What happens between the IN and the OUT breathe in seconds that takes in life and breathes out death? Remember if you tried it the other way, breathing in CO2 and Breathing out O2, it wouldn't work very well and you'd die. It's a one way system. No backsies.

It could be a ring, a necklace or a pin. Also, this way magic could be passed onto the future generations if they are magically inclined.

Thoughts?

Edit: You guys I know what a talisman is. I am wondering about concentrating and accumulating all personal magical power/"juice" overtime into a single item. So when we feel like living a mundane life we just take off the item. And when we grow old and pass on genreational magick we simply give the item to grand kids if they so desire.Effects of listening to 150hz at 30-40% volume (was not meditating)

10 minutes- whole body starts to feel relaxed, felt drowsy, pushed through and reached a state of awareness in relaxed body 

20 minutes- visualisation ability increases, more vivid imagination
,creative ideas start forming in mind 

25 minutes- mind starts to go blank, thoughts disappear, whole brain started tingling, head feels lighter, lungs feel lighter, slight depersonalisation from body( similar level of depersonalisation when high off weed)

30 minutes- feel detached from body, feel like a less dense version of myself is encased inside my body, better control over my body, body feels lighter overall

Stopped listening. I did all this while on a tour bus and experienced these effects which I documented. Epsilon (0.5hz and lower) and Lambda (150hz and higher) are not as researched and talked about as the other brainwaves, so I hope this is useful to someone who looks into them and decides to mediate using them. From my experience, I assume that this can aid in the expansion of consciousness and can help those practicing things like astral projection and magick practices. Once I return back to my hotel, I will properly mediate to this with the yoni mudra and see if I get the same effects or go even deeper.

Edit: 54 minutes- visualisation is as perfect as sight, can create large spheres of energy and feel it and play with it, can imagine myself out of my body and can change the form and appearance of my body, and can feel sensations from the imagination, can enter a state of no mind at will, can make body still and then feel like my body isn’t there,heart beat was very loud in my head, breathing produced sensations, felt heat and felt like I was breathing in a less dense gas&#x200B;

Most of us spend the first ‘part’ of our witchcraft as a private practitioner. You may not even be at this point physically practicing at all… you’re just getting your bearings, investigating, and deciding if magick and this path are right for you.

For Some people at that first leg of the journey, they turn away.

“Nope, I don’t resonate with this…”

And that's A OK!

But if you’re here reading this, I can reasonably suspect that’s not you.

So what do we do when we have decided that witchcraft and magick *are* for us? What do we do when we want to ‘come out of the broom closet’, dedicate ourselves to our Truths and begin living as witches out in our “real world”?

For just about anybody who doesn't come from an ultra supportive place… this can be absolutely daunting. I have heard horror stories of people being thrown out of their homes, or being ostracised by their families and communities.

There are so many unknowns that many choose to stay hidden for a very very long time, in lieu of having to answer any of the questions.

And that’s A OK too.

It’s ALWAYS ok to protect yourself.

But for some of us… this truth is *SO STRONG* and *SO PREVALENT* in our lives that we feel compelled to face the questions, to face the unknown, and to bring a new face to our lives.

So what can you expect?

Well, if you’re living with any type of “religious” person, you can expect them to verdantly disagree with you. Most religions have some statements about how there is No other God, No Gods before Me, I am the only God… and such.

As a majority polytheist community, as a whole, pagans usually don’t believe that, but we try to still largely be good to people who do.

What you need to know here is that for any of these questions, NEITHER SIDE KNOWS THE ***REAL*** TRUTH.

Okay?

You can believe what you believe, just as they can believe what they believe…and nobody has to be ‘wrong”.

Do you want a ***REAL TRUTH***?

There is no book or document or statue or monument in this world that can irrefutably prove that any belief system is the ultimate and Only Truth. *(If there were, it wouldn’t be such a chronic question/argument, would it?)*

The frame of mind to keep these questions/interrogations in, is **“We can both be right, and we don’t have to agree to both be able to believe as we do.”** It doesn’t matter WHAT they believe, and it doesn’t matter to them WHAT you believe. They want to be right, you know you both can be right and not agree… so let a lot of what happens just..*.pass.*

**Breaking the News**

So to begin, Just HOW Can you tell someone you’re a witch?

It usually begins something like this

“**Mom/Dad/Guardian/Roommate/Partner… I wanted to tell you something because I want to be open and honest with not only you, but myself. I have been interested for some time in witchcraft/neopaganism and I am at a place in my path where I want to be open with the people around me about that.”**

This statement is carefully crafted, and while you don’t have to say that exactly, let’s take a look at the pieces so you can incorporate them in your own words. Before you begin, I want you to recognize that this first statement is the *only* completely open and receptive time you’ll have with this person for the rest of the conversation. It doesn’t matter what they believe, they’re going to have questions and be asking them off of whatever image they have of a ‘witch’ in their mind.

This can be a very difficult conversation for some people...It’s important that you start off on the ‘right foot’.

Looking at the statement, We 1st address the person **“Mom/Dad etc”** (that shows respect and acknowledgement). Then we give a positive intention for how you see the conversation going **“I want to be open and honest” .** Then you **‘hand them the news’.**

The primary reaction of most people is one of confusion. That leads either into anger/disapproval or wonderment/questioning. Most people in this situation can kind of guess how their conversation partner is going to react ahead of time. So prepare accordingly.

Now, with further consideration, let’s talk about how to Navigate some particular questions and statements that seem to pop up often during these conversations.

**Question and Answer Considerations**

For most religious people, especially if they’ve been living with you for some time, the question is:

**“So you don’t believe in (whatever god they believe in)?”**

A: **“No, I don’t.**” While you may by relationship feel like you’re required to give more of an answer… I want you to know that You have 0 expectation to follow up by explaining what your beliefs are, and **“No.” is a full sentence.** As a matter of fact, I would consider avoiding further explanation unless you are directly asked (which we will cover below).

If they are particularly religious, you’ll likely find yourself answering this question next:

**“You know you’re going to hell, right?”**

A: **“No, I don’t.”**

You have 0 expectation to acknowledge the existence of Hell if you don’t believe in it. Nobody is going to try to explain hell to you, they expect you to already understand. Using a short and direct statement here is a good way to answer the question without leaving loops for argument on the topic.

They usually follow with:

**“Well I do. The (holy book) says that witches and diviners are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”**

A: **“Okay.”**

**They can cite whatever of the “holy threats” they care to,**

***If You don’t believe in it, it’s all fairytales.***

Look at this person as if they were a child. See their words for what they are… if you don’t believe in their book, recognize that you’re making them question their faith.

To some of these people, they are so layered into their faith that they cannot fathom someone not believing what they do. To them, everything is proof and confirmation of their beliefs… (*google “confirmation bias” if you want more info*)

People who are wholly and undyingly stuck to their religion mostly do not appreciate being made to question, which is why they are so devout in trying to make the people around them agree with them. Your mere existence as a witch causes them cognitive dissonance and they are seeking cognitive ease.

They can say it’s about keeping you out of hell, or getting you into heaven… but Listen to Me When I Tell You It’s Not.

**It’s not.**

It’s not about saving your eternal soul, It’s about them and what they think their righteous duty is...how THEY can be a “Good \_\_\_\_\_\_\_” for the heaven tally… so *Let* it be about them. You don’t have to respond with anymore than an acknowledgement that you heard the words coming from their mouth. They think they’re doing good, and they’re honestly misguided. Treat them accordingly.

**“Witches aren’t even real. If you’re a real witch, do a trick.”**

\`Aah, the good old back-of-the-bus bully question… Answers?

If you’re looking for an informative one that is very likely to shut them up, try:

**A: “Witches are very real and they exist across the globe. Look into the advocacy and extensive education of Selena Fox… or find a copy of the Military Chaplains handbook, which is a government produced document that recognizes Wicca as a religion. As a matter of fact, In 1986, the 4th circuit court recognized Wicca as a protected religion. If they’re not real, why are they recognized by government?”**

OR ignore and redirect.

**A:” I think that you have witches and magicians confused, as magicians perform tricks. I do not.**”

This is almost always inevitably followed by:

**“So What** ***DO*** **You do then?”**

A: *Completely up to you.* You can take this as an opportunity to express yourself if you feel confident, but at no time are you REQUIRED to share.

If you *do* want to share, it might be helpful to have some resources at the ready, should they be genuinely interested and open to new information. The wikipedia articles are a great and easy start, but consider connecting them with groups as well, because they can then SEE how many people identify, and some of the common things that REAL PEOPLE are doing.

The answer to this can be something along the lines of

**A: “I practice a faith based path that focuses on compassion, non violence and a reverence for nature. I can show you some stuff if you’re interested, there are a lot of people who practice a lot of ways in paganism. Everyone is unique.”**

If you *don’t* want to answer but want to end the question, you might say something like

**A: “I practice a faith based path that focuses on compassion and non violence.”**

For many, this will answer most of their other questions, or at least make them seem too ‘dumb’ to ask. For some, this won’t be enough, they’ll miss the cue and they will persist.

**“Yeah, but WHAT** ***DO*** **YOU DO?”**

**A: “I’d be happy to show you some resources where you can learn about paganism, but my personal practices are my own.”**

So even after all of this answering… What about the people who refuse to listen to you or believe that you know what you're doing? Many fervently religious people will say:

**“You’re just confused, and this is a phase.”**

**A: “It’s okay if you believe that, I don’t and we don’t have to agree.”**

By now, most have lost steam in questioning… and it’s usually follow up… but if the person is particularly intent on ‘disproving’ you, trying to change you, or being blatantly judgemental, they may ask some of the following which are directly intended to be inflammatory.

These questions are typically designed to try to p\*ss you off.

Don’t.

Don’t fall for it.

Don’t let them ‘raise your feathers’.

**“So do you like...kill animals and bathe in blood and stuff?”**

**A:”No.”**

**“So do you ride a broom?”**

**A:”No.”**

**“Can you kill people with your mind?”**

**A:”Yes, it’s my super power but I can only use it when people ask me a bunch of questions they don’t really care about the answers to.”**

Remember, In ALL cases, **you don’t HAVE to answer anything**. You also don’t have to be subject to patronizing questions from a person who is intent on you being wrong.

If someone asks you a question you don’t know the answer to or is intentionally irritating, you can ignore it, redirect it, say “I’m not sure yet” or give them a one word answer.

If you are brazen enough, you can call out their questions for what they are. **“I feel like I came to you to be open and honest and now you’re asking me questions like this because you’re trying to make fun of me, dismiss me, or be disrespectful to my thoughts and feelings.”**

If this isn’t really your style, start hitting them with the one word conversation. “Yes/No/Idk”

Repeatedly giving people one word answers tends to stop them more quickly than going on and on trying to explain yourself.

By using one word answers, you’re sending off the social cue of ‘curtness’ and expressing your wish to end the questioning. When you ‘explain’ things to argumentative people, they’re listening for ways to refute you, or to try to attack/throw you off balance. Don’t give them ammunition.

It’s often best to just stick with what you know, and not try too hard to appease them.

Remember, you don’t need them to LIKE what you’re doing… you need them to ACCEPT it.

In some situations, that happens pretty easily. In others, it doesn’t.

If your person is STILL asking questions, you’re likely to hit the ‘wind down’ phase now, which is usually a series of statements on their part with things like “Well, I know you’re just confused, you don’t mean it, I’m going to pray for your soul.”

And to that, you just say ***“Okay. Thank you.”***

**Safety Considerations:**

If you don’t think you’re going to get a welcoming reception but you’re certain you’re going to come out, *do the things you need to prep BEFORE you have the conversation.* Whether that is securing another safe place to stay, packing a ‘bug out’ bag or telling a friend before you do it… prepare so that you’re not left ‘out in the cold’ so to speak because someone who has control over your living space can’t handle the news.

***Those possibilities aside, many many parents and roommates ARE accommodating,*** and surprisingly so. As we continue through these generations, more and more people are becoming enlightened to the fact that pagans aren’t all animalistic blood worshippers. The internet has gifted us with the ability to demonstrate our presence, and our persistent commitment to non-violence. Our numbers are growing, we’re seeing more and more metaphysicians, witches, stars and diviners appear… the Witches are rising again.

No matter what happens during that conversation, no matter how hard it is… I want you to know that in our circle, paganism, you have Home. You are ALWAYS welcome as pagan/witch so long as you commit yourself to a path of compassion and non-violence. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re considering having the ‘broom closet talk’... Most of us have already been through it…find your tribe, ask a question...we WANT to HELP!!!

Blessings,

Sywyrd Moon

I am a a daily practitioner who writes their life into existence regularly with some chaos magic practices to enhance the feeling factor.

I am now adding in meditation into the mix.

I was wondering anyone knows what it means, if when you meditate you are unable to sleep later in the day.

I know I am not sleeping during meditation but I did it for the 1st time for a hour in full and was unable to sleep after.

I’ve been sticking to 20-30mins as I’ve been training attention span and I have noticing my sleeping pattern slightly shift later and later.

Any advice is welcome.

ThanksI need a little help working through something. I have been doing Kelly Dawn’s (for those that may be familiar) guided meditation to connect with your inner witch. I have been doing this meditation 2-3 times per week for about 2 ish weeks. 

I do not want to give someone else’s whole work product away so cliff notes- in the meditation there is a bench and you sit on the bench and talk to your witch. You have to walk a path to get to the bench. My path has a tunnel of thorn bushes with snakes and otherwise creepy crawly things I need to walk through to get to the bench. A friend of mine suggested this is a veil between the spirit realm and ours. (She also does the meditation and hers is a sheer black curtain. She has experienced this veil in other spiritual interactions. She never crosses her veil to get to the bench.) When you end the meditation, you get up off the bench and walk back down the path where you came from. The witch always stays on the bench. 

In my meditation I’ve always walked (safely and un afraid) through the tunnel and sat on the bench. I’ve interacted with a witch (my inner witch?) and she/it has materialized to me in a fairly consistent manner; however the last two meditations, she was different, not the same witch. On Monday’s meditation, we talked very briefly, then she left me sitting on the bench, walked backed down the path, waived her had at the thorn tunnel and it disappeared, and she kept waking. 

Y’all when I opened my eyes, I was not me. I looked around like I was seeing my room for the first time. When I looked in the mirror I admired myself like I was looking at a stranger. Also, I have dogs, they sleep in my room in crates. I love dogs, always have. This witch looks over at the crates and thought oh great, dogs? I hate dogs. And instantly I have memories of being hunted by men with dogs. 

I was out of sorts for most of the day and have been exhausted all week. At aforementioned friends suggestion I asked the witch to leave. Rather demanded it. But I’m not sure what happened or is happening. Just looking for a little guidance - I don’t think I was possessed by something....right? 😳

Oh also, I have not done the meditation since that day. Kinda miss it, but kinda a little afraid to do it too. This is by far the strangest thing that has happened to me in the past month, but not the only strange thing. It’s been a wild month of awakening and visions and memories of I time that is definitely not here and now in my lifetime.Very often I hear songwriters say that what they wrote in a song actually happened later in their life. I used to think it was a prophetic thing that tends to happen with artists,  but I am wondering more and more if they influenced and actually manifested it simply by writing it down and singing it many times, like a spell. I am a musician myself, yesterday I wrote a song about ghosts from the future and today my grandfather died, and saddened I remember that song that was negative and not optimistic in style, and I also started to think about all those damned artist that sang dark and sad lyrics like Robert Johnson, Elliott Smith, Jackson C Frank, Ian Curtis, Kurt Cobain and the list goes on, and I find it spooky, I feel that we should be more careful with words, maybe you already know about this, am I wrong or... is speaking anything a form of magick and consequently, is singing certain words over and over the ultimate spell? There is also "happiness is a warm gun" by John Lennon. I never do magick consciously and never read this subreddit, I just had this thought and I had to share it with someone as crazy as me. 

Interesting article with "criteria" for those looking to find mentors.

Please, beware of scammers charging thousands for mentorships!

###[The Kybalion](http://english.grimoar.cz/?Loc=book&Lng=2&Back=nam&UID=390)  
An occult classic Since its first publication in 1908, The Kybalion, Hermetic Philosophy by Three Initiates, has been in constant demand by students and investigators of the Secret Doctrines. It is a modern addition to the body of work devoted to Hermes Trismegistus, an icon of ancient teachings that reveal the path to self transformation. In this revised edition, we have corrected many editorial issues inherent within the original text, creating a clearer presentation of the book's message: The Seven Hermetic Principles, or axioms: 

• Principle of Mentalism  
• Principle of Correspondence  
• Principle of Vibration  
• Principle of Polarity  
• Principle of Rhythm  
• Principle of Cause and Effect  
• Principle of Gender 

These principles complement other Hermetic teachings and provide a foundation for your own spiritual awakening. As the book states, "The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears of understanding".



###[David Conway - Magic: An Occult Primer](http://docdro.id/vnFogWU)  
David Conway's Magic: An Occult Primer is a seminal work that brought magical training to the every-magician in the early 70s. David is an articulate writer presenting the mysteries in a very workable manner for the serious student. Along with the updated texts on philosophy and practical magic is a plethora of graphics that have all been redrawn, promising to be another collector's edition published by The Witches' Almanac.

The book is divided into two sections: "Magical Theory" and "Magical Practice." "Magical Theory" presents a very concise accounting of the philosophy behind magic. Conway begins with a exposé of magic within the confines of natural law, taking the time to meticulously find corollary for the basis of magic. He then takes us into an exposition of the Kabbalah and broader cosmological concerns. Conway drills down into daily practice and further explores the basic training necessary for a magician in this day and age.

"Magical Practice" begins with the preparations necessary for the practice of magic. Conway begins this section with several tables of correspondences that will prove helpful to even the advanced magician. He continues with an examination of the timing of rituals as well as the place and ritual equipment necessary for rites. Conway then provides master rituals presented for both Kabbalistic and Egyptian approaches. He also presents detail on astral projection, talismanic magic, and prophecy.

Magic: An Occult Primer ends with appendices that present detailed magical recipes, an examination of magical alphabets, and an extensive occult Who's Who

###[Donald Tyson - Portable Magic](http://miltonthed.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/1/6/14162844/portable_magic_tarot_by_donald_tyson.pdf)

Tyson's efficient system of tarot magic is based on the Golden Dawn tradition, which corresponds with tarot imagery. He teaches how to work magic on the astral level by projecting one's awareness into the ritual tarot layout. Learn how to set up an astral temple, build an altar, cast a magic circle, and create a triangle through which to actualize your purpose. This innovative guide to tarot magic also includes rituals related to unions, business, banishing, and evoking elementals.

###[Rachel Pollack - 78 Degrees of Wisdom: Book of Tarot Revised](http://docdro.id/fLjBZrQ)  
A top tarotist's secrets to personal growth, one card at a time. The two volumes of Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom have inspired a whole generation of tarot students. It has often been described by readers, booksellers, and teachers as the "Bible of tarot readers." It is also often cited as one of the landmark books in modern tarot, and it helped to launch the "Tarot Renaissance" of the 1980s. The two texts-one for The Major Arcana and one for The Minor Arcana--appear together in this volume, which is a reissue of the 1998 edition first published by Thorsons. Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom draws on mythology and esoteric traditions and delves deeply into the symbolism and ideas of each card. It also gives the cards a modern psychological slant based on the pictures rather than a system of occult symbolism. This endlessly useful reference tool provides a concise history of tarot, introduces common spreads, and is a clear and readable book for both the beginning and advanced tarot student.

###[Lon Milo Duquette - Understanding Aleister Crowleys Thoth Tarot](http://docdro.id/IOwwGoH)  
Originally published in 2003, Understanding Aleister Crowley’s Thoth Tarot has proved to be the essential guide to accessing the unique symbolism and meaning of Aleister Crowley's remarkable tarot deck along with the deeply textured artwork of Lady Frieda Harris. Crowley authority Lon Milo DuQuette starts by providing an insightful historical background before delving into descriptions of each card in depth, from a tarot perspective and from an expanded, magickal point of view. He first describes the tarot meaning of each card in detail and then explains all the other attributions Crowley intended.

This unique guide has been updated with a new introduction that provides information on the unicursal hexagram cards included with the deck but never explained. 


###[Papus - The Tarot of the Bohemians](http://libgen.io/get.php?md5=E713F5FAA0D318C354F517C2789473D8&key=LLXJDNJL519MQD4X)  
Tarot of the Bohemians, along with the Pictoral Key to the Tarot, constitute the core literature of 19th and early 20th century 'Tarotism'. However, PTK is to the TOB as arithmetic is to differential calculus. If you have no experience reading occult literature of this period, you may find yourself profoundly lost after the first couple of pages, staring at the abundant and profoundly esoteric tables, charts and diagrams, trying to get a clue as to what Papus is talking about. Papus is after a 'Theory of Everything', and finds evidence for it in the Tarot and a set of correspondences with everything from the tetragrammaton to numerology and astrology.

His claim that the Tarot preserves ancient, profound knowledge by way of the Romany/Gypsies (i.e. 'Bohemians') all the way back to Egypt, India and Atlantis is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence of any kind of playing or fortune-telling cards prior to the thirteenth century, either in literature or folklore. Note that playing cards could not have become popular until the introduction of printing in Europe. The Tarot is believed to have originated from an elaborate deck of cards invented in Italy in the fourteenth century. The Romany people probably started to use this deck for cartomancy (fortune telling by cards) about a century thereafter. As Papus notes, all of the early cards depict people dressed in the costume of this period.

Late in the book, Papus condescends to pen a section, in his words, 'for the ladies' (cue Barry White music here), which gives some basic instruction in cartomancy using the Tarot deck. However, this is by far the weakest portion of this book. Papus is at his best when he is spinning elaborate webs of correspondence between the Tarot and the Macrocosm. This book is hard work, but if you master it you will have a profound grasp of the inner life of the Tarot deck. 

###[A.E. Waite - Pictorial Key to Tarot](http://english.grimoar.cz/?Loc=book&Lng=2&Back=nam&UID=14)    
Long used in telling fortunes and popular today among New Agers, Tarot cards are regarded by many as "the training wheels" on the bicycle of psychic development. Centuries of scientific progress have not diminished the irresistible attraction of gazing at picture cards to see the future and determine one's fate.
This book by Arthur Edward Waite, the designer of the most widely known Tarot deck and distinguished scholar of the Kabbalah, is the essential Tarot reference. The pictorial key contains a detailed description of each card in the celebrated 78-card Rider-Waite Tarot deck, along with regular and reversed meanings. Contents describe symbols and secret tradition; the four suits of Tarot, including wands, cups, swords, and pentacles; the recurrence of cards in dealing; an ancient Celtic method of divination; as well as wonderful illustrations of Tarot cards.
While the perfect complement to old-style fortune telling, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot also serves to make the Tarot entirely accessible to modern-day readers. It is also the classic guide to the Rider-Waite deck and to Tarot symbolism in general.

This is by no means simply a theoretical treatise accessible only to specialists. Any discerning reader can cope with the initiatory contents of The Tarot, perceiving completely new horizons of thought, activity, psychology, cosmogony and practical magic in this traditional form of Hermetic Occultism.

An enormous number of questions that occur to the earnest seeker are answered in new and fascinating ways. The attentive reader is offered the opportunity to understand the true meaning of one’s own life and destiny, as well as that of the epoch in which we live.

This scholarly work creates a new epoch in traditional occult philosophy. It is the first contemporary encyclopedic exposition of the great Western Tradition since the basic books by Eliphas Levi and Papus, and it also has full practical utility. The Philosophical Tarot has always been recognized as a universal key to all wisdom attainable by human beings. This text will be of particular interest, because of its kindred approach, to the many readers of the extraordinary contemporary masterpiece Meditations on the Tarot, by an anonymous writer much valued in esoteric circles throughout the world. The present work is by no means just a theoretical treatise accessible only to specialists, for anyone can understand the initiatory concepts of Mouni Sadhu's Tarot, perceiving completely new horizons of thought, activity, psychology, cosmology, and practical esotericism. In this text a great number of questions which occur to the earnest seeker are answered in a new and fascinating way, and the solution of the philosophical equations arising from the Arcana opens new vistas in every field of life. The book is suitably subdivided into 100 separate lessons, allowing for systematic study.

###[Anonymous - Meditations on The Tarot: A Journey into Christian Hermeticism](http://docdro.id/yULTzua)  
Published for the first time with an index and Cardinal Hans Urs von Balthasar’s afterword, this new English publication of Meditations on the Tarot is the landmark edition of one of the most important works of esoteric Christianity.

Written anonymously and published posthumously, as was the author’s wish, the intention of this work is for the reader to find a relationship with the author in the spiritual dimensions of existence. The author wanted not to be thought of as a personality who lived from 1900 to 1973, but as a friend who is communicating with us from beyond the boundaries of ordinary life.

Using the 22 major arcana of the tarot deck as a means to explore some of humanity’s most penetrating spiritual questions, Meditations on the Tarot has attracted an unprecedented range of praise from across the spiritual spectrum.

Written anonymously and published posthumously in 1980 at the wishes of its author, Meditations on the Tarot has been translated from the original French by writer and esotericist Robert Powell, who lives in Germany. Widely considered one of the greatest Catholic theologians of the twentieth century, the Swiss-born Hans Urs von Balthasar, who wrote the afterword in this new edition, was nominated by Pope John Paul II as a cardinal in 1988, and died in June of that year, two days before his inauguration.

###[Alan Chapman - Advanced Magick for Beginners](http://docdro.id/rWI80kp)  
A new paradigm that delivers a genuine transformation of occultism. The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet its apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick, to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmans writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious. The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalises magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: the art, science and culture of experiencing truth.

###[Georg Lomer - 7 Hermetic Letters](http://sixcrows.org/library/7HermeticLettersByDr.GeorgLomer.pdf)  
Develop your soul and spirit with Seven Hermetic Letters. A spiritual course of instructions for the higher development of the spirit and the mysterious powers of the soul. Basic preliminary exercises for controling one's self are provided in a simple way to ensure understanding and personal growth and progress without the need of a teacher. An excellent precursor to the Franz Bardon books on Hermetics.


###[Franz Bardon - Initiation into Hermetics](http://files.vsociety.net/data/library/Section%205%20%28C,%20I,%20O,%20U%29/Bardon,%20Franz/The%20Holy%20Mysteries/Initiation%20into%20Hermetics.pdf)  
Self-initiation into the Holy Mysteries with the need of a guru or master. Initiation into Hermetics provides step by step instruction in the form of practical exercises. These exercises lead to the development of body, soul and spirit. The result of the practical exercises is the development of occult abilities which can be of benefit to the student, in as far as he can change his existence for the better.

The great mystery of the Tetragrammaton, the key to the tetrapolar magnet, is explained. By reading the theoretical section many secrets are unveiled which were once only known to very few. The reader will receive first-hand knowledge about the principles of fire, air, water and earth, the positive and negative attributes of these elements, and how these elements affect the human body. The immutable law of cause and effect is explained, not only as it applies to human beings, but also how it applies to the elements. Detailed information is also given about the soul or the astral body, and how the four elements determine the temperament in a person.

The astral plane is considered to be "the beyond" by most religions. This plane does have its inhabitants, most of which are departed human beings from earth. Besides that you find elementaries, beings with one or only a few attributes. It is very advantageous to learn about these beings and how they affect a human being's life. There is also another kind of being, which is a being of the pure elements. The reader will find that many myths or even fairy tales are based on truth. But mankind has lost the ability to stay in contact with reality and has chosen to live in a completely transitory world which they consider to be their reality.

The third plain, the mental plain, is also explained; it is the sphere of thought which has its origin in the world of ideas.

Each step of the practical part of this book is divided into three parts: the magical spiritual or mental schooling, soul or astral schooling, and physical schooling. This allows the student to maintain a complete equilibrium. The student learns how to control all his mental faculties even to the point that he can control every thought. He will learn self-introspection, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, astral and mental travel, control of the electric and magnetic fluids, and communication with the beings of the astral plain.

###[Jason Augustus Newcomb - The New Hermetics](http://docdro.id/ioUnT8W)  
The New Hermetics is a powerful spiritual technology of the mind. It is a course of study and practice that teaches the science of illumination and the ability to alter reality. The ancient Egyptian form of Hermetic philosophy was that the mind shapes reality. The New Hermetics extends that philosophy - the universe is a great mind or consciousness, and we are a part of that consciousness; therefore by learning to control the mind, we learn to control our part of the universe. With updated versions of the ancient Rosicrucian brotherhood's 10 levels of initiation, combined with ancient and modern mind-expanding techniques such as visualization and NLP (neuro-linguistic programming), The New Hermetics progressively gives initiates power over their minds and world. Practicing these elements simultaneously makes it possible to undergo initiation into the mysteries of consciousness in a fraction of the time it was ever before possible. The course offered in the book lets practitioners master their minds in such a way that they will be able to achieve anything and everything they want in life, spiritually and physically.  
The New Hermetics offers 10 levels of instruction to control the mind and control reality:   
Level 1-The Initiate teaches mastery over behavior and visualization in the Ether.  
Level 2-The Zealot bestows mastery over emotions, breathing, and Etheric energy.  
Level 3-The Practitioner gives mastery over mind, beliefs, and the ability to project Etheric energy.  
Level 4-The Philosopher masters creativity,values, and the ability to direct Etheric energy.  
Level 5-The Adept develops relationship with cosmic consciousness.  
Level 6-The Advanced Adept offers the power to direct the forces of cosmic consciousness.  
Level 7-The Perfect Adept gives wisdom and the ability to share these forces with others.  
Level 8-The Master bestows mastery of cosmic consciousness.  
Level 9-The Mage gains mastery of universal power.  
Level 10-The Ultimate Master obtains mastery over the universal self. 

The New Hermetics is a powerful course of instruction that can help anyone master themselves to rule their world.

###[Lyam Thomas Christopher - Kabbalah Magic The Great Work of Self Transformation](http://docdro.id/9jSYqsS)  
Advancing to higher levels of ritual magic with purpose and power requires an exaltation of consciousness-a spiritual transformation that can serve as an antitode to the seeming banality of modern life.

Based on Kabbalistic techniques, the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and an Hermetic tradition spanning nearly two thousand years, this innovative new work introduces the history of the Golden Dawn and its mythology, the Tree of Life, Deities, demons, rules for practicing magic, and components of effective ritual.

A comprehensive course of self-initiation using [Israel Regardie's seminal Golden Dawn](http://download.libgen.io/get/6D39D20F34DE1BA4A97019478D997516/Israel%20Regardie%2C%20John%20Michael%20Greer-The%20Golden%20Dawn_%20The%20Original%20Account%20of%20the%20Teachings%2C%20Rites%2C%20and%20Ceremonies%20of%20the%20Hermetic%20Order-Llewellyn%20Publications%20%282016%29.epub) as a key reference point, Kabbalah, Magic and the Great Work of Self-Transformation guides you through the levels of the Golden Dawn system of ritual magic.

###[Israel Regardie - The Golden Dawn: The Original Account of the Teachings, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Hermetic Order](http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=6D39D20F34DE1BA4A97019478D997516)  

The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie is considered by many to be the book that started the modern occult movement. The original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which started in the late 1800s, borrowed from a wide variety of occult traditions ? Kabalah, Tarot, Geomancy, Enochian Magic, Theosophy, Freemasonry, Paganism, Astrology, and many more ? and created a unique and viable system of magic that is still being practiced today. Almost every contemporary occult writer and modern group has been influenced, directly or indirectly, by the Order or its members, making The Golden Dawn one of the most influential occult books of the past 100 years. The book is divided into several basic sections. First are the knowledge lectures, where you will learn the basics of the Kabalah, symbolism, meditation, geomancy and more. This is followed by the rituals of the Outer Order, consisting of five initiation rituals into the degrees of the Golden Dawn. The next section covers the rituals of the Inner Order including two initiation rituals, equinox ceremonies, and more. Then you will learn the basic rituals of magic and the construction, consecration, and means of using the magical tools. Once you have these you can go on to evocation rituals, talismans, and invocations. The book gives explanations for how to design talismans, do skrying and travel on the astral plane. You will also learn geomancy, the Tarot, and Enochian magic. Filled with numerous illustrations, lists, and tables, The Golden Dawn provides guidance for a lifetime of magic and life-changing transformation.   
First published in 1937, Israel Regardie’s The Golden Dawn has become the most influential modern handbook of magical theory and practice. In this new, definitive edition, noted scholar John Michael Greer has taken this essential resource back to its original, authentic form. With added illustrations, a twenty-page color insert, additional original material, and refreshed design and typography, this powerful work returns to its true stature as a modern masterpiece.

An essential textbook for students of the occult, The Golden Dawn includes occult symbolism and Qabalistic philosophy, training methods for developing magical and clairvoyant powers, rituals that summon and banish spiritual potencies, secrets of making and consecrating magical tools, and much more.

###[Francis Barrett - The Magus](http://docdro.id/OwjwRdh)  
An excellent work which encompasses much of the occult lore to have emerged over the preceding centuries, The Magus unites and presents occultist and alchemical wisdom in an organized and exhaustive manner. Francis Barrett designed this book to guide and imbue aspiring practitioners of the occult arts with a working knowledge of the rituals and materials required.

Commencing with Magic, we are offered a comprehensive accounts of its capabilities and the tools needed for its use. Natural magic is defined, as are the many philters and potions which may be created and imbued with its essence. Various historical examples of magicians who had, for good or ill, gained public notice for their practices are given. The later chapters meanwhile concern the properties of magical stones such as the legendary Philosophers Stone, and the arcane arts of combining creatures of nature, and the sometimes monstrous results.

The Magus itself is termed the Celestial Intelligencer; beginning with a basic account of the four elements, we traverse each in more detail before delving into the more esoteric practices. The symbolism of numbers and of the astronomical bodies of the heavens are detailed, sometimes with the help of charts.

The second book offers an occultist account of the Magnetism - distinct from the magnetism of physics, the occult magnetism is instead defined by an attraction of two or more people to one another. The various potions, incantations and other practices used to draw people together (or apart) are listed, with some consideration given to witchcraft.

The second book's later portions concern 'ceremonial magic', whereby practitioners may call upon spirits for insight or other purposes. Much of the book is concerned with the traits necessary of the magician, and the preparatory environs necessary to summon such spirits. Illustrations of these beings, who are various in appearance, are appended to these pages.


Working in the occult for most of his life, Francis Barrett ambitiously aimed to collect, translate and arrange the occult books of the previous centuries. He hoped that occultism would regain great popularity, much as it had enjoyed in the past, and offered lessons and tutoring in the practices from his apartment in London. Although The Magus escaped recognition and faded to obscurity, it later came to the attention of French magician Eliphas Levi, who brought it to renewed prominence decades after its author perished.

###[David Allen Hulse - Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages & Magickal Systems of the World](http://libgen.io/get.php?md5=2DEC6109DFE01B8FA71396D6F50A8CDB&key=8ZJ4TQTUCKWFMY97)  
In scope and clarity, there is no book that can compare to The Eastern Mysteries. This reissue of David Allen Hulse’s landmark work is the one book all students of the occult must own. It catalogs and distills, in hundreds of tables of secret symbolism, the true import of each ancient Eastern magickal tradition. Each chapter is a key that unlocks the meaning behind one of the magickal languages. Through painstaking research and analysis, Hulse has accomplished an unprecedented feat―that of reconstructing the basic underlying systems that form the vast legacy of mystery traditions.

The real genius of this accomplishment is that it is presented in a way that is immediately understandable and usable. Although the book deals with many foreign scripts, ancient tongues, and lost symbols, it is designed for the beginning student. Included is a wealth of cross-references, excellent introductory material and overviews, an extensive annotated bibliography, and―new to this edition―a complete index.

###David Allen Hulse - The Western Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages & Magickal Systems of the World - The Key of It All, Book 2  
##(Desperately need this PDF, can you help me?)   

The Western Mysteries (previously published as The Key of It All, Book II: The Western Mysteries), by David Allen Hulse, is perhaps the most comprehensive, in-depth description of various aspects of the Western magickal tradition ever published.

The uniting factor of this book is language. It begins with a discussion of the mysteries of the Greek alphabet, followed by the different forms of the Runes, and goes on to describe the mystical secrets of Latin. and then Enochian, where you will discover, for the first time ever, the correctly constructed Watchtower system.

The book also includes the mysteries of the Tarot, a pictorial language, and it describes the development of the esoteric Tarot, how to do readings, and the significance of the symbolism on the Tarot cards. It concludes with the English language and its relationship to the Tarot, Enochian, and more.

The introduction to The Western Mysteries serves as a complete introduction to the magickal tradition of the West. You will learn about the evolution of thought concerning the Elements, astrology, magick squares, geomancy, words of power, and more.

You will find that each section of this book is a key that unlocks the meaning behind another of the magickal languages that you can relate to your own spiritual system. It is ideal for a beginning student to explore the mysteries of Western magick. It is a necessary tool for more advanced students, as it has collected hundreds of charts and lists which clarify and identify the similarities and differences between various systems.

This is a reference book you will study over and over. The volume of information revealed makes The Western Mysteries an instant classic and a necessity for any spiritual practitioner.


###[A.E. Waite - The Book of Ceremonial Magic: Including the Rites and Mysteries of Goetic Theurgy, Sorcery, and Infernal Necromancy](http://libgen.io/get.php?md5=88C4738FF4FD3D0BF1708122B39510F5&key=UQKYDJNSJFIL0ZFD)  
2011 Reprint of 1911 Edition. Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942) was a scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult and esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. As his biographer, R.A. Gilbert described him, "Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western occultism - viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion." "The Book of Ceremonial Magic" is the second edition of a work which in its first edition was titled, more provocatively, "The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts." It is an attempt to synthesize the procedures of all of the famous Grimoires. It draws on the "Key of Solomon", the "Grimorium Verum", the apocryphal Fourth Book of Cornelius Agrippa, and many others, including the famous "Black Pullet", or "Poulet Noir". The result is an unparalleled look at the details of ceremonial magic.

###[Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki - The Ritual Magic Workbook: A Practical Course of Self-Initiation](http://docdro.id/DpdZf7R)  
This is a carefully conceived course of instruction for anyone who wants to practice ceremonial magic, and has been written for students who are not part of a working group. Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki takes the student, month-by-month, through a full year of magical training. She imparts her years of hard-earned experience in the clear, accessible, and often humorous style for which she is internationally known. Each month's work is concluded with practical exercises designed to give the student a sound working knowledge of ritual magic. Among the many topics covered are: Constructing and consecrating a temple Meditation and visualization techniques Working in an elemental temple Exploring the Inner World Pathworking the Tree of LifeThe traditional wedding is a powerful and complex magical ceremony, with many Actors and Props. Possibly the most significant of the wedding symbols is the engagement ring

Although they take myriad forms and variations, the classic engagement ring is one or more diamond stones set into a ring of gold metal

[The Ring]

The golden ring has been a solar symbol since time immemorial. Gold is the metal and color magicians have associated with the sun for millennia. This was not guesswork on the part of the ancients; modern spectrograph analysis shows that gold metal absorbs more of the Sun's light radiation than any other element. Literally, gold is the color of the Sun

Gold was historically shaped into disks and rings to represent the shape, the circle, of the Sun. This is also the origin of gold coins

[The Stone]

Every stone has a life, like a person. Some contribute to the world, holding up a bridge or building or whatever. Some rocks go bad, and fall on your head and kill you. And some rocks become *perfect.* 

Carbon is the humblest of rocks, the simplest. Yet, only it can survive the process required to become diamond. Where other stones would crumble or split under the most immense pressure, carbon rock reduces itself, compressing itself. Until it achieves a form that cannot be shattered 

[Engagement]

As the Ultimate Stone, diamond represents the Earth. Set into the ring, it represents the Earth on its golden orbit around the Sun

And what is gravity, if not the Love between the Sun and the Earth?I’m very interested in hearing affirming uses of magick. 
Tell me the story, why you did it, what you did and what was the result that you could only attribute to your practice.Here is a very quick and easy protection spell I've come to learn through meditation. to set up a quick astral tower, first meditate and imagine a tall, brick wall surrounding you (in a circle). feel the cold stone as you build the tower, with heavy stone bricks. You can feel the sweat drip off you under the heavy sun, as you glue one brick otop another. keep building and building, up and up towards the sky until you cant anymore. once you do thins, you should feel an intense buzzing feeling inside your skull. once that happens, you will have successfully completed the spell! for better effect, cry out "no spirits may touch me, by the strength of my wal!" after completing the ritual. So far it has worked very well when I contact spirits, and not once has a stray entity interrupted my meeting with a spirit once i set up the tower. it has also kept me safe on ghost hunts thus far, so I'm pretty confident in it working for you too.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TfaRzfcB0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TfaRzfcB0)

i think this is the first time im seeing ghost hunters learning genuine occult knowledge to get better at what they do. i see all these other ghost hunters who go in haunted places half assed with no protection or other preliminaries and wonder why they dont get any activity or worse, come home with an evil spirit. regardless of whether you believe or not in this line of work, i think its fascinating.I work with weather magic. I have been practicing for a couple of years. I keep on being visited by this entity it looks like a black furry mass with a cow skull for a head. It just sits there and stares and does nothing. I don't think it is evil. I have tried to communicate with it and I haven't got any answers from the entity. I have cleansed my self many times but it is still there. It also sorta follows me but I do not sense it in my soul as an attachment. I tried to find the name of the entity  no luck on that yet. No I am not crazy and do not suffer from any form of mental illness. My question is has anyone experienced something similar to this and how to deal with it?So one of my godkids is being tormented by something similar to the "tall man" or "walking sam". He gets through standard wards and protection work. Anybody got any ideas on how to keep him at bay? She recently woke up covered in bruises and scratches and its getting worse. Im running out of ideas.I got obsidian recently and some earrings of a black gemstone (idk what exactly it is yet) and I use them to deflect negativity, but when I’m using them I get tired like my heart rate begins to rise and I start breathing slightly heavier, not like winded after a run tho, I also do this thing where I like imagine lightning coming off my fingers and it makes them all tingly it’s cool but it also takes more energy than I had originally thoughtNow I’m not saying said weapons are as destructive as the myths make them out to be. Take Excalibur and it’s scabbard. If you were to wield Excalibur you wouldn’t lose a single battle. If you had Excalibur’s scabbard you wouldn’t die no matter how serious your injuries were. Could such spells have existed and been placed on such objects? I have no intention of learning such spells but I am curious as to if they existed or still do exist. Wouldn’t it be cool if some of these famous mythological weapons had some truth to them?I have only practices 1 spell for abundance, I was curious and wanted to see if these could be something I could work this. When I was doing the ritual I was in an extremely calm and meditative state. This translated to me more as a manifestation ritual, the candles and herbs being offerings to the spirits to help assist in what I am manifesting. The spell did now show in the 3D until I completed dropped the desire I had for what I was hoping for, this was something I thought I note.Can magick be described and replicated with universal laws following scientific method, being a natural part of the physical psyche? Or does it go beyond to an unexplainable phenomenon.Hi all, Im looking for information. The Garden of Pomegranates is a great book, but the method of projection in the book lacks detail. I project semi regularly and it only matches the description with the cyan hue they describe. Im wondering, when in astral, are the sephiroth achievable via vibration increase? Ive used vibration increase to make things brighter and more accessible. Ive never seen angels(maybe I was unaware) but I would really like t start to ascend the tree.So I have been practicing the craft for almost four years now and have done plenty of divination spells/rituals and nothing like this happened before and I am looking for answers!

I had found a spell in an online grimoire that supposedly would help reveal any obvious truths or signs I was missing in my love life.

I had mixed sea salt and moon water together in an alter dish with quartz and amethyst crystals. I lit candles around it and prayed to my goddess. While praying I remember the world going blank and in the darkness a being of light appeared to me and disappeared in a flash that left a sigil behind. Eventually I returned to reality. Things like this have happened before but the strange part occurred the following morning. I awoke and the crystals were covered in a white powder and all of the water was gone!

I am curious if anyone on here has answers for me as to what happened to me and my alter. Any experiences or answers would be much appreciated!Hey guys, I don't know if anyone really cares but I thought I would share how I make my sigils work. I know everybody has their own way but I figured this might help someone or maybe offer some food for thought. I've only cast four sigils, and all of them have worked and one was for quite an improbable thing.

I write my intention as a declaration. For example "I found a quarter". 

I write the statement down and cancel out vowels and repeating letters and draw a sigil with the remaining letters. I conjure up the emotion I will feel as my desire comes true as I draw my sigil. If able I will also incorporate symbols representing my desire into the sigil, like a heart for love or a caduceus for health.

I take the leftover letters, the ones that weren't cancelled out and arrange them with some vowels to create a nonsense magical statement.

I take a fresh piece of paper and draw my sigil and magical statement real carefully and pretty. I put time and patience and work into this part.

Sometimes I will masturbate and stare at the sigil and say my magical phrase during orgasm. Sometimes I will meditate and envision my sigil glowing and bright with light as I say my magical phrase over and over and vibrating the sounds.

After I am done I force myself to laugh at how silly all this is. I rubbed one at a picture. I chanted gibberish foolishly and soon I will be rich? Come on.

I burn my paper with the sigil and go about my week not thinking too much about the ritual and trying to make my will become reality through honest muggle ways if possible.

So yeah.....I hope this helps at least one person. I would be happy to hear any variations you guys have that work for you.https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/placebo-can-work-even-know-placebo-201607079926

This placebo thing is similar to alan chapman s magick instructions.I'm running low on options and it's the end of the month, I'm not trying to use magic to become rich I just don't want to lose my security deposit as it's the end of my lease. I've tried manifesting and whatnot, but it seems like the opposite of whatever I want happens. :\\ Tried prayers, which I feel like is basically the same thing but it's not working. What sometimes happens is that I'll get what I need once I've been pushed to the absolute absolute edge, but I'm tired of that and honestly, it just feels super sadistic for the universe/God/whatever is it to do that to someone.

I want to try the method of writing in ink to I guess materialize what I want, I'm just worried about someone getting hurt, etc.Hey, I was wondering how people celebrate Yule

Do you do different rituals for all the twelve days? The same ritual? One ritual at the start and one at the end and just kinda have Yule vibes in the middle? How does it work? What rituals do you do (if you want to tell)?Does anyone know a safe spell I could use to bind someone from harming others and/or themselves? My friends dad has been raising them as an abusive alcoholic and not just harms them, but his wife too (the mom) and has committed adultery multiple times and carelessly leaves the evidence lying around the house. In addition to that, he quit his job and always leeches off of his employed kids and never pays them back when it’s almost their entire salary that he took from them. 

I don’t want a jinx, curse, or hex or anything like that. I just want to stop him from doing harm. Is there any spell to help with that?



UPDATE!!!!!

I did a simple spell where I had a picture of him and wrapped string around it facing away from me and literally just repeated “by the power of 3x3, I bind you from doing harm onto yourself and to others. So mote it be.” And then made my friend put his name in the freezer and this guy just disappeared. Literally just up and left. 

Literally a DAY later, my friend told me that his dad just took all of his stuff and left the house and like no one knows where he is or where he’s going. 

Idk if this could lead up to something with karma or something idk but uhmmmm YeppI just had a dream last night where I was running away from my abuser after they had found where I live. I was home alone when he climbed past the barricade to our porch and started breaking the sliding glass door. I bolted and headed towards a park nearby with a few open fields. The grass was long and overgrown so I hid in it. I stayed perfectly still, than watched a few butterflies of different colors land on my arms, specifically on the scars (from self harm and my abuser) until every scar had a butterfly on it. Then they started eating the scars. It tickled and hurt but I endured the hurt because it felt like a necessary hurt I had to feel. Like the pain of trauma processing, it hurts, but it's a necessary hurt for recovery. As they ate away my scars a ton of them bombarded my abuser and started eating him alive. They ate so quickly, savagely and viciously, they turned him into a skeleton. After he died cursing my name, the butterflies left my arm with the other swarm. They left my arms with some new wounds but the scars were significantly faded. I stroked my arm and none of the scars were raised as they are in real life. They were barely noticeable, when they're one of the first things people notice in real life.

I can't find any interpretations of butterflies eating scars specifically and I feel this dream has some deeper meaning. Any ideas?Recently, a student on my college campus passed from a su\*cide attempt. I'd like to stop by where the candlelight vigil was held and say a prayer and do something to help my peer pass on to the next life peacefully. Any advice is appreciatedFirst off I want to say hi, and, I just joined the sub. While my foray into magick has been only recent in 2021, it came into my life unexpectedly. I was headed back home from Denver a few years ago and my Uber driver was chatty in a good way. He mentioned the Kybalion to me. I proceeded to listen to it on the plane ride home and immediately found it fascinating how such old principles work exceedingly well with science's best models of physics, but not much beyond that.

Little did I know back then the deeper meaning of the book. This year I grabbed a hard copy and actually read the Kybalion (some during a psylocibin come-down). Then, High Magic by Damien Echols. Then a few other grimoires. Things are snapping in place mentally that I didn't think ever would. An over arching theme of many of these books is trusting in your intuition, imagination, and connection to all things. It's really beautiful.

I've never felt so empowered and it's easy to see why religions and governments have worked in tandem to discourage esoteric teachings. It defeats their overall purpose of control.

All things aside, I am happy to be posting here today and look forward to constructive and friendly talks about this next level of things. I thank you for reading and thank the universe for bringing me this knowledge of which now I feel like a vacuum cleaner too.

What are your thoughts on trusting this process?Hey everyone. It’s common to see posts on different occult-related subs regarding certain omens and their meaning. Sometimes people will say it’s nothing, sometimes it can be interpreted a certain way. I personally think this shouldn’t happen because any answer you’ll get won’t be your interpretation, it’ll be another users take on it.
That being said, some open ended questions to prompt discussion:

What do you think an omen is? How would you define it?

In your opinion, What constitutes an omen?

How do you personally go about interpreting them? Do you use a centralized source of information or do you meditate on it and look inward?

Are omens an infallible predictor of the future or are they warnings of a future that can be changed?Hi All

I’ll tell you my story so you can ask me some questions if you like.

I was studying medicine in college and realised that there was nothing known about consciousness so I focused my life on understanding it and transitioned to a life of Noetic Science.

One of the studies I did on myself was tuning myself to pure love to study love itself. I did this by listening to songs with a high frequency of the word love in them on repeat for 5 years. Amazing things happened up to a Miricle level of reality being effected and I was able to control reality to an extent almost at will. It would do what I say and Magick became a medium as opposed to weak force. 

I even ended up marrying someone after with the last name AMORim so I have Amor in my family name now. (It’s a last name I had never heard before I met her as she is foreign to my country.)

I have also worked with ex CIA Stargate people as my psi abilities got so strong. For example I warned governments of a mass event about to kill many people in cities around the world just before COVID happened. I warned the government that protests were about to occur and reach massive scales just before the BLM protests last year. Just before 4 people shot up the Pakistan stock exchange I warned government agencies that 4 terrorists were about to attack an economic target.

So ask me almost anything, I’ve been told by an ex CIA Stargate consultant that what I’m doing is Magick!These would be ideal for making a wand out of, so the branches natural pentagram is exposed at the hilt. [My post on paganism with photos. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/nqwdpm/cottonwood_tree_branches_have_pentagrams_within/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

[Indigenous beliefs, worship and origion story for how the cottonwood tree possesses a natural pentagram.](https://treespiritwisdom.com/tree-spirit-wisdom/cottonwood/)

Has anyone else known this? Or made a wand out of a cottonwood branch?I'm going to post a fuller review of this excellent publication, *Necromancy in the Medici Library* but for now I'd like to share some superb snippits that are absent in the Goetia but this text provides. Specifically, towards the back of this book is a spirit register like that of the Goetia with many familiar names like Astaroth (spelled Ascaroth in this text), Belial, Gomeris (Gremory) and so on. However there are many new names in this book as well like Torcha or Ras.

Probably the most significant portion details additional timing constraints for evoking the spirits. I'll provide an excerpt:

"Dukes cannot be bound except in the seventh, ninth, and thirteenth hours: thus if in the first instance they do not come, they will come in another..."

Also,

"Therefore the exorcist must know the days and hours of the week and take note of the invocations of all the kings; and this is so as much of the kings as the demons bound under them, that in the first hour they are drowsy, for either before or after it will be in vain to labor: for as much as anyone else, experimenters are apt to wish to arrive at their goal easily and without exertion but the demons will delay as much as they can before coming to the exorcist."

Here it makes it exquisitely clear that the hours to bind these spirits are the times they are most weak and tired. But if we foolish try another hour or time, they may be at full strength. Also, it shows clearly that demons will resist tooth and nail. Therefore, use the hours wisely and get them while they're weak and off guard. This is different from an idea I and many others have assumed which is that the hours make it easier for the spirit - it's the same result either way so I don't think it's too critical.

I can't recommend this book highly enough. There's excellent love spells in here along with new spirit names and specific astrological and planetary hours to abide by with specific spirits like Astaroth.

You can find the text on amazon: Necromancy in the Medici Library by Brian Johnson, if you're interested.What does karma even mean in your own words? One could say some interpretations of karma have no correlation to magickal practice, in another perspective it could be a valid consideration.

There seems to be different ideas and modern definitions of what karma is. Explain your thoughts/feelings on this subject.Yes or no and can you add your reasoning with it?

I of course have my own opinion on the topic but do not wish to say it should I sway people's opinions or make them feel uncomfortable disagreeing with me. Third eye visualization outside of gnosis starts small that you might not have paid them any attention to. for most, it's stats as a little blue dot of light (commonly called the blue pearl) that at first appears seemingly at random (though doing third eye meditation greatly increases said appearances). the key is to focus on this dot when it appears and to try to keep it going for as long as possible over time you'll be able to "call" the Pearl by reflex just as you can for gnosis or soul resonance. it will slowly expand in size and complexity, eventually mirroring third eye visuals usually reserved for deep gnosis. this process can take many years but should be at the top of your esoteric "to do" list. once Mastered you'll be able to see astral visualizations (including spirits) effortlessly in real time without the aid of tools or meditation. It's a hard-won uphill battle but one that's worth fight for.I hope you all have had blessed holidays.

I did a guided meditation to find my magickal name. I was brought to a place where my name would be revealed, and I received two names: S- and I-. I- was more of a whisper compared to S-, but it was there. Is it normal to have two different names? What's the significance?I did a honey jar spell on Monday to strengthen our intimacy , and reduce  unnecessary arguments. Things turned 180 the same evening , we even were intimate after a long drought. Yesterday though my hubby overreacted about something very small and we argued most of the evening . Exactly what I wanted to prevent via the spell. Obviously arguments will always arise especially when your married and living together in lockdown  (lol) . So I wondered Mmmh... the spell worked but lasted  for 72 hours? 

But this morning my husband apologised very quickly and suggested to cook something nice later. Mmh  so the spell is probably still having its effect ? 

I don't know. Maybe it's all paranoia , coincidence ? 

What do you guys think. How long can the effects of the spell  last usually ? 




My question to youI'm sure this has happened to many practitioners but I have always struggled with it and just wanted some advice. I was raised a Christian but became a practitioner of Magick around the age of 25 or 26. My gateway practice was the Tarot, I've been reading the cards since I was 16. I've always had strange things happen around me, and I've always been very spiritual. As I began to practice my now ex husband accepted that I was starting my magickal path but that was about it. As I became more adept he began to make fun of me and discount what I was doing. I was very private about how I practiced so I wouldn't offend anyone, we had two small girls at the time. We eventually divorced, and now my youngest daughter who is now 14 is showing and interest in practicing magick and learning the Tarot. My mom is a staunch Christian and knows I practice, and I respect her beliefs but she, of course, discounts mine. I have a couple of friends who know I'm a witch and I have made satchels and done cleansings for one of them. I recently did a manifest spell for another friend. But I have to say that I'm not sure any of them take me seriously or think I am capable of helping them or of making change in the world. I successfully banished a negative person from one of my friends lives because they asked for my help. Even though I do successfully do these things like protections and blessings it still feels like people think I'm a joke and a fake. My ex husband verbally and emotionally abused me and once in a while got rough with me physically, over 17 years. Magick helped me cope, connecting with my deities and such. I struggle with confidence and belief in myself sometimes and when people make a joke out of how I believe or tell me its wrong it hurts. I try to stay strong and carry on, but I do carry deep emotional trauma for lots of reasons and it sometimes gets the better of me. I was just wondering how others cope and if anyone had any advice or anything I could learn from. I realize witches and magickal people have been ridiculed for centuries but when it happens to yourself its difficult to handle. Sorry for the long drawn out post. I appreciate anything you can tell me that would help. Thank you to all my Magickal brothers and sisters out there.He made this pact with him like 2 years ago, he asked to help him succeed in music, he is now basically lost everything, his family doesnt have money anymore, he pawned most of his material belongings, spiralled into hard weed addiction, always tells me how he has those bizzare nightmares where daemons are trying to tell him something. Always feels the presence of KP, sometimes he feels like he is going crazy, he has alot of visions, he believes in all of this very deeply, takes every thought that might be KP speaking to him very seriously, and i seriously think he is going insane.. not saying this to shame magick or anything i just need advice on how to help him. He cries alot, has unmanagable anger, says he feels deep emptyness, sadness, darkness, also apperantly KP told him secrets that he said that he cant tell no one or he’ll die. Im very concerned on how to help him, im not trying to make him quit magick or anything i just want his life to be a lil easier... any tips, or experiences or explanations?I saw someone ask for ideas on what they could try materializing. Folks recommended a Two Dollar bill. I thought it was a good idea. I took the idea, shoved it in the back of my mind and… was gifted two such bills the following week. I feel like I owe y’all redditors four bucks!So I know that historically magicians would summon spirits from the astral and make pacts for some end result. If astral beings have their own lives then what incentive do they have to serve beings in the physical?Inspired by another post, I'm curious what the community at large thinks of the obvious skepticism of magic and its validity and your response to that skepticism, both in interaction with those skeptical and in your own work and approach to it.

 We live in a modern, materialist and scientific age, and you would have to be the vehement of dogmatist or aloof to a level I can't fathom to not have some skepticism yourself or at least enough awareness to understand why the vast majority of people would be. Do you have a particular model that you feel is compatible with most contemporary scientific theories of reality, such as the many psychological and pragmatist explainations of magic? Are you against scientific rationalism and its adherents? Would you describe yourself as religious or having a "faith" in magic? Do you justify your practice by your lived experience of it? Do you have some other philosophical elucidation of it in response to its criticism? What are your responses to those critical of your practice?

Bonus points for also giving me a good recipe for modak, cause its Ganesha Chaturthi and every year I try a new one cause I've yet to be satisfied with any of the ones I've made.This may be a bit specific, but I wanted to know if there was a spell or working that could help me better retain information like names, faces, and dates. 

I've always been really bad at history, I don't know why it goes in one ear and out the other. Also terrible at remembering people's names and connecting names to faces. Sometimes I forget faces idk.

Outside of this I'm great at remembering things that people said. I'm a recorder with a playback button when it comes to this. I'm good at languages and cultural learning...its just when it comes to names, dates, and faces....I really struggle. 

So here I am on reddit asking the magick community if there is some working that I can do to help.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.Sorry I don't know what it's called. [This is what it looks like.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F3%2F3d%2FCuneiform_sumer_dingir.svg%2F2000px-Cuneiform_sumer_dingir.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1) Damien Echols showed how to draw it but it didn't make sense to me, and im not sure if he reversed it so it looks right for the camera. Also what would the invoking & banishing version look like?So i have been reading book name "demons of magick"  and they are using angels to constrain demons and I have heard from some people if you use angels to constrain demons. Demons don't like it and might mess up your lifeHey, all. Sorry if the topic isn't accurate, that's just what my roommate calls.. well a non physical body. Anyway, to get to the point, It's been a very stressful last few weeks. I'm not 100% happy with how I've handled it, but I'm very proud of myself for my effort to take it well, and still smile. 

Now, after all this, I was standing on the porch, trying to do some breathing exercises and relax while getting some sun, air, and general nice natureness. There was a talisman that I'd made that was close by that I was kind of focusing on, and I was also kind of focusing on my roommates who are also going through big stress. Then..  I.. felt what I can only describe as.. wings? They stretched out from my back, and spread out, and once they reached what felt like their wingspan.. I stopped feeling them.

That experience only lasted a few seconds, but it felt very vivid. Any ideas on what that could be/mean? If anyone has any clarifying questions, I'd be happy to elaborate, but that is the gist. Anywho, thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you!Hey Reddit!

I’ve been performing LBRP as my daily practice for 48 days until when I started noticing subtle changes in psyche. As a person high in neuroticism I am starting to react less not be bothered by some of the things that used to bother me before. I’ve come to a point where naturally, almost automatically my mind is filtering every thought popping into my mind, analyzes it, finds it’s origin then it accepts or banishes it. I’ve also become more disciplined.

That is what I started noticing in the last week of my daily practice after days of perplexity and questioning the effectiveness of the ritual; very satisfied with the results which i consider them in my own words as “newbie gains”.

However, for the last 4 days I was gone away from my temple on a short holiday. The place where I stayed wasn’t fit for my ritual practice(small sized apartment) and I wasn’t alone. 

The first night i tried performing the LBRP in the corner of the bedroom. I had to whisper the god name mantras and the cardinal points orientation wasn’t advantageous for the ritual. The other day I realised what I performed that night was neither as strong or correct way of doing it as I struggled to trace the pentagrams without touching walls, the circle was too small that my hands outstripped past what i drew, even feeling it physically as I was touching the pentagrams and the skin on my hands felt electrified( just like the way you feel when you run your hands near an old tv screen), **so I stopped practicing it** until i got back home today.

After the holiday I feel as I never started practicing magick. My anger is back, as well as my negative thoughts about people and the world in general. I am very easily triggered, my superiority complexes are back, i feel spiteful to people and I am wondering just how could i’ve been living like that before, because it is quite maddening.

My main concern and the reason why I’m writing this post is: Will I have to do it all over again from the very beginning to get back where I was or will I recover fast? I am thinking of upgrading the practice by doing it twice a day at least for the next 7 days. Is it necessary? Have you ever been in my situation before and what do you think?


TLDR: I’ve been practicing magick for a short amount of time, noticed some changes in good, got a short break of 3 days and now I’m back just as before. What should I expect. What should I do?Apart from the colour of their robes I have no idea what the angels should look like. I've been visualizing robe colour with an idea of the unseen angel in mind. 

But what do other people do?Hi,

i put this little PowerShell script together to help us out with sigil construction. when you execute the script, it asks you to complete the 'it is my will...' statement. the script then removes the punctuation, vowels, and repeating consonants from the full statement for you.

what you're left with is the remaining consonants, which you can then use to design your sigil. the script lines are below for transparency, and so you can copy it and modify it however you wish.

    }So, I kinda want some ideas or how I should do it. I can't do anything too much since my family won't like it but I want to be able to grieve and kinda remember my baby I lost this month. I got candles small ones of different colors  and some herbs somewhere in my car and also some crystals. I also kinda want to paint something for her as well. 
I'm not sure what to do. I want to make it really nice and welcoming too for her and also able to just grieve and feel some peace too. I haven't been able to start grieving really and it's worse because I gotta do it alone again. Then next month too for my second one I lost on the 27th and I want to make it special for him too. Thanks guys 💔💙💓🤍💜🖤TL;DR Try using an eye mask that lets you freely open your eyes. Acclimate to sitting with open eyes in the dark. Move hand about in front of face while trying to see it; motivates mind to visualize.
———

I use an eye mask for some kinds of meditation, relaxation, and polyvagal stuff. I got one a bit ago that lets me comfortably have my eyes open with it on (so nothing is touching my eye lids or anything).

I noticed that with the mask on, it still felt different to have my eyes open vs. closed while experiencing darkness. Today after a meditation session using the mask, I kept laying there with the mask on, eyes open, for a while. After trying to do some visualizations for a bit, on a whim I decided to wave my hand in front of my face to see if the mask really blocked out all light. My conclusion was that the mask does block out essentially all light, but that my mind was quite eager to help me visualize my limb in space before me. Makes sense since our sub/unconscious is keeping track of our body most of the time anyway to keep us safe.

After that I had some more success with visualizations by staying focused on my pointing hand. (So, if I want to visualize a red bicycle, I get my visual attention tracking my pointing hand and then point at where I want to see the red bicycle). I suppose it would work in a completely dark room as well but an eye mask is a lot smaller, lol.

Just thought I’d share, and would love to hear if anybody has tried this before or tries it out after reading this.Hi guys! Just wanted to see if you guys knew of a protection I can cast for my partner, just to make her day easier and happier when I’m not around. I’ve been with her for 5 years and she’s a real star. So if you guys have any sources you could refer me to or any links please feel free to let me know 🙂💙May the Light shine upon youHello guys, this is a topic that I have dwelled upon for quite some time, and still, I am unsure of my stance towards this whole subject.

As you all do, I delve into the occult, and I am constantly trying to improve my character through the control of my emotions & temper, increase my concentration via daily meditation exercises solemnly focused on that purpose, and overall, trying to be more in control with my wants/needs as a result; such dedication & self-control is needed in order to build optimal concentration parameters when working with otherworldly beings and systems. This much has been made clear to me. without control over oneself, disaster awaits.

Now back to my questions (lol, sorry, but the topic above is related), I've briefly visited the r/Semenretention & r/NoFap communities, and while I do see their views as quiet extreme ends of the spectrum (especially when they go so far towards demonizing women and saying celibacy is the way), I can't help but notice some correlations (even if small at that) between some individuals that pertain in nofap and simultaneously experience some type of spiritual awakening or experience-- especially regarding a kundalini awakening; r/kundalini has some posts regarding this subject relating it to its dangers in spontaneous awakenings upon the unprepared practicing nofap, in which it  \*could\* be a factor upon many.

I've stumbled upon some comments by some other Redditors here and there, and they state how, if one does not masturbate from time to time, sexual energy could build up in an individual to an extreme rate. If such energy isn't either 1) released via a sexual manner or 2) \*redirected\* in some type of way, it could chaos havoc upon the individual; In the form of emotional distress, dissociation, and psychotic and or uncomfortable spiritual experiences. How true this is, I am not sure as I am basing my reasoning on posts, comments, and articles online that I don't really deem that reliable, but I thought it is worth to at least listen due to my next coming point.

Allegedly, the great inventors of our era, like steve jobs, Nikola Tesla, and others not limited to several monks of the eastern practices, Indeed practiced some form of semen retention here and there. could this relate to their success? Again, not really sure, I think that it's a combination of different factors.

I am kind of just ranting at this point, but I am just not sure what stance to take. I would do no fap only for a week or 2 per month, but I did in fact experience a slight kundalini activity a couple of months ago and would like to avoid such an experience at all costs; but then again, maybe it was due to other factors.

What do you guys think? Is there some kind of relationship with your experiences in the occult that seemed directly enhanced/subdued due to abstaining/partaking with masturbation?

I am leaning towards maybe a moderate use of sexual release is ideal, instead of going so far as to limiting sexual relationships with others and not jerking off \*ever\* because that is the way.

Also, how would one be able to redirect sexual energy as to not let it build up and let it be more practical, per sei?

appreciate the time to read and do thank you all in advance.

Kind regards & best wishes.For anyone doubting magic or unsure if it works after casting a spell, maybe you should double check yourself. I was almost too blind to see the magic I cast actually came true a few days ago!

For about 2 months I have been job searching and applying everywhere. I believe a lot of magic is psychological, so I would incorporate magic into my search and visualize myself performing at work and feeling the gladness i would have from being able to work and make some money. Just recently I had decided to pray to archangel Auriel during the LBRP and make a real connection to the Earth element, and combine my psychological magic from previous into my working with Auriel.

I finally got a job 2 days ago, 2 weeks after my initial connection to Auriel. Im so glad to finally have it, but what really surprised me is that it took so long to hit me that I now have what I had been manifesting for months, that my magick worked! I need to make sure to thank archangel Auriel, to him I am very grateful.

A tip to myself and anyone else who’s had this problem, maybe make it a habit to ask myself after casting a spell for something every night: “Did I receive what I had been praying for/ manifesting/casting a spell for?”
Or in other words put your magick in perspective, take a step back and think about it.

If this has happened to you, please share!

Much love, DAnything from India, China, Japan, or really anywhere that isn't Europe or West Asia. Books on magic would be ideal but I'm into really anything esoteric or occult such as divination, mysticism, astrology. Really anything.Hello, I’m relatively new to the practice and ideas and I’m exploring my different routes and types of magick. Coming from a beginners perspective, theres things I don’t fully understand and grasp about energies and spirituality.


My brother passed away of cancer when I was in highschool. It was a very broken time for my family and I, and to this day I have a hard time conceptualizing death and the ideas of spirituality and the afterlife. I feel like I’m drawn to try and find answers that I know I may never get till I die myself, and even at that I don’t believe that the inner workings of all and the universe is revealed to us when we die. I don’t know what to make of many things and I surrender to the idea of not knowing, and that it’s okay not to know.


But, his birthday is this month. I still feel like I never really grieved properly. He always comes up on my mind this time of year but I feel very strongly in tune with my energy right now, and I feel compelled to connect with him somehow, if that’s even a possibility. 


I never truly know what to think, since I am very much a baby in magick and energy work, and haven’t even really settled or understood the kind of magick that fits best with me, or how different energies exist and present themselves to others. I’m always looking for more advice, comments, discussion and thought. Maybe I sound ignorant, but I am learning and trying to expand my knowledge, which tends to be difficult when you still have to operate in a normal day to day. 


Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from all. 


Blessed be.Hi everyone! I have a question about overcoming initial anxiety about communicating with ancestors in dreams. 

A bit of background: New to magick, ancestors, and/or shamanic experiences. On this past Friday (3/26), I had an experience with power plants involving strong Earth goddess and divine feminine energy, including some very sexually charged creative and fertility energy. This was one of the first times I had ever had an experience with something that seemed real involving inorganic beings or presences (the other being more loving kindness power plant meditation). 

After my experience, I consulted the I Ching and was given some clarity about my role as a "conduit" (very specific syntax from the I Ching), and I spoke yesterday with a tarot and magick practitioner who advised me to consult my ancestors with intent and to notice any omens or signs. 

Yesterday evening, I set intentions during my evening shower, noticed some signs in the form of moths and spiders, and journaled my intentions, consulted the I Ching again, and placed a glass of water under my bed per the advice of the tarot practitioner. I was assured that my ancestors would always protect me and guide me. 

However, my anxiety at trying to bring them into my room and dreams and blur the line between the organic and inorganic worlds really made me scared. My cat could definitely sense some energy in the room which didn't set my mind at ease. At times I could feel myself drifting off to sleep and I could feel a sensation on the top of my head and the bottoms of my feet tingling with energy (something I am familiar with from using power plants). I also would occasionally have thoughts/dreams of a spinning stone wheel carved with symbols that I couldn't quite make out. 

I found my fear prevented me from truly submitting into a dream space. It seemed like I was inviting death and it truly terrified me. Even the I Ching guidance I received yesterday was about submitting to fate and to be courageous, but I simply couldn't let my guard down. Any advice on how to overcome this fear? Or any ways to set intentions that invite loving and positive energy? 

Thank you in advance!Hi All,

I'm looking for what the title says. I KNOW I've been carrying unhelpful beliefs about abundance. I also intuitively feel that our life circumstances are projected outward from what we vibrate, our deeply held subconscious beliefs. So have you dealt with this in yourself and had success? Did you perform some kind of working or series of workings and then notice a substantial shift in the flow of material abundance coming to you?

So many authors make claims and advance theories, but when has it worked?? I want to hear your stories and bounce ideas around with you.

Cheers.Which is essentially the infusion of inspiration sourced from cyberpunk media into one's current magickal practice. Another word for it could be technomancy, but that's too generalized. I'd like to write a guide to this particular form of occultism using technology, pop culture and magick; something specific. Would that interest you?This isn’t an offer to do a reading, just a question that I want to ask. 

I’ve been reading Tarot for a few years and it’s become a major tool for my Magick and my Journey. When I do readings for others I usually find the base crowd who are mostly interested in Romantic Love or Money readings. 

As I’ve used Tarot on myself for so many unexpected esoteric things, I know it’s uses span so much deeper than that. So I wanted to ask a more Esoteric crowd.

If you could learn anything from a Tarot reading, with regards to your Magick, to your spiritual practices, to your inner work, to your Soul, to Your Mind, to your Body, to your Path, to your Destiny, and to everything else that deeply motivates you. What would it be?Hey y’all, I hope everyone is doing good and enjoying the winter/summer wherever they are!

I know this is odd but I’ve come here asking for help. I’m not asking for help regarding laws or rules but rather in general. I’ve been on the job hunt for the whole half a year and feel as if my attempts to alter fate hasn’t worked. All I’ve received is rejection after rejection. I really think what I need is more then just me to try and will it into existence. 

So, I guess what I’m asking is that next time y’all do your magick could you direct some goodwill to me? Y’all can just refer to me as FJT and I’m sure the universe will understand. 

I’d really appreciate it!I've been giving a lot of blood offerings lately and lately I'm feeling very tired due to the amount of life force I've been giving out. (It's just a prick to the finger but symbolically it's much more than that.)
I'm thinking it's time for a break since I'm very much lacking in energy at the moment.
Does anyone else here ever feel the need to take a break from magick?Hi everyone, first actual post. Are mentors uncommon amongst practitioners and witches? If they are in fact a thing, how would someone find one? I only ask because of the misguidance I see on common apps and how hard it seems to find certain resources that arent a one size fits all type of thing. I dont have many ppl around me and I've found that knowing which site to trust is also hard when I have no basis for comparison. Ahhhhhh help lolI am confused about use of emotions in magick. I heard from some that they are forms of energy/chi themselves that can empower spells, whereas I heard from others that they direct energy instead (rather than being purely energy). Moreover, many rituals seem to substitute emotions with energy work, leaving me to think the initial option. For example, you wouldn’t necessarily enthrall yourself in emotion to perform an LIPR or a lucid dreaming spell, but you may do an energy raising working during or before them instead. However, in baneful workings, for instance, the emotions of rage and anger play a huge part, and you wouldn’t necessarily try to focus on anything outside of those emotions and the ritual implements. What do you guys think?I’m just starting to dip my feet into the (magick) water, so to speak. I’m learning as much as I’m able and it seems there are so many different types of magick. I see mentions of green witches, kitchen witches, cosmic witches and more… 

How did you know what type of magick was best for you? Did it come naturally, or did you choose something you thought was most interesting?Hi, i need your help. So for some context: my dad aggressed my mom (hit her, tried to strangle her) a year ago. Me and my mom kinda banished him from our lives for some months, then somehow she accepted to let him come back home (i was in Lisbon at times) since then a series of unfortunate events happened (my grandma broke her leg, my gpa got into a car accident) now recently they fought again and another series of unfortunate events happened ( i almost got into a car accident and yesterday my mom did get into a car accident where the car was completely destroyed but she was fine) do you this this a a curse? If so, how do i break it? I suspect him and his mom. His mom collects a lot of plants ( she says for tea but im not that sure) so please help me if you know what to do. 
Thanks a lot!Since I have a very large collective of fellow witches correcting me on my philosophy of why my manifestations aren’t working,

I’d like to ask you guys how it works, and any methods you may know of. I’d appreciate your feedback in lamen terms and not in a crude coded statement. 

Forgive me if my question seems to be a bit bitter in tone. I’m a little hangry right now, and I’ve always been a bit too blunt with my answers. 

Anything helps, and I’m having a hard time getting this knowledge through free resources. 

I’ve tried the two cup method and I’ve tried positive affirmations. Is there any other way to manifest? And what kind of internal work must I do to encourage the manifestations? Also anything else you’d like to tell me would help tremendously. 

Please and thank you in advance.

Edit; I’m having a hard time getting my magic to work too. I’ve tried tweaking the wording of my incantations with no results. Any Philosophy as to why my spells aren’t working would be much appreciated. Any tips on how to word the incantations, or how to charge items?


Another edit; Well I’ve been attempting to manifest money, but after a lot of meditation and watching a few pick a card readings on YouTube, I think I found my answer. I also had some help from another Redditer who contacted me yesterday through the private chat. I think the problem is a mix confidence, and the divine intervention of greed. I’ve gotten too attached to the financial aspect that when I hit an obstacle I start to doubt myself. There’s also the fact that simply stating your intention isn’t enough to power a spell, and having expectations for a spell, will inevitably cause it to fail. Thank you all for helping, I’m sincerely grateful.Recently, I’ve been interested in what is the best method to confront the unsavory entities that sometimes wander their way into our lives? And I wanted to hear from real practitioners of magick, with real experiences. 

I’ve had many experiences with otherworldly beings, especially as a child, most of them were necessarily with sour beings, but not the most friendly either. Only once have I come face to face with anything I could classify as particularly hostile, but even then once I yelled it down and confronted it, I never heard from it again. 

So, because of that I’ve always been of the belief that so long as you stand righteously in your own power, you’re safe. It’s just when the doubt creeps in that they gain any type of power or influence. Am I just being ignorant?

What methods have you found that were most successful if you’ve had any experience with this? Or Is this an endeavor best left alone? 

It’s just always been a thought in my head after reading things like Constantine, and watching people like the Warrens who’ve actively taken issue with the entities that plague normal people. 

If this post is too stupid, Mods feel free to delete it, no harm, no foul.I'm a beginning practitioner, and was hoping to hear peoples opinions and experiences to help me decide the best course of action. 

I haven't done very many spells and i admittedly should be focused a bit more on energy work before doing this, but when i do decide to cast some spells, i was wondering if i could or should do multiple spells back to back. Could/should I use the same candle for different intentions and could/should i extinguish the flame before starting the next spell or how might that effect things?

For an idea on the spells I'm thinking of doing are simple ones for protecting my energy, setting intentions in a journal for manifesting, and to help open my mind and like... for lack of a better way to put it,  accepting my magick.I ve been having occult themed nightmares since I was a kid and frankly I am not even that impressed by them anymore. Most of them follow the same theme I am in an evil ghost house and I am running/hiding from some unknown demonlike evil. 


A feeling of dread and doom surrounds the nightmares. 


I started practicing yoga, meditation, silva method and magical cleansings and working on (some?)  lucidity while dreaming. My bf dreams only lucidily.



I have 2 recent stories regarding dreams and if someone has experience or advice regarding my issue I would appreciate it.



A few months ago we were falling asleep and in the space between being awake and sleeping I had an interesting thing happen to me. I saw a stick figure buissness man enter the room and it was like he didn't expect me to notice him. Semi sleeping me was like "Who the f do you think you are coming in here? No one let you in!!" I was pissed ! The entity was very suprised I saw it and I started letting force waves from me. I was awake and immediately started the silva method and built a cage around the room where only love and light could stay in and worked with the whole living space. The whole thing lasted maybe 10 minutes.  

Suddenly bf jumps up and says:

 wow. 


Something weird happened.


I was dreaming lucidly when suddenly 4 aliens entered the room (very similar to what happened in my dream and at the same time) and one of them got close to me and his face turned demon like. I noped out of the situation and got to a beautiful nature scenery I generally enjoy. It was pretty much the first time I saw a dream character that seemed different? Lucid too? Not like a puppet? And suddenly the demon face started seeping in my new dream, like it was following me. I decided to wake up like I usually do when I dont like my dreams but instead of waking up I got to a fractal like dimension. The feeling was good . The fractal seemed very powerful,  intelligent, beautiful and well intentIoned. Like the biblically accurate angels. 


That night I believe what happened was was that some shitty astral (?) entity tried to fuck with us, I drove it away and in the love and light cage I built bf accidentally saw something nice. 


My question is what could the night assholes be? I got the feel that it was like a leach, something that fed on my energy, intelligent but not stronger than me who feeds on me when I dont notice it. 


Thank you. 


Love and light. 


I have many other stories to tell but I dont want the post to get cluttered. I would be so happy and grateful for any helpI've been wanted to incorporate the use of oils in my work but the only essential oil I had ran out 😅. I don't really have the funds to get more. I know many practitioner say not to use fragrance oil because they don't have the energies of the earth / plant it was extracted from. 

But all I have is the fragrance oil sets I got for my birthday over the past years. Can I still use these or should I just wait until I can afford essential oil? 

MY name is J.M from Kenya and I have worked with the following spirits in order of my invocation and working with them, DUKE BUNE,KING PAIMON,PRINCE SEERE AND PRESISDNET MARBAS.

I would like to thank Duke Bune for the money opportunities he brought to my favor and the wisdom he passed through, King Paimon taught me magic and influenced events and people to my benefit, he is a teacher spirit and friendly to humans, prince Seere helped in soothing and calming me and also uplifting my energy when I felt low and depressed, he also aided in quick spells,President Marbas healed me and my father.

I realized that working with them has led me to benefit a lot in many ways both pysically,mentally,magically,finacially and health wise and wisdom and knowledge.

I am thankful to this amazing spirits for their mighty work they have done to my life.A year or so before I started dabbling in Magick, I was contacted by what I now believe to be a dream entity. At the time I thought nothing of it (it's funny how powerful the skeptical mind can be), and thought I was having an anxiety attack while trying to sleep.

After beginning my Magickal journey, I eventually chose to make contact with said entity again, and lo-and-behold he showed up and influenced my dreams. Every single time I've contacted him, he has influenced my dreams quite heavily.

I would like to give instructions on how to contact this dude, but he has looked slightly different each time he shows up. The first time he took on a form similar to the work of a favourite artist of mine (Felix Colgrave). Each time since he's looked slightly different, whilst maintaining over all aesthetic and structure.

I've also not found much information on him, historically, so I question whether he is an entity accidentally borne of my own mind (anxiety being an excess of mental energy). Because of all this, I'm curious whether describing his appearance to another is going to be detrimental to his manifestation.

Should his manifestation be left up to them, or is it important to be specific about the way he looks?It’s for someone I used to be very close to, but recently had a tragic falling out with. I’m really hurt and just want to move on. I already have an idea of how I want to do the ritual, do y’all have any advise to make it as effective as possible?Hello all. I’m curious if there are other ways you choose to connect with the air element. Incense can be too much for my lungs at times. Ive done some research but am looking for some practical advice. Thank you 
Peace & Love.I’ve been dabbling working with demons here and there. I have made quite a strong relationship with Astaroth, I have so much respect for her power. I know demons are controversial in the magick world but they’re really not scary monsters like how they’re portrayed. 

Does anyone else work with demons? What are your experiences and what have you learned?

Just to clarify: by dabble I don’t mean I’m taking it lightly or haven’t done research, I’ve been practicing with demons for years. I just meant I don’t work with a lot of different demonsIn a way, it was to give him back all the feelings I had for him. 

In the end though, he kept it, didn’t throw out the contents. He told me he keeps it on his desk top table with our rings.

If anything, I feel like my feelings are lifted but he’s keeping them for himself.

Good or bad idea? Should I have just thrown out the contents myself? 

Part of me didn’t want him to stop loving me, since I was the one who left him long ago, and he was the one who hurt me, so I didn’t want to get rid of it by emptying it out. 

And in a way I think he’ll still harbor feelings since he kept the bottle, but he has it now, not me. I’m starting to break through.I’m only a month into practicing Wicca and have all of one spell under my belt so far, but I now have two different friends / acquaintances who have become extremely sick (one with glioblastoma, the other with dermatomyositis) and I really want to try and help them in some way with a healing spell(s) if I can.

1) Are these types of workings something I could capably perform as someone as new to magick as myself?

2) As a solitary practitioner, is this something I can reasonably raise enough energy for by myself?

3) Are there any reputable titles/websites/authors I should refer to to find an appropriate healing spell, or are all healing spells more or less made equal and depend more so on my personal working and execution of it to determine their effectiveness? Would something like chakra color healing like Buckland discusses be more effective than candle magick or poppets? 

4) No one other than my husband knows that I’ve started practicing Wicca and witchcraft. I can’t ask the permission of my two friends who are sick or tell them what I’m trying to do. Is it ethical to do healing spells on people without them knowing?I’ve been really interested in practicing magick properly, but what’s keeping me from doing so is all the darkness that one has to work with (correct me if I am mistaken), specially when it comes to invoking demons. Not sure, but this sub and the r/occult are obsessed with demons ! And seemingly, hate Christianity and angels and stuff (I’m not Christian, just find it funny that I always see people bashing on Christianity and praising demons because they are more susceptible to give one power). It baffles me how easy people deal with the primeval embodiments of malice, and even claim them to be good and with great intentions. 

Although I’m not necessarily scared, I just don’t want to deal with demons or anything of the sort. I’ve dealt with spirits and that’s fine, but won’t do the former. And a lot of the podcasts and authors that I read on, mostly praise and give hints towards demonology. Is there any way that one can practice magick without involving Goetia?

call me moronic. Call me naive. I’m well aware that the spectrum of right and wrong, good and evil, although as objectively self explanatory as it is, most isn’t what it seems. Regardless, I rather not work with the left-hand path fully. Although I am interesting in trying a bit of both, definitely won’t indulge in demonology. 

I have a couple of questions towards this sub: 

1. Why are people inclined on working with demons ? Aren’t they the embodiment of lies, deceits, and betrayal? Why work with them when you can work with the latter (like other deities and stuff)

2. I am as inexperienced as it gets (when it comes to practicality) I’m just a book worm. The only thing that I’ve managed to accomplish is astral projection. Any protection sigils or wardings for evil spirits when traversing other planes of existence ?

3. Would a neutral approach, pointing towards both the right and left hand path (more towards the right obviously, but will check the left out of curiosity, and with a grain of salt) be contradictory or is it advisable ? 

4. What stance do u guys recommend I should take ? 

5. I am unsure of which tradition/practice to adopt, and have been so for months! Ive been just cherry picking till now. I am interested in chaos magick, for the creativity and individual prospect that it stands for, but seems a little off the rails at times. Would like to hear what practices you guys do and if u guys recommend them for beginners ! 

6. Sorry if I offend anyone that works with demons, wasn’t my intention. I just want to understand not so I get influenced and indulge in whatever bs someone tells me, but just so I am not ignorant and critical of anyone’s practices.

--------------EDIT------------------------

Wow! okay, got more attention that I thought I would. this community is awesome! other communities in which I have posed this question in the past have just bashed and called me out. you guys are awesome!A girl I was dating described herself as a succubus.  I've never practiced Magik or have known much about it. She dated a friend of mine a year ago. They broke up but she and I remained friendly. She asked me out and we had been seeing each other for about 2 months. She cooled off from the relationship and since then I've barley heard from her. My friend sent me a photo with her posting about how to perform a lovespell right about when we got together.  And showed me she posted about considering herself a succubus that thrives on pain. Since we've split I've been losing weight, can't focus and only feel my effecfion for her growing.  Could I actually be under a lovespell?Hi all. 2 months ago I did a ritual for King Paimon with sigil and enn. And after a while in the ritual, I started hearing a breath voice. The problem is sometimes I already hear this breath voice in my bed, especially while concentrating. So this is not something special for the ritual. But i've never heard this kind of intense breath voice before and it took 5 minutes. I'm scared and decided to end the ritual. I apologized to King Paimon and the spirits who came there. After 2 days my mom asked who closed the curtain. She was sure she didn't, and when this happens we are just 3 person in the home. My brother was already sleeping.

After 2-4 days from this, when I surfing the internet the toy behind is fell and i put it back. And after 10 seconds, this time the book behind me is fell. I'm don't exactly remember but these items were standing in the corner, so could fall off.

Have you ever experienced similar things like this in or after the ritual, these are some kinds of signal?    
Also there is no shadow people, nightmares, extra rage or a voice in my mind. 

I've not found anything like breath voice in the forums. Maybe this things i told is just my exaggeration.   
For 1 month, there is no something like these events, sometimes just little breath voice when i'm trying to sleep in my bed if i do concentre but too rare.  
By the way, the voice is usually in my left ear.Pretty self explanatory, I’m looking to get into magic and was looking for help starting out.I’m a stay at home, and my sweet little goblin is in the beast-stage of toddler life. I do not have any sitters (save the very occasional pre-planned weekend hours so my husband and I can run errands or grab a bite just the two of us), nor will I put her in daycare until this Covid BS is over (we’re in the US, and it’s still a freak show here), so it’s me and my wild child all. Day. Long. Once my husband gets home, we have a few hours of peace until bed, but we mostly like to use that time to spend together. Are there any stay at homes here, regardless of your path, that can weigh in on how you make time to do your thing?In a time of texting, chatting, and DMs, it’s soothing to sit down and write a letter. Yes it’s nice to have immediate responses for some things, but it’s also nice to take your time, think things over, and really consider what you want tell your friend.

Last time I posted one of these, I received a lot of nice responses! However shortly after posting, I broke my elbow and was not able to write for a while. I wasn’t able to respond to everyone I wanted to talk to :(

So here I am again! I’m interested in writing cute penpal letters about our practices, stories, interests. Trade spells and poems, stickers and other cute stationary if you want. Updates on our lives, new areas of research. But mostly, just a safe place to discuss this part of our lives.

Me? I am 24f witch, happily engaged to another pagan. I am First Nations, but I live in the USA. My main areas of interest are the green path (and zero waste), tarot and divination, and deity research. I’m mildly curious about shadow work. Additionally, I feel very strongly about inclusivity in the witchcraft and pagan community. I am against all forms of hate!

I’m looking mostly for women, but would consider talking to a man if he is polite.

Feel free to leave comments to connect with anyone else who is interested in snail mail :)The subreddit is in new hands now mwahahaha!

This evil overlord would like to know how you think this place should be run? I'd ideally like to keep the format and stuff quite open, as I always saw this place as a central hub for the magick subs. That said, I am very interested in how I can help bring about the best community possible.

One suggestions that I will be implementing over the coming weeks is that identification posts will be restricted. We will not allow users to simply post "found this symbol what is it?", as this contributes nothing to the discussion and requires no magickal practice/knowledge. Instead we will require both context and self-research. If you can provide us with where/how you found the symbol/sigil/spell/ritual/being, as well as doing your own research, we will happily allow you to come here asking for help, but those things must be evident in the post. Hopefully this will cut down on low-effort posts from "muggles". (If anyone is extremely good with autmod config, please please hit me up ahaha)

Beyond that, are there any glaring problems with this sub? What can I improve? Or is it a case of dont fix what isnt broken? Free esoteric PDF books along with some other things: [http://logoilibrary.com/](http://logoilibrary.com/)https://imgur.com/gallery/0HdabGlHey guys,
Over the next little while I’m gonna post a few spells, rituals, sigils, rune orientations, and other magickal bits from my life.

But I want to know, would you guys be interested in hearing the whole stories behind them, or just getting the spells and stuff straight?

Just a question, hope I get some responses. Have a good day guysAnd this also goes with Greek and Roman deities as well are their counterparts the same entity? If that makes sense. I’ve been working with the magick from Financial Sorcery by Jason Miller for a while and I’m still trying to figure out who he is. Jupiter/Jove/Zeus is it a deity is he a planet? 
I just had a working that I called upon him manifest. So i mean hail jove. But I just want to know more about this entity who comes through all the time. Any help would be appreciated.


Edit: Thanks everyone for all the responses! Definitely some good food for thought!Just had the most emotional relieving moment and life changing event in my nightly banishing ritual. Lately I’ve been going through a lot in my life. Not the subject of the matter though. I decided to a thorough banishing tonight down to the most meticulous stuff with the visualizations, breath work, and vibrating the words of power. I just poured everything into it to make it known to the universe that nothing is breaking me down. Nothing will break through my aura. I am taking control. I did the calling of the archangels which was very vivid than usual. I then had the most powerful feeling of energy and brilliant light. It felt like it just cleansed me of everything. I felt I truly transmute emotional lead into gold. I don’t know how else to explain it. I just thought you guys would be interested in my experience.[Great video](https://youtu.be/4unDD4OUUNQ) on the Archetype of the Magician and using/finding sacred spaces to ground yourself and connect to other sides of reality that you don't see in the profane spaces. 

I always thought of a sacred space as being some where out in nature, but even your bedroom could be that space for you. Fascinating video, never knew the Magician was such a common Archetype in our existence. 

May the video find you well.While filling the bird bath this morning, I discovered this little guy floating [https://imgur.com/a/dDmg8sO](https://imgur.com/a/dDmg8sO). It looked perfectly preserved and at first I assumed it was still alive. Frogs symbolize spiritual transformation and metamorphosis, so I took this as an auspicious sign and gave it a proper burial in the garden with incense and flowers.Hey guys! I am new here, I dabbled in witchcraft awhile ago but there was just so much to learn and I was really busy so I had to stop for awhile! I was wondering if anyone suggests any good podcasts or anything I can listen to on the way home? I want to learn everything I can, rn I am really specifically trying to figure out all the magical creatures and how I can handle them but again I want to learn everything. Anything will help and thank you!


Edit: hey y’all! Thank you so so much for all the helpful responses, I was not expecting this much, thank you so much and I cannot wait to go through and make a list of these and start listening. Again thank you all so so much!To preface this, I am going to admit I am brand new to magick and these sorts of things, and have some issues with social anxiety. Today my friend and I went to a metaphysical shop that I have been to quite a few times. It was close to closing and their shop was incredibly busy. I attempted to make my rounds around the shop, while still trying to give people space, so I was kinda hesitant. I have been trying to improve my self confidence, in which I have been telling myself in my mind how beautiful I look and other things similar to that while I am in public in an attempt to make myself not think that everyone around me thinks that I am an all around awful person. Extreme, I know. (I also see now that that sort of vanity is not necessarily healthy) I got some stones to promote self confidence, a new mini tarot deck, some incense, and I went up to the counter. I also asked for 2 oz of rose, 2 oz of lavender (but I accidentally asked for lilac first). After this, a woman behind the counter leaned over to say something to my cashier, after which my cashier did the father, son, holy spirit blessing while looking at me and honestly looked scared. The woman who said something to her continued glancing at me. What are some reasons you would need to bless yourself before speaking to someone, and more than anything what can I do to improve as a person to not have this effect on people? I am actively trying to work on myself and better myself as a person, I am going to therapy and really really attempting to stick to it. I really wanted to ask the woman the reason, just to know what I can do to fix it, but the whole experience has me shaken up...I’m drawn to the light side so that’s where I would like to develop. I love the fun of magick and using it as an embodied form of spirituality and to connect to source. I also love shadow work too. The goddesses I ask for help from the most are Hecate (often feels like she’s my spiritual rock) and Guan Yin - but I’m not sure if this is relevant to resource recommendations

If you know anything that is along these lines, please send them my way 😊 thanks!I started out as a "witch" and am still very drawn to witchy type practices like spelljars, candle magic and herblore but have never actually experienced much success with it until I turned to hermeticism specifically golden Dawn material. It's much more potent but my God is it  intensive. All the rituals and stuff are so drawn out that sometimes I don't have the energy to sink myself into an hour long ritual. I know a lot of practitioners will say "do what you feel is right" or "trust your gut" but am I the only one who feels kind of weird mixing traditions even though they could technically work well structurally? But maybe not energetically?I know that witchcraft and hermeticism has technically undergone syncretization in the form of Wicca but I tried wiccan based spells but they never worked for meI've found myself a bit stuck and would love people's opinions.  Enjoying Damien Echols, and despite his own admission that he is wary of using some Christian symbolism/association, I've become a bit confused about using the Qabbalistic words for God/Creator/Supreme Deity.  I have been trying the Middle Pillar ritual and its chants include many mentions of God.  After listening to the second Duncan Trussell podcast with Graham Hancock (love both of those guys!) they spend quite a bit of time discussing the Gnostic concept of the demiurge. And with it the Gnostics believed that what we call God is actually an imposter(demiurge) , and when looking at the history of religion, this being and belief is actually responsible for much human suffering rather than uplifting.  The knowledge of the Essenes or Gnostics would have been much more beneficial for humanity (it would seem much of the knowledge Jesus taught came from those sources).  So being 2021 all of this info is flying around faster than I can read or internalize.  But I just feel like when dealing with something this powerful (I have done very little Magick but as a metaphysical system I feel its power) I really want to be careful of what I am working towards or invoking into my life.  Googling Thoth and the halls of Amenti brings up this concept as well, and I am trying to find the common ground in Magick, Hermeticism, and Gnosticism.

My reasons for engaging in this learning and practicing are to :

More deeply understand the world around me

Make the most of my life experience

Do my part in advancing my soul so that the planet can advance.

TLDR: Don't want to invoke/invite the demiurge into my life through practices of Magick (Yehowah, Elohim etc) I want the boost to my chakras/energy centers but not at the cost of hitching my cart to the wrong horse, one that I've been turned off to my whole life (Abrahamic religions)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your thoughtful input, I am going to take it and keep going in my practiceSorry if the post seems a little bit strange. I have recently discovered this community and feel like it can help me a lot with my current situation.

I am a 23 y/o Male student living in Berlin since the past one year. Although I myself am not religious, my gf is very religious and keeps photos of our religious gods on her night stand with a couple of other things like a silver bowl etc. With her I have seen that she gets most of what she asks for one way or the other. I have struggled with a little bit of anxiety all my life but lately it has gotten very severe. I seem to have lost all sorts of motivation, focus. It's luck a spree of bad luck all the time. 

Although I am not sure it seems as though something is blocking my energy since i feel like a fog covering my brain  most of the time. Is it normal? 

I feel like meditating and clearing my head a bit are good ways to start however I don't know how? I also want to turn my luck around since I am having difficulty finding a job and just health issues very frequently.

Any help would be much appreciated.


Edit: I honestly feel so happy and fulfilled with all the advice everyone has given. It has kind of given me a foundation to what i can start to better myself since this current time will have a great impact on my future!

 I thank each and everyone who took their time out to help me in any way they could!Hey everybody! I’ve been practicing chaos magick for the past 2 months, still in the beginning stages where I just have been training my focus and my visualization. I’ve been trying to get myself to workout since the beginning of the year but I just totally lack the discipline to hold myself accountable. I do feel like magick is helping me build a sense of discipline (one of the main reasons I started practicing) but I still can’t seem to jump the hurdle of exercise so to speak. Know any good rituals that might help? Should I try my hand at a sigil? Should I just grit my teeth and say today’s the day I workout (then inevitably fail to do so like I always do)?


Thanks for any and all advice! Have a powerful day!So I'm a beginner in chaos magick and tbh, at fist I thought that it isn't such a great thing or even effective in ant way but I gave it a try with exams tbh, don't judge me but I'd like to keep my and my parents' health intact🙂. So since the beginning of this month I've constantly told myself that the exams are going to be cancelled and there were some results, like little manifestations, steps on the way of cancelling of the exams but I knew I need something more powerful and looked into chaos magick a bit. I crafted some sigils, last evening, I charged them, did my best to forget their meaning and finally, just gazed at them and focused my energy on those sigils with my intent. Today it was announced that some of the exams, the oral ones are to be cancelled and I'm just shocked by how effective this is, I want to go deeper with my learning of chaos magick, could you suggest some books that are more practical, like with more exercises but still in the form of a textbook, please? Thank you for reading!https://discord.gg/vga2SeHey r/magick ...

I am going to be talking about Magick and Deprogramming From Modern Society with George Noory on Coast to Coast tomorrow night!

[https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2020/03/05](https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2020/03/05)

If you are an avid Coast to Coast listener,  call in from 12:00 AM to 2:00 AM PST and tell me you are from r/magick and I'd be happy to answer your question on the air!

<3 AlexThe task of digging through the shadow IS the Great Work, and delving into the abyss that is the depths of our own darkness, is perhaps the most difficult task that one can embark upon. 

The running from self is what fuels all addiction, and the temptation to do so is such a subtle little devil. It manifests in ways that are so seemingly benign and innocuous that we deceive ourselves into believing that we are not committing an act of self harm, but indeed we are. Even things which seem to be beneficial to us can be methods of running from self, of self ignorance; things such as meditation, yoga, exercise, so called "positive" social groups, etc. 

We run because the pain is so deep that we are afraid to touch it for fear of reliving the trauma we've endured. Remember, everyone was once an innocent child, and at some point that child was scarred by some form of emotional or physical trauma, some seemingly "worse" than others, but all trauma just the same. Trauma is trauma, and regardless of what personally each of us have endured, it hurts all the same. Underneath all that pain is a small innocent child, hiding under the covers, terrified to be hurt again, and that child develops many intricate forms of self preservation. Anything to not have to relive that pain, or to experience new traumas. And we learn how to curate our existence in such a way that we can maneuver around certain obstacles and situations which may force us to suffer once more.

The thing which, for so long, was our greatest ally has become our worst adversary on our path toward liberation. That voice which once guided us to "freedom" now pushes us ever deeper into bondage. We must let go of this "ally" for they no longer serve our greater good. 

Yes, delving into the shadow will hurt. Yes, you will cry. Although, ultimately this is what you need; what we all need. Catharsis. I promise you that once you face these fears you will be healed, and the incessant running will cease, and you will finally be able to rest. Your desires will change, and you will find true joy around every corner and in the simplest of things.

Do not become insnared in the trap of "happiness" and "positivity" like so many around us, especially in "spiritual" communities are trapped in. These are but tiny shots of happiness and positivity, and they do not last. They too are addictions, just like drugs, we are always searching for our next hit of dopamine and serotonin, and just like drugs they do not last, and they leave us empty and craving evermore. Once we get past this facade of happiness and positivity which has plagued our community then we can get to the real work: digging through the darkness and rescuing that innocent little child within us who, for too long, has been trapped within walls and traps of her/his own creation, which were designed to keep the bad stuff out, but instead left us trapped, scared, and alone in darkness constantly searching for escape. 

I speak these words with love and from personal experience. I struggled with drug and alcohol addiction for nearly six years before I finally realized that enough was enough and I was tired of running. I went into seclusion. I cut ties with everyone for several months, and I sat alone. I wrote, and i read, and i studied various spiritual texts. It was really fucking difficult at times, and there was a pinnacle experience where I felt as though I could not do it (staying sober). I was seriously contemplating going back to running, and that little voice within was working overtime trying to keep me from my task. I suffer from pretty bad physical pain due to a couple accidents, and that voice in my head was even making the pain worse in it's attempt to make me retreat, but i stayed vigilant. Eventually, there was a day which was exceptionally difficult, and my mind and my body were screaming at me to just go and kill the pain, and finally i yelled out "I don't want to run anymore!". I instantly began sobbing uncontrollably. Then i had this very clear mental image of myself in a coffin, and my body was entirely black, the blackest black, and standing over this coffin was myself, except i was the brightest white imaginable, like an angel. After this moment it was absolutely zero struggle to remain sober. The thought of using has never crossed my mind, and that was 2014. I truly feel i am free from addiction.

Obviously, i am not arrogant enough to believe that i have finished my great work, but i can say with certainty that I have crossed the first obstacle, and that, perhaps, is the hardest one to cross. Only time will tell. 

I wish you luck and grace in your journey. Do not have fear, and whatever you do: do not judge yourself for anything, especially for not yet taking that leap. All things in time. It will happen when you are ready. You may very well have more to learn first, more karma to balance out. Just keep your eye on the prize, and do your best to account for your own actions and recognize what it is that drives your decisions. 

<3 

AUM

ShantiAny guidance on when it is appropriate to use the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram versus the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram? I have been using the Lesser for about a year and a half - I miss a day here and there but try to do it every day - and I want to step it up.I’m new here, currently going through a couple Damon Brand books, which call on angels/archangels. Is it ok to work a ritual if you have had a glass of wine or two, or will it not be as effective (or maybe even throw something rotten into the mix)?I have heard recently that the English language is "weak" in terms of magickal power. Why is this the case? What effect does language have on magickal acts and how does that work? Just curious.For almost a year now, I have been an occultist. I really got into it, I read books on the topic every day for hours, I did daily rituals and invested huge sums of money into tools and altar pieces. My life was not as important to me anymore, and my college grades fell behind, I stareted to neglect my family, my room is awfully messy and I just do nothing about it other than hope that it will end. I am considering to take a break, maybe even drop magick for good because it caused me so much damage. How can I deal with this?I see a rabbit every night I walk home. I’ll walk different paths, and there he is. I asked for a sign the other night, and he was waiting for me on my front lawn, before scurrying off. Does this mean something?Greetings everyone,
I am new to magick. After watching Foolish Fish’s video I am interested in getting Magickal Protection by Damon Brand. I have had positive results with Success Magick. 
I am a complete newbie. I have never done LBRP and some people have advised me against using it as it exposes you in the astral plane. Since I am new to all this I plan to start using MP. 
I would like to know how helpful this book is? Are their any negative side effects of Performing the master ritual. Are we suppose  to use the sword banishing ritual twice a day for the rest of our lives. Should I be worried if I stop or forget to use it ?
Will there be a reaction from the spirits ( if there are)  in the house or hotel I am staying in or travelling to .
Thanking you all in advance.

Edit: Thank you, guys. So far I have done the sword banishing ritual and I really liked the feeling of it.First, I’ve become generally disenchanted with Hermeticism and in general golden dawn related magick, which is how I originally broke into this world. 

More importantly though, after a few years of successful manifestation I just don’t care anymore. There’s nothing that I care enough about to seek out with magick. I’ve manifested jobs and relationships for myself and all of my friends. I could keep going, but money and wealth beyond the basics is ultimately worthless. For all of that success too, I’ve still never been able to keep my anxiety at bay for more than a few weeks. 

Then there’s theurgy, which is a great idea, but at the same time an endless marathon in the dark. 

I’d like to master astral projection still, though I’ve only had a few trips that I can remember. I feel like having more frequent access to the non-physical would give me a better vantage point to see my way forward. Still, this has been years in progress and I haven’t come very far. I just feel lost. I’ve completely stagnated on my path and I don’t see a road forward besides maybe meditating. 

I am grateful for all of the experiences I’ve had, and I wouldn’t take a moment back that I’ve spent on this pursuit. I’m just sad to have lost the drive and enthusiasm I once had. In a way the perceived ease that magick has brought me has only showed me how little value there is to be had in the physical. 

The only thing that really matters is love. That’s cheesy af I know, but you don’t need to master the subtle forces of the universe to have good relationships with your friends and family. This realization has shifted magick from a center point in my life to a hobby, and I’m mourning that loss. 

Thanks for reading.Hello, to preface I have adhd and the second somthing stops giving my brain dopamine my brain gets bored.

I got into Bhakti yoga and Hinduism from ram dass in my earlier days and occultism about a year ago and I keep flipping and flopping between the two. My space is full of occult things and traditional Hindu things and I spend at least a month or so hyper focused on one then lose focus on one and start hyper focusing on the other. I find the Bhakti yoga to be helpful making me compassionate and loving but low key a little boring at times, and I find the occult magick to be intense and very precise and occasionally overwhelming. 

I feel the effects of the magick (I assume) but I don’t feel the same affects from the Bhakti yoga as much but it makes me feel more loving to say again.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking other then if anyone has anything they could share to either help me pick on or rationalize what I’m doing or just share something that could be helpful.Hello folks, 

I've been really interested in learning more about the mystic side of Islam, especially with Sufi practices and the power of zikir as a means to achieve gnosis, but I'm really intrigued by the possibility of elements of Islam that can be used in magick. I know Islam is a very dogmatic belief system but at the same time, there are many folklore elements that believers carry with them, especially people from the middle-east. So, what do you knows to know and can share about magick stuff originally from Islam?I’ve been guided by a mentor in magick for the last few years and they’ve told me that I’m not in a healthy mindset to be doing magick and would only destabilise myself.

I was only doing the LRP and MP.

Do you think that by doing these practices I could destabilise myself mentally?Hello all!

I have a question regarding the charging of sigils. I want to “super-charge” one I made by charging it in as many ways as possible. 

What I am currently doing:
- Meditate on the sigil and try to make it feel “alive”
- Draw it numerous times an various pieces of paper and burn them one at a time saying and saying “No harm to me or to others, so it shall be”
- Draw it on my arm and jump into a cold shower and focussing solely on the sigil and wash it off

Any other people have anything they do? Would love to get this one right!

PS: The charging will probably be done for all of my future sigil work, but I have two that have not yet manifested. One being a silly-shot-in-the-dark for a competition I want to win. The other is super important, my father had a stroke and I would love to give his healing a boost!

So pretty juvenile on the one hand and pretty serious on the other. 

Thanks!I get that some people have trouble having kids, but a lot of times I hear women discussing doing fertility spells when they clearly don’t want to have a baby and I’m a littler confused? Are there other things they could potential do besides the obvious have-a-baby stuff?When I was a kid my mom would bring me to holiday celebrations with her coven. I truly only went for the food. The environment as a whole was very restricting and not for me but my mom insisted that I loved going and the leader of her coven was a very on the surface nice lady so I continued to go. Eventually the coven split up and as the years went on I realized how toxic the environment was and most definitely had attributed to my bias against any and all religion for a very long time.

Now I have opened up and begun practicing my own magick. I thought my mom would be happy and supportive. I have no idea where I got that idea from. Turns out she isn't happy at all and keeps trying to push her old ideals onto me. She tells me that the spells I am doing aren't real spells, I'm not honoring the true "god and goddess", that I need to respect her as she knows more about it than I do, and that the communication I am having with my deities isn't real/just my imagination. 

She wants me to worship mother earth and the sun as my **only** deities. And that I should literally only do success spells. No anti-anxiety, no protection spells. Nothing. Just success. She believes that astral projection and the "truer self" is a farce. She doesn't believe that anyone should be able to communicate with their deities as she thinks it is disrespectful. She also yelled "No! Absolutely Not!" at me when I told her I was working with Loki. I would completely stop talking to her about it but she is the only way I can get many of my supplies. 

So here's my question. What the hell do I do? She is totally draining and makes me feel like my practice is inferior. Every time I talk to her I feel a 20 pound weight of negativity cover me. It's terrible.Would like to know about how the process to get into the order was, and once in, how does the relationship with the instructor work, and if the work can be managed with a normal life, i.e. working, taking care of your kids, etc.##Magick

[Alan Chapman - Advanced Magick for Beginners](http://docdro.id/rWI80kp)  
A new paradigm that delivers a genuine transformation of occultism. The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet its apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick, to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmans writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious. The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalises magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: the art, science and culture of experiencing truth.

[Lyam Thomas Christopher - Kabbalah Magic The Great Work of Self Transformation](http://docdro.id/9jSYqsS) 
Advancing to higher levels of ritual magic with purpose and power requires an exaltation of consciousness-a spiritual transformation that can serve as an antitode to the seeming banality of modern life.

Based on Kabbalistic techniques, the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and an Hermetic tradition spanning nearly two thousand years, this innovative new work introduces the history of the Golden Dawn and its mythology, the Tree of Life, Deities, demons, rules for practicing magic, and components of effective ritual.

A comprehensive course of self-initiation using Israel Regardie's seminal Golden Dawn as a key reference point, Kabbalah, Magic and the Great Work of Self-Transformation guides you through the levels of the Golden Dawn system of ritual magic. Each grade in this system corresponds with a sphere in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life and includes daily rituals, required reading, written assignments, projects, and additional exercises.

Knowledgeable and true to tradition, author Lyam Thomas Christopher presents a well-grounded and modern step-by-step program toward spiritual attainment, providing a lucid gateway toward a more awakened state.

[Basil Crouch - The Darkside of the Moon: A Complete Course in Magic and Witchcraft](http://mbdodd.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/1/6/14162844/the_darkside_of_the_moon_-_a_complete_course_in_magic__witchcraft.pdf)  
Rare text that gives a variety of insights into creation of Thralls, secrets of Gypsy Sorcerers, dark Necromantic practices, potent magic and much more! The data in this book is authentic, many of the ceremonies were undertaken by young female witches and male students of the occult, under the supervision of an Occult Master. The results they established, and which are recorded in this book, can be achieved by anyone, providing that they have the nerve, patience and the ability to carry out the written instruction exactly. The phenomena, or magic, is the result of certain phase of mind. The ceremonies help to achieve this, much sought after, state of mind. It can only come through practice, incantation or ritual. In very rare case it can be spontaneously evoked by the subconscious mind. However, such spontaneously action can not be controlled, which is dangerous, whereas the achievement of the necessary phase of mind, through ceremony, is the result of a disciplined mind that is under control at all times.
I have a rite of general offering that I occasionally perform and one thing I was wondering in reference to it and other rituals, is if I could use the smoke from cannabis as a stand in for incense. 
The basis behind the idea is using that which you smoke and your very breath for the Magick and as an offering itself 
If anyone has done anything similar and could share their experiences I would greatly appreciate itIs there any solid firm background to the widely spread notion that one should not practice magick on eclipse days or that it is detrimental or dangerous? I've seen this idea shared everywhere and for me it lacks foundations. It sounds to me like something some people would repeat enough till it becomes self validated.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time.If they do, is it common practice to not disclose that to others? 

I’m just surprised to not hear more success stories. I hear about failed spells all the time, but not successful ones.F I R E.

Especially candles.

Any advice to someone who has no access to fire/candles but wants to do magic? Living with family but they're scared I'm gonna burn the house down if I light a candle...I continue to try and dabble in the ceremonies of uniting with god, etc. The length, the costumes, the time is all a very large boundary to stretch especially if you have little ones. Parents, how do you do it?Does anyone know of protection spells I can do from a distance that could protect an area of land as well as the people inhabiting it? My parents live in a high fire risk area of California and I want to protect them, the house and property, and their animals. Ideally I would like to protect them enough that they never have to evacuate again.Hi all! I live in British Columbia and we are currently in a wildfire crisis. The town I live in hasn't been directly affected by a fire, but there has been heavy smoke for about 2 weeks now. I am finding it is starting to affect my energy, mental clarity, lungs, mental health etc. Im wondering if anyone has any spells to protect/clear this energy, or anything that can support me and my family through this thick/smoggy time. 

Thank you magick people of Reddit for any advice!For ex. If you want to meet a great teacher, master some thing, meet a great person etc. Will sigils work for things like that? (I know you have to believe in something in order it to happen, but will it work if you believe in it?)When one starts to practice and is attuned with oneself and the universe, how do things manifest for you in a sense that you feel guided.

As in once you understand the elements and nature guides and their energy resonates with yours, are you then able to have some sort of influence over them, or do they have influence over you, or it works both ways like a give and take relationship. 

Or is controlling one’s environment and therefore able to manifest our reality something we inherited through birth, our dna, evolutionary process, or reincarnation. 

For example, if you take on the path of Shamanism practice you can relate to being a “seer”, in a sense a vessel for all that is truth. Then there are those who “do”, where they are not a teacher but a master. 

When does the “seer” become the “doer” or are they two different entities. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.Someone I (kind of) know had a crazy experience recently and I'd love to hear your thoughts about it! This is what they said...

*"It was a candle spell to clean and clean strengthen your inner sacred space. Everything was going well until I began visualizing a bright white light filling the room (meaning the light from the candle where the candle represents you or your heart and soul).*

*Anyway when I began to visualize the light filling the room, it suddenly became so bright that I had to shield my eyes. Then it seemed like time stopped and in slow motion the candle exploded. I could see it clearly as I said it was like it was in slow motion.*

*I didn't hear the explosion and I didn't feel it. But it must have been very strong because it blew all the windows out of the back of my house and moved the back wall out about 3 or 4 inches. Every piece of electronics in the room was destroyed. But what was even stranger is that I have 30 or 40 antique lamps in the room, and only one lamp shade broke. Every mirror was shattered and the drywall was pushed into the joist bays on all the walls and ceiling, like something had smashed into them.*

*The fire department showed up and all my neighbors were out looking at what had happened, so it must have been very loud. But I swear I didn't hear anything and I didn't feel the blast.  Also I didn't have so much as a scratch.* 

*Needless to say I won't be doing any candle spells for a while, and definitely not in the house. I would like to get an idea of how this happened and if anyone can relate, or if someone has had something similar happen."*

&#x200B;

Several years ago I was part of a group ritual which set a fire alarm off in a huge old building (it was silent, the fire department showed up and was pissed... but no one had pulled the alarm!), so I know that really intense energy can do this sort of thing.

I've written back to the person and asked about their level of experience... but other than that I'm a little stumped on how to help them. I've suggested a look into their astrology chart to check out what their main elemental energies are... but I'm not sure that says much.

Your thoughts?

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you!In my opinion this a book well worth your time. About the occult interests of Burroughs and how his rituals were constructed.   

Written by Matthew Levi Stevens.  

From the back of the book:    "In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen. The dogma of science is that the will cannot possibly affect external forces, and I think that's just ridiculous. It's as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific viewpoint. I believe that if you run into somebody in the street it's for a reason. Among primitive people they say that if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that." - William S. Burroughs 

 In Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs, his biographer Ted Morgan wrote: 'As the single most important thing about Graham Greene was his viewpoint as a lapsed Catholic, the single most important thing about Burroughs was his belief in the magical universe. The same impulse that lead him to put out curses was, as he saw it, the source of his writing...

 ' Burroughs' writings often describe magical, mystical or occult ideas - Invocations of Elder Gods, descriptions of Sex-Magick rituals, references to amulets, charms, ghosts, omens and spells - all the thematic set-dressing that we all know and love, from Hammer Horror Movies to Weird Tales, from H. P. Lovecraft to Dennis Wheatley and The X-Files... Then there is his personal involvement with belief systems and practices that come from strange 'other' territories outside the conventional mainstream - Scientology, Electronic Voice Phenomena,Orgone Accumulators; Ayahuasca, Rites of Pan in Morocco, Sweat-Lodges with Native American and, Chaos Magic. 

  "Stevens has unravelled the threads to create a superlative supernatural treatise of El Hombre Invisible's life and work. Whether an initiate to the world of Burroughs or a seasoned scholar, this book opens new and fascinating vistas. Vitally unorthodox and yet true to the core, this is an essential text for anyone looking to go beyond the page into an alternative reality, where magic lives." Nina Antonia.I'm am already a but of a loner and normally I'm good with that... But with not working right now I literally only have contact really with my husband and my 9 month old... So I am definitely looking for spiritual, witchy friends... Or just cool people to talk to, share idea etc...An old designer adage says, “Form follows function.” If this is true than it should also stand to reason the mind tool Magick should also follow such thinking. I base this upon my observation of multiple posts and written instructions in many magickal texts outlining the need to separate mundane reality with magickal reality. This seems to be in order to help strengthen a common theme of needing to suspend disbelief and just follow protocol.

Even in the Divination skills of Remote Viewing, the operator needs to stop “thinking” and just do the protocols. While no altar or separate magickal space is require, there is a need to remove oneself from mundane existence in order to operate in peace. All this seemingly needed to help avoid distraction or introducing disbelief into the system.

While I am operating form the premise that modern technology is deleterious towards Magickal working (as in if Orgone is necessary as a component to Magick then modern electromagnetic radiation blocks the accumulation of this precious Orgone), it may still yet be possible to produce magick within the confines of the modern world despite the disadvantages. Indeed this seems rightly the case as outlined by many practitioners of magick and myself who has done many sessions in a library. This based on the notion that "energy" follows intention. If our intents are so aligned, then perhaps a strong pull of energy may be capable of performing "powerful" magicks.

**Hypothesis:** Using the protocols as outlined in the Circle of Excellence Ritual, the magickal practitioner will be able to perform Magick within the confines of the modern world despite the degenerative nature of our technology. Whether an Altar is still necessary or not may influence results.

As a magick practitioner that does not utilize an Altar, I can only speak from those instances where an Altar may not be necessary for Work.

Here, then, follows the ritual for the Circle of Excellence

**The Circle of Excellence**

This Spell will help you perform at your best. Use this Spell only when you need it. Do not rely on it too much.

* **Step 1.** Close your eyes and imagine a circle on the ground.
What color is that circle? Does it move? Does it have a sound? Does it smell like anything? Does it glow?

* **Step 2.** Imagine yourself walking into the circle.

* **Step 3.** Remember a time when you felt absolutely capable of doing anything. You were the best at a game. You were the best at a task. You were excited and happy and capable of doing anything. How does it feel? Where do you feel it? Is there a smell? Is there something to see?

* **Step 4.** Imagine that memory shrinking down and becoming a ball of light. Allow that light to join your circle and empowering it. Does the circle change? Does it change color? Does it change sound? Does it change smell?

* **Step 5.** Imagine yourself stepping out of that circle.

* **Step 6.** Remember a time when you felt absolute belief in what you were doing. You knew for certain this was the truth. What were you doing? Where is the feeling of that calm faith? What can you see? What can you smell? What can you hear?

* **Step 7.** Now imagine that memory shrinking down into a light, and push that light into your circle. What happens to the circle? Does it change? What color is it now? What does it smell like? What does it sound like?

* **Step 8.** Now imagine yourself stepping into the circle. Imagine with each breath you take, the power of the circle flows into you like water goes into a cup. Allow those feelings to enter into you.

* **Step 9.** Open your eyes and clap your real hands together and say your magickal word. This is the word that you will say to activate the power of the Circle of Excellence when you clap your hands in the future.

For those individuals familiar with Neuro-Linguistic Programming, this protocol should seem very familiar. I post this to the group in an effort to see what results might come of this ritual. Of particular note, I’d be very interested in those magickal practitioners utilizing sigils or altars as part of their regiment.

My own personal experience is this ritual has helped me in keeping me focused on my task of divination. Preventing me from allowing conscious bias to enter into the session. I look forward to hearing your own results as well as receive any questions or critiques.

Thank you for your time.TL, DR: ex got me into practicing, stopped when we broke up, stuff that I desire seems to be coming to pass and at quickening pace. Is this possible? Should I stay the course or try to dive deeper with spells/ritual/etc.? 

I’ve never been a practitioner but I’ve always been attracted to the esoteric so I’ve done a lot of research on a wide variety of topics. My ex is a theistic Satanist and practitioner and while I never was comfortable following her belief system, she encouraged me to start actually putting some of this stuff into practice. So I started applying principles of chaos magick, doing some sigil craft, folk/low magick, things like that. 

When things ended with her, I attempted some workings to make peace with the breakup and end the animosity between us. I wasn’t in a great place so of course I was impatient and when it didn’t work as fast as I wanted it to, I stopped really practicing. I realize now that it did work just longer and more gradual.  During the period between stopping and now, I’ve done a lot of thinking and visualizing on what I wanted, but I wasn’t focusing on it like you would in a working. I’ve since noticed that the following has come to pass:
-I wanted the type of woman who would make my ex jealous/insecure (yes I know this is petty. I’m not perfect). I even wanted her to speak French. About a year ago, I got involved with a woman who fit this description to a T, even down to the French. 
-I started realizing I wasn’t really happy with the relationship and I started thinking “it would be easier if she just left.” Well, I went on a work trip, she got really distant and started dodging me when I got back. Last week, I wake up one day, find she’s blocked me on everything then find out from her coworker that she got back with her ex while I was gone and skipped town to Florida. (This is an example of be careful what you ask for...I’m not happy with the specifics of how this went down.) 
-Thought I was due for a promotion, ended up getting promoted a few weeks later. 
-Wanted an equity award in my company as part of my annual compensation. Didn’t get it at my annual discussion, then a week later my boss calls to tell me I got one. 
-I’m friendly with my hair dresser and she asked if I ever have to go to Chicago for work (I don’t). She said if you do, can you bring back X and her birthday is on May 17, haha. I think about how I’d like to do that for her and a couple weeks later, invited to a conference in Chicago May 13-15

That last one really made me pay attention. Is it possible I’m causing things to manifest without realizing it? I feel like I’m tapped into something and I should capitalize on it. Do you think adding more structure will yield more powerful results? 
I think I created a space for myself, in the astral realm, by an accident. It's a beach next to a sea, there is a wooden beach house and behind it there is a pine forest, the sky looks like the sun's setting. I asked my other witch friend about it and she said that she has something like that too, although hers is very different - it's placed on a farm, during an autumn, gloomy day. There is a barn and a house. We both first got there in a dream. We were both in a really dark place at the time.

 What solidifies my belief that this is an astral haven (I don't know how else to call it) is that we were able to get there more than once. And the first and only time I was able to enter astral realm was when I was thinking of that place. I can easily enter that place in dreams, but I cannot access it through meditation just yet. 

So this is my question: is this a thing? I've tried searching for this but I can't find anything.I was really excited to get this reading done because I respected this YouTubers "Intuition" but i never got my reading. I paid in advance for a personal reading and was required to be available for a specific time but when that time came i didnt receive an invite or phone call. I called the contact and they said they would post my reading on YouTube and my "energy" would be channeled though the cards. A day passed and no video was posted. I ended up disputing the charge with my credit card company for no service provided. 

I want to tust people but the only way to know someone for sure is to watch what they do and not what they say...Hello, I was wondering if anyone from the Midwest (or more specifically more north like Wisconsin/Minnesota) could tell me of a few common plants/flowers/weeds/herbs, etc. that I can forage (ethically), and what their uses are in spells and such? I'm kind of overwhelmed with trying to research what's what, and what for. Just knowing a couple to get me going in the right direction would be super helpful. Thanks!Helloooooo.
I wanted to share an experience I had recently with a love sigil.
I must say I read more about magic than I practice.

Some context... broke up with my ex-girl and lost my job the same day, I was in the deep abyss of fucking depression for a couple of weeks. 

One night I drew up a planetary sigil, of course used Venus, because I wanted my ex back. ( lol … I know … ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )

With my sigil drawn, 
I thought “ I could charge it by playing music “
I had a beat I was working on, looped it, got the guitar and improvised to the beat with the intent of charging the sigil, was at it for about 2 hours, then went to sleep.

Next morning and since, the feeling of wanting to get back with my ex vanished, completely. 
I was myself again. Finally
(- Love is a hell of a drug, kids -)

It was incredible to discover that the magickal operation worked, although the result was not what I intended, it was exactly what I needed.
the thing that changed was myself :0 !!!

can anyone link me to any books or instructions regarding ways to improve concentration such as certain meditation techniques etc.  any help would be appreciated![https://gnostichurchlvx.wordpress.com/2021/05/16/may-2021-rosicrucian-mass-sermon-the-oversoul/](https://gnostichurchlvx.wordpress.com/2021/05/16/may-2021-rosicrucian-mass-sermon-the-oversoul/)

Think of the Oversoul as the Qabalistic Adam Kadmon; a holographic archetype from which humanity generates male and female beings. The Adam Kadmon is the Divine having taken on etheric substance with humanity fully taking on material substance; divided into male and female forms. The Divine itself, first manifests as Kether (the Crown) on the Tree-of-Life. This is also referred to as the L.V.X. or light, which Emerson refers to as the Oversoul.Hello all,

Our little community just grew to a big community of 100k subscribers. This is a phenomenal growth, and it's all thanks to you.

We moderators tend to do quite a lot of moaning at users over rules and behaviour, so we thought we'd like to thank you instead. This subreddit would not be what it is without it's userbase. 

Since the current moderation team started here, we've seen our member count double, and the subreddit has changed with that growth. It is down to user feedback, participation, creativity and patience that this subreddit has flourished into what it is today.

At least for me it continues to be a constant source of inspiration, wisdom and personal development. I can uncover great insights and I can have my misconceptions challenged. This great ability for growth is down to your participation. The discussions you have, the resources you share, the questions you ask, the posts you report, the rules you follow, the feedback you provide.

On behalf of the Mod Team, and the egregore that is /r/Magick, thank you all for everything you do.

I would also like to deeply thank the people who keep the place running smoothly. Their ingenuity, vigilance and direction gives bones to the body of this community.

Thank you /u/ioptah, /u/zsd23, /u/viciarg, /u/Magic_Al_Vulture and /u/daxofdeath.

Here's to 100k more!!I'd like to offer a few powerful incense/fumigation blends that will attract and draw in spirits. These are for people who wish to conjure or call spirits for spells or evocation. They will work extremely well for dead human spirits, especially if the first blend on the list is burned in a cemetery. This also may aid EVP work.   


1. Ambergris, mugwort, saffron, storax, musk, amber, frankincense, and lignum aloes
2. Mugwort, myrrh, and pepperwort
3. Mastic, red sandalwood, malabathron, and amber
4. Mugwort, hemp, flaxseed, cardamon, anise, camphor, coriander, lignum aloes, valerian root, frankincense, storax, mastic, olibanum, red sandalwood, saffron, benzoin, laudanum, and blood of a bat, goat, or bird, ant eggs, and eyes of a black cat... as gross as that seems.  


The last blend is helpful in providing the nourishment spirits need to visibly appear. Particularly the blood and animal parts. The last one is easy  


Charcoal made from willow wood and pure oil of spikenard. Mix this into a powder and place some oil on the outside of a candle. Roll the candle in the mixture and add some mixture to the base of the wick.Hello all,

We are compiling a reading list, one that spans genre, skill level and philosophy. 

What books would you personally like to see on there? I'd like to include all and any books that folks believe helped them in some way.

In order to have your recommendation included, you **must** comment/PM me the Title, Author, Subject Matter and any Comments you have.

Thanks for participating in the hivemind :)I have a small oil lamp (a diya, specifically) and a bunch of herbs and oils (both conjure and cooking oils). Can I use the oil lamp in place of a pillar candle? Is there anything different I should keep in mind?

Edit for spellingWith /u/ioptah's post about the ever-evolving direction of the sub, and all of your great feedback, it got me thinking about exactly what makes a Magick community worthwhile. This isn't limited to reddit. Not only do you have subreddits and forums, but there are covens and groups you can join out in the world. 

There are communes of like-minded people living together to accomplish something great. There are "ancient" orders like The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn or the Freemasons.

Most of the latter require a heavy dedication and a handsome fee. But many report that without such institutions in their life, they wouldn't have progressed with their practice at all. Others claim that being in a coven or order only stifled their abilities.

**What would make joining a Magickal Order worth it for you?**

Follow Ups:

- Have you ever been in a group/coven/order? How did it go?

- If the order/coven setting isn't for you, why not?

- Of the available orders you know of, which is the most enticing to you and why?This might be a silly question but I’m a big fan of Ram Dass. I also really enjoy learning and practicing magick. Are there any practices that go well with Ram Dass style teachings or something that would supplement that type of lifestyle? Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated.Hey all,

I've searched for video content about magick for a little while that was free, accessible, and didn't rely on the person presenting the information making it all about their personality. So far I've found that purely informative content is severely lacking in this space. Nothing checks all the boxes.

I'm not a master of anything magick related and consider myself a newcomer to all of this (hence why I was seeking out this kind of content), but I have video and motion graphic experience. What I lack in experience in Magick, I hope to make up for in experience creating accessible content. My goal would be to build a free, high quality resource for anyone looking to learn more about Magick of all kinds.

**The most important things to me would be the following:**

* Content must be FREE for people to access.
* Content must be high quality and reflect modern video standards.
* Content is about the subject first, this isn't a lifestyle vlog.
* Comments will be answered, discussions will be had on subjects following video releases. Creating a community is very important to me.

I'd love to know people's thoughts on this. If there's interest here I'd be eager to start developing a video plan with the intent to start releasing next month. While I wouldn't want anything in here to be behind any kind of paywall, I may look into eventually moving onto some kind of Patreon-like platform to support the creation of further videos on a donation-only basis.When casting a spell, tarots is useful to create a visual storyline of how the spell is going to work.

Let's say you are doing a money spell, you can create a story line in which you have no money -5 of pentacles-, then receive an offer -ace of pentacles- and then you become abundant -9 of pentacles and 10 of pentacles-

This could be done with any spell. I find images and the meanings attached to the tarots helpful to make the spell feel more real.I am always looking for books written by people who were really successful in life and also practice some kind of spirituality involving personal empowerment and one's own mind -both conscious and subconscious. I am particularly interested in books written by people who have advanced degrees in a STEM field yet also have managed to reconcile a spiritual yearning with a love of science and empiricism.

For example, there is a neurosurgeon named James Doty who wrote a book called "Into The Magic Shop" about how he was taught meditation and creative visualization techniques in his youth which he used to get into medical school and succeed against all odds despite coming from an impoverished family with alcoholic parents who had little education. The techniques he describes in his book are not that different from anything you would find in a New Age guide to the Law of Attraction but my own biases make it seem more believable when coming from an actual neurosurgeon with his own page on the Stanford University faculty website who really did accomplish a lot of things with his life and has real proof of his achievements.

Anna Yusim is a psychiatrist who graduated from Yale and is a lecturer at the Yale School of Medicine who wrote a book called "Fulfilled" about how she teaches similar practices to her patients. Judith Orloff is another genuine board-certified psychiatrist who graduated from UCLA and writes books about being an empath who communes with higher powers and uses intuition in everyday life. Stanislav Grof is another psychiatrist -former research fellow at the Phipps Clinic in Johns Hopkins and Chief of Psychiatric Research at several other universities who wrote books about altered states of consciousness and the scientific basis of mystical experiences.

&#x200B;

Claude Poncelet led shamanic workshops and wrote about being a shamanic practitioner who saw no conflict between his spirituality and his love of science -he also held a Ph.D in physics and taught at various universities including Carnegie-Mellon in Pittsburgh. Olympia LePoint is a former aerospace engineer who worked at Boeing and helped launch several shuttles at NASA- her book Answers Unleashed talks a lot about Christianity and Oprah-like messages about New Thought but has a lot of advice and exercises similar to other books about magick and the subconscious mind.

&#x200B;

It makes it easier to feel confident about pursuing my own occult path and less inhibited by skepticism and blind, this-can't-possibly-be-real type doubts when I read books about real people who succeeded in life and have advanced degrees in the hard sciences who have developed their own personal spiritual practices and insist that this was a key for their success, especially when their credentials can be easily verified on the websites of the universities from which they graduated. Are there any other authors like this? I'm always on the lookout for books by other authors who meet these criteria.

&#x200B;Now I’ve only made three so far an OMFG! They all worked. This last one came Like not even 48 hours later BAM.  I’m a beginner, but clearly Powerful with the intent and will if these things happened that Quickly. I had no idea what to expect, trying something new to me and testing a theory or doing an experiment to see for yourself the results and  outcome never seemed silly to me. So I experimented. And I got the results! And I’m like Wow. I’m shocked, I’m sooo happy knowing that this actually works. So Why stop now right. I feel like I should keep going and see what other great things I can manifest in my life. I just want to know whats next. What else can I Do. What direction do I take. I just want to continue to build myself into the best version of myself. Where & How do I find people that are like minded and willing to teach me new things when it comes to Magick. 
I feel like no matter how many books i read, I still need a Scholar at the craft to look up to and ask questions to. Those that are willing to share with me their knowledge & experiences with the intention of Knowing that when I create my own that I know the right things and make the wise choices. 
This Stuff REALLY WORKS. I laughed soooo hard when what I asked for came, even tho I forgot it and didn’t dwell on it at all, I just forgot I even made them and went about my day and work like usual.....I knew what it was and where it came from instantly when it happened. In a room full of people and some strangers I Yelled “WOW” and then proceeded to Laugh my ASS OFF. 
Only the Universe can Make you Laugh Crazy for no reason, by showing you something or making something happen right before your eyes. And it was sooo funny because I knew right away that it was NOT a Coincidence. 
I’m excited for the Future, for the first time in a long time, I’m excited for the Future. Only if I knew then what i know Now......WOW. 
My personality lies closer to the "Average". I like the idea metaphysical things but when things start to get real, I panic and rile myself back in. In terms of spiritual growth, attaining pshyscis abilities and sidhis I feel like these are just things I like to distract myself with due to being lonely. Whenever my social life improves a little, a good family gathering or lunch with co-workers, I realize how play-like and childish the things I practice are. Then its back to zero with me again.I did my first Fortuna working after reading Gordon White's book.  And it was freaky successful.  Like Harry Potter type magick.  Every subsequent working has been the same -- just astounding to the point of being spooky.  Offerings and Orphic Hymn to Tyche > any other success or wealth magick I've ever tried and it's not ever close.

Try it!  Hail Fortuna!Where are the Swedish witches at? I have been a solitary witch since I started my journey. Now I’m dying to join a physical community, doing ritualistic ceremonies and other stuff with likeminded people. Swedish fika anyone?I hope this doesn’t break Rule #5, because I’m not asking for medical advice or anything of that sort.

My question is: can prescription medicines interfere or hinder rituals? 

It’s not likely that my doctor will be able to answer this for me. I will not make any changes without discussing the matter with my doctor first. But I’d like to know how they’ve impacted others work, if at all.I've put a LOT of energy into my Altar and I tried to remove a statue from it and it made the spirits Angry ... I work with Angels Only.  But the energy I felt made me rethink removing the statue...

What does this mean to you all who practice Magick regularly ...Hello everyone! I have recently started journaling and engaging in some introspective practices. Some days I wake up so energetic and so confident believing that I can actually transcend the shadow of the Past and even become forgiving. But later I realize that the pain is still there: the rage, deception and I feel the instant urge to cry. It's somewhat frustrating that where I live I can engage in a real cathartic activity to release it and I'm even forged to see sometimes the people that caused this pain.

What to do to embrace my darkness and integrate my Shadow? Guided meditations don't work, I can't yet visualize things with eyes closed. Most websites usually recommends methods that aren't effective. Which practices were/are effective for you to heal yourself?He said I could wipe him out astrally. What does he mean? He said he sensed vast potential in me and I have the potential to walk on water. He said I’m alot stronger than him.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVzg4zrUPa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVzg4zrUPa8) 

 Fire Qi is very useful for maintaining ones mental and physical strength. In this video you can learn how to cultivate Fire Qi in a safe controlled manner.I’m at that stage in my craft (and honestly just my life in general) where I want to shake things up (In a positive and productive way ofcourse!) 
I am looking for love but that’s the only thing I find myself “looking for” right now. Everything else in my life is perfect and stable, if not a little repetitive but I’m still content! I have fantastic family and friends and a good job. 

I want a little bit of a surprise or a gift to come my way! 
What’s the best way of positively shaking things up? Any recommendations on spells/intents etc??Let me add this preface by saying I completely understand the dynamics behind A legitimate psychic attack. That being said, it would behoove me to point out that due to recent events that revealed unfortunate truths about people I thought I could trust, I now understand that most psychic attacks are the result of a persons psychotic break with reality, or someone who knows a few things about  magick and  may be struggling with drug fueled psychosis. 
Please don’t think I am underestimating the very real nature of a genuine psychic attack. Given the prevalent and copious use of Meth, and other psychosis inducing substances, that this may need to be explored first. Anyone else who has experienced this or anything related, I’m interested in your story.i’ve noticed that most western occult literature i’ve read is very anti-astrology in regards to its use and accuracy as a system of divination, i’m curious as to why this is? is it simply that practitioners find other divination systems to be that much more accurate or is there a core issue within astrology?I ve been practicing middle pillar for a while now an i sense some unusual hornyness.

Have anyone had same experience?

I wanna also invoke Thoth. 

What should I do?

Thanks in advanceJust¨wondering if anyone is using The Secret Doctrine from H.P. Blavatsky as a basis for their spiritual growth. Any opinions abut The Secret Doctrine?

If not, what Mystical School or teachings are you using as your basis?A lot of the time, we (as practitioners) like to talk about what went "right." Manifestation that occurred, profound experiences w/ entities, personal change that we feel is positive. But, especially for the sake of newbies, it might be helpful to talk about our "oops" moments. What's a moment you slipped up, magickally, and learned your lesson?  


Just one example: A while ago, while working w/ Metatron, I asked for "as much \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as I can handle." I had one week of intense psychological discomfort following that (intrusive visualizations, sleeplessness, depressiveness) and have been much more careful about how I phrase my intent since then! Haha. Lesson learned: ritual hygiene includes clarifying your intent, doing your research, and respect.Sooo, asking on behalf of a friend:

She’s got a pretty serious haunting going on. Like, the spirit seems playfully malicious. She has claw marks, wakes up choking, and from what she says, he just thinks it’s all funny. She also has a 4mo old baby, which is my primary concern.

Now, she was a hella stupid and was the one who took books from the place she’s 90% he died (as in, she didn’t want to walk into the barn because she could tell but did and was like “oooooh books”)

I pointed her in the direction of cleansing and banishing (and getting those damn books out of her house). She says now that he’s not in her house, and the inside of the house feels safe, but that it feels like he’s lurking outside, waiting.

I am not sure I’m comfortable doing any work there. She’s asked me for help but I’m honestly not sure I could be of much help. Curious about the next step of professional that she could contact? I have her trying to ask a local parish what to do. How do we even LOOK for a professional (aside from Catholicism) to deal with this stuff?

It’s some bad juju and I don’t want to go near it. Doesn’t help Samhain is around the corner.Hey I’m doing a full moon purification/cleansing ritual this full moon, October 1st.

I’m planning on taking a spiritual shower, journaling what I need to releasing, then burning the papers and burying it..

I’m also going to light I white prayer candle that I’ve charged with purification energy and let it burn out, and make some moon water.

What are you guys doing this full moon?So i was in my bed 10 mins ago, lying down and studying for my exams to come. I suddenly felt this presence on my left and i saw something with the corner of my left eye. (It usually happens at night you know, you misregard shadows as scary objects) i thought it was one those misinterpretation moments so i was quite relaxed, when i look at the "thing" i saw a clear anthropomorphic shape with reaper like appearance and he/she was huge, not skinny as the popular culture reaper is, just the color and clothing was similar. His height was beyond human. I saw it for a second or half and it dissapeared. Anyone any suggestions? I am terrified and i have just fled to the garden.I'm currently practicing a ritual that is similar to the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. In this ritual I'm supposed to visualize symbols in front of me. I'm having lots of trouble doing this and I was wondering if there were any exercises I could do to get better at visualization.*We are transitioning from the outdated Piscean age ideals of "I believe" into the scientific, psychological, humanitarian age of "I know." This well characterizes all the growing pains we are experiencing as a civilization.*

Whether we like it or not, now that the world has moved into the astral current of Aquarius all institutions resting on a foundation of mere Belief will disintegrate. The orthodoxies of the Piscean Age are irrevocably doomed. Energy spent tearing them down is wasted, because their falsities already are disappearing, dissolving like the morning mists, faster than those who are enlightened can disseminate true knowledge to take their place.

All the facts that material science has to offer must fit snugly into the religion of the Aquarian Age. Not that the unsubstantiated theories of materialists should be included; for fashions in scientific theories change as often as do the styles in women’s clothes. But all those things which have been proved a part of physical reality must be included.

Yet in addition to the facts accepted by the materially minded there is a vast field of carefully verified truths relating to planetary influence, relating to the development and use of other than physical sense organs, relating to the conditions that are present after the dissolution of the physical body, and having to do with the basic purpose of life itself. This information also, however wide its range and varied its character, and regardless of its conflict with preconceived ideas, must fit smoothly into the Aquarian religion.

All obtainable information must be organized into a single consistent structure and made practical in application. And as the zodiacal sign pictures a Man, this religion must provide man with the best possible method of meeting every contingency of his life. There is a best way to act under even circumstance wherein the individual finds himself, and this religion should be so comprehensive and yet so explicit that those who adopt it will have no difficulty in determining what is the best course of action under the conditions that confront them at any particular time. Because knowledge of astrology is essential as a guide to such best course of action, and because astrological relations, through their correspondence with things on the earth and within the mind are the avenues to the more comprehensive Knowledge required by the Aquarian religion, the religion thus formulated should be called The Religion of the Stars. And as this religion is based on that wisdom which expresses the Aquarian spirit of altruism, the text associated with the constellation is: **Do and Think Unto Others as You Would Have Them Do and Think Unto You**.

I'm a magical practitioner. I'm building my practice. I keep rubbing against the OTO's work with Crowley. i  know the OTO is based off his teachings/workings, but how do you want to immulate a man who assaulted and abused his acolites and partners? It's on record that he abused Neuberg. It's on record that he was an abusive leader at the Abbey of Thelema. It's upsetting to read about.

It reminds me of L Ron Hubbard: sure, cherry-pick the principles of Scientology, there are some good ones, but why join an order that was so deeply based in the man's paranoia? 

This sounds like a call out, but I feel like I can't get around the man in my studies, and he just strikes me as a self-obsessed, bloviating predator - which I don't see as excused by his intelligence.

Please don't take this as an attack. I know one argument could be that it's important to separate the art from the artist - but theres a difference between knowing the Cosby show was an important cultural relic, and being a Cosby stan. 

Does that make sense?I want to meet more open minded, self aware people but i feel like all the "conscious" meetup groups and meditations i go to are full of people who i feel like are either A) bullshitters or B) just completely full of themselves. i'm not being mean,  i'm just really frustrated with not being able to find  people who are down to earth but also actually know whats up. maybe i'm alone in this? maybe im the asshole... who knows. how do you guys branch out and find genuine connections in your area?In the past, I have experimented with a few rituals, but only enough to name on one hand. Also practised a lot of law of attraction manifestations, which used to work really well in the beginning but fizzled out.   
I'd like to start getting off the couch and actually setting up a daily routine/ritual/practice. Have begun a meditation grounding practice which I will commit to doing daily.   
I wondered if any of you guys have any tips, books to read, meditations and/or rituals for a beginner? Am struggling to get off the ground.   
Thanks in advance!In my opinion too many people exclude the material world in favor of the spiritual world without realizing that materialism and spiritualism are complementary opposites. 

I will give an example. Your spell requires an expensive herb and the oil is really difficult to make. Now you can get it from walmart or something really cheap. Unfortunately the Walmart brand has a lot of impurities and additives to make it smell and look the herb but there is actually only a little of the herb in the oil you wanna buy.

This means you need a lot more money to get this oil maybe $50 over the $10 cheap one you wanted to buy.

Using the cheap oil means you magic has a less than intended outcome over the more expensive oil that has a very high purity.

Books and education in the occult arts cost money. These sages and ascended masters gotta eat too right?

Perhaps you wanna meditate in the mountains with a group of monks, well how can you do that when you have bills to pay and maybe people are counting on you.

So I thought instead of complaining I'd come up with a solution.

Your work in the material world provides the monetary energy to fuel your spiritual/metaphysical/magical pursuits.

By spending some of your spiritual/metaphysical/magical studies towards acquiring more abundance and money as well as learning how to manage what you got I think that spirituality can make you richer.You can then you can use those riches to aquire more knowledge to improve your craft using it to get more resources till eventually you don't have to be bound by it. 

Just a thoughtI am under the impression mushroom help us scale our sensitivity to our energy to where we can take control of the matrix and manifest realities.

What are you guys’ thought?Lately, when I have felt really down I have been experiencing some weeeeird feelings in the middle of my pity parties. I just feel this comfort all of the sudden and thinking for myself that everything is perfect. Not in a way I have always been thinking of what is “perfect”, even though I have been thinking about this term spiritually, that everything is perfect. 

The other day this feeling clinged on to me so long that every time I came up with a thought like “oh these pants weren’t right for the occasion..etc” I instantly had a thought that answered with like “I am safe, all is well and this is perfect” and I really felt that way. Like, I didn’t talk myself into this. I genuinely felt it. I don’t know how to describe this feeling right because it doesn’t feel like a “sense of perfection” I have been  thinking about before

I have been working with angels lately (been working with magick before I started doing this) and I read somewhere else that this sense of comfort is an angels presence. Have anyone one been experiencing this and have any thoughts about this?According to my readings, a lot of places recommend the LBRP as a basic protection spell to be practicing and it's something I'd like to try out.

However, I feel very averse to Abrahamic religions and don't feel all that comfortable saying these Hebrew words. I get that they're supposed to just be sounds, but I just can't get over how Hebrew they sound, and the archangels are Abrahamic ..

I wonder how much leeway there is in changing things up? Eg I am very comfortable with Japanese Buddhism, so perhaps swapping out the archangels with the Shitenno? They are the Buddhist equivalents to the Lords of the directions and they have associated elements as well.

If there are other protective rituals you could recommend that aren't qabbalistic based I am open to hearing about those as well! Just want to dip my toes in a lot of things at the moment.I always thought of myself as drawn to water and fauna anywhere I go but I’m having a way deeper emotional reaction to being back home to my hometown and where I grew up. Can there be more powerful or more significance given to items taken from places where you have an emotional connection too?yup

i just bought an old boat. Ive had a tattoo of a very magickal looking boat on my arm for the last year. i didn't even know what a sigil was when i made it, but i figured it out and charged it up. ive been staring at a painting of boats in the harbour for 6 months on my wall. I of course also have been saving money the last year, learning about boats, imaging myself on the boat with a lady frolicking in the lake, did all the research in the mundane as well. Already have the camping stove, already planning out how to make it comfortable, before finding one

And then i found the perfect one, after many viewings, i was not interested in it in my head before i saw it, then met some resistance at the last second.  My friend didn't want to spend the money to split it with me. Marina is full, no go. About to lose the option, seller has other people coming. Soooooo i just bought it anyway myself, and i will patiently wait for the marina spot to magickally become available. And then i will patiently wait for the money i am owed when my friend magickally is back on board.

thanks magick love youI've literally just woken after encountering something VERY strong. I'm pretty shook up, so any suggestions would be welcome. Some context:-

I lucid dream regularly and have got to a point where I am more or less able to turn these moments of lucidity in to astral projections at will.

Tonight was one such night. I had stepped out of my body and was sat at the end of my bed. Something felt off and I asked myself 'where is my God?'

In that instance something grabbed me from behind and began strangling me. This is not unusual, I meet these entities pretty regularly, and as a magician of 15 years, I've gotten pretty adept at fighting them, so I began to run through my usual prayers to escape.

The thing is, they didn't work. Now in terms of the old 'light vs dark' battle, I tend to be pretty neutral. So grasping at straws, I began running through a couple of mechanisms for placating darker entities. But whatever if it was got MUCH angrier at this. At this point I felt like the thing was going to break my damn neck.

I woke up screaming, which is fine. But what freaks me out is first, that I wasn't able to beat it (I'm not saying I'm a GREAT magician, but this is the first time in a while that my magick was ineffective against something like this) and second, that whatever it was seemed to be driven into a complete frenzy by the insinuation that it was something darker (a demon or what have you). Any one with any ideas what it was? Anyone experienced something similar?Anyone who studies magick has heard something to the effect of "before you can change anything, you must change yourself."  What kinds of ***radical*** changes have you made to yourself using magick?At my gym there is a yoga room in the cellar that hasn't been used for classes the last 5-6 years maybe. It has been open for members up until last summer.

I've been using this room for yoga and meditation since I started at this gym 8-9 years ago. I never did anything outside of normal norms in there. Well, until I discovered magick. I started doing the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram and middle pillar ritual in there in the fall of 2020. Well, not long after, I had a dream that the staff and some of the members were partying in the yoga room and wanted me to come. I woke up from this dream around 1 in the night. So I was half a mind to go there ... Just to check. But I waved it off. Not long after I had almost the same dream, only this time they were angry with me for something and wanted to "get " me.

Well, then wave 2 of corona hit and the gym was basically closed until the summer of 2021. So I am like half expecting some dirty looks from se of the staff, so it might be my subconscious tricking me, when I got just that from *one* of the staff. Other than that they all ignored me like before.

Okey, so late summer I have a vision of the staff standing and talking serious to each other saying something like "It's enough now, we have to put up a note!"

So. Next time I go to the gym there hangs a note over the staircase down to the cellar where the yoga room is. "PERSONEL ONLY
 - 
X"

So, yeah. My curiosity is killing me. Why did they suddenly hang the note and has it anything to do with me doing magick in the yoga room. Was there actually a party? I will never know.

Some time before the vision of them speaking about hanging the note I had a vision of the manager talking about me and then she called me to talk about some issue I had brought up to the receptionist.

Cue today. What prompted me to write this post was that I dreamt about one of the staff members being a personal trainer for me. When I woke up she had sent me a message saying my wristband (for access) was found in the wardrobe and that I could pick it up in the reception.

It's weird, right? Haha.
What I am wondering about is how can I do this deliberately and how do I remove it.Hi everyone! 

I've recently managed to get rid of a parasitic entity that had been plaguing me for months. I thought I was fine doing daily banishings (LBRP and BRH) but apparently it resisted them.

Under which conditions could a parasitic entity resist daily banishing work? Could it be that my banishings are ineffective, or are there other possibilities?

Edit: lots of great advice and ideas so far, ya’ll are awesome! Thank you!I don't know anyone in my life who practices magick so I'm here to find a community I can talk to. I've been doing meditation/yoga/spiritual things since I was a child, and I recently learned at 40 that I've actually been spiritually bypassing for a very long time. In the past 3 months I've made a concerted effort to do some self-work to peel back layers and find my authentic self. I've been using my intuition to guide me to what tools and practices to use. After doing an akashic meditation I was shown (to sum it up) images of herbalism and magick. The magick part was me in a garden, with very feminine energy, basically doing magick with plants and nature. It's hard to explain in a few sentences. Anyway, I felt **very** resistant to the idea of anything "witch" or "magick". I've also been completely disconnected from my feminine side for a long, long time. Nevertheless, I followed the imagery and have been looking into herbalism and listening to podcasts on magick and I feel this strong connection whenever I hear anything around green witches, cottage witches, kitchen witches, nature witches, etc. I've actually been practicing some of these things without knowing it. I feel a pull to this but at the same time I'm incredibly resistant because of my past Christian experiences. I try to talk myself out of these thoughts, but I'm so afraid that I'm not actually following my intuition, and that I'm instead being influenced by dark forces to go against God and I will be punished and bad things will happen to me. I feel embarrassed even writing that but this is the Christian conditioning that still comes up for me. I'm also afraid of opening myself/my home up accidentally to any evil spirits. So I feel a strong pull to this but at the same time I'm afraid to do pursue it. I'm taking a wiccan course that goes over how to setup a circle before doing anything but I'm too afraid to even do that. At the same time I can't ignore this calling. Can anyone relate and do you have any advice for me? Thank you!

update: after writing this I went outside and saw two large ravens above me in a tree. I never see ravens. I don't want to read into things too much but I thought maybe that was a sign?

2nd update: I really appreciate everyone's comments. Seeing how insightful, compassionate, and intelligent these responses are makes me even more comfortable in this space. Thank you!Also known as an obsidian mirror, and used by King Solomon, this item is said to be able to evoke powerful beings. I’m thinking of trying it to contact angels. Anyone know how I can do evocation with a black mirror? Thanks
Back on May 19th I was paid a visit by an entity with the appearance of what appeared to be a wise old man holding a golden staff with a black cube sitting on top and a clock in his hand. He appeared in priestly garments with a hood and covered face. He presented his name as “Asim” and told me that it wanted me to experience sin. It said that I, myself is Aton? or Atun? 

I am now aware that Chronos (Kronos) or father time was taken by the Romans as similar to their Saturn. This explains to me the clock and the black cube. 

Asim after a quick search is an Islamic name for “guardian or protector”. Ok interesting so why would it be tempting me to experience sin?

I couldn’t dig up anything on Aton that resonated as important until months later I was recommended a song by the algorithm in a synchronistic moment called “Atone” by Jerry Cantrell. Some lyrics were so significant to my current battles with ascending the idea of good/evil and integrating my shadows so I can fully be one with love and light.

“ Trying to find a way to atone
Don’t much care to be the other me 
One that plays the role of enemy”

“Running out of time
Gotta find a way to atone”

“I want to believe i’ll never drown
Can ascend
No release or reprieve to be found”

The cube on the staff at one point shifted from black and turned to a deep blue color which seems to me to have some significance I have yet to determine. 

Has anyone ever had a similar experience? I have never seen a manifestation of the ether come into my reality before.
What follows is my opinion. Please remember my words are just that words. Please dont take this as an attack on how you choose to practice.

Chaos magick is the aquaman of the occult paths. Chaos mages are laughed at and most practitioners who voice their belief in chaos magick lose credibility.(which is hilariously hard to do in occult circles). The thing is chaos magick is literally every other practiced stripped down to the fundamentals.


I wholehardy agree with chaos magicks emphasis on belief and intition. 

The thing is if you go on to a chaos magick forum and see some guy jacking off on a shitty drawing or worshipping superman as a diety your immediately turned off by the utter lack of reverance chaos magick seems to hold for their practice. 

The thing is if they get results then, their way of casting is no less effective than anyone elses. Alot of time the part of us that yearns for religion uses magick as a substitute. They  forget that there is a fundamental difference between religion and magick. Its about the results and nothing more atleast imho. 

While i wouldnt wanna worship superman and alot of the sigils seem silly . I know for a fact that the fundamental rules of chaos magic are taken from tried and true practices and while i doubt even half pf practicing chaos mages are actually casting spells im sure some are enjoying success from their practice. I reccomend every initiate atleast looks into chaos magick as it can show you that magic is a tool rather than the worker.
What follows is my opinion. I like anyone am far from infallible and suffer from biases just like anyone else. Please remember that as you read this.

Faith be it in yourself or some form deity.  Think about women lifting cars off their children or martial artist withstanding insane temperatures. 
Confidence in yourself, and your practice is required to do good work. You need to believe without a shadow of a doubt that your practice will have a consequence. 
The best way to gain this confidence is to find sources you trust.  I know at times it  seems im too critical of wicca and demonalotry but i truly respect the practice in theory but sometimes the reality of its more vocal practitioners leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
MY OPINION ON DEMONALOTRY 
I reccomend that initiates stay away from demonalotry forums . You can find yourself discouraged because you dont have the same fantastical manifestations of entities.this discouragement can affect your practice, and weaken your faith in magic over all.

MY OPINION ON WICCA! 
wicca has been amazing at revitalizing interest magick. The thing  is most practices with a high amount of members suffers from overexposure. Wicca has so many differing opinions and hundreds of books and various things you can buy to compliment and strengthen your practice. It can be a bit much for an intitiate.also the prevalence of instawitches and some people who practice wicca with a laisse-faire approach to ritualism can teach some bad habits and shake an intitiates faith. 

I reccomend initiates research before they begin actually practicing.  I reccomend you research the more traditional methods that inspire these practices as I PERSONALLY  believe that tried and true methods make  it easier to have faith in your practice. 

IN CONCLUSION 
Thanks for listening to my rant and i hope i didnt offend anyone. Please feel free to disagree with me 
. I always think magick can benefit from more objective discussions about the validity of different practices and the pros and cons of each one.I've known my guide since I was 9. I'm 19 now. He was my mother's who she let go, he came to me now. He identifies as a daemon and we have a very very close relationship. Bordering past platonic. Anyways. We experimented with some karma v karma, cursing on some terrible people in my life. My boss filed false sexual harassment against my best friend and got him fired and listed. Anyways. Worked as intended. Her replacement for him quit the next day and she didnt have anyone to operate the machines. Got in heaps of trouble for not meeting quota. But now others who I really dislike are being affected in strangely suspicious ways all around me..

My asshole coworker pissed me off today and I was ranting to my spirit guide. He spilled hot coffee on himself and all over his work. The other one spilled ink all over his pvc. Thousands worth of materials. 
Is this just coincidence ??I searched and found no info. 

Can I use a selenite wand during LBRP?  Would that have an impact?

Does anyone use wands over sword mudra?  What are your experiences. What are the differences?Any body have ideas on a travel/vehicle protection charm or amulet 🧿 or even spell bag or bottles to keep in there? I'm open to it all. Herbs, crystals, oils etc. to keep me and my passengers safe.The practitioner visits a small clearing in a forest. He has to prepare for the upcoming ritual. He had cleansed himself in a river close by, washing his hands and feet seven times. He can feel the soft grass under his heels walking to the far end of the clearing, where he stops and looks around. It seems like he won't be disturbed in the upcoming hours.

The sun is about to go down and it gets darker in the forest. Time to start. The practitioner diggs a small hole on the outer fringes of the clearing. He lights three black candles and places them in a triangle around the hole. The carvings on the candles reveal the practitioners names, but it's to dark to read.

He takes out a small bowl made of led and places it next to the hole he dug. The bowl contains a seed of his choosing. A connection between the mother plant was established over months through care taking. The practitioner spills his essence in three ways, covering the seed and bringing him one step closer to his goal.

The bowl now prepared, he lights a forth candle, white, and plants it between himself and the hole. Engraved on it is his new name. His true name. He lies down and meditates in Shavasana. An hour passes and then another. It is dark now and if it wasn't for the stars it would be pitch black for lack of a moon on its first day in it's cycle.

Thoughts and visions of death go through the practitioners mind. He can see his body starting to decompose, his skin slowly cracking open and becoming brittle. Slowly but surely everything turns to dust. There is nothing of him left anymore. It's time.

He sits up and uses his dagger to cut a small opening in his chest. He removes his heart, adding it to the bowl containing the seed and three times his essence. His voice, first hesitant, becomes stronger and fills with conviction as he starts chanting. Years ago he would have called for his father, the father of magic, for help... But he knew better now. He calls for his mother. The mother of life itself... and she listens. He asks her for help in this now most important undertaking of his life.

If it wasn't for all the times the practitioner sat down to talk to her, she might not have listened this time. She sends her emissary as a sign of compliance and the practitioner knows to carry on. The chanting stops. He delicately spills the content of the bowl into the hole he dug. After all it contains his heart. 

The hole is closed now, the candles burned down. The sun is about to rise and the practitioner opens his eyes for the first time.Would love a blog or easily accessible online source ideally please. Or open to books too :). Wanting to create some of my own oil blends and herb/plant mixes. Thanks 😊Have you recently found yourself heart broken and confused. Whether it was long time coming or sudden, do you want that person back? Did they cut you off but you’d do anything to reach them? Have you turned to magick in hopes of reigniting the flame?

Stop it. Stop choosing people who don’t choose you! You matter. Relationships are give and take and while they may not all be perfectly equal, anything more that 60/40 is not worth your time.

The traditional love spell (or at least what you have in mind) is unethical and down right evil... You don’t have a partner, you have a prisoner. And not the cool kinky kind, the bad kind. 

Stop rolling your eyes and listen to what I’m going to say. If you want to resort to magick for anything, use it on yourself. Work on yourself. We’re not perfect beings and there’s always something you could do better. If you want a bit more confidence or whatever, a little glamour* never hurt anyone. Heal. When you’re ready, get out there and live the life you wanted without the person who abandoned you. Someone better will come. I promise you. Even if it’s temporary, just enjoy the people who you cross paths with and cherish the good that comes from them and learn from the bad.

But please, for the love of all that simply is... stop asking for love spells. Stop asking for possession/ obsession spells. Again, why would you want someone who doesn’t want you? Trust me, it hurts. I’ve been there twice. But the sooner you heal the sooner you can actually go back to enjoying the life you have left to live.

Other options may be spells that can maybe ease communications and tensions, compatibility spells/readings, etc., whatever. Think outside the box.

tl;dr Fuck Love Spells. Heal.Hey. My name is Andrew I’m 21 I’ve been really deep in spirituality for a while now. 

My life is a huge mess and I just went through another really big trauma. I tried for my very first time to be independent with only 1.5k to my name and my basic essentials and got robbed day one. My family turned their back on me and then I was again robbed by a scam artist who manipulated, used, and severely gaslighted me. 

I am so damaged from what I’ve been through that I can’t take any negativity about my ego at all. Anytime that my ego is attacked it’s hard to even function. Little things like petty drama hurt me so deeply because they trigger me and it is clear for everyone the way that I completely fall apart with any criticism. 

Please send healing loving energy so that I may heal these wounds and be able to survive this life. Thank you. Bless.wanted to share. really enjoying these two!

Hope you all find it useful and interesting!Hello everyone I have been a practitioner of magick for many years now. My favorite thing to use it for is no doubt my lucid dreaming and astral projection practice.

Let me know of what you think of this concept of associating colors with meaning.

If a symbol can hold subliminal power, so can colors. 🎨

With time, intention and practice the colors can be used to influence the subconscious mind!

Magick! The art or science of communicating with an influencing subconscious mind.

My #1 tool for lucid dreaming!

https://youtu.be/76U1s8drUJwSo, I have a question about moon water. My boyfriend's mother had placed some bottles of water on the porch and left them to charge under the moon. We brought them in  and apparently one was left behind in the kitchen instead of making it's way to the designated spot in my boyfriend's mother's room. My oldest son drank some of the melted water (maybe about a tablespoon or 2 worth of water) because he thought it was his water bottle. Was any harm done to the moon water? Or is it still okay to use in rituals and spells?Hopefully not too noobie of a question: I started reading Damon Brand's _Magickal Protection_ and the first couple rituals in there include talismans with Hebrew writing and the invocation of Angelic names. I'm not so drawn to Angels and such as I am to things like planets and animal spirits and so I was curious if anyone had insight or resources related to substituting Angelic invocations with other powers (celestial, natural, etc). Additionally, if anyone has other protection magick books that seem up my alley, I'm open to suggestions!Most people and books say: you should direct your magick on stuff and values rather than money. What if i want wealth in general(and i know that would push me out of my comfort zone,or require much more action)? I have so many plans to actualize and i can  not focus on them,because they are many and also, by getting the money i would have this feeling of accomplishment. I cast spells, do magickal diaries other rituals to get X amount of money,or flow of currency, so i could say that,i did it.. what i don't get here??I'm not a witch per se but I know many non-witch magicians do some variation of ancestral work. I don't but I'm always fascinated by it. I personally don't like working with human spirits and even if I did I'm from a Muslim family so I doubt any of them would be okay with me practicing the occult. Since we're in Samhain season tell us about your thoughts on ancestor veneration.Does anyone have any solid suggestions on books that go over the magickal property of plants? With so much fluff on the spiritual market place I want some solid suggestions. 

Thanks!I've heard that you need to protect talismans and other magickal implements when performing the LBRP because it will completely destroy the work you've done. 

Those who keep this ritual, how has it been for you? Do you need to store away all implements in an altar or wrap in a black cloth? Do these things even work? Or is it just the idea that you've protected your implements that allows you to selectively not hit them? 

I have a talisman I'd like not to take off during ritual so I'm trying to figure out the best course of action 

UPDATE: I performed LBRP twice since posting and my talisman is still entirely functional from what I can tell at the moment! Thank you everyone for the great responses!In my childhood kitchen,  we had  checkerboard style laminate flooring that was kinda beige and white. This was one large piece of laminate that was one texture with a very basic color pattern and was not made of many small individual squares. Nonetheless, even with shoes on, if one half of my foot was on white and the other part wasn't, I could FEel where the dividing line was even before looking down to check just to confirm, yep, thats where I felt the line.  I would also notice this in stores and supermarkets where there was little to no difference in the flooring besides the many times waxed over cover. I hadn't thought about this in a long time now but we just redid our our kitchen flooring and I thought I was feeling shoddy workmanship under my feet while they were tucked under the dining table. I've always been  "in-tune" with the energies around me but didn't have a name to put to it until I started getting more into occult/magickal studies. Does anyone have any insights or something similar that you've experienced?

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback, guys! I have heard of people having synesthesia before and color/number association but I hadn't made the connection of this to that before. I'll definitely look more into it to see if there's anything else that can provide insight to these unnamed feelings. Best of vibes to all of you and thanks again.Both seem to generally be about intention and outcome. I pray on a nightly basis, judge if you want, and have found it to be helpful overall in my life. That being said my prayers are more broad and general - good health, safety for family members, etc. 

From what I understand sigil work in magick tends to be for more specific outcomes. For instance I have never prayed to hit the jackpot at the casino. However, with a sigil that might be something I’d consider. I’ve never experimented with this yet, my sigil have been more broad so far as well. 

Obviously these traditions differ in a lot of ways, but it would be nice to shed some light on the similarities. 

Any thoughts?A bit small at just under 6” in length, but makes a nice ceremonial dagger for ritual magick. [https://imgur.com/a/aiibpVN](https://imgur.com/a/aiibpVN)Hey folks,

Not too long ago I saw someone talking about performing a meditation/ritual on calling forth any entities that may be looking to work with them. How would I go about doing this, any special tips?

P.S. - I’m referring to benevolent entities that could help improve my life in some way.

JesseHas anyone tried this method? I personally am a big fan of Nikola Tesla came across this technique for manifestation and was instantly intrigued by it. Also does anyone have any tips on how they personally manifest things. I was a fan of utilizing abracadabra to invoke the holy trinity to allow me to speak things into existence. I seldom ever use any ritualistic magick, that is always my last resort.I'am a christian and I curious to know if learning magick would conflict with my religious beliefs, or would it not really affect anything regarding religion?Was hoping they'd quote some more of the tech for you guys as I delved heavily into the algorithm during the interview (my mailbox is always open for that) but hopefully you guys enjoy it

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjp5v3/internet-occultists-are-trying-to-change-reality-with-a-magickal-algorithm](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjp5v3/internet-occultists-are-trying-to-change-reality-with-a-magickal-algorithm)Something good was in the air today as I cleaned my office. The music was seeping into my soul, healing damaged places from a long convalescence from Covid. I had energy and happiness and I just felt something brewing from deep inside my soul. 

I have a cleansing spell I created, charged with ametrine (the best crystal I have for the job currently) and had worked it on my bedroom. Sort of like an energy fabreeze after physical cleaning. I planned on doing that in my office. 

But as I put away the vaccuum, the music took me. I could see clearly all of the greyish brown energy that has accumulated through the hard months of December and January. I began to dance and sing, and the energy turned yellow. I tapped into the Earth effortlessly, and they gave me more energy than ever before, turning the yellow energy orange. The grey brown faded away as bright sunshine yellow energy turned grounding joyful orange. Near the ceiling, it was a lovely shade of lavender. It is also my altar room, and I just danced and danced and sang at the top of my lungs. I have never actually changed energy before- cleared it and called new energy sure. But this was actually changing the energy. 

I got cold halfway through, but I just kept going. I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop. I've rarely seen anything so beautiful in my life. 

When the song was over, I stood panting and giggling to myself. As I went to give energy back to the Earth, they playfully told me I could keep it. I was instantly warm again. 

I still performed the spell, but there was no heavy grey energy left. Just mounds and mounds of pure delicious happy energy. 

I'm so glad I just went for it!

So excited to go work in there tomorrow!

ETA: Thank you for the award! I'm so happy this struck a cord with people. I love witchcraft!I lurk on here a fair bit, this might be the first time I'm posting.

I had a breakthrough less than an hour ago. Sadly I can't share my joy with my wife as she is what I can best discribe as an atheist. She is my rock that keeps me grounded, but she is very much not spiritual at all.

Anyway I digress. I have been finding my own path for many years and I have always taken what works for me and what doesn't. I have recently been trying shamanic journeys. I was starting to get to the point where it just wasn't working for me and I was about to give up and tick it off the list of things that don't work for me.

Until an hour ago. I have had a block now for 2 days not really feeling well at all but I lied down and tried to do a journey of finding my sprit animal. I was I think about 20 minutes in and thinking to my self, one I'm trying too hard and two I know this doesn't work for me. Them suddenly as I was about awake my self from my meditation I get this whirling image of an animal. So strong so powerful, I won't say what it was for I have to work with them and see if they want to stay.

Let's just say because it has come back with me I feel like the block has shifted and I am now starting to feel better.

All the best to you all an I just felt the need to share.For years I have been looking for answers but have never had luck. Please help me. I want to know what they are.

Some back story (important)...

I grew up in the mountains on old mining land. My entire childhood I felt constantly watched and would often see things out of the corner of my eye.

One night I was in deep sleep and I felt almost like I was being called to wake up. When I did standing in the corner of my room was a tall black shadow like figure. It had no facial features. All I could tell was it was a man wearing a hat and that it was blinking. I stared for the LONGEST time thinking it was just my eyes playing tricks. After looking for I don't know how many minutes I realized I wasn't seeing things. I called out to it "Dad?" Then right before my eyes it began to vanish like when Thanos snapped his fingers. Just like sand in the wind...

A few years after that I was again deep asleep and I still remember I was having a dream about rock climbing. Right in the middle of the dream I was startled awake by a hand stroking my cheek (I was living alone). When I opened my eyes a similar figure but with no hat was standing over my bed by my head just staring directly at me. I began to yell "Get back! Go away!" As I fumbled for my phone to turn on the flashlight. While still watching me very closely it slowed started to back away into the furthest most dark corner of my room. Once it made it to the corner I could no longer see it but I could feel that it was still there and watching me. Once I managed to turn on the light it was gone...

It was scary at the time but after both times I kicked myself. I really wish I hadn't acted that way. I wish I had been able to try and talk to them. But I mean it's one thing feeling something there and an entirely different thing seeing something... I am just so curious to what they are exactly and why they watched me or even let me see them. Also, I would like to say that both times I never felt a dangerous or evil energy from them.Hello, so I wanted to perform a banishing/cleansing ritual and I've seen a lot of examples everywhere and it is so hard to choose the right one (as I lack the knowledge on the subject). I would like to get rid of some evil spirit in my house and I was wondering if any of you have some useful ritual schemes. I want to be very careful and ideally I would like to solve the problem with one useful ritual instead of trying over and over. A couple of months ago I did some sigil work for getting rid of this entity but I just made it more angry so I don't want to make that mistake again. 

That's why I decided to make this post to reach out to someone who has experience or knowledge with this kind of stuff.

(I've made the same post on r/occult but for some reason it's not in "new" or anywhere does anyone know what might be up with that?)On the full moon I did a self cleansing and meditation and asked for help to break my addiction to sugar... A week later I was tempted by some cookies and ate a few of them. 

I didn't get to keep them. 

Was sick for three days and could barely eat anything. 

Lesson learned? Spells don't always work the way you expect, instead of making me not *want* sugar I now know if I overindulge the way I used to I'll be punished for it.Obligatory notice that I've been a long time lurker, first time poster here. I want to start by saying thank you to everyone here who has taken the time to post their own magickal works. I'll be honest that I'm a bit nervous to post my thoughts here as I tend to think that my own reasoning may be a smidge too fringe. Fair warning beforehand. To put it simply, I'm partly posting this here in an effort to help crystallize my own thoughts as well as figure out where my "education" may be taking me. As well as receiving valuable insight from my fellow magick practitioners here. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this horribly rather lengthy post.

Let us begin.

> **"*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.*" - Arthur C. Clarke**

I believe that magick is simply a form of technology and/or tools that modern science or mainstream skeptics don't understand and equally dismiss. Despite that, a body of research is consistently being conducted to understand just what our own minds are capable of. Through the lens of a man of science, I hope to further the study of magick in a way in which we all have a means to test and find repeatable results. As such, there are some base points (read as presumptions or even simply assumptions) that I would first like to state. This will be the foundation of the framework I operate from and give us a common place of terms in which to go into dialogue.

* **Presumption One**: There is a God. Now this isn't necessarily the Biblical God of Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, but it may be. I don't know. Only that there seems to be some sort of Prime Existence that is the source of all phenomena. ALL PHENOMENA. From God Forms to the practical physics of walking. This is perhaps the most nebulous of concepts I have attempted to explore. So supporting arguments will be flimsy at best. Apologies in advance.

* **Presumption Two**: The Aether is real. Now I don't mean the Luminiferous Aether that was tested in the Michelson-Morley Experiments. Instead I mean a dynamic Aether as demonstrated continuously by the [Miller](http://www.orgonelab.org/miller.htm) experiments and [many others](http://www.orgonelab.org/DynamicEther.pdf). I would like to point out at this time that the Michelson-Morley Experiments was declared the greatest null result in scientific history. Yet if you review the data itself you'll find there was still a result and not null. It simply was not at the magnitude they were expecting. Aether's relation to magick will be discussed later.

* **Presumption Three**: Orgone is real. Part of this resolution is from personal experimentation, but also from the extensive research conducted by [James Demeo, PhD](http://www.orgonelab.org/bibliog.htm) (apologies for the same link source).

* **Presumption Four**: Orgone is Mana. I believe Mana is a very real thing and quite possibly a source magick draws upon in order to effect the change our Will is attempting to conduct. An explanation will follow shortly as well.

* **Presumption Five**: There are only three schools of magick; Theurgy, Divinination, and Force of Will. This makes the most sense to me and can be learned more about from the book ["Real Magic", by Dean Radin, PhD](https://www.realmagicbook.com/). Theurgy being the work with "spirits", and seems to be one of the main source of magick I come across from many magick workers. What would seem to be Force of Will magick seems really more related to Divination magick. Apologies, again I will explain shortly.

* **Presumption Six**: Magical devices can be created using the principles of Orgonomy and an understanding of the Aether. Sigils work as do wands and altars, but perhaps not for the reasons we think they do. Or perhaps they do work for the reasons we think, but on a more complicated fashion.

* **Presumption Seven**: In the end our beliefs will dictate our reality. There is a pretty popular saying, "*Know, Will, Dare, and Keep Silent.*" While nice, I think this might be detrimental to the development of magick as keeping silent prevents magick entering into the forefront of people's consciousness and thus stunting the flow of Mana towards magickal workings. On a tangent of this Presumption I would also like to add that "psychic" phenomena should also be considered magickal in nature, and requires Mana to operate.

So that is my world model I am operating from. I started my journey into this whole scene via Remote Viewing. I learned Remote Viewing from Major Dames using the declassified military protocols he used to train his team. Not to blow smoke, but I was fairly surprised by how good I was at it. So that is where I am coming from when I started down this rabbit hole.

**Presumption One: Explanation**:
Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy is what Potential can become, and should be thought of as a verb. Potential is to bird as energy is to flying. With this in mind, there is no such thing as negative energy. Once energy is expended, that is it. The energy has done the work and is expended. There is the saying you can neither create nor destroy energy. It may seem like, under this definition, we do it all the time, but what really happens is the energy is expended to create symmetry. In order to get energy to work, there must be an imbalance and then energy will move towards the "weaker" of the imbalance to produce symmetry in the system. Think of a ball on the edge of a hole. There is no negative energy stored in the ball waiting to fall. The ball is in symmetry with the ground and won't fall in until an external source acts on it. So if you push the ball and it falls into the hole, you input 1 unit of energy and received 1 unit of energy back as gravity completed the process of the ball and had it fall into the hole and so a new symmetry is achieved.

So how does this apply to Presumption One? Where is the potential that animates you? Where is the potential that allows your neurons to fire? What is the Potential that allows you to passively observe your environment? I posit that the virtual particles that pop into and out of existence are the source of our animation. The fact we live creates an imbalance in the symmetry of the Universe, and so we become animated. When we die, that Potential returns to the Source. What the Source may be, I'm not entirely sure. I could go deeper into this if need be. But for the sake of brevity I'll leave it at that.

**Presumption Two: Explanation**: So how does the Aether relate to magick? Well let's think of the Aether as the Potential of the Universe itself. It may very well be the source of Potential of everything. Maybe even think of it as the Zero Point Energy Field, if you like. I believe that the Aether possess inside of it what Remote Viewers call The Matrix. The Matrix is what Remote Viewers tap in order to gain information about any person, place, thing, or event throughout all of Space and Time. I believe that as the Aether flows, magick affects that flow and creates asymmetry to the system. So the Aether flows to create symmetry in accordance to that magick we've "uploaded" to The Matrix to match what we "perceive" as our reality.

**Presumption Three: Explanation**: Orgone is a type of "Life Force" energy that Wilhelm Reich discovered and conducted exhaustive research into, as well as others. I've conducted my own experiments with Orgone myself and I'm not sure how to dive further into this explanation. This one requires personal experimentation, I believe.

**Presumption Four: Explanation**: When I was beginning my training in Remote Viewing, I entered into what is known as the golden phase. It's the point before we have to conduct serious work to properly train ourselves in the tool. During this time we are strictly warn to only do five sessions per day. One particular day I latched onto a target so completely that I couldn't believe my accuracy. Shortly afterwards I had one of the worst headaches I had ever had in my life. I later began to call this the Burn. In those who I have trained in Remote Viewing, they also encountered the Burn in their early training. My thought is that the Burn is a result of over taxing our system and draining our personal stores of Orgone that we would otherwise use for everyday thinking. In an attempt to test the theory that Orgone is Mana, I conducted sessions one after another until I encountered the Burn. I then immediately used my Orgone Accumulator and found that I was able to completely remove the feelings of the Burn. Normally I would have to stop all "magickal" work for the day and the headache would subside after a full night's rest. Further experimentation is needed to see how far this hypothesis reaches.

**Presumption Five: Explanation**: Remote Viewing seems very much like a "psychic" art, but it's elements are far too similar to magick to ignore. When choosing a target to Remote View, you assign Target Reference Numbers (TRNs) to the Target to sanitize the session from conscious awareness. This is not too dissimilar to sigilization of intent with Chaos Magick or some other styles of magick. Going further into this, there are certain times when conducting a Remote Viewing session where "external agencies" take notice and may affect the session itself. External Agencies are effectively spirits or non-bodied individuals for the sake of clarification.

There is another side to Remote Viewing that involves nudging destiny to correspond with what you want. In essence you upload a Signal Noise (a bit to explain, but effectively what we think) loud enough to drown out the Signal Line (again, a bit complicated to explain, but effectively what a Remote Viewer "reads" in order to gather information on a Target) of The Matrix in which The Matrix adopts the Signal Noise as the actual Signal Line and reality conforms to that new Signal. The steps are basically the reverse of a normal Remote Viewing session, with the whole session being capped off with an assignment of TRNs. As you can see, this isn't too dissimilar to what most magickal systems describe as the steps necessary to conduct a spell. These sessions must be stated in present tense and fueled with proper emotional backing. I believe these types of magickal spells are forms of Divination as they don't necessarily cause actual real time gross change, but creates a series of events that if you are paying attention you can react and capitalize on those events to achieve what you desire.

Theurgy seems to be another school of magick that people seem to work with, and I don't really have much to say about this as those who work in this school understand it. I will say that I am interested in experimenting with the concept of Astral Projection as a type of Theurgy and have thought about how [New Hermetics](http://www.newhermetics.com/)(a type of system that utilizes Neuro-Linguistic Programming, or NLP, and other frameworks to conduct magick) might play a role in finding results, if at the very least allowing me to adopt a suitable belief system capable of allowing me to experiment in this field.

The only example of Force of Will magick that I have ever encountered was from the works of [Jack Houck](http://www.jackhouck.com/). It's an interesting field to explore, but there are some things that make me wonder. As a trained Remote Viewer, we are trained to stop conscious thought and suppress emotional involvement with the session. As such I don't seem to be able to create a large enough emotional surge in order to fuel these experiments that the late Houck says is necessary to perform the feats shown on his website. I have since begun doing the exercises in "Advanced Lessons in Perception", by Harold S. Schroeppel to see if I can identify my "plug" and effectively pull it. More experimentation is required. Though I will say, thanks to the works of the late Houck, I now understand why group magick is so powerful.

**Presumption Six: Explanation**: With the study of Orgone Accumulators, I can't help but think that wands and papers with sigils on them are the beginning stages of making proper magickal devices. As outlined in the book "Orgone Accumulator Handbook Life Energy Construction", by James DeMeo PhD., there is what can only be described as a wand that is detailed in the book itself. The works of Professor Robert Haralick suggests conscious intention may also be a way to create magickal devices. In all, I do not doubt the efficacy of sigils or wands only that I believe they can be made stronger or more effective. The way Orgone Accumulators mixes organic and non-organic compounds to induce a "pumping" of Orgone into the system. Could not a more advance wand, utilizing raw Orgone, be an instrument to help fuel what energy our minds require to do more powerful magicks? It's an interesting thought experiment.

I think I will stop here. Thank you all for taking the time to read this, and again I am sorry it was so long. As you can see, I fear my thoughts are a bit too fringe and that I might be going off the deep end, but at the end I want to make sure that all the results are repeatable and verifiable. Or at the very least, I want to make sure that I am still a rational person. I believe we are only truly beginning to tap into the depths this field of inquiry has to offer, and I believe that some day we can do amazing things that defy reason and logic of the past or of modern times.

Again, thank you everyone, and I look forward to answer any questions you might have if it be in my power to do so.I did an unbinding ritual because with the magnitude of attachment we had, I’m sure that’s what it was. 

I cut the chord and it was scary but I sent you love and set you free. 

I feel it manifesting. I’m a bit sad yet a bit lighter not wanting to be binded to the pained side of our attachment anymore. 

Love you. So I have been studying different forms of magick over the last year or so but I've never actually tried anything. Until last night. 

     I woke up from a dream in which I took a week off and spent that time dedicated to meditation, magick and the task of quitting smoking. I woke up from this dream and decided to make a sigil. I charged the sigil and then fed it to the fire before returning to sleep. When I woke up this morning I wrote 2 pages in my journal on why I deserve this time off and what I plan to do with it.

    I've been at my job for over 4 years and have NEVER had a full week off. At most I've had half days or one day here and there. 

   Today my boss told me that I should take next week off. 

   My mind is blown.Hi all, does anyone have any good love spells to strengthen a relationship or have a long lasting relationship? There are no issues with me and my partner and are both very happy with each other but are there any moon are jar spells  or anything else to strengthen the bond?ive recently taken a break from practices. sort of just got sloppy and lost my groove. slowly attempting to start back up and have mainly just been trying to work on self reflection/ analysis & also basic meditation. im wanting to hold a ceremony and give a go a some actual ritual work once again but with the assistant of the magick mushroom. any sort of suggestions about doing this kind of work? was thinking just start out with basic hatha yoga, transition to pranayama, perform LBRP & perhaps LIRP to charge the mushroom tea but im not sure how to incorporate the moon. any help is appreciated, thank you -respI have always been an atheist agnostic but I have always appreciated symbols and stories. I read Alan Moore’s Promethea and the way it made sense of everything shook me. 

I want to become a magician, but I don’t know where or how to start.Prayer, sound healing, Sigils, etc.?  

What have you all found to be most effective in blasting through what it takes to transform your own physical body either away from injury, deformity, illness or into a new superior physical state.  Any examples?  

Thanks for sharing:)So y’all I’ve been thinking about this. Do you believe that spells really only backfire when you have bad intentions or selfish intentions? Or also backfiring when you aren’t very clear on what you want? The only spell I’ve done that backfired was a love spell I tried to do (I broke the spell). It wasn’t something I did with the best of intentions.**Blessing Techniques:**

* Draw in chi with your breath (at least 3 breaths, however, the more breaths the more powerful the blessing), and then (with your wand or sword mudra) draw a pentagram or elemental sign and infuse it with the associated God names & Archangels.
* One can also draw an astrological symbol over an area of the body and embody it with associated God names & Archangels. (Can be combined with the pentagram blessing by drawing the symbol in the middle of the pentagram, as you would in the SIRP)
* The symbols can be embodied with any God or spirit associated with your particular invocation. It is not particular to Archangels.
* Optional step: draw a Rose Cross and infuse with Yeshua to seal and strengthen the blessing.
* Always end with a present moment affirmation that implies and feels as if that the purpose for the blessing is accomplished. And of course, be thankful and show gratitude.

**Air Blessings:**

**God Names & Archangels:**

* Hebrew: YHVH
* Enochian: Oro Ibah Aozpi

**Conclusion:**

* All blessings are customizable. Feel free to use the mantras, God names, or spirits that resonate with you the most.
* One can bless certain parts of their body or their entire being depending on the results you are trying to achieve. Intention is key. Blessings can be used for manifestation, self-improvement, healing, and many other factors. As I mentioned, intention is key.
* Doesn't only have to be on yourself. It can also be done on food, other people, and even into objects or trinkets to turn them into talismans.
* One can do this same exercise but with planetary or zodiacal energies. For example, one could invoke a mercurial hexagram to their head to bring on mental clarity and effortless thought.
* One can also use other symbols as they please. For example, instead of using a pentagram, one could draw a Dingir and vibrate one of the Sumerian Gods into it. The possibilities of application are literally endless.All over the place, I see people giving recipes for spells. This confuses me. Because if that worked, and was reliable, it would be science.

I've had some success, but my theory of magick is radically different. I think you have to sense what is  required in the particular moment, that it is almost entirely intuitive and improvisational. More like jazz than memorizing a rock lead. Science can't really deal with unrepeatable phenomena (until and unless it finds a way to break it down into repeatable bits), so it makes sense that some  things are not currently within its sphere of enquiry.

So which is it? If you can write down a recipe for a spell, why can't you give it to scientists to replicate?  


\*Argh\*, can't edit the title. Oh well, the whole magic/magick thing is another rabbit hole...i just wanted to share this video because i think this can really  explain a lot of occult concepts through a scientific lens. this video blew my mind, especially with zeroth dimension concept. also if this post gets removed then that's some booboo butt cheeks.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALq8Rrr2mfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALq8Rrr2mfg)Hi all.

I'm new to all of this, but I do have a question.  Can magick be used to influence another person to do something positive for themselves?  Say for example you want to help someone drink less, or lose weight, or fight procrastination.  Would that be an appropriate use?  If so, where would one start researching to find out more about it?

  
Thank you.So... I drive for Uber and last week was really slow by day 3 out of 5 of it.  I wrote a sigil for $500 extra to manifest over the weekend.  I felt really desperate, but don't suppose I really thought it would happen.

I just realize that:

1) Veteran's day weekend, which I'd forgotten about, was relatively busy

2) Lyft realized they deactivated me by accident.  If I can run both at once, this greatly increases revenue in slow times

3) Someone recommended a local plasma bank that pays $100 to donate

In short, if not exactly right on the dot of the weekend, $500 definitely did show up that I didn't anticipated, pretty quickly.  Whoa.Hi all. Just created my own sigil ritual that ended up being really powerful, so I wanted to share.

Need:
7 pieces of paper
7 consecutive days
Pen
Fully enclosed container (between 1 cup and 1 quart in volume, can be any type of significance to you)
Place to burn the paper (fireplace, incense bowl, etc)

1. Create the sigil for your idea/desire using standard method (write it out, get rid of duplicated letters, create design out of remaining letters)

2. Write a short mantra (mine was 4 lines of 5 syllables) that captures the idea of your sigil and your will behind it

3. For 7 consecutive days, repeat the following:
3a. Draw your sigil large on an entire piece of paper.
3b. Tear up paper in a determined way that can be done the same each day (I tore in half vertically three times then horizontally three times)
3c. Cup all torn pieces in between your hands
3D. Eyes closed, focusing on sigil in your mind, shake the pieces in your hands vigorously while repeating your mantra 7 times.
3e. Place charged torn pieces into the enclosed container, so that after 7 days you will have the torn pieces from all 7 days enclosed inside the container

4. Shake the container with all pieces while repeating mantra 7 times.

5. Burn the torn pieces to release the sigil energy.

Notes:
As best I can tell, this can create a sort of supply of energy that you can burn a little of as needed in your life, or all at once for a single task.

I only burned half initially, and immediately experienced some major chaos shifts in my life towards my goal (2 events within a week), so be careful as this can be powerful. Remember that sometimes the path from where we are to where we want to be can be an unpleasant!

How to maximize energy gathered. More energy you expel in shaking pieces, the more energy can be concentrated and gathered. Higher focus (no distractions) on sigil and mantra gathers more of your expelled energy into the spell.

Possible variations to maximize energy by experimenting with different types of paper and different types of containers.

Not recommended to repeat ritual with a new sigil until previous pieces are all burnt (reveals lack of focus = loss of power)

Good luck!Between Notre Dame being on fire, the release of the picture of the black hole, and the general feeling of upheaval in the air, does anyone else feel something approaching on the horizon? Maybe even something -lovecraftian-?This is my current fundamental understanding on what the practice of magick is. Magick is the power of using the imagination to influence reality. We are used to thinking that the only way for the mind to influence reality is through the medium of the physical body. Magick suggests that there is another medium, which allows the individual mind to influence reality directly. I call this medium the psychic plane, and it has been called by many names, such as the collective unconscious, the unconscious, the universal mind, the causal plane, etc. This is like an underlying level of reality, like the numbers in the matrix, a fundamental deep mind which causes and controls the world. This universal mind is available to us, but it is existing almost purely in the unconscious for the vast majority of people. This universal mind holds all of the potential information in the world, and it also holds power over causality and what occurs. The whole practice of the occult is centered around working with the universal mind. There are two aspects of working with the universal mind. First, there is the aspect of divination, which is accessing the information which is available in the universal mind. This occurs either directly (through direct vision and revelation), or indirectly (through a variety of divinatory devices meant to access unconscious information, such as tarot cards, Ouija boards, pendulums, and many other types). This can also be used to gain information from specific nodes or centers in the universal mind, what we call spiritual entities like angels, demons, elementals, etc. The second aspect of the occult is opposite of the first, it is the outward projection of our individual mind into the universal mind. This is the practice of magick. By creating a certain mental form and then empowering it through emotion, belief, and will, it becomes imprinted into the universal mind and takes life therein, influencing the world automatically. The whole practice of magick ritual, then, is twofold, which is the creation of certain mental forms which are reflective of what one desires to happen in the world, and the empowering of these forms with emotion and belief. The whole variety of ritual practices, then, are performed to:

1. Expand the consciousness and increase the emotions to such an extent that one is able to influence the universal mind
2. Receive information from the universal mind
3. Transmit information out into the universal mind so that it manifests in the world

This is the best way I've been able to describe the process thus far. Tell me what you think about this, and if you have any questions about it or suggestions about how I could make the whole description better.

Six months in and they are really happy, and I'm happy for them. He's confident and sure of himself- he sees himself the way I have always seen him. He gives me lots of love and affection and is a fantastic partner. 

But I'm miserable. I'm sad almost all the time. My self esteem has plummeted since we started doing this, and I'm not sure why- maybe the constant rejection from dating apps, and comparing myself to my husband's girlfriend who is really beautiful and talented and has lots of partners and people wanting to sleep with her. I work really hard on not doing that, but it's so difficult. 

I've dated a few people but the guys I like don't like me back. It all hurts and it's painful and I'm just so sick of being sad. 

I do my best not to dump my stuff on my husband, and I succeed a lot of the time. He comes home so happy from dates and I usually stay up and cry after he goes to bed- I just wish I had what he has. I don't know what it's like to come home from dates feeling like that.

I know it probably won't be like this forever. It's just hard, sticking it out.

I just needed to get that out. Thanks for reading.I love those poly moments. The time my wife, girlfriend, and I all died laughing from the joke my girlfriend made to my wife. Or when they both pounce at once on me. Even the times where we all have to use the restroom all at once, and figuring out who needs to go more. I’ve had all these interesting poly happenings that make me laugh, and fill me with love. Feel free to share your special poly moments.Forgive me if I use the wrong terms. The wife and have been together for 13 years. She awhile back came to me and asked if we could open our relationship some. I tried to be supportive of her feelings and let her know that was ok, but not for me. I told that I'm way to insecure and jealous for that to work. She said she understood and was ok with it. I offered to end things so she could find what she wanted, but she said she didn't want to lose me. Now some time past and she confronted me again. This time she wanted to explain how she wanted us to open the relationship. I agreed  to listen. She explained how she has been sad she is unable to have more kids and adoption and/or surrogate is expensive. Then she told me how she doesn't want to see anyone else. She just wants me to find another woman to my like my 2nd gf/wife. She wants to all live together and have more kids. Which after a few months of talking about I finally agreed too.  Now I have finally started talking to some girls. I have to admit this feels weird, uncomfortable, and unfair. Just deep in my heart I don't think I can open to more than one person. I know I'm going to get the hate comments (which I will ignore). What I'm really looking for some real advice on how to open up or end things. It's the only 2 real options I see.

Edit: just clear up my poor writing skills. The wife wants the other woman to be her BF/sister or whatever it's called. She just doesn't want to have sex with her. The wife has wanted the 3 of us(once we find) to move to a new place, so she doesn't feel like she is moving into our place. She wants everyone envolved. This still maybe unfair either to me and/or other woman. IDK, just want clear up the wife doesn't want to (at least not intentionally) make the other woman feel less than in any way.That's a total of 6 years and a lot of different partners between the two of us. 

I cringe at the toxic masculinity and naive stupidity of the other man she chose. But this reflects on her and not me. 

I had some small crying bouts yesterday. Took off my ring this morning. Put my bottle of rum in the freezer and texted my new online bf I'm meeting with in a month that I love him. On to new adventures. Goodbye rocky marriage with your lack of intimacy and respect. 

Goodbye, good luck, good riddance.Hello! I was wondering if anyone had any sources for coping with getting out of a toxic poly relationship. Support groups would be great, but I'll take anything. 

I've been looking into general sources, but of course its tailored to monogamous folks. And I'm worried that if I go to a general support group, they'll be like "oh well the problem was polyam." When no, it wasn't the polyamory, it was the fact that I ended up with an emotionally abusive and inexperienced hinge, while trying to deal with my own PTSD, trauma, etc.

In short, I recently got out of a pretty toxic polyam relationship that I'd been in for the past year. It'd been my first real shot at poly. The person had been controlling and shown narcissistic tendencies, to where they'd been controlling of me, my emotions, etc. They'd put me down whenever I wasn't in line with whatever they wanted an outcome to be. There was a good amount of emotional and psychological abuse. And the same went for the former metamor, though that metamor is still dating the person. The former partner had also been controlling over the way me and the metamor met, along with our interactions. That incited a ton of drama, running around, hurt, hitting triggers and trauma in me and meta, opened attachment wounds, etc. That's the most basic summary I can give. 

I'm no longer in contact with anyone from the former polycule, cause of the amount of pain that they're associated with. I don't think I'll ever end up talking to any of them again. They were such a big part of my life for the past year, especially the former partner, to where I feel grief. And I need help coping with that, along with the abuse that I put up with for the past year.As a preface, I'm relatively new to polyamory. I approached it solo as opposed to from a couple, which seems the majority of scenarios here. 

Last year, I started dating two lovely polyamorous folks who are each married to their spouses. My relationships with them are still young, but I think both are evolving into long-term, serious relationships. 

Honestly, I have never felt more loved or committed to in my life. I feel even more loved than when I was in a long-term monogamous relationship. One of my partners was polyamorous before they were married (they only had the 1 serious partner at the time). The other became polyamorous after marriage. 

Both have done their poly homework, and for the record? They DON'T treat me like a "secondary." Their spouses have no veto on our relationships and they've even confirmed that there's no "ceiling" on how much love they can develop with me. 

Our only constraints are: 1) we can't get legally married; and 2) it is highly unlikely we'll ever share an address. I've never cared much about marriage so no complaints there. Besides, there are ways to get legal protections outside of a traditional marriage. As for cohabitation, I admit it would be nice but I like my own space and honestly, if I end up juggling 2 big relationships, I like having a neutral space to wind down between them.

So why do I sometimes feel like a side-chick? This is something I can't stop ruminating over, and I'm not sure if it's because of deeply-programmed mononormativity, personal insecurity, or because there's an unmet need I can't identify. Even though I know it's not right, sometimes I can't help but compare myself to a metamour who is "farther along" with our partner-in-common than I am. And sometimes I feel resentment that they, in many ways, had it easier. There was no comparable metamour for them, who also required their partner's resources. And they benefit from socially-approved, exclusive structures that keep their relationship secure.

I've communicated my anxiety to a degree with my partners. They seem to sympathize with me but they also feel helpless and sad when I tell them. They feel inadequate, like they're not giving me enough. As if they need to divorce and move out from their spouses if they want to make me happy (which I don't want, obviously).

We've discussed other relationship milestones to honour the progress of our commitment, such as co-owning cars or having a ceremony and stuff like that. I feel assured that my partners are open to these things. Yet I guess my biggest fear is that my partner will always love the person they married first the most. That if my partner becomes my most important person, I won't be theirs.

I don't think I'd be having these feelings if my partners were just dating other people. It's the fact that they've given someone else something big that can't be given again (marriage) that makes me insecure, I think. 

I've been doing a lot of soul-searching to try and figure out what love and commitment mean to ME (and not just what society says it should look like). I've read *Polysecure* which was super eye-opening because it's about the idea that relationship structures do not guarantee healthy relationships. So, I'm trying to see that my partners showing up for me as proof enough that I'm important.

In the meantime, I wonder if anyone has advice on how and what to communicate to my partners? We've had heavy conversations that ended in frustration and stress, so I really don't want to come across as "blaming" them for being married. I would like us to think of solutions though. Help a girl out...? (P.S. Yes I'm in therapy as I have lifelong anxiety/OCD issues so I'm working on this!)I'll add some background below, as it's a very complex and messy situation, but the TL;DR is that the person I love (and who loves me) has feelings for someone else and I want to know if my jealousy and devastation are obstacles possible to overcome, or if this is simply who I am and he and I are incompatible. I guess I also want to know whether you can love two partners equally (or simply love them both, without one having to be better or worse) - if I was pushed to the side, I don't think I'd cope with it well at all.

I really struggle with jealousy and insecurity and always have, though I do believe him without a doubt when he says that he still loves me, too. But I know that I feel terrible and jealous and angry when I think about him dating/sleeping with/being otherwise sexually/romantically involved with someone else. It's worth mentioning that we split up after being together for a year back in July of 2020, but pretty much kept being in a relationship while leaving it unsaid - at one point I slept with someone else and it *devastated* him, so it's not just me who feels this jealousy. But I don't have feelings for anyone else.

I acknowledge that he loves both her and me, but find it almost impossible to conceive of him being in a relationship with someone other than me. I don't think I would cope with him visiting her more than me (long-distance, but she is in the same country as me, while he lives elsewhere close by on the continent), and I think I would have a *horrible* time with their honeymoon phase where he'd be a lot more into her than me - I don't begrudge that and acknowledge that it's a normal part of relationships, but the thought is really offputting to me. He wanted a triad relationship and I'd have been okay with this, I think, but she and I have no chemistry and I'm just not too interested in her.

I suppose what I'm wondering really is whether it's possible for him to love us and want us both, and if my feelings could ever be overcome or if this is simply how a monogamous person feels - and if so, whether monogamy is an unchangeable state of being, just like sexuality, in which case I would have to simply leave and allow them to be together without being a part of the equation at all. My head is a mess and I feel so confused. We've discussed this to death, there's no shortage of communication, but I just have no idea how I feel right now.I matched with a guy on tinder, realised I've met him before and I'm not interested in him for a few reasons really. But his girlfriend  seems like someone my partner would connect with.  I haven't told him I'm not interested, the conversation fizzled out, as they usually do on tinder. 

Would it be rude to ask him if his partner would like to be connected with mine? He has met my partner before too and they got along well.I've (F26) been seeing a poly guy (32) for nearly 2 months. I wanted to do something special so I took them to a parody burlesque show. It was lots of fun and we both had a great time. The tickets weren't overly cheap but yeah, wanted to do something nice.
Yesterday he told me he had a great time and he was going to take this other girl he's been seeing to it the following week. I was a little hurt because that was something special I had planned for him, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to be? Like am I just overreacting?I know everyone is different and there's no right or wrong answer to how long it takes to properly vet a new partner in a poly dynamic. I'm just genuinely curious how long it takes for most people to go from first meeting to:

\- Having sex with someone new.

\- Establishing a stable relationship dynamic ("I see my girlfriend/boyfriend every two weeks and we are in a closed triad").

\- Moving in together ("my boyfriend and I asked our throuple partner to move in with us last weekend").

Are poly folks are more or less cautious about escalating relationships than in the monogamy world? I don't mean 'escalating' as it equates to monogamy relationship escalators (dating/marriage/kids) - more like moving through stages of familiarity between a meeting a brand new person and how they become an established presence in your life based upon any relationship landmarks you deem significant. **No need to argue word choices re: monogamy escalator.**Spoke to a M55 I met on a dating app. After ending a traumatic non monogamous relationship in August, I am on the market as single and ambiamourous. Because, I'm really more concerned with finding an excellent match then what relationship style right now. 

Matched with a guy. He said how about a phone call sometime. I just got off the phone with him. He had decided that we weren't a good match. Because his father had a whole separate family, a secret, cheating on his mom. So he could never trust me if I agreed to be monogamous. He would always assume I would cheat or change my mind. 

Number one, why are you wasting my time on the phone? If you thought we were a poor match, ghost me or tell me that by text. No need to waste our time. Number 2, fuck you for equating polyamory and cheating. 3. Anyone could change their mind and break up at any time. 4. He repeatedly mis gendered me (late 40s afab enby) on his lengthy monolog about how he couldn't date someone who was ever non mono. 

He had some fantasy that I'd coach him, be his buddy, just to teach him all about fascinating polyamory. I told him off.

Edit. Still steamed. Dude gave me his number just to tell me on the phone that he doesn't think we were a good match because he assumed I'd cheat. Because I am capable of loving and fucking multiple people at once. 

Oh yeah, before I was polyam, my mono ex repeatedly accused me of cheating because I once asked if he'd consider an open relationship (if you're stalking me, M, no, I never fucked anyone else while you and I were dating/married. Never). Dudes can fuck off.

Edit 2. I think he just wanted to have the opportunity to tell me on the phone how disgusting he thinks I amI'm going to a thing in Baltimore and I get to see two of my comets! I'm so excited and they are both talking as if they are quite excited too <3 After a hard month, it's going to be absolutely lovely to see them both, plus a bunch of friends. Ahhhh yay!Married 20 years. Spouse has had an off and on again non-physical relationship with a previous boyfriend from 25 years ago who is also happily married with a family. Their relationship before we met was toxic and he used her and damaged her. They started talking again 3 years ago so she could get closure. Then it continued over years as I would find out, get upset and forbid him from talking again. She would engage with him again and again and go through great lengths to hide it and would lie, but when I find the evidence she finally admits it. I have learned that she has a strong bond with him and things did escalate to sharing intimate thoughts and pics. I believe now I can not prevent her from doing this and am now allowing her to talk with him because she needs other people to validate her insecurities. I even told his wife about this thinking it would scare him off but that didn’t work either. My wife and are best friends and we can’t lose that. We are also very sexually active so no issues there. We have agreed that if things progress now that she is in a safer place to communicate with him, that as long as we are open and honest and agree on boundaries that we will see how this works. So far just the talking and not knowing has been very difficult for me and we have set it up so I can no longer have the ability to intercept. I worry that she only tells me what I want to hear because she is afraid of my reactions in the past will reoccur. She needs to learn to trust me also. I also worry he hasn’t changed and is using her and grooming her again for his own pleasure. I do not currently have any other emotional relationships but I probably need one as my own way to escape, and as long as at the end of the day it’s us and family first. 

Please be open and provide feedback because it’s a gift. Trying to save a marriage here! A year of couples therapy after the last time and individual therapy and it still happened so I we are trying to break this cycle for good and change our lives together. I don’t polyamory is the right approach or is this a trust thing we need to keep working on.I’m 41F and lately I feel like I’m just a sex object to my other partner.  He only wants to hang out when we will have sex.  He has stopped inviting me out to anything the last couple of months.  He’s the only person I’m dating currently except my NP.  Maybe that needs to change.  I feel taken for granted.  Sitting at home alone and sad again for another Sunday.I opened up my marriage a year ago (my idea). My husband wanted to try group dating. He dated the wife, and I both the wife and husband. At first, it was awesome, but very quickly I realized group dating with these particular people was not for me. There was no privacy. I felt like there was a lot of comparison, especially sexually, and was pressured to give up boundaries like condoms. Looking back, I was new and not yet used to expressing what made me uncomfortable.

The husband unintentionally made me feel bad if I didn’t date him as much as his wife and my husband, but I had another partner already. This led me to quit dating him, though I’ve tried and somewhat succeeded being friends. I continued to date the wife, and her and my husband’s bond kept building, but I found other male partners who were a better match.

The more time I spent with the wife, the more I realized she was leaving me feeling not that great about myself. She is a kind, beautiful person, but I felt like she would only talk about herself or other people, and often in a kind of chastising way that makes you feel like how you’re doing poly is all wrong. She meddled a lot in my husband and I’s relationship. I felt like I had too little personal space. She frequently talked about a long list of guys who liked her and sometimes seemed to get awkward and competitive toward me when I mentioned things like us starting a family or my other partners or my job. She is in a tough spot with her job and family situation right now, so I could see where that might come from. She sometimes talked down about her husband.

Don’t get me wrong — there were fun times too, but it increasingly made me leave hanging out with her feeling uncomfortable. I stopped texting her as much, but still tried to continue a good relationship. As soon as I did that, she pulled back very hard, and it made me feel like the whole thing felt very one way where if I wasn’t texting her and making all of the plans, I got little in return. As soon as I did, she poured love, but what kind of relationship is that?

At times when I struggled with poly, her first reaction was always to think about me impacting her and my husband’s relationship, which is understandable, but made it clear she’s not a typical girlfriend or friend. 

Now, I have decided to exit myself from the situation because I am thriving outside of this particular part of my life. However, I am dealing with the fact that I find my metamour annoying and am a little angry at her. I rarely dislike people and didn’t anticipate I’d be in this situation. It’s causing strain on my relationship with my husband.

Let me reiterate that I do deep down believe she’s a good person who cares about my husband and us. Right now this is causing a lot of challenges for me, but what have you done to ease feelings about a metamour who your husband continues to date? How have you recovered from ending a group relationship? While I wouldn’t rule it out forever, this was not the right scenario for me. I sort of left it feeling a little used and not like I had the same genuine relationship quality I had with other people throughout poly, all of which were (for the most part) good or growth experiences, and it damaged my self confidence a bit, though I am working on that a lot!

I am generally a very loving, happy, confident person so this did rock me a bit. Appreciate your lessons and advice!I’m new to poly and have a girlfriend who is much more experienced in polyam than me. (I’m a 46 y/o life long lesbian.) I’m also married to a wonderful woman whom I love dearly. I got both of them presents for Valentine’s Day. The one for my wife was a bit more focused on longevity type gifts since we’ve been together for 18 years. My GF and wife and I are all good friends. And my GF and I enjoy showing each other gifts we get for our spouses b/c compersion is a beautiful thing. (She’s married to a straight man btw.) So I sent her a couple of pics of the v-day gifts for my wife and then my wife and I had a pic on FB later in the evening, which my gf loved and commented on. But now she’s sort of pulling away. Did I break a poly 101 rule here or something? I kind of want to know before I talk to her about it. BTW, the three of us are reading The Ethical Slut 3rd Edition together - such a good and informative book! TIA for your insight and wisdom!Heya, 
My relationship with my bf of 5yrs (X) went through a very long and traumatic time alongsided with mental illness (depression, anxiety,..).
(Some stuff happened to us separately at the same time. The last years it felt like surviving, instead of being able to focus on our romantic relationship. We have love for each other but it felt like a roommate+ situation at the same time (romantic but also roommate and or surviving like). Also my mental illness may impact my feelings and relationship dynamics back then and today.).

X and me needed to start living seperately again (we lived together for 3-4 years), which isn't making it easier to get our sht together and be as happy in love  as we were cuz of our distance now and my depression isolation, but we can start to work on our relationship now as we are no longer just surviving (we only need to deal with the aftermath of our traumatic years). I still love to cuddle him v much and he gives me peaceful, calm and "everything is okay"- feelings, even tho I feel emotionally distant to him at the same time. I thought maybe that my need/drive to be with him is very low cuz of my depression (I kinda isolate from him n all my friends), but then I discovered feelings for my best friend Y (I knew I was poly before that). The love for my "new" best friend feels so new, exciting, butterflies. The love for X is kinda old and chill and almost normal?
-Either I stopped loving X as much? And Y came into my life at the same time 
-Or depression is at it's fault + plus it is normal that the new found love is more exciting (?) and therefore a strong enough feeling I crave cuz of my depression = therefore I feel like that I don't "love X as much" and only want to be around Y for now cuz he gives me the butterflies or whatever (what also supports this is that Y is connecting deeply with my emotions and it feels so relateable and so good w Y bc of it as I am going through the emotions, while X is autistic and can't do it like Y for me emotionally).
But I know it feels wrong losing X, that gives me hope for my feelings to "resurface" for him.

Has anyone had a new relationship enter your life like this and did it made you question your love for the longer partner too? bc it's new and more exciting I guess.. bc if yes then my depression may also play into this as well. Y is maybe only giving me such strong feelings cuz we are both so very similiar emotionally and I finally feel not alone/alien connecting like this to him on this deep emotional lvl.  I am so confused, I guess I would love to hear some experiences and advice. Thank you for reading, I hope this text wasnt too complicated and I got all the important Information out.How did you come out as poly, and what motivated you to do so? What if someone else in the polycule comes out first or without everyone agreeing? What if people think someone is cheating? Advice on how to navigate?Seems a bit counterintuitive in poly, but how do you feel about a (not strict but more lax) Don't Ask, Don't Tell situation? 

I started dating a man who I'm really liking and he and his wife are in different countries because of work (their relationship has operated this way for a couple years), but he says it's a Don't Ask, Don't Tell situation. Like she's told him have fun, wear a condom, but don't tell me about it. I asked if she was practicing as well and he said she's probably not, it's mostly just him. I know this is kinda common in open relationships/ENM, but wondered if this is a yellow or red flag of sorts within poly?It seems like a lot of people (including me and my partners) have been having a rough time lately, it’s cold, there’s still a pandemic, all kinds of things, so I just wanted to share some positivity. My wife and our two main partners are working towards moving in together soon and I’ve found a few perfect houses for us and I’m so excited we walked through ikea just to get out of the house and I got lots of ideas for design and I’m putting mood boards and practicing recipes on them whenever we visit (I’ve been cooking for a really long time and they’re too busy to cook so it’s a new experience for them) and marriage/hand fasting has been casually brought up a few times and I’m practically vibrating from joy, our boyfriends family is amazingly loving and welcoming and kind, it’s just wonderful, even with all the hard times 🥰🥰🥰Hey all so I’ll lay down a ground rule my partner and I had that had since been revised a lot with us both talking and discussing what would be best for the relationship. We’ve done poly from the start (funny story there I’ll share of asked) but one of the starting rules just for the both of us was that on first meetups it’s introductory we generally keep our hands to ourselves but we had always had an amnesty period where once everything was done if we just talked we could go past it. 

Well that’s where my scenario Comes in. My partner (now she from here on out) went out on a date simple movie and dinner however around I think 11pm given she’d left at mmmmm 5ish I think I texted her asking if everything was okay. Fast forward lol got home about 2am we talked it out and I thought that was the end of that. Couple days later I did the worst thing you could do I snooped and I saw their message thread. In there I saw him talking about choking her and feeling her up. I was confused she had told me that nothing happened and she’d never lied to me before about anything. So I screen capped it sent it to myself and I sat on that hurt and anger for a couple hours. When she got back home I tossed the phone on the bed and had her look at it then asked again if anything had happened. She came clean that she had lied and tried to back pedal saying nothing had happened further than that. We fought I told her I was down with polyam and that if she couldn’t do that then to leave me. 

Fast forward again we had cooled off I had accepted that I wanted polyam as much as her but the issue was that despite my explaining (several times) that I would never be able to be comfortable with her dating someone she cheated on me with I gave her the answer of I’ll think about it. Just because I couldn’t personally deal with it at those moments I finally broke it down and said no I admitted that I dragged it out because I wanted her to understand the hurt I had been put through by experiencing loss of her own. Since then we revised our whole approach to polyam and everything really. 

I know I’m not innocent in this and I didn’t mean to write myself out as such. I should have been forthright and at this point now I am. For example in a couple weeks a man she is very excited to meet is moving to the base I am at. I’m excited for her as well but I explained that as I’m going through hell with work and family that I need her to remember I exist and that I also need a little love and support physical and mental and that I was worried that I’d end up just feeling like the roommate not the partner.

So end question would you let your partner be with that person in this situation or would you have put your foot down like I did?Met my husbands girlfriend yesterday. We went on a group date for Valentines Day. I’m just in awe of how incredibly different we are. Not just physically, but behaviorally, affection, etc. Polar opposites. I find it really interesting.Heya all! Here I'm back again just wanting to give an update to you. The date I had went incredibly well. Starting in the car and driving our way towards our destination we had a great time talking. Throughout the day I got more comfortable with them and I dared even being close and just a few general touches/head on shoulder. It felt great, and after sitting down for a drink and putting my arm around them I knew it was going well. Around dinner time we had a reservation at a restaurant and we kept looking at eachother and giggling. It was just supercute. We called it a night after a few kisses that actually stunned me?! I knew they told me it was possible but they happened and I was still bamboozled. Overall we both had a great time and a great date and we want to continue on together and have a second date pretty quickly now. They did give me exactly what I needed that I cannot get from my other partner (also no worries both my partner and them are completely knowing of everything, they accept the situation and support everything). Just a happy update for y'allI'm not new to polyamory, but I'm not an expert lol. 
As a bisexual woman with strong preferences for women, my spouse has no problem with me dating women, the problem then lies with me. I'm not at the same level of comfort with him seeing other people. I know I have attachment and self esteem issues I'm working on, and we are openly communicating every step of the way. We've taken a break from seeing other people at the moment, just until I'm more comfortable with him seeing other people. I fully intend to resume polyamory but I don't want anybody to get hurt in the process. 

For those of you that have had to overcome a similar hurdle when it comes to your partner, how did you overcome that insecurity? I want to work on this area in myself so that I'm not a hindrance to my spouses experiences with other partners, his happiness and comfort is important to mehttps://chng.it/JBqYkFwcrJI have inadvertently ended up with four beautiful partners and these four people have challenged me in ways that I could never have imagined. The perspectives, insights, and experiences that they share with me has broadened my horizons. Ensuring that I am treating each of them individually, showing up for them emotionally, and maintaining healthy relationships has forced me to do more introspection than I have ever done. The different ways that I interact with one relationship often highlights my shortcomings in another. I am more fulfilled then I have ever been in my life and I have grown beyond comprehension. I am surrounded with love and I could not dream of a better life.When people ask me what drew me to polyamory, I respond by telling them that I have always been non-monogamous. I just haven't always had the words to describe it. In my teenage years, I avoided every opportunity for a romantic relationship because I was unable to come to terms with what a monogamous relationship demanded from me. I had observed the fact that almost every example of monogamy in my life was toxic and harmful (especially my parents) and I wanted nothing to do with it.

I graduated high school never having experienced anything more than hook-ups. In my second year of college, I fell in love with someone who I was really interested in developing a relationship with. In those days, I would tell her that I really wanted us to try an "open relationship." She was not okay with this and convinced me to try monogamy. As I suspected, the relationship turned toxic and she ended up abusing me at some points. By the time that relationship ended, I had discovered polyamory and began dating someone who also favored this relationship style. We dated for 9 years. We broke up a few days ago.

I have no more partners. I haven't had multiple relationships in a few years. I don't foresee having partners anytime soon if my recent experiences with dating are indicative of anything. I post this not because I am doubting polyamory or its principles, but because I lament living in a world where monogamy is hegemonic. One of the reasons I am polyamorous is because I have so much love and affection to give. I love experiencing intimacy with people. Polyamory allows me to do this organically and to let all relationships develop as they should. It's just sad that instead of providing me more opportunities to experience the joys of companionship, I feel marginal and undesirable to the masses of people seeking relationships. 

Long story short, I am sitting with the reality that I love polyamory because it allows me to experience relationships in ways that feel natural to me. At the same time, it also feels like it has branded me as undesirable for most of the dating world. (I should add that I am Latino and monogamy has a stronghold on our community)

Anyway, just needed a place to share my thoughts. If you have thoughts or even want to pushback on my perspective, feel free.I've given up on dating apps, but I'm usually friends with someone and start crushing. Then getting my feelings hurt cuz the friend is mono/not into me. It's just hard out here and I wish more people were cool with the idea of poly.To begin with I have another post I just recently posted. And I'll use the same names that ended up being used for that I have 3 partners Alex (23) Beau (24) and Charlie (29)
So recently I felt jealous that with Charlie just coming into the relationship and I was the first to date Charlie but my partner Alex and Beau I have been partners with for 5months now. Started giving Charlie a lot of attention to where I felt neglected and I suffer from severe depression due to memory loss from recovery of doing fun recreational things I hadn't been taking my antidepressants and depression hit me hard and I ended up isolating myself from Alex Beau and Charlie for two days before my meds started to kick in and everytime they tried to talk to me I shut down or ended up getting a little irritated and snapping at them. Alex after 2days I started to tell them a bit of what was going on with me being jealous besides the meds. And they asked for space since I snapped at them which didn't help me but I understand but hurts so much. (that was yesterday.) today it was still hurting because they can't give me and semblance of affection. And they asked me to go away from their room because they couldn't stand to be in the room with me. Me being dumb and compulsive due to depression still fairly active decide we need to talk more which I shouldn't have done we got into talked more and they told me they can't be around me at all for a couple days not even in group settings. And I hurt so much that I compulsively tried to end the conversation and snapped and said I'm just gonna give you your space and tried to walk out and they told me I was being a dick and I was and I am honestly terrified I might have lost my partner Alex due to this and am afraid I'll lose everyone else due to how I am right now. (I was being a dick I admit that) I have been breaking down crying the last hour and half. 

Part of me really wants advice from people and I really needed to vent this out.
So hopefully if anyone has advice I'll take it and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get a lot of I'm just being a dick and need to realized I fucked up badly to the point where I might not be forgiven. If that's what you have to say please don't I'm already torturing myself with that but I understand this is the internet so it's probably gonna happen. 
I am taking my meds for depression it's just taking way to long for me to feel better I started to feel better but this just set me back.My np and I had both agreed we wanted to be poly from the very start of our relationship, and we even talked extensively about oit boundaries, agreed on rules, anf talked with other experienced poly people both together and separately. We really thought we had it figured out.

Turns out, we really didn't. Our communication styles are wildly different, and we each agreed to rules that are inherently toxic. And of course, we wound up hurting each other because of it.

Well, it basically came to a head today, when I had an over emotional reaction to something small and all my feelings came flooding out. Which was only compounded because I was getting upset with myself for letting my feelings run away with me and hurting him in the process. 

Now my np feels terrible, I feel terrible, and we don't know what to do to fix it.

In a perfect world, I know exactly what we need to do. Therapy, couples counseling, among some other stuff that's unfortunately not available to us right now.

I know we'll get through this. It just feels awful right now.

To those who have been in long term poly relationships, did you experience blunders when you first started? How did you protect your metas and other partners from being affected by your relationship troubles?My partner A has two partners: myself and B. My partner also works two part time jobs. I live with A; B lives alone. I see A most nights after work, but it's usually just straight to bed, maybe time for dinner and TV sometimes. Once a week, we have a date night that can sometimes turns into errands or ends early because the rest of the week exhausts A. B only sees A about 2 times a week and A usually spends the night at B's. I still feel like I'd like to spend more time with A, but it's really hard for us to find time together because of the two jobs and their relationship with B. 

If I ask for more time spent together, how do I do it so I'm not monopolizing A's precious few hours of free-time per week? How does one avoid scheduling feeling methodical and passionless? 
___________________________________
Addt'l Details: 

I do my best to communicate my own schedule and keep the apartment orderly so spending time together can be as easy as possible. 

I fill my time alone easily with friends, work, and solo activities. I'm not lonely, I just miss A. 

A is also balancing internships and job hunts on top of the two existing jobs, in addition to trying to find time for a social life outside of their relationships with B and I. 

A hates any kind of surprise and needs plans to be figured out down in detail, preferably at least the night before, but ideally a month in advanced. I personally prefer to go with the flow, plan things partially and let things play out as they will.We recently got a campaign style board game, and one of my partners (I'm a hinge) brought up having Friday night be a game night for the 3 of us. 

We all live together and have all been in a slump/out of it lately. Last night was the 3rd week, and it's been such a wonderful bonding time that we didn't realize we were missing. 

I'm so extremely happy and just wanted to share. :)So I came into a poly relationship with my two partners partner A (23) and partner B (24) I was happy with it we had bumps and eventually worked it out things were not very sexual so I seeked out another partner for myself partner C (29) and things were going good and my partners wanted to meet partner C and I was okay with it I figured maybe it might spark sex back into the relationship and it did but at the same time both partner A and B have been spending all their time with partner C and giving them more attention and affection then they ever gave me. They are dating my partner C but I didn't expect them both to ignore me both emotionally and affectionately, and I suffer from depression so I ended up holing myself up from depression which just made all 3 of my partners closer and made things worse for me and my depression. Im getting better because I started taking my meds again. But am looking for advice on how I can deal with this sense of loneliness when all 3 of my partners basically stopped caring or giving me any kind of affection or comfort.  Or how I can go about healthily saying I need more affection from partner A and Partner B and also about me feeling either jealously or lack of comfort or whatever it is I'm feeling.So I'm a 26m and I've been in a committed with my now fiance 25f for almost 5 years now. When we first dated we both discussed that we will at least need to operate as an open relationship, as we've both never felt that monogamy is comfortable for us. We didn't really open the relationship untill a year ago when she slept with another couple. 

Now she sees and sleeps with multiple people and we're discussing to turn to polyamory not just open relationship. Problem is, she finds dates and hookups very easily while I rarely get a match (we both think that that's because of where we live and the skewed gender dynamics). But the problem remains that the lifestyle is very one sided which is very bothering for me cuz I feel left out. Everytime she tells she's going out to sleep with someone i get a sinking feeling in my gut and o don't know if that's jealousy or envy or me being insecure.

I feel way better when i go on a date but it rarely develops into anything, but i feel left out of that part of our relationship and not by choice. Is this sinking feeling i get because of me being left out or is it because I'm not actually polyamerous in any sense?

Edit: Forgot to add something, we both live with our families so we don't really have a place rn to sleep together, so when she meets someone they all have their own place. So maybe this is just me being a primary partner who gets way less sexual gratification than random people on bumble?So hi guys! Is it okay to ask some questions?
Basically I'm mono and v interested in this one person, who's poly. We discussed it a lot and were talking about prospectus relationship. I'm looking for sth more mono but I'd never want to stop them from anything, yanno, and they said they'd like to be in a relationship with one person (they were in sth like that previously) but would like to also have an open way to for example make out with ppl who they're in love with, too.
Now you know, I'd love to give them that freedom cause I basically love them a lot but there's a fear at the back of my mind of not feeling... Idk, special enough? Or exclusive enough? Cause I do want to be like, the most special one, or the primary, or something like this.

Was any of you in a similar situation? Can you please tell me more about feelings of being poly? (I talked to them about it, too, but I want to know more) did any of you have a similar situation and how did it work? I'd be grateful for any help, cause basically I love them lots and if any relationship does come out of it (which I hope for!) I wouldn't want to make them feel caged, but I'd also want to feel secure?So me and my partner have decided making our relationship open. It's gonna be purely sexual and and feelings for the sexual partners are gonna be tolerated. As the sex was the only problem and I'm able to satisfy everything else. 

For some boundaries, I would want cuddling, pillow talk, long hugs and even just kissing/making out(not as foreplay) off the table. So basically anything romantic, emotional is completely off the table and if you catch yourself falling for them even a little bit, you cut of contact completely and depending on the situation, we may or may not stay together. 

Now i think kissing isn't sexual, it leans more towards the romantic side. Kissing maybe as a little foreplay is okay but not a full blown make out session. For me, sexual is anything that involves the genitalia. She's told me she likes kissing me, she enjoys it. 

Edit: A thing that I need to know and is also kind of bothering me is, is kissing a sexual or romantic act (if done solely and not as foreplay)? 

Edit2: I think my situation is called swinging, like an absolutely no strings attached thing

Now I'm afraid my gf is gonna say that I'm being controlling and I might cave. I don't want to. So how can I make her see my side of it?TLDR: "To be honest I REALLY wish that there was a way that metas, especially femme metas, could band together in poly and hold neglectful, abusive, and emotionally unavailable partners accountable."



Before someone else feels the need to say it; Abuse can happen in monogamy too. NRE Chasing can happen in monogamy too. Feeling devalued, neglected, and triangulated can happen in monogamy too.

Great.

Now that that's out of the way.

There are some people who use polyamory as a tool to never be alone and to escape self work. There are people who use polyamory as a way to abuse, triangulate and gaslight people...and it fucking sucks.

I was new to polyamory. I didn't know what the red flags were. I just knew that I met someone and fell in love and was excited to start my poly journey with someone (I was poly prior to him though thought he would be a nesting primary).

What followed was a grand love story of closeness and passion that wore off for my partner right around when the NRE wore off and he started fiending for the next partner and that next hit of NRE.

There were SO MANY BRIGHT RED FLAGS and the biggest one was that he NEVER SEEM BOTHERED when a longer term partner would inevitably leave him every few months because he stopped caring and putting in the work (he went through 4 breakups the year I met him).

And you know what? I wanted to keep his love so bad (codependency- working on it in therapy) that I thought those women were crazy. He never had to say it. I thought they asked too much of him. And honestly I was excited to see them go because I already got so little of him as it was.

From what he told me ALL of his partners have asked for more of him and ALL of them have questioned if he actually loves them. Knowing this, he would offer rewards of time and energy to people though never explicit. Listening and affirming him while he discussed other partners got people more attention and more love for awhile. Realizing how abusive this is now (which my therapist has always called out).

Towards the end when I left- his current partners thought I was chaotic and just causing drama or trying to push him into monogamy.

No one EVER THOUGHT to hold the man at the center of everything accountable though some of these people have years of poly experience (totally makes sense now why my ex has to be pushed to introduce partners to partners now). 

To be honest I REALLY wish that there was a way that metas, especially femme metas, could band together in poly and hold neglectful, abusive, and emotionally unavailable partners accountable. I wish that the patriarchy wasn't so easy to harness and that the commonly said poly rule of "focusing only on your relationship" couldn't be used to harm and hide abusers.

If anyone else has gone through something similar I would honestly love to hear your story or advice.

 I'm still committed to exploring polyamory even after this awful first experience. As I work on myself I'm really hoping I can find the love in myself that I deserve and down the line- the love of partners and a healthy polycule.I'm married but separated and kinda just want to casually (ish) play unicorn for a bit.  But with so many couples looking for unicorns, how do I find people who are not going to treat me like a sex toy?Trigger warning death:

I feel like I've been generally "lucky" about being pretty open about being polyamorous. My work colleagues who know don't treat me differently. My family is rather far away so however they feel doesn't really affect me. My own little happy bubble.

However my anchor partner's father passed away recently and he's asked me not to visit (long distance) because his mother finds his relationship with me upsetting. I can't be with him or support him or help make arrangements and all those things a loving partner does - because I'm polyam(I don't think he's even dared tell her that I'm bisexual as well). I understand he doesn't want to upset his mother, who lost her spouse, and I understand it's entirely logical and reasonable and correct. But it still hurts so much. 

I have never met his father because his mother deemed it to be too upsetting for him to know about. I haven't met her again since she found out. We've been together 2 years.

I don't think he's wrong. I just wish things were different.Hey, so first of all I'm wondering if that subject heading is even a thing. I am in a committed relationship with someone and he with me, however he doesn't want me to date anybody else because he doesn't want to lose me and typical things like that. I don't want to lose him either, as I love him to d3ath. However, could I still be dating him, but have a really close relationship with another guy, but platonically? Is that even a thing? Would that even be considered polyamory? AHHH this is all so confusinggggg (I'm 17 btw)New to reddit, total scrub, and needing some much needed advice and guidance as I traverse Polyamory with my partner. I really need someone to talk to.My partner and I have been together for almost ten years now, and we have been open for six. So far our non-monogamy has been casual in nature. We have spoken about poly on several occasions, and I have expressed that I think I would identify as such. In theory, this has been fine. 

A few months ago I started hooking up with a guy who I really hit it off with. We’ve been seeing each other on a regular basis and I have started to develop deeper feelings for him. All signs point towards those feelings being mutual. 

My partner knows, on some level, what is happening, and we even spoke about it about a month ago. It didn’t go well. 

I love and care about my partner deeply, but now I’m developing these intense, exciting feelings for this new guy… and I have no idea how to navigate the situation. I’d like to spend more time with him, do romantic things, etc. 

I’m both elated and terrified by this new development. I have no one to talk to about this, so I guess I’m grasping. Can anyone offer some insight?so currently my two partners, let’s call them Max and Dave, had a talk about wanting to get closer to each other and work on getting through their insecurities and jealousy with each other. Max has another partner but personally i’m not jealous of them so this advice is solely for the benefit of Max and Dave atm, although who knows maybe one day i’ll need it too! I was wondering if any of y’all had disentanglement techniques or techniques for jealousy that they could work on. This could be anything from good books about it or just simple advice that’s helped you personally! they also could probably benefit on some advice on how to get closer to each other as metamours. we’re aiming for a kind of kitchen table polyamory atm but they need some help getting over the initial nervousness “hump”!Hi guys,  


Hope you're ok!  


My name is Charlotte and I'm a freelance journalist currently on shift at Metro lifestyle! I'm looking to chat with people today (13/02/2022) before 3pm GMT about how they plan to spend Valentine's Day as a polyamorous couple/family! It would just be a short DM/email and the intention would be a fun seasonal article normalising/raising a little awareness of poly couples because valentines is usually kinda nuclear family/heteronormative centric and I think it would be nice to share insight on some of the different ways relationships celebrate valentine's!   


Would be great if you could provide your name but understandable if not. Please DM or comment so I can DM you if interested!  


Thanks  


CharlotteTL;DR: at the end

The partners: (all names changed)

Me (Molly, F, 56) divorced after 24 years married, went through the end of a six year relationship last year when my “life partner” cheated. Very difficult for me. I have 3 kids, including one who is severely disabled and requires constant care. Currently no other partners except for Will for almost 1 year. In a Dom/sub power exchange relationship of sorts. I have never tried poly before this and right now as a newbie consider myself ENM. 

Will (M, 62) Been married/divorced once, has been poly for several years. Has a full-time job and 3 part-time jobs plus various social clubs, etc. that mean he is busy with those activities at least 4 nights per week, usually. Add in 3 relationships, and…. Yeah. Time? What time? He runs hot and cold, texting and calling every day for weeks, then nothing for days in a row. We don’t have set days/times to be together, so I just sit and wait to hear from him if he wants me to come over. I’ve known him for over 8 years, but I often feel like a booty call. Even though lots of the time he doesn’t want sex as much as he does to hang/cuddle/watch movies/etc. 

Rhonda (F, 39) Will’s partner of 3 years. Deals with a chronic pain condition, has borderline personality disorder and can be very difficult to deal with. Says she is mono with Will due to her past experiences with poly where she was very hurt by the actions of others. Very possessive of Will when she feels threatened, but otherwise mostly self-absorbed and doesn’t think of others but herself most of the time. I’ve known her for about 8 years as well. He says she is “submissive” with him, but not in a formalized way. 

Chrissy (F, 31) bi, poly, has a part-time girlfriend and has agreed to a OPP with Will. Been dating for 3 months or so. I don’t know her other than as “friends of friends”. He says she will be his submissive as well.

(We are all active in our local BDSM/kink community, that's how we all met each other.)

When I (Molly, F, 56) began dating Will we went very slowly and got to know each other better for a long time before moving forward with being romantically involved. It’s honestly the slooooowest relationship I have ever had, and I have been really happy about that. I feel we had the time to strengthen our friendship and to see if we were feeling authentic things for each other or not. 

We are compatible in many ways, (kink, D/s, interests, hobbies, intellect, financial/retirement goals) but clearly since I am posting here, there are some stumbling blocks. Because he has years of experience with poly and this is my first time, I thought he would be able to guide me through the complexities and help me figure out what my poly life might look like, (fluid bonding, what we tell/keep to ourselves about other relationships, etc.) but he really hasn’t. He has left me to my own devices to learn and figure out what I want. It was a bit hurtful and overwhelming at first, but I did take the time to do research and reading and to try to figure out for myself what it is I need and what I want from my relationships moving forward. 

One problem that came up almost right away once we moved to “dating” was discussions about fluid bonding. When I asked for recent testing from Rhonda and him, as well as offering to give him mine, he was very taken aback. He told me that Rhonda is mono with him and that when he began dating her, she was negative for any STIs and that he was as well. He said they have been faithful to each other (she has a chronic illness that limits her ability to spend time with others, plus a rough history in poly from before, so she only has sex with him, at least for now.) I went ahead and got tested and shared the results with him, but he didn’t get tested until December during his regular yearly physical. He also tested negative for STIs, but I admit I did trust him and went ahead and began having unprotected sex with him during the summer. This should mean it’s only me, Will and Rhonda sharing cooties at this point. (Nothing direct between Rhonda and me, neither of us is bi or curious).

In November, he told me he was bringing on another partner. (Crissy, F, 31). Because he and I were still building our relationship and hadn’t talked about it, I assumed we were still figuring out Molly&Will and how that affected Rhonda&Will. (ie, what the hinge relationship would look like).  I know, I know…never assume. So when he told me about Chrissy I was very hurt on a lot of levels. I told him that we were still trying to figure out what our relationship IS (we’re a power exchange couple as well as the poly) and that I wanted him to wait until we knew what was going on with us before bringing another person into his dynamic. He barely has any time for either of his current partners, and definitely doesn’t have as much time to give me as I would want. 

Will wants all 3 of us to be his harem, where we all hang at his house together and watch movies and have cuddle piles. I told him straight up I have zero interest in that, especially with someone who is half his age and young enough to be my daughter. I would feel like the parent in that situation, like I should be in the kitchen making cookies to share for everyone. Will told me that this hang up over the age gap is my problem, not his, and that I need to fix how I think. He said he doesn’t think about age when he is with someone, he only considers if he likes them intellectually or not. (He never had children, I have 3, including one just a bit younger than his newest partner, so maybe that is how he can fuck a girl young enough to be his to be his granddaughter.) 

I am squicked out by their relationship and want to have nothing to do with it. I am still very hurt that he wouldn’t pause his exploration with her when I asked him to, but I understand that is my issue to deal with. I am embarrassed for him because I feel she is his “mid-life crisis +” “red convertible”…. He’s driving her around to prove how virile and desirable he still is, which in my opinion makes him look foolish. He, of course, doesn’t see it that way at all. By association, I also feel foolish because why would I want to be with a man who wants to be with someone he clearly can have almost nothing in common with? That’s all neither here nor there, at this point, but is causing me to seriously consider ending my relationship with him. I suspect he is having sex with her, and that bothers me because once again, I have no definitive STI testing results to know she is STI free. Is it out of bounds for me to think that if I am fluid bonded with someone (and his other partner, technically), that I should also be told her STI status BEFORE he fucks her and then expects to fuck me? He acts like it’s none of my business and that I should just trust him to ensure she is negative, but that feels like a pretty big ask… 

I told him from the very start of our relationship exactly what I need and want in the future. I want to be in a relationship with a male who is my primary partner. To me, that means that hopefully someday we will live together, share our retirements, travel, possibly even marry. (That’s not a requirement for me, but I am open to it.) I want to be able to explore other relationships, at least sexually, and am open for my nesting partner to having other relationships/loves as long as he can still give me the time I need to feel happy in our relationship. He said he was open to those things as long as Rhonda was going to be around too. I was okay with that. But, so far he has been all words and no action, and after last year, I am NOT impressed with that. 

So, after getting through the holidays and watching his relationship with Chrissy grow, I began putting up profiles on dating sites. (One or two sites at a time so far). I was completely up front with him that I was doing this and even telling him about some of the funny responses I was getting from men who were clearly catfishing/scammers, etc. He responded a couple of weeks ago that “He doesn’t think it’s the best time for me to be adding a new partner”. I asked why, and he said that because it was so late in the evening, we would talk about it later. In the meantime, in the spirit of positive communication, I took my dating profiles down until we could talk so I could consider his thoughts. 

Perhaps he sees a part of me that isn’t as healed over my betrayal in 2020 as I think. Now it’s been a couple of weeks and although I have asked a couple of times, he hasn’t had the time to sit down and talk with me about why he doesn’t want me looking elsewhere right now. I have told him that if I meet someone who can give me the primary relationship I am looking for, my relationship with him might need to change to one of lovers or “friend with bennies” instead of a D/s power exchange and romantic relationship. His continued silence on the topic is starting to feel dangerously close to a OPP and I am NOT okay with that. Rhonda is OK with it, and Chrissy is ok with it as long as she can still have girlfriends too. I’m not only the old one, I am the odd one out, the only one who wants to have another male partner. 

So, here I am in love with a man who I know I could have a wonderful future with if he would compromise a little, but he won’t He says he loves me, but he is a very damaged person who has been incredibly hurt in the past, which is why he decided to become poly. (ie, he’s not poly because of loving more than one person at a time, but as he puts it “to say up front, we’re going to be fucking other people so no one can cheat”.) I feel he has multiple partners so if he loses one, he still has others to cushion the blow. He denies it.

So my questions about my current partner and possible future partners are:

1. Is it okay to expect to have STI testing results from any/all partners and partners of partners, and to ask to see those results BEFORE he starts having sex with someone else? And to at least be told he IS having sex with someone else? Or is that their business and I should just stay out of it? 

2. When I asked him to focus on me and our relationship before adding any other people to our dynamic, he clearly did not want to do that. If I find another partner, is it okay to ask them to not seek out other partners until we know who/what we are together? Or to at least get warning that hey, I am comfortable with how we are, so if I meet someone else, it’s game on? I think my problem with this whole thing, other than her age, is that I am still trying to regain my self-confidence after my last relationship ending in such a horrible way. I was suicidal, etc. and although I have come a long way, I recognize (and freely told him) that I need some extra reassurances right now. In other words, is it okay to negotiate when the relationship is brand new? (I realize it’s too late to negotiate with Will, much to my chagrin).

3. I have pretty much decided that although we love each other, there is too much that doesn’t work for me in this relationship and that I need to end it. Should I tell him the “whys”, like Chrissy’s relationship with him, his lack of communication skills, etc. or should I just say it’s not working for me and end it? I truly care about him and want him to be able to do better next time, so I keep thinking maybe if I am explicit about how his actions have not worked for me, it will help him to avoid these things in the future, but then again, he’s an adult and he knows what he wants. (and it’s not me!! Wahhh lol)

4. We originally said that if this didn’t work, at least we’d have a new friend. I would like to try to honor that, but think I will need some time apart from talking/seeing him until I can stop loving him in a “partner” kind of way. Now I am wavering if I should just completely end it or if I should try to stay friends (if he still wants to) because I don’t want to hurt him the way others in the past did, he really is a great guy, but then again…this is HARD and it HURTS and my heart is broken, so should I put myself through that??? 

I am sorry this is a book, truly. Thank you for your time!

TL;DR: My older male partner is adding someone literally half his age to his “stable”. He and I haven’t labeled what we are so I have no recourse even though this has hurt me terribly and I now feel I probably need to end the relationship. I have several questions just above that I am hoping to get some insights about to help me decide what to do, when to do it, and how to do it better next time.Hey! So I've never experienced polyamory, but I'm very very curious and would like to try it. I joined a local poly community on facebook and they are hosting an event in a couple of weeks and I want to go check it out!

I don't have much of an idea of what to expect, so I was wondering if you guys ever attended this type of event? What kind of interaction should I expect by going alone?

Thanks!Hi everyone, please excuse this post if it doesn't belong here.
I'm going to try make this as simple as possible.

I (f) and my friend (m) both like each other, want to be together, etc. It already feels like we're in a relationship. But not yet.
He's polyamorous, & I'm not (well I'm not sure, I'm questioning it?) In the past I did think I was polyamorous, however I have Borderline Personality Disorder which plays on my abandonment issues a lot & I do have insecurities. I do still like the idea of being poly, I just don't think I'm there yet.

I don't want him to give up his lifestyle, but I don't want to give up in what we could have together. & I think he feels the same.

Could someone please give me some advice. I'm dying here. I keep thinking about it & just wish I could have the same mentality I did a few years ago (I enjoyed the idea of being in a polyamorous relationship one day & find it so beautiful & magical when it works out)So full story, me (F22) and my boyfriend (M22) went to a house party last night, he has always been open with me being sexually involved with others, even in front of him, whereas I have always told him to not tell me any details about his dates since it triggers me.

So last night there were a girl and a guy at the party, the guy wanted to kiss me, I asked my bf if he's okay with it, he said he's more than okay, so we kissed. Then I had passed out quickly after throwing up due to drinking very much. So my bf kept talking to the girl, which is fine, they were in the hall, then he came into my room to say goodnight to me, I asked him if he's going to hookup with the girl, he said he doesn't know, they're just talking.

I told him, can we please cuddle up, to which he said he wants to talk more to her, then i told him it's making me feel very uneasy and can he please not sleep with her, they can do it some another time but I don't want to see it happening in front of me. He said please let me be with her, he was very adamant about it, so I said okay go. The whole night I was with the other guy, we just talked and I kept thinking about my bf in the other room with the girl and was anxious and jealous the whole night.

I cannot help but feel hurt, because he saw how uncomfortable it made me feel, I requested him to be with me, I was also not well and yet he chose to sleep with her, idk please tell me if feeling hurt is valid here. I have never done anything that might make him uncomfortable, it's my top priority and one of the rules.Hey awesome people, do you experience jealousy in your poly relationship? Asking specifically if you opened your monogamous relationship to non monogamy and experienced a bit of jealousy/uncomfortability and how you worked through this?Hi new to this subreddit! Would love to know if there are any resources or groups for monogamous partners in a poly relationship?? I did do some searches but really didn’t find what I was looking for. 

I have the option to pursue other relationships, but now is not the right time. I want to support my partner and have some people to talk with. We moved to a new city and I don’t have anyone to talk to here.Stop telling thirsty monogamous couples who want to find a lady for a threesome to try swinging. Ladies who swing solo are rare. They rarely play with newbie couples who don't actually swing.

The swinger sun tells them hire a sex workerDoes anyone have any helpful tips or even feel this same way in the first place?

My main partner (we're really secure and steady, going on 2 yrs) and I are opening up, and we have one person each we're particularly interested in rn. He has a date lined up with his crush, and she's making him vegan cake. He's a meat eater and I got self conscious because I feel not good enough because I don't bake a lot even though I want to. 

It's like, I actually am excited for him and want him to have a great time and tell me all about it, and have felt compersion with him in the past. I initiated opening up, we both feel totally okay with everything. But my knee jerk reaction/emotion is to be sad and I don't like/agree with/understand it. There's lots of things about monogamy that we don't agree with, and I want to challenge myself and get over these things.

How can I separate what I believe in and what I feel in the moment? Can they coexist? Do I just feel the feelings and let em pass? Ty in advance. <3I'm not really looking for advice and I need to vent. Though maybe I need a perspective check? Also please do not share this anywhere. 

Valentines day is coming up again and I had asked in advanced what we should do. My hope is that we could plan something together. They asked if we can do something either before or after the actual date since they have work and couldn't take time off. Not a problem. 

I started planning some activity and dinner reservations, but something came up with our friend group that made plans change. Now we would have less time together on the day we agreed to do things together. 

During all this, it was brought up that they're trying to save money to pay for their honeymoon with my meta in a few months. Ok, that's completely understandable. I was planning to cover the costs for the stuff I was planning. In my attempt to be cognizant about life and feelings, I suggested I bring take out over that day instead and we have Valentines day in to save money and make it less stressful. 

They told me that we should still go out for dinner, that they'll look at places to go (Mind you, most places close early during the weekdays here). So the day before I see them, I ask where we were going and I was told it's a surprise. 

I was happy. It's been a long time since they last planned something for me (I'm the one who normally has to plan stuff). Come the day of, I find out that they didn't make reservations and decided to just walk to one of the places that caught their interest and hope it wasn't busy. So we're at a restaurant and I'm dressed up, they are not and it seems like there wasn't much of a plan. 

Most days, I'm truly happy at this point that they've even given me enough thought that they wanted to spend time with me outside of the house. However that day hurt. I honestly thought we were celebrating. I wasn't expecting much. I came up with thoughtful gift too and they've been very thankful, but also said that they didn't realize we were exchanging gifts since I mentioned saving money. I would have been happy with a hand written note.

The reason I really feel cast aside, they made plans with the meta for Valentines day. Planned, picked and is basically surprising the meta with brunch at a restaurant. I've been asking for a while now if they would be up to waking up early to have brunch/lunch with me. If the answer isn't no, I get met with a reluctant response of: let me look at my schedule to see if I have something planned or maybe, but I might be too tired from work/lack of sleep.

I'm trying to be very understanding, but it hurts right now.My crush has a lot of exams going on at the moment, so we're not really able to see each other in person and I happen to really miss them. 

I tried to be somewhat poetic about my feelings and felt like sharing it (and ofc I'm in no way brave enough to send it to them; also my (nesting) partner and I have not yet opened up our relationship so I'm not trying to really hit on my crush, at least until we open the relationship; and yea we have a point in time in mind for that) - maybe someone can relate? 
(Btw English is not my first language!) 

》I'm so sad, because I miss you so bad 

You hurt me so much by not being here

Please, don't just disappear 


Notifications on, but I still keep checking the phone, hoping for more conversations with you, I feel so alone 

I'm caught in this endless loop, what can I do 



Keep thinking about you, about what you might be doing 

With every thing I do, I'm imagining you being here with me and what you'd say 

Is this coming off in a cheesy way? 



It feels so heavy in my chest, I know you're trying your best 

I'm looking forward to see you again, hope it doesn't have to be long until then 



I know you're busy and trying to succeed

But I just can't do anything to stop my greed 



I revisit and reread our talks and texts 

Reminding myself, that you do care about me 

Promise, I'll be the person you see next 

Still, I can't stop missing you 

Hope you feel the same way I do 《My (30f) sweetie, Eric (29m), has a casually romantic/sexual relationship with Rob (30m) and Lily (32f). The latter are married with a kiddo and Eric has known them for some time. I had hoped that Eric would take me out or plan something fun with me for Valentine’s Day, but learned this week that Lily has claimed both his and Rob’s attention that evening. I assumed that she and Rob would make plans together, since he is her more committed partner, but am kinda disappointed that Eric went in on their plans too since he knows I don’t have another sweetie to spend time with. Was it unrealistic of me to think that he would conclude that Lily has her romance partner for the occasion, and that he should reach out to me? I’m sure I’ll take myself out to dinner or something but it would’ve been nice for Eric to want to spend that time with me. Neither Lily nor Rob would have been left without a date. This is the first Valentine’s Day in a long time that I have someone romantic in my life to potentially spend it with and I’ll be making the same plans as I have for years. :/Since people often ask for more positive content here, I thought I'd express some appreciation for those partners who aren't on the relationship escalator with us. 

One of my partners lives on his own and thrives that way. He gets to switch around his apartment however he likes and come up with different systems that accommodate his quirks, and he doesn't have to negotiate with anyone else about his space. When we're together he's also sweet, kind, patient, earnest, and very present with me, and we're mutually supportive and help each other grow. I live with my two other partners, a meta, kids, and pets, and those are the beings I revolve my daily life around, but my non-NP is a lovely person and I greatly appreciate what we can offer to each other even if we're not sharing a home.

Who are your great partners with whom you aren't building the usual monogamous version of a life together? Your blazing comets, your 20-year relationships across a country, and your FWBs who want different things out of life? If you're in a mood to share the love, I'd like to hear about them.Hey all! I hope I am allowed here-this is my first time considering a type of non monogamous relationship. I have historically always been monogamous. However recently I realized I have a strong desire to engage in relationships that have a certain sexual dynamic (d/s) outside of a primary relationship. I also met someone who has also historically been monogamous but has really wanted to explore casual sex and multiple connections.


We both are super excited about each other but also for different reasons want some non monogamous elements as I mentioned above. 

My issue is that my relationships outside of ours would most likely be consistent dominants or submissive that I have. He is really interested in more causal sexual connections. I don’t totally feel comfortable with having our sexual health be so up in the air. For folks in similar situations, what can we do, especially about his desire to have varied partners? Is using a condom enough? Should we both ask new partners to get tested? Should I be on PrEP if I have male partners who have sex with men?

Also, if we start a relationship like this, is it realistic to think we could end up monogamous at some point? I genuinely don’t know if I’ll always want another dynamic outside of my relationship. 


Sorry for word vomit!
I am in a mental predicament you could say. I don’t even know where to begin. 

 The gist is this something I Persue or do I reluctantly become monogamous?


I started a cuddle relationship with my ex partner and his gf. (Her and I are best friends and we are not intimate anymore as I am not ready for another relationship with a women at this time ) We all use to date back in a poly relationship a year ago . It ended due to lack of communication and one of the partners manipulating the situation to his advantage. (This person isn’t part of this now). I’ve know them for a year and I trust them and love them. 

The relationship progressed and we now are intimate and emotions are growing more so then before  and I am now in a place where I am having some feelings. New ones to me as well.
In our prior relationship I had no
Jealous tendencies. It wasn’t in me. Since our relationship then I have had two monogamous relationships. I am finding myself becoming just that. As well as not knowing If I want this type or relationship anymore.  Now these feelings make sense due to my trauma from these monogamous relationships.  And I can logically  see both sides but my brain won’t allow me to  feel how I was before. My reasons being 1) I want a lot of attention, texting as much as possible, going out and having one on one time, good morning texts, constant touch and it’s one of my love languages. ( his time  will be split) 2) I want to feel like I have a forever, me coming into a already established relationship means if it came down to it I won’t be chosen. I’ve been left for another person several times (I’ve been in some rough life or death incidents, so this is a real fear) 3) do I want to build a shared life, I want my own space and to be able to organize my space my way and keep it organized and clean. Sharing a already established relationship and home unit it’s already set up. (For whatever reason I need to find a stable place build my own secure nest) 4) they have two young children and I have a lot of anxiety recently with kids and it being to over stimulating. I need space and sometimes a area that’s my own, but  if I had my own room I would forever feel like a roommate and that’s not something I’m wanting anymore. There are other reasons but I cannot for the life of me think rn. 

With all this being said my logical part of my brain says “ well maybe poly isn’t for you anymore”. When I am with him I am happy when I am around them I am happy, they get me in ways others don’t. But I don’t know if I can handle this type of feeling everyday in a relationship where I feel I will always feel jealousy and second choice, the “ oh she’s here first she’s his forever, I’m just a bonus” when to me he would be my everything like they are to eachother. That hurt is my own to deal with and  overcome. But I don’t know what to do because those emotions can potentially breed a lot of hurt and that is not what I want to do. I love him and she is my best friend most of me says jump in and figure it out but I’m scared.Cause I am blocked on the other thread I will just say I have 15 years of dumpster fire experience making slightly different versions of the same issue trapped in the same lack of empowerment. 

And I had every advantage.  I started early.  I had connections.  I was in the mix of the poly culture which is borne into today's world.  I was white, sexy, traditionally educated, no debt, fairly abled.

I had to be ready to say no, to say something really had to change.  And then follow through.

If anyone wants help, know someone else like me has done worse for longer and still managed to get out and make an awesome life.  I try to give what help I can, some days more successful than others.  But it's ok if it took you until today to say no.

Or tomorrow.

Or next year.Hello lovely poly folks of reddit! I got a question that I'd love to ask and navigate with y'all. 

So my nesting partner and I have came into an interesting intersection of having a crush on the same person. We have both talked about our interest in this person and we would like to individually date said person if she is into it. She flirts with both of us and seems to be into both of us. Usually if I'm into someone I'd just say 'hey I think you're a babe and I'd love to get to know you better. If you're down let's grab a drink.' This has not happened because of numerous things such as current personal transitions and also wanting to navigate this situation correctly. 

At this point I am aware we're assuming that she would consent to a date at all with either of us. She could reject one of us, or both, we're fine with that. But if the situation arises that she wants to date both of us we want to approach the first communication surrounding it in a good thought out way. 

I have never had a crush on someone that one of the people I'm seeing does as well. So while my partner and I are discussing this we're thinking how do we communicate both of our interests with out seeming like we're unicorn hunting or make this person uncomfortable. 

Side note: she is poly and has a primary partner. 

So have any of y'all been in a situation like this on either side? Any words of advice are welcome.Me and my wife had been monogamous for 10 years and recently decided to poly. I'm having a somewhat difficult time adjusting to the idea of sharing my wife with someone else but also being in another relationship myself. Does anybody have any tips for adjusting to the new lifestyle?so, me (25nb) and my partner (28m) have been together for a a couple of months. we're long distance it's been kinda rough dealing with the fact that my meta Bee (26f) can be with/do things with him that I can't. like, when he takes her out "squishmellow hunting" (we both collect them) or to crystal shops (we also both collect), they watch movies together that I wanna see, etc. I get kind of sad/jealous. I'm feeling it even more so now that valentines day is soon. I've never had a partner on valentines day, and even tho he said he'd make time for me while she makes time for her other partner, I'm struggling with how to deal with my jealousy. I know it comes with the territory for long distance relationships, and maybe even if we weren't long distance since we've only been together a few months and she's his primary partner. anyone else deal with anything similar?Mono dating someone that came out poly 6 1/2 yrs into relationship 
Been 1 1/2 yrs now and I don’t know that I’ll ever get rid of the feeling and sadness that I wasn’t good enough.I have recently gotten out of a long term hetero relationship and it was the only one I really had.  I was not looking into poly relationships originally when I started dated again but I was open to all genders. Long story short I met a guy on tinder who was open about him and his girlfriend looking for another person  for a long term relationship.  This has been something I have always been interested in as I do not get jealous easy and can communicate well and my biggest fears of poly was people on tinder only want a fetished version of it and I need a connection.  I felt this connection with them right away, which I know we need time to fully feel this out. This is their first time opening the relationship,  they only want a relationship with the three of us not a full open relationship.  I am unsure what sort of questions to ask to make sure we are prepared before we get too far into this. They have even talked about how the girls mother would not be accpectuing , the boys family should be accepting even if they don't understand,  and I have no clue how mine will react. Sorry for any errors I have never posted on reddit.And I'm annoyed because that two times in a row that my exciting plans for alone time at home have gotten canned. He's generally out for a couple of hours or more when he's out on a date. I was looking forward to ordering takeout from a place he doesn't like, watching one of my goofy shows and taking a long bubble bath. I can still do these things, but he's going to be around, so it's not the same thing. It's too late to ask him to make plans with friends and get out of my face. 

I'm sad that my Friday plans are ruined. But hey, I'm still rooting for him to find someone to go out with this evening. We have a few hours. It's not too late yet!I've only been poly for a few years now - I caught feeling for a friend of mine who is married/poly, and consulted another friend who is poly on what to do, how to handle it, and what to expect. While I approached everything from a reasonable standpoint, I still couldn't get over how I'd feel dealing with multiple partners and/or metas. I decided not to act, and to consider these feeling a passing crush...

Until I watch Kung Fu Panda 3

<SPOILERS BELOW>

One of the running sub-plots in the movie is about Po's father, Ping, becoming jealous of Po's relationship with his biological father, Li, and acting out purposefully against Li in order to undermine their relationship while seeking to strengthen his own with Po. Towards the end of the movie, however, Ping changes his tune and begins to help Li, defending him in battle before the two of them join forces into one fighting machine (Double Dad Defense!). During this scene, Li asks Ping why he changed his mind; Ping goes on to say about how he recognised the jealous feelings and how they were bad not only for himself, but for his relationship to their son. Finally, he makes the revelation of why he can now see Li in Po's life:

> "It doesn't mean less for me, it means more for Po"

This line hit me like a brick, and made me realise that part of polyamoroury isn't about just your connection with one person, but how that person's own connections can actually help to strengthen your own. It allowed me to see just how selfish any feelings of jealousy really are, and how simple it was to dissuade them in favour of my partners being happy.

We've now been dating 3 years, and I have had other partners at the time, all without any negative feelings that I was originally afraid of. So if you know anyone who's on the edge about becoming polyamorous, treat them to a movie...My partner and I have 5 children, I have always struggled with jealousy and anxiety. It is something I have always wanted to break free from.

My partner and I are committed, and are very important to each other but recently we realised that we aren't as compatible as we thought, and maybe we have pushed this along for a while. We enjoy each other we just think maybe there is more out their and we could be more fulfilled outside the traditional relationship ship construct.

I have had threesomes in the past but not in committed relationships, and I've always been jealous in every relationship I've ever been in, I plan on seeking therapy to help with my self and my healing from my parents separation.

I think I've always been interested in poly but my jealousy is overwhelming, and my partner is very interested, and neither of us want our intimacy or relationship to change much.

In short, scary, confusing, no guidebook. What do poly people do when they feel jealous? Has anyone with intense jealousy their whole life gone into poly and how did they handle those feelings?How do you guys deal with the jealousy and the sad feeling when your partner shows interest in their other partners or people they're interested in? 

Small update: I think I've managed the detanglement element 😀 feels good tbh even if it's just growth I myself (I'm very new to poly)He wanted us to share partners sexually. I didn’t want that. And I told him repeatedly that it wasn’t gonna happen. That I liked dating/having sex separately. On top of him not being attentive and other reasons that I won’t disclose here.For the people that are poly with long term health conditions-how does that effect your primary relationship. I have a lot of health issues and I’m always in fear that if we start poly my partner may find someone healthier. I know I bring a lot to the table and trust him, but it’s a reasonable doubt.  And how does the chronic illness affect the relationships you have?they live on the west side of the united states (nevada & utah), while i live on the east side (florida),,, sometimes i get lonely at night and i wish i were cuddling with them,,, i could actually give them gifts without going broke by shipping it to them,,, we’ve planned to do a group call on valentines day, so at least i get to see them,,, i just hope that one day, we’ll be together in person,,,

tl;dr: long distance relationships suuuuuuuuuck, but it’s worth it in the endI don't like Valentine's day and never have. But I'm really bummed this year in particular because I've been looking for another.partner for so long. 

Me and my husband are doing something the day before because Mondays are generally for my meta which is fine.

 Im Just feeling a bit lonely I guess. This poly journey has not been easy for meSummary at bottom. (hah)

Every time someone in polyamory expresses struggles with jealousy/insecurity, the template answers are 
- “take some time to get to know why you’re jealous”
- “focus on a relationship with yourself”
- “try to see your partner’s happiness with other relationships from their perspective”

And more. 

Yes, all of that IS truly helpful, especially when someone is new to enm, and even for our friendly monos. Basically anyone can benefit from that advice, and I have, in that I am well aware of the roots of my insecurities and jealousies and have worked hard with therapists, myself, and my partner(s) on those issues (thankful to currently have a very supportive and compassionate NP).

So my issue is, half a decade into working through all of this, I feel cheated- I expected it to be easier at some point to come home to my partner and see their grin or feel their exuberance that stems from someone who isn’t me. And in a way it has become easier, but mostly, it hasn’t, and that leaves me feeling so disillusioned about participating in enm relationships. 

I am traditionally highly desired in enm (by that I just mean what we all know- attractive demi/bi femmes without rings or kids typically have a larger dating pool than others), but I struggle with finding the quality in new relationships or in potential interests. Even apart from enm, I struggle with feeling motivated and having the desire to meet new people. I love being by myself, or outside, or with my pets, all three is great, honestly. If things ended with my NP, I honestly don’t think I would get back into the dating pool, much less try to find another primary partner/NP.

My NP has a little bit more interest in and expects to be dating new people (the ongoing panini is definitely a barrier there). It still feels like a knife in my chest. I know that’s my issue, not his, and we have had discussion after discussion unpacking our own possessiveness/jealousy/insecurities. I want to marry this man, have a kid or two with him, and we’ve made plans to go forward with kids in the future, but the idea of dealing with reproductive hormones and jealousy over metas is extremely intimidating to me. It doesn’t feel worth it, and I feel stuck in my own brain trying to process and make a determination.

Summary - I have a deep grasp on the roots of my insecurities due to long-term involvement in enm and putting in the work, but am potentially coming to an uncomfortable conclusion that I’m not interested in further/new dating, and still struggle with jealousy. Looking for input from people who may have similar experiences.This is not a critique on poly itself but more how I think the poly world needs to evolve. I’m newly exploring polyamory from a solo poly perspective. I am a bisexual female and have never been in a traditional long-term monogamous relationship. I find it very frustrating that so many poly sources of information and perspectives seem to be centered around monogamous (usually hetero) couples opening up their relationships..as if poly exists solely for the need to open an already existing relationship. 

I feel very alone. I find that non-monogamy for me is more of an identity, more of a thing I can tell that “I am” rather than the typical “my husband and I decided to open up our relationship.” I also feel that the world at large views solo poly people as just dating around until they find the right one..making partnered poly people the only people considered “legit poly.” 

Maybe I’m wrong about all of this and just overly sensitive or hanging around the wrong people but does anyone else feel this way? I’m very insecure I’ve never achieved that traditional long term relationship and I thought entering the poly community would somewhat abbate these insecurities and help me to meet more people like me but it hasn’t. 

90% of poly folks I come across on dating apps seem to be in a partnered man-woman relationship where everything else seems to be side fun. While this sub has been a great source of information, a very many of the posts seem to be from the perspective of relationships that involve a primary partner (and very much of the time man-woman relationships). I just don’t understand why this seems to be the “Face of Poly.” Why do new things need to still be steeped in traditional expectations to be taken seriously? I’m tired of feeling like a side chick to people who already have “more important things going on.” Not saying I need that serious relationship lifestyle necessarily but why can’t I find more people like me?SORRY LONG POST JUST NEEDED TO VENT 

To start this off, I've never identified as being poly until this, and even the poly people I know haven't really been in a situation specifically or even similar to this. But I guess im poly?? So I'm asking for advice 

Me (M 22, genderfluid) met this couple after they adorably asked me to hang out and watch anime with them while I was working at my coffee shop (I honestly firsthand thought it was a date asked by F/24 until I realized that the two were dating as I was introduced to M/25). There was a week of awkwardness during the first few hang outs- then we all suddenly just kinda fell into this deeply intimate friendship. 

For a few months now, I've basically become a live-in at their house. We hang out and laugh and dine and have transitioned to doing everything together until it's midnight and then we have intimate talks abt life and family and everything. 

They often hold my hand, both flirt with me constantly, talk to me in extra loving ways and call me pet names, and they seem to always try to cuddle close to me or find ways to make contact with me, like dancing, slapping my butt, tickling me, etc. 

My relationships with each of them one by one are special in their own way, and then added all 3 of us is just a constant stream of joy and content. They're so flirty that at times I feel like they get jealous of each other over me, and then I subconsciously bring it back to the group. 

Now I have hella couple friends and I know for sure that couples don't act like this to friends. I've seen them around other friends of theirs and they don't act at all like this to anybody. They are from a diff country, so at first I thought maybe their etiquette in friendships are just more intimate, and I honestly started becoming so fond with them that I didn't mind: if anything I've enjoyed this quite a lot. But it's more than just being groomed by them 

I've fallen into a deep emotional connection and attraction with this couple. It's insane and I feel insane cuz I've never experienced anything like this. This couple seems to reciprocate the loving type of conversations to me, and they make me feel special in everything they always do for me (cooking me breakfast and dinner, taking me on trips, making me gifts, etc). They naturally want me to be a better person, and it feels good to just be with them. 

I'm pansexual, and I've dated both genders, but I came into the friendship ultimately thinking theyre unavailable, since they're married. But I won't lie: they're both extremely attractive. Guy and girl. And not only are they attractive, but also sweet, caring, genuine, funny, thoughtful, and overall just beautiful inside and out. 

They recently had their actual wedding, and upon arrival I realized that I was the only invited friend: everyone else was family. Of course a lot of this was due to family/friends being so spread apart in the world, but it was a deeply intimate ceremony that they had me by their side on the whole time. Given, I also just recently met them. At the end of the night, after basically hanging out with just them and a few cousins, they asked me if I wanted to drive them to their hotel, despite already having a car. I didn't realize at the time what that could have meant, or maybe I'm awkward. But I hesitated and said some excuse that I had to do something after. 

Skip into another few months, and we all go on a trip to LA to visit some of their family. This was the peak of their flirting towards me: they basically had me as their extra partner, holding my hand and making gestures towards me the whole week (no kissing, but lots of touching and flirting). Then, after a really great day of going out, we all get to the room and pile onto the bed: M under me and F on top of me. They were laughing and just cuddling and getting comfortable just being squished to my body. And I won't lie, I started getting really flustered, and a part of me just wanted to kiss them, but I (ME) was the one to pull out with a sorry excuse of going to shower. In my head, although I couldn't define what I was feeling towards them, as much as they are hot AS FUCK, there was something in me that didn't even want this special thing to be ruined by just sex. 

Immediately after this trip, she texted me and asked me if, when I say I love them and these other things, if I mean that as friends or as something more. (The cutest way too- she said that spanish has two words for love. One meant for friends, and one meant for lovers. Which one do you say to us?) 

In this moment, I knew I liked them, and maybe even more, but at the time that sounded like a sure way of them exiting me out of their lives. Like, how could that be possible? Are they just outing me so they can put down my feelings? So of course I said friends. 

And then she nonchalantly laid ground rules that I still mean a lot to them, but there will be no kissing or inappropriate touching. But the flirting has still kinda commenced

Since then I feel like I've been family-zoned: they've kinda transitioned into just describing as their family and our love in that way. But I've been oddly jealous and sorta empty since the whole exchange. 

I'm now realizing that this is polyamory. My therapist made me realize that not only would this have been awesome for me, but im basically the reason for my own downfall. They had been the ones to have been making the moves this whole time, and if I'm not mistaken, actually gave chances for me to take it even further 

I had no idea that a relationship structure like that could even be possible before people explained it to me. I thought this was all just something I was just getting carried away in my head. 

I feel like a dummy now because now that I've realizing my feelings for sure, I feel like I've lost my chance. My therapists advice was that I should make them a valentines gift, and ask them to be my valentines as a simple gesture, and just be open about my feelings. This has me excited and so nervous: it's crazy because I was already making them a gift, but hadn't had a real reason to give it to them until that suggestion. 

My advice I ask is this crazy, could I just be overthinking this? They are so beautiful and a part of me feels like this cannot be true. Do you think this advice is sound and I should go along with it? Is this considered polyamory? What should I expect in a polyamorous relationship if things go right? 

It's crazy because they're so thoughtful that even in the future where they don't reciprocate these feelings fully to me, I know they'd just communicate with me and understand either way. But I asked F recently what her thoughts on polyamory was, and her answer was very open-ended and hopeful. Basically, that poly relationships can be messy, but with the right people and communication, they see it working. My heart fluttered, hoping maybe she knows I'm thinking of them when I ask that. 

Should I just do it and be open with my feelings? I've never been poly but for these two, I for sure damn would be. It's crazy 





TLDR: fell in love with a couple, didn't know it was possible to have a polyamorous relationship until it was too late. Now I'm thinking of opening my feelings to themI was finally able to have a more in depth conversation about polyamory, logistics and being realistic. After some help and advice from a local support group, this Reddit, reading “The Unicorn Hunters” and other reliable resources, I was able to go more in depth with my partner about how we could ease ourselves into the waters of polyamorous dating!

The plan is: after we move into our apartment and get settled in, my current partner will try to date separately. This will allow him to move at his own pace due to prior negative experiences ( his ex (A) tried to force their partner (B) into a relationship with him (C). C didn’t know A was dating someone and neither C nor B wanted a poly relationship.)

If he is comfortable with that and things work out well, the plan is that I would then also try to date separately. We’re being very cautious to take our time, do our research and think of our future partners wants and needs.

Any advice as to how to begin dating separately is welcome! Please be kind as we are still learning despite talking about this for over a year.I want to do something for my boyfriend, we are long distance and it needs to be something that I can somehow give him without knowing address. So obviously that means online. I'd like a few ideas, we both like gardening, reading, music, basically he is bi-wife energy (sorry tiktok reference). I would like for it to be a little personal. I know how to photoshop! I have a few ideas like a play list of music that we enjoy but I'd like something to add to that. Any ideas welcome!I hope I phrase this and don’t sound stupid but what do you find/seek out from a non primary partner? I know the stereotype is that people do poly just for sex. Is it common for someone to ONLY want sex from their other partners? I am mono and BF is as well but are both interested in poly, but likely all I would want would be other sexual partners-unless the right person came along to be better friends/partners withContext: 
I (24f) started talking to this guy (29m) in December. We matched on hinge and really hit it off. I told him that I was polyamorous and that I had a primary partner (my husband) he was totally cool with it and was himself really interested in polyamory. We’ve basically talked non stop since we matched. 
We had our first date about a month ago and have seen each other pretty regularly since. With us recently having a discussion that we are both open to exploring a more serious relationship with each other beyond just sex. 

I am totally falling in love with him. Which is a whole other thing. 

But here’s the issue, if you could even call it that. I’m just really annoyed by something and I am planning on potentially discussing this with him at some point.  But again we aren’t serious yet and are still keeping it super casual. 

We were meant to have a date night on Friday. He ended up feeling sick earlier in the week and with COVID we didn’t want to risk it. We both agreed to reschedule to Saturday if his COVID test came back negative. 
Friday night came and he said it might be best to reschedule our date from Saturday to Sunday as he was feeling better but still feeling a bit run down. 
Which I really appreciate because he respects that I take the risk of COVID quite seriously and we have a  big outbreak in our country atm. 

Saturday morning came and he messaged me as soon as his result came in that they were negative. 
But then he said he was going on a coffee date with someone (this person had previously rejected him when he asked them out) he also checked to see if I would still be down to hang out on Sunday instead. 

I did communicate to him that I felt a little jealous that he was going on this coffee date. He did try to reassure me which I appreciate because it was unnecessary imo. 
He said he would message me after his date. Now I don’t know what time his coffee date was, I didn’t ask because I didn’t feel like it was my place. 

It’s been 8 hours since we last spoke. It’s now almost 11pm at night. 
I’m feeling really hurt by this but I don’t even know if I have right to be sad about this. We technically are only casually dating. But I can’t seem to be able to process how or why he had cancelled two dates in a row with me but then decided to go on a date with this other person instead. 

I have no idea now if I am actually seeing him tomorrow or not. 

I completely understand that he wasn’t feeling well. But if he was feeling too unwell to see me, why was he not unwell enough to see this woman. 

Disclaimer I may also just be overreacting because it’s been an incredibly stressful week and my hormones are all over the show with my period coming early. 

Okay thanks for letting me vent ✌🏼I have recently started dating this absolutely amazing woman, her presence, her communication, her awareness of what she wants, her perseverance through transition, and of course her beauty as well as so much more has me feeling happiness again.
And I am so thankful for her existence and desire to be with me in a platonic queer relationship. But I am so use to typical monogamous heterosexual relationships and we both are recently divorced. I spent the last 7 years being with one person and three years prior to that relationship being completely alone. I really care about my girlfriend and want her to be happy with me and with others. How do I become more comfortable with this new to me open relationship concept and get rid of the monogamous only mentality? I have been reading books and trying really hard to not be so clingy/jealous. I guess I could just use some good tips from people who have gone through similar situationsThis has been on my mind and I want to hear other opinions. In this community, I’ve noticed, a One Penis Policy (OPP) is inherently wrong. 
Prime example: a girl saying “my boyfriend won’t let me sleep with other guys but I get to hook up with other girls.” This is absolutely dismissive of a bi person’s sexuality. 
I’m very curious as to if a OPP has worked out well for anyone. 
My partner (M24/pan) and I (F21/pan) have an accidental OPP currently, it wasn’t forced or rooted in some machismo-insecurity. He never asked me not to sleep with men and vice-versa. Not sure if that counts as a strict OPP though.
Edit: quickly learned that I do not have a OPP because this was never asked for, my bad.About 6 months ago, I began a relationship with one of my current partners, we’ll call him Kevin. 

Kevin is in a relationship with a casual friend of mine, we’ll call them Harper. When Kevin and I began to develop feelings for one another, we immediately communicated this Harper and initially they seemed fine with it. 

Afew months into Kevin and I dating, things started to take a weird turn. Harper and I had a few touch bases (as we were friends before Kevin and I began dating and I wanted to stay in tune with their feelings throughout this) but I feel like this gave them some sense of power over the relationship between Kevin and I. They seemingly wanted me to spend as time with them as I was with Kevin, and when I did not they would say that their needs weren’t being met. I thought this was strange because 1. We didn’t spend that much time together before Kevin and I started dating and 2. I didn’t feel responsible for meeting these needs they were communicating.

After one of these touch bases (the 2nd and last one) Harper called a very close friend of mine and divulged a shit ton of information to her regarding their relationship with Kevin (their issues, how things have historically gone in their poly dynamics, financial things), information that they didn’t rely to me even though we had a touch base THAT SAME DAY (although, this is not information I wanted to have at all. It should’ve stayed between the couple). That rubbed me the wrong way as it felt like a triangulation tactic. 

Still trying to be a good friend, a invited them on a polycule date with Kevin and I along with my other partner (Jen) and her partner. They replied that they didn’t feel like they were apart of a polycule therefore would pass. I found this interesting considering they make it a weird ass point to be spending time with my partner Jen (platonically thank god) every time Kevin and I have time planned together. 

I’ve told Kevin none of this, and honestly left majority of the weird sneaky shit Harper’s been doing behind the scene out of this post of the sake of keeping it as short as possible. 

My question is : should I communicate to Kevin that their partner is doing things to make me uncomfortable? Should I address it with Harper directly? Or should I do with I’ve been doing; ignoring them?Hello polys! My friend is a doubter so I’m looking for proof of long lasting poly relationships, like 10+ years. Thanks for helping me prove a point.One of my friends had a girlfriend that her bf of 6 months, (now ex) didn't know about and he strictly wanted a monogamous relationship. I never really liked him but it still felt wrong so I asked her about it and she told me that she's polyamorous so I told her there's a difference and she got pissed at me. Polyamory means more than two people who are in a consenting relationship not having someone on the side.It’s been a long few months but it has come a long way. There’s a lot of backstory so if you’d like please read through it not this is just like an update 

I’ve been doing so much research , podcasts, reading, etc etc. we were mono for 5-6 years. It was extremely hard for me to go through this process. There were times of deception and there were lies but I stuck through. In all of this I found a lot out about myself and what kind of poly I’m looking for. Me and my partner have came up with agreements and we’re happy with them. I wasn’t very sure if I could do this and honestly thought it was going to be the downfall of our relationship. But going through it I see why poly is so nice. My new partner helped me understand. I’ve come to the realization that i enjoy a  hierarchal poly. My main partner is amazing and they are going through a bit of NRE so it is a little strange seeing my partner of 5-6 years get all googly eyes for someone us but it’s also made me so happy to see her smile. Knowing there’s two people in her life to fill all her needs. I was very hurt at first. The way it all started was fucked up but it ended up being okay. 
Also at first I didn’t think I’d be able to have the type of feelings I have for my main partner for another. But as of lately I’ve been getting very deep feelings for my new partner. Were known each other for a year or so now but really started talking about 3-4 months ago. I’ve noticed the feelings are similar but not as strong as my feelings for my main partner. 
One thing I’m not super fond of is I will try to have Intimate moment with my main partner and be really cute and sexy. But I will literally get left on read or she will switch the conversation. When I know if her new partner would say something like that to her she would be all heart eyes and oh my god it’s so sweet. I do enjoy the attention and just the feelings my new partner gives me. It doesn’t compare to how my main partner makes me feel but I fuckin love it. It’s been years since I had someone run to me and Jump hug and kiss me like that. Lol it feels like high school again 😂😂😂. She’s super caring and wild at the same time it’s pretty sick. I wish I’d be able to get them together one day so they could meet. Unfortunately it seems my main partner still hold feelings of possessiveness and jealousy at times so I don’t think that will happen. I’ve also declined on meeting her new partner. I was trying to be in her life too much. I thought it would be cool if me and her new partner sat down and had a beer but it seems I would be better off not getting into her business. It just seems better that way. Besides I have a relationship of my own I need to take care of now. 
Long story short I feel happy about the situation in now and I want to say thank you to all you guys who commented and helped to get me to look at poly different. It really is a beautiful thing that allows a lot of love to be shared.Here is the funny tale of the 9 way paternity reveal cake I made. 

I am a professional baker and a client requested a unique twist on the "gender reveal" cake: 

Paternity reveal! 

She had 9 partners, all of whom had potential to be the biological dad of kiddo to be. 

I was interested. And the cake was adorable, and I like money, and drama, so took the job and got to work. 

3 weeks later she comes in with 10 envelopes, 9 from dude-donors and 1 from kiddo. None have been opened. 

*I get to be the first one to open all of them and compare* 

At this point, I cannot convey to you how much I am just dripping with anticipation and excitement and drama. This cake is meant for delivery. So I know I am getting to *see* at least some of this.... 

Opening all the dude envelopes one by one laying them out I leave kiddo one for last. 

My employees are all giddy to see the climax- 

Results are in.... 

I was given a colour to coordinate with each man so when the cake was cut into a bunch of sprinkles would pour out matching his shirt. I started calling the client to try and get a hold of her immediately. No answer. Email that she needs to contact me ASAP.... no reply. Im trying desperately to get a hold of her and even send someone by the listed address.... no one there.... well, cant say I didnt try !


Next day comes and I try calling, email, texting, etc again, nothing... so: I deliver the cake. I look around the room at all the anticipated faces full of hope. I have never been good at hiding the look in my face and I ask to pull my client off to the side but she says she doesnt have time. 

I am pretty much running out the door tbh. 😅 

The partners shirts are 
1.Red 
2.Orange
3.Yellow
4.Green 
5.Bright Blue
6.Navy
7.Lavender
8.Dark Purple
9.Pink

I am in the car headed back to my bakery, preparing my employees for what we pretty much know is coming next... this part I can only make guesses and fill in the blanks with my part of things: 

They cut open the cake to find entirely Grey/Black sprinkles... there were 0% matches to the partners she had up there that submitted DNA for testing for this very public party. 

No sooner had my feet crossed into my shop did my phones start ringing and my email start blowing up with how she wanted a full refund and credit and how I ruined her party and how unprofessional and awful I was and how couldnt I have warned her.... my contracts are solid and had the calls/emails/etc to prove it and I did try and thankfully her partners did stick up for me in that but damn.... 

and they did let me know a funny coincidence about 4 months later as they were long time clients of my bakery

Turns out she had been sleeping with one of her partners brothers and he ended up being the DNA match, and he was also at the party.... *and was wearing a Grey shirt*

Edit to add as It was asked and I forgot to mention- it wasn't a match to the brother and they were comfortable sharing because they are, like me, adoptees. They are long term clients of my bakery and myself also being adopted wanted to use my bakery for the occasion and since they come in frequently and adoptees have the habit of being chronic oversharers felt comfortable sharing the drama about adopted bro being DNA dad. 

No one besides the mom- who was rightfully embarrassed- was angry or bitter or upset about anything as far as I know, and I made kiddo the giant birthday cake for the whole family last year too so it seems nothing really changed.Hey all. I recently started an ENM relationship with my partner. We are both open to both the possibility of polyamory and to having casual sex partners. I am female, straight, 26. My partner is male, straight, 25. We have been together about 2.5 years. It seems to be going well so far as each of us has found at least one other awesome person who we are seeing regularly. However, I feel like whenever I go on dates with other guys, I’m constantly in my head comparing him to my partner. I find myself finding things I like about this new person that my partner doesn’t have, etc. I worry that I’m subconsciously just trying to replace my current partner with someone who’s a better fit for me. I want to stay with my current partner though because we love each other and it seems like we’re pretty compatible having stayed together almost 3 years. Idk, maybe I’m truly finding people that are better fits for me or maybe it’s just NRE?! I haven’t gotten to know these new people long enough to know all their flaws yet…Has anyone else experienced something similar to this (especially those new to non-monogamy?)I am very confused, as my partner states the level of energy given to my friends is similar to polyamory. Polyamory is not about sex. However it truly seems to be the only thing that mentally separates the two in my mind. 
Thoughts, please.When my now-husband & I moved in together several years ago, there were hurdles both emotionally & logistically that we didn't anticipate. Big & small. I think this is a pretty common experience for people when they move in with a partner. But my question for those who cohab with a larger polycule is, "What things about cohab in a group situation caught you by surprise?" 

Note: Not super interested in the opinions of UHs & closed triads. Anyone out there cohabing in a vee situation or larger poly web?Yes I’m in therapy, yes my NP and I in therapy (but we don’t get to see her as often as we would like). I thought I was over it as all of this occurred almost a year ago at this point, but I’m starting to realize I’m constantly triggered, have no trust, and it’s causing issues because I will blow up. It’s driving my partner away. I feel like it’s ruining my life being this anxious and paranoid all the time.I have two partners. I’ve been dating both of them for roughly the same amount of time (6 months), but everything about my relationships is very very different. I’m solo poly and RA, and my dynamics with each of them are unique. That said, I do find that I’ll go through these… phases… where for a week or two, I’ll be head over heels with one of them, and then it’ll switch and I’ll be head over heels with the other. Very rarely I’ve been absolutely twitterpated for both of them at the same time. And then occasionally I have a few days or even a week where I feel really solo.

This doesn’t affect my behaviour really - I still see them the same amount regardless of if I’m in an up or down for that person at that time. I just find myself getting really lovey dovey over one while I am less likely to spontaneously text the other. 

I’m not super concerned about it because these peaks and valleys are mild and short, and they don’t appear to be noticeable by my partners, but I wondered if anyone else has experienced something similar? If so, is this something I can expect to change over time - increase in severity or length, or go away as the NRE fades?

I’m also trying to relate it to my experience being in mono relationships in the past… possibly I went through cycles then too but it doesn’t feel comparable.I "stumbled" into polyamory by falling in love with an amazing man who was open with me about being married and poly from the start. I \[F\] was freshly divorced at the time and craving connection, and it didn't bother me my new love interest is married. I recently met his wife as well (one-on-one), and that went as friendly and lovely as could be. I enjoy the transparency and the unique bond he and I share. 

Here's my question, which is perhaps a very mono one. We've been dating for close to five months now, texting every day and seeing each other once or twice a week. The word "feelings" has been recently brought up. My partner makes me very happy and fulfilled, and, while our time together somewhat hinges on his wife's schedule, I view it just like dating anyone with time limitation and other logistical circumstances. I've come to trust him. But I often wonder - what's next for us? I certainly don't want him to ever leave his wife, and I have no desire to marry him or move in with him, but without any of these classical mono "relationship escalator" steps I'm lacking a blueprint for our relationship's future deepening and development. I'm wondering about its longevity. I have a child from my former marriage and might want another one - but I'm very skeptical about the odds of having a child with him (him and his wife don't yet have kids and I'm thinking that would be his first priority...? Although we have never discussed this). I don't know what else to want and plan for.

In other words, I'd love to envision some future avenues for this relationship but lack real-life examples, as everyone around me is monogamous or single. Does a relationship like ours have longevity potential, in years, decades...? Theoretically? What could a progression of our connection look like? How do long-term poly bonds look like, or is there an expiration date sometime soon? I must add here that I'm not interested in a triad or a "alternative family" with his wife and him, which I sometimes see as an example of a "next step" in poly relationships. Would love your thoughts and input!My primary (36m) is currently going through some career hurdles right now. Pulling 12+ hour days- even on the weekends! Meetings that don’t end until 11pm (international- so hours are tough) and by the end of the day, he’s just straight up mentally and physically exhausted. Because of this, he’s not really able to date which means we’re kinda stuck in a mono/poly relationship. My schedule is much more flexible and I’m able to see other partners easily, but it’s just not in the cards for him right now. Has anyone else gone through this? I’d hate to have to stop seeing my other partner entirely, but I know how hard it is on him to see me go out on a date while he’s trapped in his office. Any advice?     Edit: y’all this is fictional.      

*Inspiration: u/folk_punk_slut posted their amazing* [*Frequent Topics bingo card*](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/sopd4w/our_weekly_sometimes_daily_recurring_topics/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) *and* u/ok_fine_8680 *asked for a story containing "at least ten" of the bingo card items.

- - - - - - 
I (22F) found out I was poly recently and started to date polyamorously. Last year I started to date “A,” (44M), who is just amazing. He had two other partners at the time (“B” F24, “C” F23), and I got along well with both of them but after a few weeks C and I started dating, too. A was so happy when C and I started dating, but we were both struggling financially, so he offered up his guest bedroom for us to stay to help with that.  

That’s where things started getting weird. I went out on a date with someone I met from work (“G”, M25) and A got so upset. He said I was cheating, even though we’d already talked about how he prefers non-hierarchical relationships and would never want to limit his partner’s relationships. But B and C agreed with him (C and A were so upset I had to go stay with a friend for a few days), but they helped me understand that they were just worried for my health and the whole polycule’s, too. For a few weeks I didn’t know if A, C, or both were going to break up with me, but once I got my STI panel back clean we were all OK again. A said he hadn’t explained his fluid bonding boundary very well, but basically I should ask him if I'm not sure what is encompassed in the boundaries we all talked about and agreed to. I’m just glad I didn’t bring anything back to the polycule.  

Anyway, I thought we’d resolved this, but then I noticed A going down to his basement a lot. He said he was renting out the basement, but he left his laptop unlocked and I didn’t even mean to look, but I saw he was in a sexting group chat with three women (“D”F26, “F”F30, and “I”F23) I’d never heard him mention before. I confronted him about it and A said that they met through the local poly scene, they were in a closed triad and wanted an open minded landlord so he rented to them, and later they all started including him in group sex, but it wasn’t a real relationship. I brought up the fluid bonding boundary and he said it didn’t count since they’re in a closed triad and wouldn’t be catching any STIs from additional partners. Something about that felt weird to me and I tried to say so, but I haven’t been poly nearly so long as A and once he’d explained himself it made sense.  


Later, C, A, and I started going through a rough patch and at the same time A started dating a really sweet girl, “H”(F20), and I got a wild crush on her right away. It was kinda hard, suddenly having so much less of A’s time but he told me it was just NRE and I should work on myself to get over this jealousy. I really tried, and leaning on my metas helped a lot. Then C, A, and I had a planned date and he brought H along. We all ended up having group sex, then C and A went to snack and then H and I had sex, because I was pretty sure that was allowed under the fluid bonding boundaries my polycule has.  

H is in college, but her dormmate was so awful that during xmas break, she moved into A’s office (it has a hideabed) unofficially. With four of us in the upstairs and D, F, and I living downstairs it really felt like I was living the poly dream. The NRE was amazing. It felt like we were telepathic. All our petty arguments and nonromantic house stuff that had crept into our headspaces just went away. We mostly kept to ourselves, but A was great about arranging polycule parties with B, D, F, I, and I. 

OK, all this has been leading up to my real question. I love A, C, and H. I like my metas B, D, F, and I. But last week I got a notification that I’d been added to a whatsapp group by I. I opened it and it was clearly a polycule group chat. I was so upset I hadn’t been added to it earlier, but then I realized there were eighteen women and A in this group. Scrolling through the chat it became clear that all these women are in closed triads of three, except they all also date A.  

A didn’t come home that night and the next day when he did he was so mad. He said I should have left the chat right away when I added me, and H wasn’t in it either because we hadn’t “committed to the identity yet,” because we hadn’t “let go of society’s unethical cishet standards,” and I’m pretty sure he’s talking about when I went on a date with my coworker, “G”, idk what H did, but I’m pretty sure she went on a date with a man, that I never heard about. It hurt really bad that I hadn’t regained the polycule’s trust from that, especially since they agreed it didn’t seem like I’d understood the boundaries in place, and it hurt even more that they didn’t include me in the polycule conversation with H.  

But then while A was explaining why it was more natural for women to form poly groups that network with other all-female groups except for one man who “lives up to the full potential of mankind,” he let it slip that my metas D and F are sisters! At that point I started questioning everything I couldn’t believe that this information was kept from me, and I told A that, but he told me I was “psychologically conforming to the cishet narrative” and that he’d call a polycule meeting tonight so we could “sit down, kitchen-table style” to figure out where my “borderline-pathological mental block” is coming from.  

I know that it’ll be hard for me to hold onto my reasoning once all A’s partners are here and talking to me, and I’m sure that I have the “right” to be uncomfortable, but I just can’t find the words to frame my thoughts around this. How would you suggest approaching my polycule to talk about my concerns?  

Edit: I’ve been with A for four months, C for three months, and H for two weeks.  

Edit2: You guys we really all love each other and I agree with the fluid bonding boundary, please stop saying A is a predator and we’re all in a cult. If we were in a cult, would they have let me go stay at my friend’s while we were fighting?  

Edit3: If you’re not going to give me REAL advice on how to deal with my polycule and partners then stop commenting! Reddit ALWAYS jumps to “break up!!” but I thought this subreddit would understand our situation.  

Edit4: so it’s been a week and I thought I’d tell you all the kitchen table went great, my concerns were all addressed and I feel so cared for and loved.  

Edit5: One year later: see my update on the cult I escaped from [here]. thanks for all your supportive Dms, especially u/weeboodaddy88 for that *More Than Two* rec, I will definitely follow its advice in my new relationship with J(M55), K(F27) and L(F18). It’s going great! We’ve been together three weeks, and J just agreed to collar me like K and L. I'm over the moon. Thanks again you allOk so basically i have two friends who are dating (lets call them Oliver and Emmet). I talk to both of them almost every day and i make out with them sometimes. We've talked about becoming partners and having sex but i have some intimacy issues so its stayed at making out and hard flirting for about a year. Recently two of my roommates started dating these two friends (roommate Noah is dating friend Oliver and roommate Mark is dating friend Emmet) they've all gotten really serious and i felt a little left behind. So last week i decided to finally get the nerves to ask Emmet out on a date (yes, after he told me several times he wants to date me) and he looked really happy about it.
Anyway a few hours ago i was sitting with my roommates just talking and Noah was looking at Emmets Instagram stories and i could see some where close friends and some weren't, i was kind of confused because i didn't remember him posting so i looked at my Instagram and i couldn't see the close friends or the normal stories. I asked Noah for his phone to confirm (but didn't tell him anything, just asked if i can use his phone for a sec) and later i did the same with Marks phone. So basically i can see he posted several stories but i guess he blocked me. 
I haven't told the roommates because i don't want to start drama.
I feel really hurt? I keep telling myself he probably posted something he didn't want me to see so he blocked me and then forgot but I'm getting anxiety that i might have done something wrong? I honestly don't know what. I want to ask him but I'm not sure how or if its appropriate because he's under the weather at the moment. Any advice or reassurance?

Edit : ok so i talked to Oliver because emmet isn't feeling well and they live together and he said its just an Instagram issue and it happens to him to sometimes. I don't really care if that's true or not it just eased my anxiety that I might have done something horrible and not known about it. 
For anyone reading this now just extra information - the way we talk (all of us) is basically only via Instagram and stories. Which is why i got so stressed. 
Also things are mostly going in a positive direction as I'm getting over some stuff that bothered me and getting in touch with my emotions (such as jealousy and where it stems from)Perspectives from fellow queer people preferred 

Hey folks so I'm somewhat new to poly. I've felt poly feelings for a long time and my partner of two and a half years and I started off the relationship with the intent for it to be poly, but covid kind of slowed down our exploration if this. Now we are about 6 months into being functionally poly and for the most part it has been great, but I'm having difficulty with the concept of her doing certain kinks with others. 

Specifically the one I am unable to get over is the idea of her FWB giving her a permanent brand as a form of BDSM play. I'm not completely opposed to the idea of it because I'm also into hardcore BDSM, and conceptually it's really hot! But the idea of her being branded by someone who isn't me has given me a panic attack multiple times just from thinking about it. 

I can be kind of a jealous person sometimes(which I am working on actively,and have gotten a lot better at) and this is triggering it immensely. I've become fine with her returning home with bruises and bite marks from others, it used to bother me a little but I got over it for the most part. Especially since this is something I can do with her and I enjoy getting to leave marks myself, so it seems fair that her other partners should be allowed to do the same. 

With the branding she's really only expressed interest in having her FWB do it. When she first told me I kind of freaked out and said I wasn't ok with her friend going it to her if I couldn't also brand her. And that ideally I'd want to do it first. It is literally a symbol of ownership and while I obviously don't own her(outside of roleplay in the bedroom) I would seriously struggle with seeing a permanent mark of ownership on her, that I had been denied. Like I think I could be ok with her FWB doing it to her IF it's something we had already explored. But having a permanent reminder of her intimacy with someone else(especially form of intimacy I wasn't allowed to have) feels like too much. 

Her body is hers to do with what she chooses and ultimately I can't stop her if she decides this is what she wants. But I'm genuinely concerned that if she goes through with it I'm going to stop seeing her in the same way and ruin our relationship. I don't want to associate seeing her naked with these jealous and insecure thoughts, and likely more panic attacks.  I don't know if I would be able to be able to get over this as if it were just another hicky, I'm afraid of looking at my girlfriend and not being able to just focus on how much I love her because there's this mark there. 

Am I being controlling by not wanting this to happen? How do I get over something like this? I've read/used the jealousy workbook, read through polysecure and read a ton of this reddit but I can't figure out how to get through this one. I'm really afraid of either losing her...either by being too controlling over her experiences with others or not being able to handle the consequences of releasing that controlMy gf thinks we're sexually incompatible. I think we can work on that and she says she's sexually attracted to me and loves me and doesn't want to lose me, so she's ready to work on it too. 

Now I've been monogamous since the beginning but I've tried making myself okay with being emotionally and romantically exclusive only, while not being sexually exclusive. I'm still kind of sceptical and hesitant but i don't want to lose my gf. I love her and want her to be happy. 

What are some things that could make me feel okay with her being with other people. We've also stated that we're not gonna say a word about our sexual encounters to each other and our relationship is gonna be the same. We've decided that it's gonna be strictly sexual and we've also talked about boundaries. How do i make myself comfortable with it? Honestly, I'm not. The imagine of her with someone else just breaks my heart but I really don't want to lose her and I want to make her happy. Please helpI’ve been in a new relationship with a woman for about a month now. My wife, she and I have been good friends for a few years. So we all know each other pretty well. I’ve been seeing her 3-4 days a week for 2-3 hrs a day while my wife is working (she’s fully aware), so that I don’t take any time from her. My work day usually ends 3-4 hrs before Hera hence the time availability. How long does this NRE last? I can’t get enough of her! I’m totally in love. Best drug ever. And it’s not just sex. I love spending time with her when she has time for me. Does it go on like this forever?? 

[goofy in love](https://giphy.com/gifs/spongebob-26FLdmIp6wJr91JAI) Trigger warning : abuse 
I am unsure what to do I am needing guidance from this community. Me and my ex where together for 5 years, that relationship ended on new year day 2022. He met his now Partner F21 who herself has a primary and another partner in January. They have been talking nonstop but became partners 6 days ago.
 
  He has been sleeping with me the whole time. And asked recently if I could become a partner as well, she said no because I was her predecessor. She does not know we are sleeping together at all and is already telling him she’s in love with him and wants to build a future together . I know he hasn’t told her about us because I asked him why he would taint their relationship and he said because I was addicting. I also know he has lied telling her we were having family time with our child when we were just sleeping  together. Hes planning to visit me again Saturday to sleep over.
 
 
He can be violent and abusive and has pointed a gun at me. I got upset and made a off hand comment about telling his gf recently and he grabbed me by the neck for example.
 
 the reason I tolerated so much abuse when we were together and had a kid with him is because no one told me he was cheating on me when we first got together. I based my sole decision to stay with him bc I trusted him and no one told me. I didn’t find out till years later. Ive always told myself that I would always tell someone because if they had did that for  me my life would be so different.
 
I only played along and slept with him because he told me what I wanted to hear, that if we just reconnect and reunite the spark we would get back together and get married and that he loved me more than anything.  He knew having our family together with our daughter was so important so I threw out my morals. I want to tell his partner to warn her but im scared im going to get hurt. Idk if this is even cheating. Im also scared it will ruin our co-parenting relationship.
 
Idk what to do. Im getting mixed messages from everyone but the voice in my head says tell her or youre no better then he is. Is this cheating in a poly relationship? Should I risk this and my relationship with him. Im planning to cut him out as a friend/ lover after this and stop sleeping with him obviously but my co-parenting relationship is something, we have always been good with.
 
TL:DR:  I might be helping my Ex cheat on his new poly relationship and am unsure if Ishould tell his partner. Because im putting myself at risk.So my partner is hooking up with someone who kindaaa looks like me. I’m a white female with blue eyes and a shaved head and so is she. We don’t look incredibly similar, but for some reason, the fact that she also has a shaved head makes me feel a bit weird. I can’t exactly figure out why. The things that come to mind— it makes me sad to think about him doing things like rubbing her bald head like mine, maybe I fear being compared… I’m not sure why it’s so damn cringe and uncomfortable. I do know that this is a “me” problem though, and I am trying my best to observe this feeling and get in touch with the reality that I am a completely different person than her. It’s like I intellectually understand that, but I don’t feel it in my body. You know? My immature, first reaction to my partner is “can you just… not?? Like why?”. Of course, that’s not a fair request, and I wouldn’t ask that of him. He’s been very kind and understanding about my uncomfy feels, but he is still going to see her, and there’s no where else to go with that conversation with him because this is something I have to face within myself. I guess I would like to know if this situation would make anyone else feel this weird kind of jealousy? Have you experienced this situation before? How would you handle it?Usually I describe myself as more open than poly, just because I have a hard time forming romantic connections with more than one person at a time (my romantic side seems to be monogamous while my physical/sexual side seems to be open 🤣). But would it be a turnoff for open/poly people if I do eventually like to meet my meta at some point? Just to kind of say hi and get a feel of them? We don’t have to be friends or anything…. But just like ok you’re a real person, I’m a real person. Nice to meet you. Obviously not before they feel ready and it’s not necessary before a first date or sex or anything. But if they seem to be sticking around is that an offer that is usually turned down? Like, it’s not “mandatory” but I would LIKE to meet them at least once at some point…. And it’s not like if they don’t they can’t keep seeing my partner or anything. I guess it just helps me manage my emotions?I mean this only for myself. I logically understand that’s not how it is for everyone, even if I can’t totally understand what that feels like. 

I’m demisexual and I need to not only be physically attracted but romantically and emotionally attracted to someone to be sexually attracted, so there are a lot of people I can like or objectively recognize they’re beautiful and still not want to have sex with them. Because of this, I have never wanted a sexual relationship with someone I wasn’t at least sort of in love with. And subsequently, having sex with someone is sort of my ultimate “I trust and love you” act. 

I have two nesting partners. One of them is also demi, but in a very different fashion. They really only need to like someone enough to be friends and care about them that way to be sexually attracted. The other is simply a very sexual person and only has to establish basic trust with someone to have sex with them.

Through the year and a half I’ve been with these people, they seem to simply refuse to understand how my sexual attraction works, to the point where they are now insisting I find another sexual partner essentially “for my own good”. They went so far as to tell me I should have casual sex with a coworker I have a crush on, even though I have already expressed I’m not sexually attracted to them. 

There is also a mutual friend of ours that they both want to have sex with, and they seem to think I will eventually want to have sex with her as well since I consider her a friend and I can objectively say she’s pretty. I have zero sexual attraction to her. We saw her last night and my partners chose to out of the blue give me consent to kiss her, when I have never expressed an interest in doing so. It feels like they’re trying to push me to have a relationship with her that I don’t want, and by pushing it they’re making it hard for me to even want to be around her, to no fault of her own. 

And despite my own icky feelings about all this, there is also a feeling that maybe my relationship to sex is an unhealthy biproduct of monogamous culture. From what I’ve seen of the (at least online) polyamorous community, I’ve felt very out of place in this regard, and I’m worried I’m in the wrong. Especially with how hard my partners are pushing me to date/have sex outside of our relationship. I’m poly, but that doesn’t mean I’m currently interested in another relationship, and I feel like the harder they push the more I feel like I don’t belong.One couple I talked with agreed to have the other approve of their sexual suitor. It seemed they where sexually polyamorous, but not emotionally/romantically. They were also a part of an informal swingers meetup/club.

Agreements I think I would have

* Other partner must approve of suitor before anything ***sexual*** (dates and spending time with others are obviously excluded from this)
* No hosting on weekday nights
* Condoms for first time encounter, including blowjobs, then optional once person shows STD test results within past year (chlamydia and gonorrhea) and immunization registry (HepB and  HPV up to date)
   * Or condoms always with others
* Communicate openly about changes in relationships and sexual risk factors

[r/polyamory/comments/8mc01x/glass\_ceiling\_questions\_moviess](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/8mc01x/glass_ceiling_questions_moviess/)So me and my boyfriend A have been together for 9 years, we opened our relationship 4 years ago and were poly curious from the start, but "it" never really happened. In August, I met P on a date and it clicked right away. We have since been dating continuously, A and P have met and get along well, even though they are not romantically or sexually involved with each other. But we have a group chat and share calendars and take trips on the weekend together. P mostly spends the weekend at A's and my place. You get the picture.

Now I want to move things forward with P and tell him that I love him. I already told A about this and he is supportive about it, but he also asked me to find a way to make him part of the actual situation somehow. He has been dealing with jealousy a lot and the two (and three) of us have been doing quite some work on that already, but it is important for him to feel seen in the V and I want to make sure that he does not feel rejected or ignored.

I know he is not asking to actually physically be there in the moment when I tell P that I love him and he already said that he would prefer it to happen at P's place. But apart from that, I am a bit unsure how exactly I could make him part of the situation. Are there any experiences out there that could be helpful in this case? It would be very much appreciated.

In the past, checking in via text while I was at P's place has proven to be quite helpful. Or reconnecting once I get home and talking about both our experiences while I was away. But all of this does not seem to be appropriate right now.Disclaimer* Extremely anxious person, in therapy, getting medical evaluation, very self aware.


It's as the title says. I can't tell the different between a healthy boundary/expectation or  if I'm being controlling.

I wanna know before my partners hooks up/hangs out with their partner. (On random hookup/booty call nights, things that werent on the calendar) Is this controlling or a healthy boundary that allows me to have accurate expectations for the night when to comes to sex and affection?

We don't discuss heavy things on date nights (with ourselves or others). Is this a healthy boundary acknowledging the emotional limits of people and making sure to keep date nights "fun", or is this limiting the amount of space and time we have to communicate heavy subjects when time is already limited.

These are just examples. I don't know what to do anymore.
We got a couples counselor but there is a long list of things that will be addressed before this and that are more important than my anxious ramblings.
Not bc my anxiety isn't important, but I've been dealing with it for 28 years and I have tools to cope.
I try to bring stuff up on RADAR and check ins, but I end up needing a in depth discussion about anything and everything.
I'm feeling very controlling and I'm not really controlling as a person. I just need a lot of consistency and knowing things won't change without appropriate notice.

I get that boundaries are things I can control, and expectations are desires I expect my partners to respect, idk how really to define rules 

The only good rule I have is "don't leave each other with a dirty kitchen on date nights"okay hi! so my gf and i have started dating about her couple. we’re having tons of fun on the dates we both really like both of them and have gone out/hangout all four of us a few times. Now when we’re like hanging out we have our arms around each other/hold hands/hands on legs or knees consistently. I think they’re so hot snd cool snd i want to like make the move to kiss them? but i have no idea how to initiate that when it’s four people?! like logistically who should i kiss? how do i just like kiss one of them?! pls helpI'm a part of a decent sized social group that includes bdsm/poly/ and swingers in our area (to the tune of like 300 ppl). Today's subject of debate is over Anne and John. Anne is poly and a long standing member of the community. John was introduced to the concept by Anne and said he was open to trying it at the onset of their relationship. And roughly a year goes by and there pretty much only dating each other. Anne says this is bc she just hadn't met anyone who she was interested in and  the pandemic made dating difficult. John has gone on a few one off dates in the beginning that led nowhere. 

Enter Wayne he is Jon's polar opposite.  Thing successful brunette nerdy IT vs. College age athlete surfer beach bum that can ever seem to find his shirt. Wayne and Anna start dating Anne doesn't tell John she has begun dating Wayne bc she doesn't think it's important. John has fallen into a comfortable habit of monogamy. Anne waits a few months to tell John she's dating Wayne. And when she does it's just to tell him that Wayne is getting tested and they intend to begin having unprotected sex after the results come back. 



As the experienced have probably already guessed John looses his shit. Gets mad at Anne at first for "cheating" but then remembers he agreed to this. So now John says he's mad that she "hid" the relationship from him. She brought them both to a group event so they could meet in neutral territory. She thought if they got to know each other and maybe became friends John might handle the change better. They have some common interests they both share with Anne and she thought it would help smooth things over. 


It did not. John laid eyes on Wayne and immediately started being rude and melodramatic. Anne says John needs to address his own issues instead of taking it out on Wayne. And John says he feels like she lied to him. So in traditional reddit fashion as I sit in the bar and watch this clusterf*ck (can I cuss on here?) unfold I must ask Who is the *sshole here? (Besides me for sitting here posting this) I have no plans to interfere I'm here with my own dates and the sushi is good so I'm not leaving. 


Obviously names have been changed to protect people's identity.  I personally think they all suck for bringing this argument to what was sopoused to be eating too much sushi and drinking good wine on a chill night.Hi there! Mono with a poly partner. I'm kind of in a tough spot and I don't really know if this is the right place but I really would like advice. It kind of needs some backtracking, so- When I started dating my partner, she had been out of her previous relationship for a while. It was pretty long one and there were some definite issues there. So, when we started, she really latched on to being able to vent to me and how well I listened and supported her. Our dynamic was amazing, and we really got invested pretty fast. But one day a few months in she told me that she still had feelings for her ex and had been talking to him romantically without either of us knowing for a couple weeks. (She had mentioned she was polyamorous at the start, but she never explored it really.) It took a bit of an adjustment period because I was so used to being 1 on 1, but I really cared about her so I stayed and I wanted to at least try. Things were very separated because she wanted to ease us into it. The issue came up when he would yell at her and say terrible things to her until she'd come to me most nights in tears. I really didn't like him much after that and we both kind of developed a mutual dislike for each other. (This is the sort of stuff that happened with them before we dated, I just didn't realize he was this bad - I would give examples but I don't feel comfortable airing out her private stuff) She came to me and over time came to the decision to break up with him, eventually asking for me to intervene. During this talk he was friendly and eventually got me talking about my hobbies, but eventually I told him I just couldn't have that conversation after seeing how much he's hurt her. After this, he started yelling at her again and they broke things off in a long messy breakup. After it was just us, things were great for months. We're a little over a year into our relationship and after a few large very painful events and some mistakes on my part we've been working on us, but we we've been in a good place again for a while. She has been depressed recently though and she's opened up about still having feelings for him and resenting me a little for causing their breakup. She says she doesn't think she can be happy without the both of us, and while I want to be what she needs, he was very controlling and I was consoling her the entire time they were together because he was verbally abusing her daily. I've not been the best, but after seeing him hurt her so many times, I feel uncomfortable with going back into this situation. She says she feels a lot like we don't understand or support her having love for more than one person, but it's hard to tell her that there's a difference between not supporting dating him specifically and not supporting her feelings. I really care about her and I want a relationship with her, but it feels like my only option is to watch her get hurt again or leave which I don't want to do. Does anyone have any advice on how to argue against her abusive ex without making her feel like I'm unaccepting of who she is, or is it best to support her going back to abuse?Hello guys! I am in an open relationship and we're looking for advice on how we can invite someone to hookup with us again. We've done it twice already for the past 4 months, and we don't want to sound desperate looking for sex (i mean we are but not THAT desperate). We just want to give hints and not explicitly inviting him. Thank you.I am curious about y'all's thoughts on polyfidelity and the general consensus around it.I (27F) have been with my partner (30M) for 4 years. A couple months ago, he expressed that he wanted to open our monogamous relationship. At the time, I was bi-curious and was open to the idea. Not just to do it because it made him happy, but we each have very different sex drives and with his being much higher, I knew that would be a great outlet for him and if it was someone that we both were in a relationship with, I would feel even more comfortable because I too would be in a relationship with her.

Things definitely did not start off the way they should have. I own up to the fact that I didn't do my research when it came to triads. He met our GF (29F) through Tinder, he did not include on his profile that he had a girlfriend and we were looking to open up. She matched with him thinking it was just him that she was getting. They met the first time, without me, and that was when he told her. She was open to the idea but obviously wanted to meet me first.

After her and I had hung out a couple times, we established all of our expectations in the relationship and that we wanted everyone to feel equal since that's what it was.

I do want to add, during this time, my primary partner and I were in the process of purchasing our first home.

Things were going great, her and I were building a great relationship and it was the same for him and her. We had times where each of us would hang out separately with each other and times where we would all hang out together.

My primary opened up to me that he was falling in love with her and I reassured him that was the point.

Here's where the trouble comes in:

I began to feel unsure about it all after a while. It just started to feel like this lifestyle wasn't for me and that I was pushing my feelings aside to make both of them happy. My primary was very pushy about the relationship that her and I had. Continuously telling each of us to text each other, hang out with each other, show more affection, etc. I knew with a triad, there were going to be ups and downs, that's why I didn't want to jump on my feelings right away. Eventually I reached my breaking point because they were spending significantly more time together without me, but in the same room (spent the whole day in the bedroom with the door shut without even speaking to me). I lashed out, and sent a text saying I was done while he was at her place for the weekend.

Now, before anyone tells me I'm in the wrong for doing that, I know. I understand that I should have handled that much differently. He basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I don't make the V situation work he will no longer continue to be with me.

I'm trying to move on and be better and make amends with her because I do care about her, she is human and has feelings too. I've been trying to talk to her and slowly build our friendship back up. However, my partner is continuously bringing up that I am the reason everything failed and I am the one who broke their hearts. Even though I am trying, he still continuously throws this in my face and makes me feel worse and worse every single day.

I guess I am looking for some advice on whether or not it is even worth it to continue with him in general. He is still seeing her, which doesn't bother me, but seems to be much happier with her than he is with me. I am at the lowest point in my life and am so lost. We have this 4 year relationship, but it's hard to feel like it's worth continuing after all of this because I don't know that there will ever be a point that he doesn't bring it back up to make me feel bad.

I just need some kind of outside perspective as he has also gotten mad at me for trying to talk to my sister and friends because he considers them "broken women" and expects me to sit here and not talk to anyone about it and be happy.

TLDR: Our triad ended horribly, we are now onto a V and the past is continuously brought up. Boyfriend has now made it a point to make sure I feel guilty.So my meta is the absolute best. She’s amazing. She introduced me to a good friend of hers and now we are all good friends. However, this mutual friend now contacts me more and doesn’t talk to my meta like they used to. 

I feel guilty, like I’m taking this friend away? I love spending time with both of them, it’s always a blast. Our schedules are all different so the friend and I have more time to spend together which makes my meta feel left out. 

My partner voiced this to me as my meta thinks it’s just her brain telling her bad things so she doesn’t know that I know. If I invite her to a thing that the friend and I made plans for, she feels like an afterthought. 

I want to make sure my meta feels included. I wouldn’t be where I am today without her.

How can I reassure her that I’m not meaning to make her feel excluded without actually telling her? Because as I said before, she doesn’t know that I know.Hello there! I (20ftm) had brought up to my current partner (24m) that I had always had a pull towards Polyam. It’s not a sexual thing in the slightest, rather the possibility of being able to share love and affection in a triad style. 

It makes me so happy to think of my partner and another partner being affectionate towards one another! I love the idea of sharing love, experiences, going on dates, hanging out, cuddling, etc.. it was something I had thought about even in high school but didn’t think was an actual thing.

In the past two years, I have been doing more research in what Polyam. is. After a while, I brought it up to my partner who is also interested in the idea. He’s slightly nervous because he had a previously negative experience with another couple who were trying to force him into a Polyam relationship with someone he didn’t like at ALL (neither my partner nor the person they were Datong’s partner wanted that. The main person in the relationship was trying to force the two to date). He has expressed interest in giving it another shot since he feels more comfortable since he knows I respect his boundaries. I’m making sure to check in regularly to make sure that it’s something he’s still okay with and interested in.

With that stuff covered, does anyone have any basic Dos and Don’ts when it comes to looking for another partner?

Update: I’m an entirely open to the idea of dating separately! I still need to discuss it with my partner to see if he would be comfortable with that. I want to make sure he’s moving at his pace so he’s comfortable, so chances are that he would end up dating separately while I stay “monogamous”. If or when he’s comfortable with that, I might end up dating separately as well before we even think of forming a triad (or any other Polyam shapes lol). I just want to make sure he feels in control of how quickly things are moving (and they should be slow!).

(Edited to add more context)While poly/mono relationships do exist, I recently had a bad experience with a polyamorous girl who has a strictly monogamous partner. This is fine, but the partner also wanted to regulate the girl I likes relationships as well. The result? I was rejected by the mono partner who is possessive of the person I’m into. I don’t want to destroy their 3 year long relationship, but I wish I would have known. 

EDIT- This is me venting. I specifically stated that this dynamic can and does work. Please don’t scrutinize me for sharing a recent experience. The purpose of this post is that we failed at communicating, which made everything fall apart. Us not communicating was the fault, not the dynamic.So my primary is REALLY into MTG, and he plays with his secondary partner once a week. It's not really my thing, but it makes me happy he has someone to share his hobby with. There is a card he has been eyeing up for MONTHS and I thought it would be nice to surprise him with it for Valentine's. I ordered it and was so excited I messaged my meta to show her. She goes "NOOOO, I GOT IT FOR HIM ALREADY, I GAVE IT TO HIM LAST WEEK," and I guess the moral of the story is always coordinate gifts with your meta whenever possible so you don't end up like me. Everyone involved got a good laugh and I thought it would be appreciated hereMy Meta has been very unwell. She is dealing with the after effects of covid. They call it 'long covid'. She admitted she had been having fainting spells and passing out for a few hours randomly while home alone so we asked if she could come stay with us.

My sis said yes! She is very supportive of us. And I'm glad my Meta said yes too! She is having a really hard time of it and it scared me good when she passed out on me after a flair up of whatever it is that's hurting her so bad. (dr is looking into it).

We have been keeping an eye on her physical well being and plying her with tea and her favorites foods and she has been such wonderful company. I just wish she would stop apologizing for being sick, lol. Both my NP and I keep telling her it isn't work and we *want* to help her.

My sis is keeping an eye on her and checking in while both my NP and I have to work and I just appreciate her so much! And she bought us Sushi! How badass is my sis or what? ❤

Edit to add: I live with my sister in her house and we share expenses. We love living together in our own little communityI'm dating a plumber. And I like to make corny jokes and innuendos about him "fixing my pipes" ect. Drives him nuts it's hilarious (he smiles ik he loves laughing at me). He getting used to it I need new material. Spam me with your jokes the more corny the better.Hi all!

So I've recently started seeing my friend Kelly. They are best friends with me and my nesting partner, were roommates with us before they moved for work, and played a huge role in our wedding, is the godparent of NP & I's kid. Also note, my NP and I opened up for poly in the middle of last year after doing a lot of disentangling work.

Kelly and I have had chemistry since we met a few years ago, but it went unspoken and didn't interfere with our interactions. We love each other very much and are great friends, and have recently discussed wanting to dismantle the emotional/physical walls we constructed, and want to give things a shot. (We live across the country from each other for at least another year, they might move closer though once their contract is up.) We're both super excited!

Here's the kicker though. My nesting partner is and has always been supportive and enthusiastic about our connection in whatever form it takes, but Kelly is really anxious. They're worried about hypothetically messing everything up and not being in our family's life anymore, and is especially worried about upsetting NP.

We've been friends for Years (NP & Kelly went to HS together) and have excellent communication, so I'm not worried, even if things don't work out romantically/physically, but Kelly is super in their head about everything.

We've already talked a few times, and NP & Kelly are going to talk too, but how can I reassure Kelly that things are alright? I love them so much and I want to help them stop fretting :( 

(also: my 2 other partners are also excited and supportive, NP is the one who's most involved in this situation though)

Edit: Thanks for really great replies! I'm going to talk to Kelly more and be more conscious of their concerns as we try things out.

Edit 2: Clarified that we want to just see where things go, not jump right into datingRecently my wife and I have been failing miserably at communicating. It's not that one of us is to blame, but given the situation it's on both of us that we've been failing. Our house was hit with a double round of sickness, first a stomach flu, and then a sinus cold, so we've both been irritable and quiet. 

One of the things I've asked her to do is talk to me about dates with her other partners rather than just put them in our calendar and expect me to see them. It's a pet peeve of mine when she does this, we have talked about it at great length in the past and she had been doing great for a long time. I was hit with a blindside when I got a day off of work and asked her on a date tomorrow, to be told she has a date with another partner, and that's why she has the day off work. 

I'm having a hard time handling this right now, and I'm trying really hard not to make a big deal out of this because I know it's not all on her, I haven't been asking about her other partners lately, and so I can understand her not wanting to just out of the blue bring up a date. Am I in the wrong to feel hurt by this?Hello lovely people, I apologize if this is a common reoccurrence on this sub but I feel I need some people with experience to offer some advice if possible. I (22F) have been in a monogamous relationship for 2 years, and recently we decided to explore polyamory. My partner (22M) is seeing someone (29F) not very often but sleeping over and going on dates what not, I have not met anyone yet, but I am having a really hard time. I just feel really hurt when he goes to see her, and I can’t tell if it is because our relationship is maybe not working or if it’s just my societal norms and expectations bringing on these feelings. Is there any self reflecting/ questions I could ask myself to get to the root of the issue? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you all and I hope everyone is enjoying their time in life!This ought be a real fun one

Edit: anybody that’s going to come on here complaining instead of playing along, move along, please and thank you 😊


The headliner should’ve said educating instead of educated. Voice to text really does suck. So please do not hold it against meHi all,

I've got a partner (EDIT: let's call him Victor) whose set up is currently that he prioritizes his nesting partner (primary) and everyone else he dates is non-hierarchal secondaries. He's currently got me and 2 other partners who are considered secondary.

There has been some tension in his polycule, with his primary not feeling prioritized because a secondary partner has lived with them for quite some time and that has made private time a struggle. That secondary partner has moved out, but I'm seeing that my partner, Victor, is struggling to find separate time for not only those two partners, but me as well. I see him struggling with time management (forgetting dates, not scheduling them, rarely planning on his end) and trying to lump dates together. His COVID anxiety makes it especially hard to decide where he's spending the night.

I'm not feeling too butt-hurt over this, as I have other partners and friends I can spend time with and I'm in the relationship-anarchist camp, but I'm genuinely unsure how to go about this situation. We've been dating for a year and we've not had a lot of physical intimate time or dedicated romantic time to the point where I can say Victor has definitely not met my needs and I've been way too chill for way too long, but I also understand that with COVID, that it's also my responsibility to be reasonable about the way I approach this and I also want to be understanding to V's situation.

My question is: how do I approach this topic of conversation? I like him a lot and I feel a lot of connection, but I'm seeing it as a "I don't think you have the resource management skills to date me" kind of thing. I also think that's coming off way too hot and I don't know how else to word it.I'll set it up and everything. Just need to know if there's interest or if this already exists.

Bonus point is you're WOC and interestedAfter the previous relationship my husband made me a profile and was talking to a few of them and now the time has come where I have to meet this new guy and I am excited and nervous. Let me know what things do I have to clarify on the first meet?So my wife would like to have a poly relationship. And I trust her entirely, this isn't her trying to cheat or anything like that. I have issues with several things regarding it but I want her to be happy. I want to try to open myself up to it, but I don't have any clue on how to approach this. To those who have gone through this, what are your opinions? I'll list my concerns below in no particular order of importance. More to come, I just don't know how to voice the other concerns in a healthy manner.

1. Feeling less loved. The person she wants a relationship with is also my best friend (who I also trust) who moved in recently and already I feel less important, less loved, and honestly just left out. 

2. Family matters. While I'm not particularly one to care about familial opinions, I feel like this would be a damning issue to my family, moreso my father who I feel would cut me off from my siblings which is my real concern. Hiding the others in our relationship also would be wrong for a few obvious reasons.

EDIT
Let me clarify this as I feel I've done a disservice in how this was explained. When I met her and started dating, she made it known that she was non-monogamous. However, she put that aside for me. I did not ask her to to do this and have offered to allow her to date others if she so pleased. She has never taken that opportunity. There have been several instances in which she has developed attraction for another person. She voices this to me when it happens. Usually after awhile it dissipates. Now, the above situation with the roommate is only an example, and one case of an attraction that over the course of a year with minimal contact has not dissipated. It isn't something spontaneous, in fact we've discussed the option of opening the relationship, only for her to refuse.Hi, I am in an open relationship, so we're not polyamorous yet but non-monogamous and both open to having more relationships. 
I am very new to non-monogamy and after being in a monogamous relationship that felt limiting I decided  to try and overall I like it and I felt like it fits. 

Atm, my anxiety and fear is triggered for multiple reasons but now I also feel insecure in my open relationship bc safety is my biggest need rn. My partner knows about it. I would love to hear some advice from people who have more experience. I am sure it's quite normal to feel insecure in the beginning of something new and also throughout. 
I am nervous that there's a part of me that wants to go back to monogamy and I wanna figure out if that's the case or if there's just stuff that's triggered I need to be working on 
I feel like my mind is lying to me because it's telling me monogamy would make me feel safer simply because I am in a vulnerable place rn and I'm afraid to lose my partner. Monogamous or not, that could happen tho and the attempt of my mind to convince me monogamy is safer is just caused by being surrounded by monogamy I guess 

So, I need help understanding that my partner also having other relationships doesn't necessarily mean I'm unsafe/about to be left etc.. 

Some other thoughts: 
Is not wanting to share your partner toxic entitlement or simply a pillar of monogamy?
- it could simply be a monogamous mindset which is fine or it could be based on fear and possessiveness
but how does one figure out how to differentiate between healthy monogamy or fear driven possessiveness and entitlement?
If imagining your partner with someone else makes you uncomfortable, does that mean you should be monogamous or does that mean you should be doing inner work in terms of jealousy, insecurities, abandonment issues - questioning why you feel uncomfortable

It's difficult to outgrow toxic monogamous ideas/standards but I am very willing to learn and understand 

Thanks in advance for constructive feedback and advice ^^I live with my partner Bob. His trauma is activating my trauma and I just need to be done with that. 

Bob and I date Tina. She has a lot of mental illnesses and it takes up all the emotional space when we are together.  She lives in the same city but not with us. 

Bob and I also date Cecelia. That is a long distance thing, and they were together then I got into it after dating Bob for a while. 

How do I politely and nicely tell Bob I can't handle his shit? How do I break up with Tina without making her feel like a freak? How do I break up with 3 people, do laundry and grocery shopping, in 1 day? I work 2 jobs right now and Saturday is my only day off until next month. And I work until 9pm Friday. 

Sorry for the epic download of info but I've not broken up with people in a poly situation before. I don't care if I look like the bad guy to them after this I just don't want them to feel worthless afterwards.Just wanted to share some positivity :)

I'm so pumped! I (they/them) have a solo dinner date with my NP (he/him) on Saturday, then a group date with our other partner (she/her) on Sunday! My NP and I will probably do something small on the 14th too, but will probably just hang with our friends.

We're each planning lil' solo long distance dates with her too, which is so fun!

I'm also planning something with my other partner (they/them) for later in the week, and might be able to do something with someone else I'm seeing (he/him)...AAAA I love being in a polycule!God, I’m in love with two totally different men, and I love it!! I often wonder how I’ve been so blessed to have my yin and my yang. It’s amazing! Feeling very fulfilled. In this case I can have my cake and eat it to, or cuddle it or whatever. HahaThis is my first time trying polyamory. I’ve been interested in trying it for a while but I tend to be more demisexual so finding partners takes time for me. My boyfriend is very “poly by nature” and wants lots of freedoms to explore every crush, which he gets quite often. I feel that this imbalance is too much for primary partners, but he does not. Especially because I feel my needs are not fully being met. Looking for advice from those who have been in a similar situation? I’d like to keep the connection.Update: We talked and the "still deciding" refers to deciding if she wants to have *anything at all* to do with him considering the red flags :) We're both on the same page - kind of intrigued, and super wary.

(TLDR: My gf is chatting with a guy who’s moving way too fast, and it scares me)

I (51m) and my wife (52f) opened up last year. We did the work - read tons of books/articles/podcasts/thousands of Reddit posts. Talked exhaustively into the night for months. Learned and Unlearned a lot, and have been doing really well so far. We are completely different people than we were a year ago, and have grown so much closer.

I have been seeing my gf (51f) for a few months, and we all get along in this V (they aren’t sexual with each other, but we play together sometimes). We all get along really well and I am deeply in love with her. Recently my GF has been chatting with a guy she met locally (in person) in a poly discussion group. Apparently he’s been moving pretty fast in their messages over the past few weeks, and he’s already asked to meet her son. (Way too quick, IMO) He’s also mentioned that he’d like her to ‘join his polycule’ and alluded to possibly moving in.

Now, keep in mind they’ve only met in person once or twice, and have not been sexual ( he has a health condition) with each other yet. My GF told me these details because she invited me to a Super Bowl party at his house, and wanted me to know what I was walking into. So first off, lemme say I see the red flags waving, but I’m unsure what to do here.

For context: We’ve been learning a lot about attachment styles, and I’ve discovered that I am secure with my NP, but very anxious with my GF. I think this is due to the fact that my NP will share all the details of her time with others freely (with their consent) but with my GF I have to ask questions and most of the time she has not asked for consent to share - so there’s always an unknown element.

My irrational fears (didn’t I fix all that?) went into overdrive when my GF told me about him last night & said she’s “still deciding”. What? That felt like a kick in the stomach. I actually had to get off the phone. Spent the rest if the night torturing myself with my own imagination.

I realize I need clarity on what that means, exactly. I’ll talk to her later today about it.

My questions: (in order of importance)

What is my work in this? What steps can I take to become more secure with the unknowns?

Is it ‘normal’ to have such different attachment styles with different partners?

Should I go to the SB party and meet this guy to see what he’s all about?

Irrational fears/ questions - she’ll join that polycule, and I’ll lose her somehow. Wtf? Can one be a member if more than one polycule? In BDSM dynamics - if she becomes his sub, will he control who she’s allowed to see?

What would you do?

(Edit-grammar)How do I know whether I'm polyamorous- or just a horny cheater?

I love my partner but can't help having that wandering eye and reach out to people. 

Any words of wisdom please? Do i need meds, psychiatric help, self discipline...?This is gonna be lightly graphic so scroll away if you don't fancy that.

.
.
 
EDIT TWO: Folks please read this. I can have completely condomless sex with one of these people. They just can't cum inside anyone apart from their partner so they have to pull out. This has nothing to do with STI risk.



EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I wasn't clear here and I had a brain fart and said the wrong thing in the comments. With one person I can go bare back with but they can't ejaculate inside anyone but their partner, and with the other they wear a condom with everyone apart from their partner. 

.


And I don't mean that no one can do it. I mean that they can with one person.... but not with others? With all others they require barrier protection or pull out?
I don't get it. 
This is with sex including a penis and a vagina, btw.

I'm dating 2 people right now who both have the one relationship and some unlabelled more casual things (for which category I fall into) that both have this rule.
That they only cum inside this one person they're in an official relationship with and no one else. 
And I can't wrap my head around why? 
I'm pretty certain that even if I were to be official with either of them I still wouldn't be granted semen rights (or whatever funny thing you wanna call it).

If people are using hormonal contraception then it's surely not about a pregnancy risk. And if everyone's getting tested regularly I just don't see an issue. Especially if there are other exchange of fluids so the STI risk is still there.

Everyone can have their own rules etc., but this just feels like a weird possessiveness? 
I know for at least one of them it's a rule set up by their partner and not themselves, and they'd want to cum inside me if they could. (EDIT: I want to add here that I don't think the person who brought in this rule here is evil or anything like that, and it wasn't phrased in a negative and blaming way. Just that they won't because their partner doesn't want them to, but they would like to. I don't see the partner in a bad light outside of the whole placing rules about what someone else can do with their gentails that isn't even close to being about safety. And yes, I know they they agreed to it and there is no blame here to shift. That's not how I see it anyway)

I'm sorry if this is graphic BTW. I just can't find a less on the nose way to describe it.

If anyone has an answer then I'll hear it but I'm mostly just here to vent. I dislike hierarchy in polyamory and this feels like a weird dibs or "first come, first serve" (pun intended) but with someone sex life???Exactly what it says on the tin, basically. I’m [28F] in a long-term relationship with my nesting partner [29NB but she/her pronouns], and I’ve had several other partners during the time we’ve been together. She, on the other hand, hasn’t had much luck. I know it’s mainly because a. I’m the extrovert between the two of us and b. I am pansexual, whereas she is ONLY attracted to feminine cis women (she’s not a TERF and actually feels really guilty about not being attracted to trans girls, but she just doesn’t like penises at all). The point being, I’m only having this much success because my dating pool is a lot deeper than hers, but she’s starting to feel like she’s undesirable because of how little luck she’s had in comparison. I don’t know how to show her that it’s not her fault and that there’s nothing wrong with her. What should I do?!I’ve been seeing someone for the past 8 months but he never wanted to explore a romantic relationship since he has certain ideas and wishes about his partner that I can’t fulfill (+ he has some commitment issues). Ever since we got to know eachother, we’ve been talking and acting like we were in a relationship but with the sidenote that “we’re just friends with benefits”. He knew that I developed feelings for him months back and we’ve been communicating clearly about our needs and our boundaries. The “rules” we had were pretty open, the only requirement was to be honest about any romantic or sexual interactions with others. Although we can both do whatever we want, we’ve both only had 1 sexual interaction with someone else since we got to know eachother.

Last week we had a conversation and he told me he didn’t want to continue our relationship like this and that he wanted to let the romance flow. He told me how much he appreciates me and that he started to develop feelings aswell and doesn’t want to keep supressing them. We do however want to keep our same rule and want the other person to be able to experiment and interact as much as their heart desires.

I really like this arrangement and am very happy with how everything is going but I know that I’m a very jealous person. I try to be supportive but I’m a bit scared that it might not work out because of the jealousy. 

I wanted to ask advice about what I can do to make this work and how I can try to fix my issue with jealousy since it’s a trait I dislike a lot. We both haven’t had a relationship like this before. What tips do you have for a person who’s new to polyamory and open relationships?If you’re poly and children are involved please tell me about your set up as far as co-parenting. My partner (male) is married to a woman. They have 3 children (7, 6 and 3 yrs old) and me and my partner have 3 children (8 month old twins and a 3 yr old). We all at one point lived together and currently we do not. The wife and I are not on good terms and longer since the pregnancy and birth of my twins.
My fear is that my children will be mistreated, neglected or left to feel abandoned later in life. I live separately and me and my partner share our children in both of our households. I live alone and my partner lives with his wife, parents and their children. Any tips, advice, feedback on how we can make this a positive experience for all of our children would be greatly appreciated. I welcome any questions.What’s something you would of loved to had heard from someone else when it comes to the whole poly experience when you first started down this awesome and loving journey? 

What’s some ways to help someone like me when navigating the dating world? 

I would love to hear some your thoughts 😊So I’ve never truly been in a poly relationship (though one relationship has been pointed out by friends that it was poly and just not properly communicated), but I’m not opposed to them and within that past few years I think I’ve formed a desire for a specific type of relationship that I think I would be happiest in. This doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be willing to do other types, and I wouldn’t refuse to date someone just because they DIDNT want what I think would be optimal for me. But anyways, I think I would be happiest in a relationship that was me and two women. I feel like saying that gets most people thinking “oh he just wants threesomes” but my sexual preference is complicated and I identify more towards asexual, but with romantic interest for only women and not men. If I had an attraction to men I wouldn’t mind being in a relationship with two dudes or one dude one woman, but I’m not attracted to men so I don’t feel comfortable with a man being part of it. Does this mean I’m being selfish or perverted? Logically I tell myself I don’t think so, we all have our preferences and types and shouldn’t feel bad for liking what we like as long as no harm comes from it, but I can’t help but shake a feeling of being guilty or being looked at as wrong somehow. What do you think?

I don’t know how important or relevant it is, but I was born male and identify as male but I really wouldn’t care if others identified me as anything else. I very much hold traditional masculine features through natural muscle development and full facial hair.

Fairly new to the concept of polyamory, and really wanting to give it a go. Any advice is appreciated[EDIT: I am in favor of open relationships in which boundaries are agreed to. Commitment to those boundaries involves respect for my partner and respect for myself. Sometimes people's boundaries involve participation as a couple only. Sometimes it involves just checking in with your partner before going to meet someone else, because if your partner is having a super shitty day, they might need their partner for support. It's not marriage. It's not ownership. It's a mutually agreed upon ideology that monogamy isn't for everyone, and that you trust one another enough to know that when it's time to be a couple - when a team of two is necessary to accomplish something  - you're going to be that force that makes the whole larger than the sum of its parts and take on your troubles.

That was the context of what I was referring to within my post. Not kink, nor the various abbreviations associated with them. Thank you to the peeps who addressed my post as mature adults.

In contrast, I've got a collection of phallic ball gags and Scold's bridal masks for the assumptive mind vomit crowd. Don't be afraid. I'll teach you to enjoy them. Trust me.]

ORIGINAL POST: My understanding of the definition of polyamory is "the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the INFORMED CONSENT of all partners involved."

My experience has been that "informed consent" is often left to interpretation, but it's not up for interpretation Someone who so consistently lives in fear that they can't be honest with their partner about their other relationships isn't ready for a polyamorous life. People get hurt unnecessarily, which, in my opinion, negates the spirit of what polyamory attempts to establish.

It shouldn't have to be pointed out that without informed consent, we're left with a lying, cheating, poser of a human being, whose last few romantic partners were scooped up while trailing tail at a meeting of Sexaholics Anonymous.

I'd like to hear some opinions on this. It's possible that I'm being too much of a hard-ass about this. I must concede that possibility. Constructive criticism is always welcome, as long as it's not dickish. Thanks.I'm feeling bad and confused sometimes, and I'd like another opinion on how I've approached the below situation. 

I have two committed relationships, both approximately two years old. 
One of my partners is poly-oriented, while the other is mono.

My mono partner knew I was poly-oriented when we were getting close and knew that I had a different nesting partner at the time and everything. I explained the process I went through where I discovered I was more poly too. 

From time to time, we have conversations about being incompatible in a variety of ways, mostly due to sex and poly/mono stuff. We talk about it, they decide that they're happy with me and couldn't imagine me not being their friend anyway, and we continue on. 
We spend lots of time together and I tell them my plans like I do with any partner. 
They've met my other partner and we hang out together and play games sometimes. 

Sometimes I feel really bad though. 
When I see romantic movies, I can't help but think "if I love this person, I'd do anything! I'd even change myself"
I know that I can't possibly do that though, and I try my best to respect who I am and what I want in my life. Sometimes I get a bit lost though. 

During Covid I haven't seen anyone new really. 
However, soon I want to go on a date and make more friends. I don't necessarily want anything to happen fast or to enter into a new relationship, I just want to socialize as my authentic self - which is poly and kinda kinky. 

Thank you for your time reading this and for any insight or feedback. 
Worse case, even just talking about it helps :)Hi! 

So I have met this guy online some months ago and he invited me to his home where he lives with his boyfriend. I did not know what to expect at all, but we ended up having a threesome that night - to be honest I wasn't as much into his boyfriend since he's not really my type, but it was fun. I thought that would be the end of the story, but it turns out both me and the guy I met online really fell for each other - like really really. In the past weeks the contact among the three of us has increased and things are getting more serious, we didn't define any relationship structure yet, but this is something that will happen soon and I'm really anxious since my feelings towards them are very different. I know a triad means there are 4 relationships: i really like the one with the guy I met online, I really like the exchange we have together (the 3 of us), but I'm very unsure about my feelings towards his boyfriend. He is into me and interested, but to be honest I am not  sexually attracted to him and at the moment I feel like we are close friends - at the same time he is very nice, I like both of them and I would like to give it a shot since I see a lot of potential in this triad. 

Do you think I only need some more time to get to know the boyfriend? We didn't have a "spark" and I feel like we didn't really get to build intimacy together, but at the same time I feel very pressured to develop feelings for him (not because they pressure me, but because  they both have feelings for me and the direction in which we are going depends on me and my feelings...).I saw the post the other day requesting more happy posts so I figured I'd share something from the other day.

I tested positive for Covid a few days ago, luckily vaccines + booster are kicking it's butt but... I have been staying away from everyone and am craving any kind of human touch at this point. Both my wife and my other partner know this and decided to mess with me.

Evidently while I was taking a nap my wife texted my other partner and they concocted a plan to both send me sexy nude pictures to torture me. My wife comes in and wakes me up from my nap and tells me I needed to check my phone (while taking a video of me so I know something is up) and gets my reaction when I see all the pictures. She then sends that over to my partner so she can see how I reacted. I feel so loved and terrified of what kind of antics they will get into next on their quest to torture me 😂I recently started exploring the idea of a polyamarous relationship. I found someone who is Poly and with whom I felt an instant connections. What are questions I should ask (about boundaries, safe sex, potential partners etc) them? They are in a committed relationship with another polyamorous person.I have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for about a year.
Last summer, he started seeing another girl without telling me. When he told me about her, at first he described her as “It’s just a thing”.
I thought I am okay with it as long as I am his important person. But as time passed by, he is getting like her and he suggested the idea of poly relationship. I could not keep up with him, but I said it’s okay because I really like him. But I have to care my feelings as well, so I said I don’t wanna see her and I don’t wanna know what they do. And he said it’s okay.

He and another girl are not dating. They like each other a lot but she hasn’t decided if she would be his girlfriend or not. But he wants her to be his girlfriend.

Now he and the girl live in the same city, but I live 11000km away from them. I decided to visit him this month and stay with him for three weeks. This is our first time seeing each other after we decided to do long distance relationship. At first he said he and the girl are okay with not seeing each other for three weeks.But just before I leave my country, she said she wants to meet him during my stay, having a couple of date nights or having coffee for 2 hours. 
I said no to both of them. I want him to focus on me when I am with him. I have been patient for over a year, so I don’t want to have any insecure feelings when I am with him. Also I don’t want him to use our limited time for other girls, because they can see each other whenever they want. 
I prepare for visa, airplane ticket, my time ( I took day offs for three weeks) to visit him. So I don’t want him to leave me alone to meet other girls.
But the girl said that if he cannot meet her during my stay, she doesn’t want to be his girlfriend anymore. So If I don’t allow him to meet her, I will be the one who ruin their relationship. Now I have so much pressure….

I am okay with him texting with her, chatting over the phone, or video chat. But If he use our time for her even tho they can see each other whenever they want after my visit, I feel like she is more important than me. He said she is not, but I feel like that.

Am I the only one, selfish, arrogant, and inconsiderate??
Should I be patient when he leaves me alone to see the other partner?Hi all! 

First-time poster here. I'm a queer poly woman with a live-in partner. I'm looking to date and make some connections with new folks but am just stumped about how to go about it. I am from the US but live abroad now and I am having a hard time connecting with queer communities in the country I live in (its relatively conservative ). Honestly, I had a much easier time being poly in the US and kind of miss the super queer, open community that I had.  Has anyone been through this? Advice is appreciated!There's a guy I've been seeing the last few months and it feels so authentic and amazing in a way I didn't expect.

I'm one of those poly people, where I do tend to jump into bed with someone on the first date. My girlfriend and I joke that you have to "have a sample before you decide to buy" in regards to sexual compatibility with a potential partner. But him and I have not had sex yet, and for a while it had me concerned.

Due to personal reasons I put a lot of validation in sex, but he said he preferred to take tings slow, due to his own health and emotional reasons. It almost scared me at first, like I was scared it'd fizzle out between us before it even started. But that hasn't been the case at all.

And it's reminding me that I can go at a slow pace and create something authentic, and that my relationships are completely true and authentic with or without sex.

I can tell we're beginning to make one another feel fulfilled, that we're cultivating something very healthy based on trust and mutual appreciation. Like we're really building something here in a way I haven't experienced yet. I have cultivated innumerable healthy friendships and relationships but this is in a new way for me and it's honestly exhilarating.

We had such a good and productive talk last night and I can't stop playing it over and over in my head.I'd love a preemptive Valentine's Day thread. Especially other solo poly folk - How do you plan to spend Valentine's Day? I guess, alternately, is this a meaningful holiday or celebration to you?? Do you even ask other partners to spend time or prefer to spend it alone - doing some self care or whatever? When I was mono or now that I'm poly this has never been a huge real celebrated thing in a relationship I've had. But it's a weird time (not unlike the holidays) that I get that gnawing twinge of "shoulds" in my life. Would love to hear others thoughts**Rant**

If you are Monogamous, and you have a "Sharing Kink" or you simply have no desire for other partners while having no issues your partner having other partners, then I'm not talking to you. 

But for those of you who are full on monogamous -- *you want a one on one monogamous relationship,* please say No to Polyamory.

If your partner "comes out" as Polyamorous or proposes that y'all give it a try, you are under No obligation to say Yes.

You are under No obligation to stay in a relationship while your partner explores Polyamory.  

You are under No obligation to try Polyamory for yourself. 

You are under No obligation to do the emotional labor of opening your relationship if you do not enthusiastically consent to opening that relationship. 

Polyamory is a subset of Ethical Non-Monogamy.  Manipulating a partner into trying polyamory is not ethical. Please say No, and say it loud! (We even have a name for that type of abusive behavior - *Polyamory under duress*)

To the "Polyamorous" people who are attempting to convince their monogamous partners that they should give this a try: Stop It! 

They deserve better. Monogamous people deserve to be free to go find fulfilling monogamous relationships. 

You are not more evolved because you want polyamory. There is nothing wrong with your monogamous partner for not wanting polyamory.

No, they do not owe you 6 months or a year before deciding it's not for them. 

This has absolutely nothing to do with whether you believe polyamory is an orientation or a relationship structure. All relationships are choices, and no one should be forced into a relationship that they don't want.

Stop trying to make people fit your mold! Go find people that actually want to have the kind of relationship that you want to have.I want to find the smoothest way to let people down firmly but gently. It makes me uncomfortable when I do reject them but they think I’m just not available now for “x” reasons. I’ve also been so direct that I would literally say “I do not see you in that light and I will never see you in that light.” After many times of not understanding “no”. I know there’s people who just won’t take no for an answer but for those who do, how do you let down people gently but also directly that you’re not interested in dating, having sex now or ever, or play( kink) with them in anyway if you want to maintain friendship? This could be a rejection for an acquaintance, friend of friend, good friend, or someone you met on OLD. 

Answers depending on intimacy level highly encouraged!I have someone I am interested in, but I found out she is poly (single so far). I don't think I could really handle being in a poly relationship. Would it be selfish if we did end up in a relationship and I just wanted to remain  in a monogamy with her? I do want her to be happy but I wouldn't want to feel like I'm keeping her stuck with monogamyBeing polyamorous and being in polyamorous relationships can take many different forms and it's easy for us to forget that we don't all do polyam the same.

So in order to celebrate the diversity of being polyam, what does it look like in your life?Throwaway account for anonymity.

TLDR: Her words say she wants polyamory. Her feelings and actions say she just doesn't want to lose me (and she has verbally confirmed this too). 

UPDATE TDLR: I've been projecting my bad habits onto her (withholding feelings when I'm scared it'll cause turmoil) instead of just trusting that when she says she wants this, she means it. I misinterpreted her text about only doing poly for me. I am working to be more trusting. 

-----

When I insist (in the kindest, most loving and supportive way imaginable) that she doesn't have to choose this, she doesn't have to stay with me if it hurts, that there will be someone out there who who give her what she needs, she claims she just needs to "get over her ego," as if her feelings are something to be fixed. As if her needing more security is "less than."

Her feelings are valid, and as of today I have official text proof that the ONLY reason she chose to be poly with me is because she didn't want to lose me. (We've been poly all our relationship, but she has consistently expressed jealousy and hurt— all valid— throughout.) She knows this is something I need, and that's the damn truth. I wouldn't sacrifice my needs, freedom, or happiness for anyone— no matter how much I loved them. Meaning, I would never be mono for anyone. 

So why is she sacrificing hers for me? It breaks my heart just writing this. 

I'm heavily considering leaving her, which is ironic because the reason she's doing this in the first place is to keep me. But she is clearly hurting herself in agreeing to this, even if she won't admit it. Every time I mention a metamour, she goes silent and then verbally questions the value of our relationship. "How do I know our relationship has value if you love this other person, too?"

It's not healthy for her and it is really hurting me, too. This fear of hurting her taints every new love I encounter. I need to have partner who WANTS this just as much as I do, simply because they want it, not because they don't want to lose me. It's hard for her because im the first person she's ever loved. I've loved and lost and everything in between. 

But every time she feels jealous/hurt, and I tell her she doesn't have to do this, I WANT her to be happy, she draws me back in with her words... "No I promise, I can fix these insecurities, etc..." but she shouldn't have to. It's totally healthy and normal to want more security within a relationship. Some people just aren't built for poly, and I think she might be one of them. And seeing her hurt over my needs is breaking my heart in the process. I've been with her for just over two years. I love her to death. I see myself being with her forever, but not if my love for others is going to hurt her. 

So what the fuck do I do?

UPDATE: 

I am an unreliable narrator. (Have disorders that affect emotional regulation. My fear at the time of writing the post heavily influenced my perspective, and therefore my narrative.) 

I have decided to stay with her. Here's why.

We had a long-ass call (long distance relationship, sadly this couldn't be in person) and I expressed I may need to break up with her because of the reasons above. I was fully intending on doing it. Until...

She showed me where I was wrong. 

She does want to try this. I misinterpreted her text so  completely. When she said she only tried non-hierarchal poly because I wanted it, she didn't mean that she'd rather be monogamous. She only meant that its not something she would have initiated, but she is happy to try it and enjoys being able to sleep with other people. She's just much more selective when it comes to other romantic partners, and I fall in love much more easily.

Its that specific reason that she gets insecure— it comes from a difference in perspective. And all she asks for is verbal re-assurance. Her insecurity doesn't continue past the initial question of it; it's not used as a weapon in discussions (we don't ever argue or insult, only didcuss) or brought up more than once. She believes me when I reassure her. I'm more than willing to do that for her, because of COURSE I love her!!! She trusts me, and she has all along. Its me who hasn't been trusting of her feelings..

Issue one solved.


I have serious trust issues when it comes to believing that others are being honest about their feelings, and thus could not trust her when she promised she wants to work through this. I thought she was just scared of losing me, but she genuinely wants this type of relationship and wants to work through her insecurities, not because she feels she needs to but because she wants to. I am working to trust her when she says that. I am working to believe  that this isn't hurting her like I thought it was.
-
 Issue two: work in progress.


Anyway.. thank you all for your advice and for coming along with me. I think there's more work to be done here on my part. I am learning to trust instead of paint a fear-fueled picture in my mind like I have in the post above. I am learning to respect her autonomy instead of believing that I know what she "really" wants. Especially since she is expressing what she wants so clearly. 

I love you all and couldn't be more grateful for your support of my partner's best wishes. Of course, you only have gotten my perspective, which is skewed due to reasons mentioned above. So your perspective is limited. Im definitely an unreliable narrator. 

But yall are some good fuckin people for looking out for her. And for me. Thank you.I have an unusual situation and I’m not sure how to handle it. 

My former partner, “Josh” and I were together for quite some time.  I got to be really good friends with his other partner, “Heidi.”  

Heidi and I really hit it off, in a platonic manner, and became very good friends-hanging out, grabbing lunch together, etc. It was a pleasant dynamic. 

My relationship with Josh ended- we hit some issues that we couldn’t resolve, namely that I felt that he thought that he was always right, and found that he could be a bit passive aggressive.  Nothing that made him a horrible person, just not compatible with me.

Josh and I are friendly, but nowhere near as close as Heidi and I are. 

However, Heidi has recently opened up to me about some relationship issues with Josh and he is doing some stuff that is NOT cool, at all. 

He has a new partner, and has been caught up in NRE for several months. He’s been distant and cold to Heidi, and frankly, I feel that he’s said/done some seriously sketchy things. 

When Heidi tells me these things, I often don’t know what to say other than, “I’m sorry” or “that would upset me too,” etc. 

Frankly, I want to say, “that’s pretty shitty of him” and “do you really want to be in relationship with someone who treats you this way?” 

I’m torn, because Josh was a good partner to me, but if I didn’t know him, and Heidi was another friend, I’d tell her to cut her losses.Disclaimer that English isn't my first language so I don't know the exact correct terms for everything.

My partner and I (both nonbinary and around 20yo) got together half a year ago. Actually it was my girlfriend who got us together and at that time they were okay with me not dating only them. But my partner said they'd be uncomfortable with me dating anyone else. 
Since then, my girlfriend and I broke up and being limited to only one relationship doesn't feel right to me. 
I have a friend with which I do some stereotypicaly non-platonic stuff (no kissing or sex, wouldn't even want that) my partner is okay with that. And once when I was telling them about something they even said they expected to be uncomfortable with me telling them that but it's actually pretty fine/not that bad. 
They're also not a jealous person and we are not codependent although we plan on moving in together in a few months.
I also know I wouldn't be able to give 100% of me to two people (before, my girlfriend lived 4 hours away and we only texted and saw each other few times over the months we were dating).

So I was thinking. I could have them be my primarily partner and only have one or two (wouldn't be physically able to have more) other people to have some kind of relationship with. I also wouldn't tell them much (except basic info) about my other relationships unless asked. 

No matter what the result would be I want to stay with my partner and if they refused I would not break up with them. 

Do y'all think this is a good idea? Or have any other ideas as to what I could do?\[Edit: I think I put the subject wrong: it is 'my meta', and 'her other relationship'..or 'the other new guy, in our ENM constellation'\]

Dear everybody,

My girlfriend "E" (now 36) and I (now 40) started dating, she had an 8 year relationship when we started, that was of the type: we know stuff happens with others every now an then, and the boyfriend "J" didn't want further not to talk about that stuff. Anyway, that is not the focus of this topic. That relationship with "J" ended for all kind of reasons (but not so much because of E and I having a relationship), already after the first half year.

Ok, good, E and I have been in a fucking good relationship for the past 5 years, often living together sometimes some months apart (we lived originally in different countries, ocean in between...visa stuff, obligations in our home countries etc.), and openly talking to each other about dating with others. The intention was never to go into very permanent relationships with others, but we also knew things could get pretty serious. So we had kind of a hierarchical intention, us being primaries of each other. This was also the case for years. But one year ago things got more serious progressively with one of her dates "D" (now 39). Accepting that was/is kind of a process for me, comes with the non-monogamy...Moving from a casual date every now and  then,  an evening with a Fwb, this was something else.

Then Portugal happened in October last year, she went there for a month, with her new lover "D" joing for 10 days in that period. We had not a lot of rules for the relating with others, except about safe sex: We would have sex only with condoms, and we even banned (unbarriered) oral from the list. Makes kind of (smart, ethical) sense with a variety of contacts and changing contacts. Anyway, they unilaterally 'decided' to have sex without condom. That was not very rationally decided, I think and believe, kind of nature taking it's course. Anyway, I felt betrayed, because I take an agreement serious, even if they wanted it, it should have been discussed beforehand. And also I thought it first just happened once, a single mistake, but later E confessed they did it for days (when the norm was broken). She said they felt very bad, and she was obviously aware this was not okay. Still, a sorry, it doesn't immediately heal this wound in trust of course.

I already got a bit nervous before this Portugal thing about this D guy, having like week and month-long holidays together with E...and I had just met him once before Portugal for the first time, to get to know him. I hugged him, tried to make that meeting work...but it was a bit uncomfortable, he talked for example German, and well, I am Dutch, so I had to struggle (come on, I didn't speak Dutch, he wouldn't know what it was, but I spoke a 3rd language: English, which he masters fine, at a slight lower level but not the difference of my 500 words in German and his mother tongue German). Well, I blame it to D being very uncomfy with English and tbh, I didn't ask to switch to English. But okay, well, D an I didn't have amazing chemistry, yet, I hoped it would get better (I mean it was not bad or anything, just a bit new and weird and not very easy flowing). Then Portugal happened, but ok, E was there and it was of course mainly her responsibility (as D accepts her decisions, he is not an asshole, in that way), but I also blamed him as he knew the rule of E and me, and I personally would not like to fuck over other people's rules. Ah, anyway, just to say, D and I were not in a mega good way of relating.

E and I recovered quite well out of this betrayal episode, but the hard but also honest thing was that E wanted to continue having no-condom sex with D (they were using condoms again, but then this request came). That was a hard pill to swallow, but it is either that or get out of the relationship kind of thing right. We talked a lot about it, and I wrote E something: "ok, but can we do then penetration but with withdrawal (before coming)", but in the bulk of messages/drama... she never answered that specific message....and I think I kind of didn't want to think about it (well, life also happens, and things were in many ways complex). But I also stated very clearly that I was not so much concerned of the STD's, but mainly afraid she would get pregnant by clumsy birth control, actually I was thinking from my reference (we do withdrawal for all these years now) and was mainly afraid D was not good in that method. Especially, and now we getting to the main point (sorry, I type too much), especially because D wants a lot a child and also definitely with E. He is traumatized as he lost a child that he was expecting with his big love. But the baby had major defects and would have dreadful life in the hospital...they aborted and were devastated. It became clear after tests that D and his big love were a bad DNA match...they broke off their relationship.

When E and I started out 5 years ago, she didn't want children ("definitely not now, maybe in the future, but probably not") and I neither (I broke off a 4 year relationship over this issue, my "trauma", or emotional backpack). So that was supergood! And she was non-monogamous, a direction I also wanted to go. Anyway, nothing in life is static, and the child 'No' became a 'maybe' after some years, to 'I want children' like in the last year. E prefers to have children with me over having them with D (but she is not against that scenario, it is a preference), but as I don't wanted them...that's a problem. I said I  didn't have the wish, but I preferred the scenario where I was the bio-dad of our child, it felt like the less problematic scenario..as I have no relation with D at all, and we didn't hit it off amazing, there was Portugal, and I got a bit a competition attitude towards him, and he towards me (he is, or was, quite bad at talking relationship things). And him being the bio-father, I saw that as a potential lethal bomb under the relationship with E (how would that work, as D and I didn't work yet, and I would have to hang around with this new innocent being, but yet being half him, ok, in DNA. I should let that DNA thought go). The competition thing got less, as I learned from the book "more than two" that it is handy if the pivot (E) takes more a "I want this and that" (make clear what the pivot wants) approach and not "partner X wants this, so I go" (pivot is a helpless being, decided by her partners). I talked with her and she changed her language discourse towards her wishes, which shifted agency to her, where it was all the time, of course. That helped a lot (the irony is that I had a 5-time date thing a year before (that was a lot for us, back then), with a girl that I had a super intellectual connection with, which made her uncomfortable/jealous. And she told me the same then: 'Don't say C wants this and that, say "I want this and that"'. Recognizable, we learn lessons along the way). We also improved expectation management, because to spare me, E tended to say the minimum time she expected to go away with D, which then always became longer (sometimes much longer), I said: 'better say the max you expect to be away, then sometimes come back a bit earlier every now and then, that will work better'. She did. Just to illustrate, we are trying to navigate the hurdles and take care of each other.

Back to the child issue. So it came out to be now, in retrospect, E and D where doing periodic abstinence, and the abstinence meaning using a condom during the most dangerous (fertile) period. E and I sometimes did, like once a month, come inside, basically in the middle of the safe period, like well after her PMS, just before menstruation. Menstruation is already a stop sign for me. Remember, I didn't want children. E used actually a quite solid system, with one mistake, and then making a mistake on top of that. She bleeds for 3 days normally, then she adds 2 days after, which she thinks is safe to have sex. Her cycle is 26 days (min 24 to 29 max, last year, but mostly steady on 26 days). And that is quite safe (according to this periodic abstinence scheme [https://mymonthlycycles.com/rhythm\_method\_calculator.jsp](https://mymonthlycycles.com/rhythm_method_calculator.jsp)), but only if she bleeds 3 days. The right way is to count from day 1 of the period, and then go until day 5. Then you still have 9% chance to get pregnant every year. Evelyn had her last period, but this time she bled for 5 days...she added 2, she thought, only to realize later it was 3 days extra. Then you talk about period day 8 (Jan 17), the day before she would (on average!) be advised to start having a lot of sex to get pregnant. Anyway, a super red zone if you want to prevent birth control. That was 3 months after she decided to go unsafe in a durable way with him, and the 3rd cycle, with this miscalculating, resulted in her pregnancy, probably ovulating on January 21. E was in corona quarantaine with D a bit after New Year's eve, and she had to stay isolated with him until January 18. I would see E like January 6, but corona came. And a pregnancy with it, we would discover later. E and I were reunited on January 19, so theoretically, I could be the dad too..but chances are minimal, as normally we do 99% withdrawal, except for this ultra 'safe' moment every cycle. But we are not 100% sure, as E said 'we had one moment quite some time ago, that I said you could come inside, but maybe I made a mistake'. But I think small chance it was around this super fertile periode. But who knows. So that is added to the mix of soapyness.

I felt quite disappointed E was so reckless with birth control, but when she explained, I understood how it could go wrong..and I also said to myself: 'be honest B (me), they wanted a child, unconscious things pushed a bit for that'. E was honestly shocked and in tears because of the pregnancy, she had really thought to start trying like 6 months later or so..and she knew, I  guess, this was a atomic emotional bomb in our constellation, where D and I are not mega good, she kind of preferred me a bit more to be the dad (she likes for example my family to be our child's family, she likes D's family less. And she likes me more..), and she knew this could very well be the end of our 'life partner' story (we always refer to each other as life partner, 'let's grow old together'). We were of course also postponing the drama a bit, because in like 6 months this child question would become dramatic anyway. I kind of was relieved we didn't have to rationally decide: ok, D is going to be the dad, you are about to ovulate, hurry, go have sex with D for 5 days. E also said that if she would have gotten pregnant from me, highly likely it would be the end of her and D. This made me uneasy, I asked why that would be the end, she said: 'as he is not so open-minded as us, and he has a quite traditional vision of a family'. Well, let's see how open-minded I am about it.

The plus side is: everybody got their desire in the children question, in a way (it's a good among the bad options available?). D and E got their desired pregnancy and eventually child. I don't get a child of my own, as I wished. And I hope we can adopt or foster a child after things settle down around this new child. And E really wants to experience this part of the human experience, to be pregnant. And she also feels for adopting together. And D gets his long wished child, with an amazing woman, E.

Anyway, E took her pregnancy test 36 hours ago, and told me immediately, we lay a lot awake that night, we cried a lot. I feel numb, I need to study, exams and papers are coming up soon...but I can't, not yet. It feels so from another world right now. To be honest, I wanted to disappear into nothing, I kind of prayed my heart would just stop.

She went to D last night and told him. He is super happy of course, and E was happy somebody was happy. This morning E came back, and she was distant, that was awful. Later we reconnected, I cried so much, I don't know if I ever cried so deeply, very primal. E was a bit shocked and said I should get some therapy to help. I said this sadness was always every now and then part of me, a weltschmerzen, also the reason I am super hesitant to pass on my DNA (what if I give hem this curse). But now of course it was my very personal pain...I fear to loose her, and I am not convinced we can make this work. I see the main problem in the D and me part. I wish so much it was a guy I liked a lot, like her ex, we are friends, would have loved he was the father (I proposed it, but yes, it is not up to me).

E also said 'you need to make it work with D, I really need you two to fix that.' And at this moment, that makes me crumble, and also resisting. It is all nice in "More than two", where it says that you cannot as pivot expect that your partners will love, like or even can stand each other. But you stay civil with each other, as we did... But now we have to go for, co-parenting, co-living (E already switched from yesterday 'you are my nesting partner' to 'D wants to be close, so we should nest all together'..so difficult this. Well, we can try. But I am afraid I know quite quickly if I connect with somebody or not (which, yes, might be a self-fulfilling  prophecy)...any thoughts?

Edit: this "we should all move in together" is more a brainstorm idea of her, it is a suggestion. But she goes for living with D, as  I see it now, and I can opt to be close or live in an annex house, or we live all in the same house...We didn't get to practicality of that yet. I first need to talk to D, and with D and E together, get things a bit more clearlyHi there... I decided to post in here because I feel like y'all will understand where I'm coming from more...

I met someone recently who is traditionally attractive while I'm not at all and he's really really into me.

Traditionally hot people have been into me several times throughout being ENM/Polyam. Every time, it's shocked me and I've ended things because I just couldn't be comfortable enough around them to trust that they were actually into me.

When I was a teen/early 20s, I was rejected a lot for my appearance by traditionally hot people. As I've gotten older, people have cared less and/or actually been really into me physically. But that initial damage was done and it makes me so so apprehensive when it comes to trusting that traditionally attractive people are actually into me.

For example, I was told that I was un-date-able/fuckable because this one person believed that brown people didn't shower as much as white people and that's why we're darker. There are more examples.

I know these lingering feelings are likely a confidence thing. I don't want to end this dynamic with this partner. I really love and enjoy it so much. I also don't want this to be a hang-up as time goes on - I want to meet people who are a good match, regardless of what either of us looks like.

How do I find a sense of comfort and okay-ness with this person? Like, how I trust that he's actually into me? And that I'm actually good enough? If you've dealt with this, how did you get over your hang ups? Were there any resources that helped in particular?

If you're ***POC or plus-size***, I'd especially love hearing from you. But I'm happy to hear from anyone.my partner and i are in the beginning stages of an open relationship, while both of us are pansexual, he is insisting that i only see women, with reasoning that men are gross and unsafe. While he would be able to see all genders. while this is his comfort zone and i want to respect that as much as i can i kind of just want some other opinions? is this a fair request? am i being unreasonable for being off put by this?



EDIT - i did not make it clear in my original post that he did not give me an ultimatum it was more of a “i don’t want you to see men. no actually, i guess i will be okay with it, but i definitely don’t prefer it in any shape or form”  we are still talking about it, i just want to see if me feeling put off by this was just. thanks to everyone for responding i appreciate it <3Wife came out as bi to me in november.  after discussion, we decided to let her explore her sexuality . She met up with a lady, and they have hit it off immediately, and my wife reallises that her sexuallity is basically 100 percent lesbian. However we love the living daylights out of each other so we have decided to have a poly relationship where our marriage is a loving platonic primary.  I am really struggling with Jealousy that she is getting a lot of sexual intimacy from her girlfriend, but i dont have a partner yet. im on a tonne of dating apps looking for someone but havent had any bites yet. Im not sure if the fact that i openly state in my profile im in a poly relationship is not helping. Is there anyone else in a similar situation or has been previously? are there any decent  poly dating apps or sites?This split is absolutely not as tidy as Monogamous People vs Poly People, but something I've run into recently is using the communication I've learned from being poly and just hitting a wall when it's monogamous people I'm trying to communicate with.

Recently me and a couple of long-time mono friends had a physically intimate experience that stopped just short of sex. There was a lot of physical intimacy where previously there had been none, nudity where there had been none, etc.

Afterwards, I sent a message saying something along the lines of

"Hey, just wanted to say I had a great time the other night. We did a whole bunch of stuff way outside the bounds of our friendship up til now, so if anyone has anything they want to clarify or need reassurance about I'm totally happy to talk <3"

I ran that message by a different couple of mono friends and they just rolled their eyes at me, and said "Jesus, you don't need to make a big deal out of it. What if they don't want to talk about it?"

And it's frustrating. This isn't me making a big deal about it. It's the exact opposite. This is pretty much the bare minimum, in my opinion, in terms of making sure everyone involved is cool with what happened. Why do some people feel like just *neutrally making a space* for emotions is threatening/weird? It's left me feeling like the thing to do is to 'play things cool', but in my experience that just creates situations where people feel like they can't express themselves. 

Shrug.Someone posted that they wish there were more poly success stories on here, so I'm going to post mine.

I (59F) was married for 28 years, had four children, but monogamy almost destroyed my soul. Back in the day (1984), polyamory was almost unheard of and the internet didn't really exist. I basically was poly in college as I dated two men at the same time but eventually, and somewhat grudgingly, chose one to marry, because the cultural and family pressure was overwhelming.

Fast forward many years, I ended my marriage after my children were grown after 15 years of talking to my husband about my needs. I remained monogamous during my marriage because he wouldn't entertain the idea of opening it up. All of our conversations were just exercises in futility. So I just waited.

I became non-monogamous through a D/s relationship (which ended a few years ago). After that relationship ended I just decided that I was going to explore polyamory more but as a solo poly, and have been doing this for over a year.

I currently have three partners in a D/s dynamic, where I'm the D. And you know what? They're all younger than I am (30, 35, 46)!  I'm young at heart (and take damn good care of my body) and so happy in these relationships. I enjoy the committed time I spend with them and our D/s dynamic is working wildly good. They all have other partners as well, so unlike many men my age, who really want monogamy, they don't demand all my time.  

I feel like I've been waiting my whole life to feel this loved, empowered, and affirmed.I am currently my partner’s primary/nesting partner. I love them and have absolutely no desire to break up. However, I do feel that our relationship would benefit if I were not the primary/nesting partner. Have any of you or someone you know been able to make this transition successfully?I have known I was polyamorous since I was 17. After a horrible 7 year relationship with the father of my children who cheated on me multiple times. I thought maybe doing the mono thing was the better idea.

I met my now husband 8 years ago. A year into our relationship I realized this part of me was who I am and not something I could hide away. I talked to him about it. He understood. Did lots of reading, and jumped in feet first. 

We had a few not great experiences. Trauma, date rape... very bad and backed away collectively for about another year and a half.

3 years ago, he met our amazing partner (now wife we handfasted this year 🥰) They dated for 3 ish months before her and I organically started our own relationship. Our relationships with her are separate and not dependent on each other. No unicorns were hurt in the making of this triad*

My husband is completely okay with wife having other partners but says it is different with me. He is not at all okay with me dating and it's killing me. He told me a few months ago I needed to do what I need and he couldnt hold me back. I started seeing someone almost 2 months ago. We arnt intimate because my new bf doesnt want to cross my husbands boundaries. How long do I wait for him to be "okay". I hate this. I love him, but its not fair that he gets to dictate my life or relationship? Am I wrong?I am at the beginning of a relationship, my partner is flexible knowing that I love two people and this would be our first polyamorous relationship. I would like tips, boundaries and know how to deal in case of jealousy, eventually he feels a little insecure, in those cases I usually deal with it by reminding him of important moments for us.

I'm not sure how to classify myself but I think that because of my capacity to love more than one person at the same time I'm polyamorous, he however sees sex as fun (except with me) and this discordant view makes me uncomfortable. He's willing to allow me to have a relationship with the other man I love even if it means he won't be with anyone because he doesn't think he's capable of loving more than one person at the same time like me. And even with him accepting this I don't think it's fair, until we figure this out we're not hooking up with other people. This relationship is very important for both of us and we're willing to work things out together.

Maybe I need to deal with my discomfort and allow him to have multiple partners for casual sex or maybe I'm just not ready for a relationship, after all while we were getting together although he hasn't hooked up with anyone else I wouldn't have bothered, maybe it's just the case that a lot of mental social barriers need to be broken down for something satisfying with him but I'm a noob in polyamorous relationships, so I would appreciate different points of view.Like the title says. It just seems silly to me that, just because I'm not straight, so many women will waste weeks talking to me only to pull out the line "my boyfriend thinks you're hot, you should let him fuck you." Seriously? If I thought HE was hot, I would have matched with his crusty backwoods Wisconsin ass. 😂

I just don't get how they can think it's not a mood killer? And a waste of energy. Just be honest with what you want in the begining so you can actually find someone interested? It's not like waiting 2 weeks is gonna make me suddenly say "oh man, I've invested so much time. Better just let this guy fuck me so it's not a total wash."I always learned about polyamory as a non-monogamous relationship option. I never thought of monogamy as a personal trait. We know that no one is born monogamous. Monogamy is a culture, based on patriarchal morals. People are not born mono or poly.

How can someone be polyamorous without partners? Just because you want a lot of partners? Who doesn't?

After adolescence, everyone wants multiple relationships. People just deny it to pretend to be complacent with patriarchy.

&#x200B;

My conclusions are:

\- People lie about wanting only one person, they lie about being naturally monogamous.

\- Polyamory is a consensual ethical choice made by all people in some relationship. It is not a personal desire or characteristic. It is a deal.

\- Monogamy is a behavioral boundary that two people agree to uphold, but often fail to meet.

I'm wrong?So my NP and I have been in a relationship for 4 years, and we have been living together for almost two and a half years. We are not married, we do have a dog together. Our relationship has been open since the beginning (mostly because I was newly out of a break up and enjoying my new found freedom, but I was also totally smitten with my NP). Recently, my partner has not been very interested in sex with me (we went fromhaving sex 1-3+ times/week for many years of our relationship to 1-2 times/month in the past year) but is open to sex with other people. When I suggested that maybe, if her desire had fallen off for me, we needed to figure out if we still wanted to continue to nest, she cried about how she doesn't want to nest with anyone *but* me. As someone whose love language is touch and who craves emotional and physical intimacy in my relationships, I'm struggling. A long term partner of mine moved, so we don't get to see each other as frequently, and I am a Ph.D. student with a busy semester ahead, so I am not dating as much. Also, I love my nesting partner and would love if she wanted to maintain a sexual relationship with me. My NP works 50+ hours a week (by choice - she started a part time gig in January that goes through April), but this desire disparity started almost a year prior to this.

My NP recently started seeing a new person, "Amelia". It's someone we both have known for a while and someone I feel pretty lukewarm towards (my NP knows this, I told her long before the relationship began). My partner and I are also trans - I only date other trans people, and my NP's last several partners have been trans as well) and Amelia is queer but cis and has never dated or had a physical relationship with a trans person before. My NP and Amelia get along well though, so I am trying to get over my bias against cis people in the poly pod, but I have been struggling with some trust/insecurity issues (see next paragraph) and also with the fact that I have to split my limited time (2 evenings and weekends) with my partner with someone else (which also means a large amount of the dog responsibilities end up falling on me) 

But I am also having some trust issues. Last spring, my NP started seeing someone new, "Via", and the honeymoon phase was pretty rough. I was excited for my partner, but she was always on the phone with Via, making plans, or out with her. She would invite Via to intimate hangouts we were hosting and not spend a second with me. They were also not being COVID safe at all, and potentially exposing me and our roommates to the virus while we were all trying to get our vaccinations in order. It took a toll, and I asked my NP if we could have a night or two each week where neither of us were on the phone with other partners so we could have some quality time together.

Then, I found out my partner was pursuing a relationship with someone she wasn't telling me about, until she texted me in the middle of the workday asking what I thought about her having a kink partner. I was confused, partly because I had been actively pursuing more kink in our sex life and was being turned down, and because shortly thereafter I found out she hid this potential partner, "Casey" because I got bad vibes (admittedly not a nice assessment on my part, but he did turn out to be pretty toxic, and my NP ended up apologizing once she found out how he was treating other people in our community). So, needless to say, I'm having some trust issues and feeling some insecurity about my needs being met as my partner starts to see this new person. 

Am I approaching this situation in a healthy way? Are my trust issues an overreaction? How do you all deal with insecurity when your partner is in the honeymoon phase with a meta? And how do you deal with a desire disparity? I'm four years into poly dynamics but I know I have a lot of growing to do, so tough love is so welcome.

Thanks for reading.

Tldr; I'm having some trust and insecurity issues as my partner starts to date againyahh, we’ve known each other since 2016, and this was my first v-day with a polycule, and i spoiled my partners by sending them multiple gifts and cards in two packages, and it was over 100 dollars. i don’t have a job, but i’m getting out of debt by doing commissions (i do cartoon art has a hobby). it fine, tho, it’s worth their happiness,,, <3

update: my partners are concerned that i did this,,, i probably should’ve made them art as gift for valentines day,,,,Does anyone have any recommendations for how to find online sex therapy for couples? In desperate need and I know this community has to have some recommendations. Thanks in advance!I'm so excited! My triad just spoke with a lawyer today about us all getting "married" to make sure we wouldn't break any laws or could be reported for polygamy in our state and we're basically all in the clear! We're so excited to go forward with planning our celebration with family and Friends ❤️❤️I'm on Bumble and I match with a person (A); talk briefly. Then a few days later I match with person B; who is person A's partner. Person A then sends me a message saying that they have a rule that they don't get sexually involved with the same people and that I can date person B but person A and I will be platonic. I was more into person A. Is this couple's privilege?

Just curious for thoughts and opinions.Please delete if not allowed.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a creditable poly dating site? Like an actual good one that people have met others on?

I’m looking to add another partner and Covid has made it less than desirable to try and find partners out in the wild, especially ones in my location :/For all the beautiful parts of poly, its not an easy road, and tonight is one of those times.

My spouse is definitely a lot more open than I am. I keep tighter circles, and especially of late have been redefining how I look at my own interpersonal relationships, and restructuring what I want out of relationships, whereas they are a lot more open and vibrant. 

I never truly mind, deep in, that she has many partners. As an introvert, its nice that she in all her extroverted beauty can seek more interactions, and be herself fully. But I find the honeymoon phases of her new relationships to be the times I struggle the most. I'm a jealous person, and its both easy yet incredibly hard for me to adapt to change. But I'm good at managing that jealousy, good at knowing when its a valid jealousy, or if its just my brain making things up. 

She found a new partner. They're incredibly cute admittedly, and seems to be a really good fit for my spouse. But new starts means honeymoon phases, which means that inevitably a lot of attention is being diverted to someone new. It's natural, for sure, but I can't help but wish, at least for tonight, that I had more of her attention today. Jealousy says I'm being forgotten, trauma says I'm not good enough. They're both lying obviously, my wife does so much to tend to my needs, we're extremely happy together.

But every so often, poly takes a lot of effort. A lot of self restraint, a lot of emotional control.

So, instead of giving in to jealousy, to make sure I stay supportive of my wife's new bout of happiness, I vent to people I'll never know. People who'll maybe understand. Just a simple acknowledgement of what I'm feeling.I’m a hetero man (C), who was monog and married to (A) from ages 15-47. Three years ago we met a woman (B) our age who just blended and we all seemed like a great fit. We were never poly and didn’t intend to be. B was a client and it just happened. Both women were open to each other emotionally and physically, both together and separately without me, which I enjoyed greatly too. It was closed and we were all committed.

A and I saw our new partner together as well as separate. Over time as we grew closer and after our newer partner began staying in our original home more and more, the long-standing woman in our closed triad (A) felt threatened. 

I had attempted to create equality for us all, so everyone was equal in status and there was no heirarchy. I did not want the newer partner to feel less in any way, and that meant redecorating, adjusting the home so there would be 3 equal bedrooms, letting family know, and creating legal and financial equality. My goal was to create the paperwork and legal status for us all, and either through my own divorcing so they could marry (as I am not threatened by that) and have the mutual benefits for their children, as well as equal protection with finances - or none married, or status quo but with legal paperwork leveling the field financially and with rights.

We talked and talked for the three years and we all grew and changed a lot. I expanded greatly and I adored them both. I can’t say I loved one more than another, and I had so much joy.

But as A felt her status was threatened and I did not accept her excluding our new partner or keeping her, well kind of like a side dish, who she was happy to sleep with and hang out with but wasn’t able to accept her fully as an equal - I realized she wasn’t the kind of person I could fully accept myself. I have compassion for everyone’s view but I also found it unkind and unfair if not cruel to our newer partner, who is near our age and childless and wants a child of her own. It seemed to me dishonorable if not deceptive after years to deny B, when B had been open and honest about her needs from the very beginning. Try as I might, there was no good path forward for all of us, nor how A’s issues could ever work with anyone else, and I initiated a divorce which is now concluding. It is for me a matter of integrity and decency no matter the cost. We were all hurt and it’s unfortunate, but we’re moving forward with love and it’s amenable.

Our new partner is still here with me, in the PNW where this is somewhat acceptable socially - and she and I would both like to try again because it suited each of us so well. We are neither jealous types and attentive and careful communicators, fair minded and really - just adore more love, but prefer committed closed types of triads. It was such a joy in our daily lives, cooking, working, traveling, keeping the house, the kids loved it - but we are both a little gunshy now. I knew my wife for most of my life and her behavior deeply surprised me. Perhaps I saw too deeply my own self in her.

Thing is, neither of us really knows where to begin again. We have each other and the beauty of our days, and the memories of what was, and know we both adore bigger love and the incredible joy of compersion. I found myself creating opportunities for them so I could feel the joy of witnessing even the aspects of their daily expressions of love. I just loved giving time and effort and making more love possible.

But I was never poly. It just happened. I don’t know much about this lifestyle. The advice I’m seeking - is this really just a hopeless thing or is it even possible? It was just so beautiful and I can see how it could work with the right situation- but perhaps it failed for a good reason, or perhaps because of a woman’s natural need for security -or even because we were too established for such change…

I appreciate your time and replies, thank you.Me (before potential new partner):

Wife: "You can't have her over until the house is clean"

Me (now):

https://preview.redd.it/enptayf74xg81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f8cee254fa525437dbab4f67c17d47d9ce51f51As the title says, I am looking for some advice on how to reconcile different conflict resolution styles with my partner. 

Little background: Me (28f) and my partner (m35) have been dating again for a few months now but know each other much longer. Almost three years ago we met on a dating app and dates for a year. After that a period of contact/no contact began during which I started dating my primary nesting partner (m36). My other partner (m35) is married with kids and also nesting with his wife. 

&#x200B;

Now on to the problem I am seeking advice on: My partner and I don't fight a lot or have a lot of conflict in general, especially compared to our first relationship this time dating is smooth sailing. Partially that is because some of the factors causing trouble in our first relationship have disappear and we have also worked and continue to work on not repeating old mistakes and on reaching common ground when it comes to how we resolve conflict. We have had and continue to have a lot of conversations about what we need from each other when in a conflict. Most of the time it actually works out well but there are certain things where I feel we end up going in circles. 

&#x200B;

When in a conflict I am a person who does not necessarily need to resolve it straightaway if the discussion becomes to heated but who needs a clear time frame as to when we are going to talk about the situation. I am perfectly fine with someone telling me "I don't want/cannot talk about this now but let's discuss/call about it tomorrow". What badly triggers me is the silent treatment, for example not responding to a text message anymore (not in the middle of the night obviously) or when someone just aggressively tries to change the subject. I also need to be able to (respectfully) express feelings such as anger or frustration. Not being responded to or being told that "I already said sorry" makes me feel invalidated and silenced. It also makes me feel that me communicating negative emotions is unwanted by my partner. I communicated all of that to my partner and asked him to act accordingly. 

When my partner is in a conflict, he prefers to not respond or communicate anymore when he feels triggered. He needs a clear break to let things cool off and he does not necessarily feel the need to communicate about that. What triggers him is feeling blamed or made out to be like a horrible person who constantly does wrong. When I express a negative emotion he often perceives it as me blaming him for everything or believing that he is a terrible person and partner, which I obviously don't think. He then also feels that him saying sorry to me is not enough and that he then doesn't know what to say anymore. He then responds with giving me the silent treatment to cool off, without communicating that to me. 

So yeah..maybe you can see how we trigger each other in these situations. Like I said, I feel like us having these conversations and being so aware of each other's triggers is a great step and I also don't expect that we will always be able to resolve conflict situations in a perfect way. I also know that no one here is right or better than the other.

However, I wonder what else we can do to improve our conflict resolution skills and reconcile each others differing needs in these situations? I often feel like I cannot do more than communicating what I need to my partner and the same goes for him. Any advice maybe?There is no greater sound to me than that of my partners laughing and giggling together. My husband and bf are sitting on the couch next to me giggling away at a movie and their comments to one another. It's nice that they can watch movies I don't like together while I play pokemon on my switch  and still spend time with them. It's these little moments that I treasure the most. These moments make all the hardships that can come with being poly worth it.(28F) I’ve been with my primary partner for 5 years now and my secondary partner for 5 months. At first, we were all happy. But over time, both of my partners expressed that they wanted me to break up with the other person and be monogamous with them. I wouldn’t mind having just one relationship, either. 

My secondary partner offers emotional depth and the sex is mind blowing. I want to run away with him to the Swiss alps and make love for a whole month straight. My primary partner wants the same things as me at this age, mainly a family and stable careers and property. 

Secondary partner seems a bit directionless in life and takes each day as it comes. But I’m also really losing excitement for my primary partnership despite the strong foundation it offers.

How do I decide who to be with…I don’t want to hurt either of them…I decided to go on a date with a woman I met at one of my friend’s bday. Most or if not all are in the LGBTQ community and some consider themselves queer or free spirited. (She) never claimed poly but said she’s committed to multiple people because her love was for everyone, one person can not meet all her needs.

I myself am a heterosexual male, and very foreign to this type of love. I did not let that stop me from pursuing her since we both bonded extremely well. 

This past weekend we decided to go on a date. She bought me a gift and raved to friends about me. The night started off wonderfully, conversations, drinks and overall mutual interests, especially spirituality. 

Cut to the end of the night and we decided to spontaneously hit up a club which is mostly made up of lgbtq community. I have been plenty of times to these clubs so I didn’t mind. We danced, cuddled a lot, and she kept telling everyone I was her boo. I personally was flattered but felt a little off. 

The whole night we checked in with each other as she went off with her girlfriends to dance and chill and I hung out with a few people. Not once did I dance with another woman because I only had eyes on her that night. I stepped out to smoke a little ganja and come back to see her sexually dancing with another man. Same man she made a comment about when he walked in. I was in the crowd watching her do this in front of me and felt betrayed, confused and hurt. 

I was more sad than angry so I tossed her gift in the garbage and blocked her. When I unblocked her, she was livid. Claiming I’m not her property and she can love whoever. I agreed but told her, this specific night, I was trying to know her and that’s it. This wasn’t part of the plan, yet she completely disregarded my feelings. Told me I was apart of the patriarchy and only was jealous because it was a man, and my ego got it the way. Though I told her it was about the principle and respect for who she was on a date with. 

I personally moved on, even though it stings a little. But I felt like my feelings were not validated, due to her choice of lifestyle which she does not claim. But I see this as polygamy. Please correct me if I’m wrong? And does this mean I am strictly monogamous?Hello! I am a monogamous person who has been married to a poly person for almost 8 years. However, They did not realize they were poly until about 2 years ago. We have recently went back to being monogamous after trying a mono/poly relationship for about 2 years. I would like some honest feedback on wether I handled the closing of our relationship in an ethical manner or not. 

I am an open minded person and do not have an issue with poly in general it's just not something I need or desire for myself personally. I don't believe I own my spouse or that I should be their only means of connection.

Background: Our journey began 3 years ago when they confessed to cheating on me. (The cheating had happened several years prior) I was obviously very hurt initially but we talked and I am not someone who feels like desiring sex with others is that big of a deal. The lying was a much bigger issue to me personally. 

I told them if sex with others was something they desired I had no issue with it as long as they were open and honest about it.

At this time, they and therefore I, believed that what they sought was more under the umbrella of an open relationship than poly.

They got on dating sites and connected with 3 separate ppl over the course of about a year. The last person they connected with wound up becoming a regular connection and opened their eyes to the fact that they actually desired a poly relationship vs an open one.

I was very much cought off guard by this (although in hindsight feel like I should not have been) and it was a much bigger deal to me than simply having an open relationship.

However, I had no desire to control my spouse and so threw myself into learning as much as possible. I read designer relationships and polysecure, I joined FB groups, stalked this subreddit and watched countless YouTube videos.

My spouse did non of the "leg work" of learning to transition between a open and/or mono relationship into a poly/mono one.

Their relationship ended on a sour note when the person they were seeing showed up uninvited to MY grandmother's funeral and caused a scene because my spouse had not texted them back all morning. 

After this my spouse, by their own choice, quit everything for about a month. Deleted their dating profiles, said they were done with anything outside of monogamy etc.

Then they reconnected with someone from highschool and it quickly became a relationship. 

Unfortunately this person had a very strained home life and was simply in a different place in their life than we were. Thus their relationship was very chaotic from the start.

My marriage quickly absorbed the residual chaos of their relationship and became unbearable to me.

They broke many established agreements and repeatedly lied to me. 

Four months ago I decided I could not live this way anymore and I was tired of all my efforts at discussion being met with defensive hostility, however, before I had the chance to voice this the person my spouse was seeing ended their relationship. 

I did my best to be sympathetic and told my spouse that while I'm very sorry they were hurting it had become increasingly evident to me that I could not be part of a mono/poly dynamic with them going forward.

I asked them to take some time and think about what they wanted. If poly was it, I encouraged them to go forth and find their happiness but if they wanted to continue a relationship with me it would have to be a monogamous one. 

After a month they decided they preferred to continue a relationship with me and we have been monogamous for the last 3ish months.

Last week a mutual acquaintance of both myself, my spouse and their ex told me (of their own volition, I did not ask) that the ex had attempted to get back together with my spouse and that my spouse had told them I had issued an ultimatum and for that reason they could not engage.

So, at long last, here is my question; Did I in fact give my spouse an ultimatum? 

I personally do not feel that I did but I fear my monogamous nature may be clouding my judgement. 

If you read this far thank you, all insight or opinion is welcome .Hi all, first time posting here and I'm really awful with words so please hang in here with me lol.
I(23nb) have been with my partner (28M) for 3 years now and we have both been poly in previous relationships but when we got together it just worked for the 2 of us to be mono.

Well about 3 months ago we started talking about opening up and being poly again! I was stoked! Until he said he wants a One Penis Policy and now I'm just not sure what to do?
I said "okay to make it fair then it'll be a One Pussy Policy"
Which I know isn't fair either but I could care less who he has sex with or anything like that. 
He cannot work on or work through his jealousy of another penis entering my life or vagina and I'm just not sure what to do or how to feel or where to go from this point?? 
I'm no longer happy being monogamous but apparently being poly isn't going to work out either?
I just feel stuck and I have never been in a situation like this so any advice or opinions are greatly appreciated!!!

Edit: I cannot thank you all enough for the advice, words of wisdom, support, sources, and eye openers. You've all been super helpful. ❤❤❤Inspired by the lovely post on r/twoxchromosomes about the goofy and sweet things the op's partner does. The comments are so full of love and laughter, and I thought hey, I could bring that here!

What things do your partners do that make you smile or laugh? 

My polycule has a habit of running jokes into the ground, which makes them funny again somehow. For so long, any word that ends in an "-er" sound was followed up with someone repeating the word with a certain inflection and adding "I barely know her!" Except that we did it so much that now someone just has to repeat the word with the inflection and everyone will groan. 

One of my partners is amused by "deez nuts" type jokes and will try to get us to say the word with leading questions, but they have a certain tone of voice that means "I'm messing with you" and we'll just dance around the word until someone gives up.So to preface, I practice mostly solo polyam and relationship anarchy. I guess my values and morals align most with relationship anarchy and right now, solo poly just kind of fits my lifestyle during this time. But I have found myself feeling quite isolated and sad watching some of my peers form relationships. 

A wonderful life long friend of mine is monogamous, and each time she gets a partner, she just kind of vanishes. Tonight I saw her post on her Snapchat story a photo of a cute gift she got for her girlfriend, and I can't help but wish she would do the same for me. I find it frustrating she values her romantic partnerships ten fold over her platonic connections. We are like siblings, and I love her dearly and have been practically adopted into her family, but this really bothers me. I do not have any romantic feelings for her at all, I just wish she showed how much she values our friendship in similar ways. It is odd to me that she doesn't. Even when I begin experiencing NRE, I make it a priority to see her and my other platonic folks because they are just as important to me.

I am also watching my other friends partnering up and just kind of vanishing, and I'm feeling a lot of grief. It starts to feel like I'm less valued simply because of someone's attraction to me. Which I know is just an insecurity, and just the jealousy monster talking, but it's a difficult thing to feel and it's weighing heavy on me and it's not how I view some of these same connections. 

I really want to build a chosen family, but it's feeling quite hard to when none of the folks I want to surround myself chose me to be theirs. Like I want a strong community and a group of folks that I chose to walk through life with, but right now that dream feels so distant and faint. 

I'm not really looking for advice, just someone to say "I see you and you're valid."

Do any of my other relationship anarchists feel this way with some of their monogamous folks in their life?I had an overwhelming day today, and the tipping point was slipping and falling in my own apartment 'cause my socks were too slippery and I was goin' too fast. :| But my partners pulled me onto the couch and hugged and cuddled me while I cried it out. Just feeling very lucky and cared for. <3My (F42) primary partner (M48) recently expressed that he is feeling stretched thin and wants more solo time to recharge/hang out with friends. He suggested changing our Friday night/sleepover to solo time. 

We have been together over a year, do not live together, but spend 4 nights a week together. No kids involved. He has a secondary partner he sees once a week and I have a couple of secondary partners I see occasionally.

Logically, I know alone time is important for everyone. I'm having a hard time with the 25% reduction in time. It makes me really sad to think he would rather be alone than spend his Friday nights chilling with me. 

I'm hoping this will be something I can adjust to, but it is possible that I just need more than he can give. 

Any advice for reframing this or stories of similar situations you have gone through are appreciated!I’ve had a couple opportunities to have sex in my life but I just never ended going through with them.. so now I’ve been on tinder trying to find someone to hookup with and I’m not having much luck. 

I’m just wondering, if I go with a poly couple for the first time will it be too overwhelming? Will they be understanding? Or should I just avoid the situation all together?Hello! :) Sorry for the long post, but I think its an interesting one and I appreciate you stopping in to read. I am a fairly newly open polyamorous and pansexual trans woman (been fully out to most people for about 8 months). I am in a couple dating/casual relationships with people I really care about, and its wonderful. There are more beautiful people coming into my life every week it seems. Ideally, I want open, non-hierarchical kitchen table polyamory some day in the future.

I feel so blessed in my life and frequently get this "in the groove" feeling where I realize I am not anxious, depressed, stressed or worrying about anything, and that I am surrounded by the right people and am exactly where I'm supposed to be. its a beautiful, dreamy feeling and I have NO complaints there.

My only trouble is that I am just so attracted to all of the friends and peers in my life. I know sustainably, that doesn't make any sense, but whenever I start deepening a friendship with someone, I start getting romantic feelings for them. I'm having a bit of a crisis of what the difference between platonic and romantic love is. I'm just in love with life and the diversity of people and my instinct is to want to romance them!! 

I have been thinking about this  question for some time, and my definitions for both types of love seem to be just about the same; 

when I care deeply about someone's well being and happiness, when I want to be a part of their life, when I feel emotional about the prospect of them leaving or moving away, when I get jealous of their time (here comes compersion!) , when I feel comfortable sharing my vulnerabilities and shortcomings, when I feel comfortable in silence, when there is groovy conversation and food shared and heart conversation. 

 for the life of me I cant find much difference, other than wanting to kiss someone, and sexual attraction. at first i thought, ultimately that was the major difference, but then I thought there is a spectrum of asexuality in people, that still engage in romantic love. On top of that I know platonic friends who kiss as an expression of platonic love, and its pretty common in Europe or so I hear. Thoughts??

 Thanks for reading this far!

;;TLDR;;

 my question/s to all you poly peeps; 

how do you recognize when a relationship is platonic and not romantic/ vis versa? 

How do you foster deep love platonically without wanting to move deeper into romance? That is something that is hard for me to resist as i get to know someone on a deeper level.

what even IS the difference between romantic love and platonic love?I (33F) just ended my first poly relationship with a nesting couple (42M, 44F)There were a lot of missed red flags in the beginning. I still can’t help but be a little wounded. Any advice of breakups, getting back out there eventually, or general encouragement. This was my first poly relationship and while there were a lot of good things I felt very unwanted and secluded in the end.What were some of the emotional challenges you had, and how did you work through them?

How did spending less time together affect your relationship(s)?Hi everyone. I've been part of a quad for about a year now with three other people and I'm mostly happy with this setup. The other three (two girls and a guy) had already been together for a while before I met them. Recently though, the guy in our group has started talking to a new woman and wants to bring her into our polycule. The other girls seem to be really enthusiastic about her, but I feel really worried. I like things how they are and didn't expect another person to join so quickly. We all live in the same house so I'm worried that if they move in I'll be seeing them all the time even if we don't get on. My boyfriend has started asking me to take her out to coffee but I don't even know this girl and I'm not sure I want to encourage her to join my group lol.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Am I just jealous because I won't be the "new" one anymore? How do I raise my concerns to my boyfriend?I have been worried that some of my past dysfunctional family behaviors would creep in somehow and destroy my poly family. Then just in passing, I thought is this the reason that I gravitate to a poly family?

As a child, we were a family of six. Completely dysfunctional, always verbally and/or physically fighting one another as I grew up – dad was an alcoholic, mom lacked maturity, that ended in divorce and it spiraled down to us the children in many different ways.

Is this why I long for a strong feminine and masculine figure in my life in an attempt to rebuild what I never had?A lot of people on this sub that identify with polyamory talk about having a nesting partner and dating others “more casually.” Or even having 2 partners and dating others “more causally.” By the definition I originally believed before more research the former is actually non-monogamous and the later is poly with 2 and practicing NM with others.  Realistically causal does not usually mean loving and committed. Point being my impression is there are people on here dating without the intention to form a loving/committed relationships with everyone, who identify as poly.  And that’s fine because realistically a lot of people want both love and something more causal and may even be fluid with spectrums of both love and commitment.

I don’t actually care what people do per se and I’m not trying to gatekeep I’m just confused if most people use “polyamory” on dating apps to mean the umbrella term (which can just be sex according to wiki) or specific to seeking long term loving relationships? And what the hell is romance an in between?  I don’t want to misrepresent myself and obviously I would get into specifics with what the term means to me to clarify but I’m curious if there is any general consensus because ideally I do want to be specific and not misrepresent what I am/want off the bat. 

I am polyamorous (non-h) with 2 people but I’m considering dating other people casually right now, what am I lol? Also is this frowned upon in the poly community not offering an equal chance for full relationships even if I’m 100% honest since it’s a type of hierarchy?  Some part of me wonders if I should stop myself dating if I can’t offer the chance at love that I give my partners? I’m proud to be poly and worked hard at making sure I’m non hierarchical but now I kind of want to date others casually without as many strings after a couple years.  I feel a bit conflicted essentially because I feel like what I also want now is potentially mutual using and caring rather than what I originally identified with as loving poly relationships. 

Wikipedia says: 
“Polyamory has come to be an umbrella term for various forms of non-monogamous, multi-partner relationships, or non-exclusive sexual or romantic relationships.”

TLDR: How common is being both poly and non-monogamous or what is it called if you have committed partners and want to casually date? Is this frowned upon or unethical in the polyamory community?I was in a situationship with a man who had a girlfriend, and who always pointed out she was his number one and always came first, no matter what. She had these ridiculous rules to what we were allowed and not allowed to do. In the end I felt like a mistess since she never even met me, and always felt like I had to protect her feelings by not getting too close to him, even if we had a deep connection. It still rubs me the wrong way. Thoughts?I've been a big fan of Lindy West for a while - she's sharp and hilarious and vulnerable and totally unashamed of her shameful feelings and experiences. Now she's opened up publicly about being poly and here she is in an interview with her triad! love this so much for her. And I love that someone I ALREADY stanned is talking about their poly life.My first poly experience started when I began dating my close friend who was in an open marriage. I've known her husband, I'll call him Boris, almost as long as I've known her but I wouldn't say we ever really spent time together without it including her, I'll use the name Katie. 

About 2 years ago Katie and Boris both spoke to me about their intentions to explore their sexualities and opening their marriage.  They asked if it might be something I was interested in being involved with. So things started from there basically. Initially we were all very friendly and understanding. Boris struggled from early with his insecurities and often compared himself to me. I'm very confident in my body so I think that made it even worse. As things with me and Katie began to progress towards a more loving/ romantic relationship (not just casual sex), he started acting really passive aggressive: enforcing boundaries where they didn't make sense, accusing us of trying to make him feel bad, accusing us of having revenge sex. All through this time I was trying to be as accommodating as I could so that he could feel comfortable. 

Eventually I started to notice that he really didn't have any consideration of my feelings. I became totally disposable in his mind. One time he veto'd mine and Katie's relationship(he's since then lost that right and I realise it was a rookie mistake to even allow that conversation to be so one sided) only then to ask us if we could continue literally a day later because he saw someone at a house party he was interested in. He also on another occasion told Katie that she should cut contact with me completely. I understand that it was a difficult time for all of us but it wouldn't have taken much thought to know that her cutting me out would have been really devastating at that time. I did confront him about it and he admitted he hadn't thought about what that might have done to me once.

I tried to have multiple conversations with him about boundaries and his passive aggression but he's very very self absorbed and any dialogue just turns into a 2 hour waffle about how much of a victim he is in the situation. 

I then decided about a year ago to go full parallel and reduce my interactions with him as much as I could. But then, more recently I'd been talking to him about returning a mixer I'd lent to him. It required fixing as he'd previously broken it. When I approached him and asked that he fixed my stuff before returning it he was very abrasive. It was really the last straw for me. I told him he should never talk to me like that again and that he should resolve the situation ASAP. A year later and he's still not yet returned all my belongings. 

Over the last few months whenever i tried to bring it up with Katie she keeps telling me that she's not involved. They've had a load of issues within their relationship and I feel like she's not trying to accept anymore tension between them.

Yesterday I spoke to her about the way the dynamic was affecting me. I feel hurt because Boris continually shows that he has no respect for my person and Katie just watches it happen. When I tried to tell her he's not a nice person she kept saying she didn't agree because he's "progressed". I tried to make the point that the difficulty I'm having with him now is symptomatic of the same absolute lack of consideration that meant he was so casually able to ask her to drop me out, or to veto our relationship and that unveto on a whim. I love my relationship with Katie but i cant get over the fact she's in love with someone that has been so disrespectful of me. 

She's coming over later to talk about it and I have no idea what to do.

Any advice the community could offer will be appreciated. Thanks for reading people.Hello! I [F 25] have been on Feeld and other dating apps looking to expand my polycule/poly community in my city. In the last year of intentionally seeking out connections I’ve found, more than not, people who claim poly/ENM but haven’t done the work or show that they don’t want to do the work.

For example, I matched with the person and they stated “ENM” and “polyamorous” on their profile but when I started chatting with them, they were clearly a newbie and unfamiliar with poly terms. Them being a newbie isn’t an issue… it was when they said “I tend to stay away from labels because I find comfort is being able to maneuver”. Basically saying they didn’t care to immerse themselves in the language of poly/enm.

I understand the comfort in that but it doesn’t make it the ethical thing to do. (other thoughts on that would be appreciated) I rolled my eyes and replied with “Ironically I find it harder to maneuver without ‘labels’. I prefer using terminology and definitions created by and for ENM while exploring ENM. It also helps with communication and boundary setting.”

They also said they’re looking for “casual but consistent”. Another eyeroll because (now this is me just assuming so I could be wrong) I’m sure by that they meant they don’t want commitment/string attached, but consistency requires some level commitment. To that I replied with “That’s contradicting, could you be more specific/provide a best case scenario?”

I had a feeling that after that slight dig into their approach the weren’t going to message back. And they never messaged back lol. If a person doesn’t want to reply/agree that communication and boundary setting is important then I’m no longer interested in perusing them anyways. So I’m not upset about this particular person not messaging back/the rejection isn’t what I’m upset with… I’m frustrated that this has been my most common experience so far. Sometimes I even find myself in the position of providing these types of matches poly/enm literature and media for them to start somewhere with help… but I’m tired of facilitating newbies’ entrance into poly/enm.

Basically, I’m sharing this example and my experiences to explain how I’m truly tired and frustrated of people claiming such labels as “ENM” and “polyamorous” but not doing the work that those labels/relationship orientation/culture call for. Am I being too mean with these newbies on these dating apps? I know my expectations aren’t unreasonable. But man, my experiences are making me think they are.

I know that ‘teaching’ a prospective partner is an option but that’s not within my mental and emotional capacity to do any time soon.

Any general tips, words of encouragement or even anyone who is struggling with the same thing want to share their experiences are welcome in the comments… 😪

More specific questions; 

How do I find others who have lived-in poly experience/aren’t afraid of ‘labels’?

Is there a way to meet others who have “done the work” that I’m unaware of?

Is this just a part of being poly and it will always be something that we accept and work with? 

How do I kindly, respectfully and honestly tell people to do the work and read the books and listen to the podcasts??!

How do I support newbies while also rejecting them but not taking on the teaching role?


Thanks in advance,
ChellieMy wife and I have been ENM for  little over 4 years. We have both had our ups and downs. Currently she has a girlfriend and I can not be happier for the both of them.

She has had her stay over a couple times and both have not stopped smiling when they are around each other.

Cut to this morning. I am getting dressed for work and I have a pair of under wear I don't own in my drawer. I ask why she has her under ware in my drawer. She says "Those aren't mine", then turns bright red and tells me they are her girlfriend's.

She runs to grab them out of my hand, while I am processing the whole thing. I can't help but laugh my ass off.

&#x200B;

I have had so many happy moments, but this one I had to share. Who knew my wife finding another woman's undies would leave me rolling of the floor laughing my ass off.

LOLAnd I know that cat owners have it worst…My ex was poly and pretty terrible at relationships. One of his other long term partners had absolutely awful self esteem issues that stemmed in part from the way he treated her (nothing overt, just continuously being subtly and subconsciously treated as less than by my ex-partner) . I was partially financially dependent on him while we were together which is probably why I stayed so long in that relationship. 

He broke up with me the day after we had a fight where I was prepared for things to be over and he begged me to try to make it work. I got home and asked him if we could talk, I started talking about what I needed for the relationship to work, he pushed back on certain points, I got frustrated, and then he told me that he had already decided to break up with me earlier that day. I reacted poorly. 

Tried to find some way to live together peacefully especially because we were social with our roommates.  In all this time he never gives me a real apology, despite me apologizing for every possible thing I can think I fucked up on. 

I am literally throwing up from stress

Two weeks after our break up, he offers to cuddle our hot roommate while they're in front of me. When I try to explain to him that I was incredibly uncomfortable with that he offers to "help me with my jealousy" 

He seems to have a history of unhappy relationships with vulnerable women, and the fact that none of the poly people he knows seems to have called him out on it is so shitty. 

I've moved on from that relationship in most ways, but I still get triggered when I see polyamory mentioned in the media, especially when it features white men.Looking for perspective from the more enmeshed poly folks (i.e. married, nested, "primary", etc.) who've made agreements which essentially restricted the intimacy of other relationships. Not necessarily picking from the relationship escalator menu (i.e. no moving in with other partners, getting married, having children, etc.) or safer sex practices, but agreements closer to; restrictions on # dates per month with other partners, no overnights, no weekends, no vacations, etc.

If you'd like to share, describe the agreement(s) and reply to the following;

1. At the time the agreement was made, how long had you and the partner you made the agreement with been polyamorous together?
2. Why was the agreement needed?
3. Do you believe it helped with getting your or your partner's needs met? Why or why not?
4. If it was intended to be a permanent agreement, did it stay that way? If not, what changed?
5. If it was temporary, how long did it take to do away with it (if you did)? What needed to happen?
6. What affect did the agreement(s) have on your other partnerships? Were there any unintended effects on the (presumably more "primary") partnership it was made for?
7. Any regrets with the execution or would you uphold it/place it again, if needed?

Or--if you've been the partner on the outside of another more coupled/enmeshed unit, what has your experience been like when agreements were placed against your relationship? Was it temporary (assuming you stuck around to find out)?

Just looking for anecdotes. Thank you!I'm not actually polyamorous but was in a - let's call it poly adjacent - relationship for some time.  I imagined  there's a lot of overlap and maybe some of you have had similar experiences and can provide insight.

A few years ago, I met Jenny and Robert (names changed).  They were a couple at the time.  Although the 3 of us met at the same time, my relationship with each of them grew independent of the other.  Jenny and I hung out without Robert and vice versa.  I actually met Robert first through FetLife but we hadn't yet met in person.  We were both interested in a D/s relationship and quickly hit it off.  Of course, before the D-ing and the s-ing started, we had to have a meet and greet.  The three of us met and I instantly adored them both.  Flash to six months later and we're all close friends. Like hide a body, no questions asked friends.  While the three of us were always together, Jenny and my's relationship was never romantic or sexual.  I'm not polyamorous.  Robert and I were always friends first.  So, when they broke up (about 1 year from the date we met) I was conflicted.  At that point I considered them both my closest friends. Their breakup was bad and you can imagine how I felt as the 3rd wheel.  Thankfully we were all able to navigate the situation without major fallout, but aside from forcing cordiality when absolutely necessary, they don't speak to each other anymore.  I'm still friends with them both though.


It's been a year and a half since they broke up. My relationship with Robert didn't change after they broke up. I remained his sub (for a while) and we remained good friends.  Jenny had some feelings about that for sure, but also agreed that it was unrealistic to expect Robert and my's relationship to end because theirs did. I'm not closer to one than I am to another.  I love them both. I'm confident that by now she's fine with our friendship.  The problem is that I think Robert and I are low-key in love.  He talked to me about wanting us to explore a romantic relationship. I had to admit my feelings for him too.  It's the dream situation.  Best friends becoming a couple.  We then had to have a pretty shitty conversation where I explained that no matter how much I'd like to be with him, I couldn't ever break Jenny's heart like that. Even though it's been nearly 2 years since the split, she's still processing it. After some back and forth for a few weeks, we were both on the same page.  We could never be romantic.  And like an idiot I thought our relationship wouldn't change.  We still saw each other multiple times a week, spent the night (we had ended our sexual relationship sometime before this), talked all day on the phone, but after that conversation the only thing I could think about was "damn, we'd make a great couple". I'm pretty sure I love the guy and he feels the same for me. I know we can't be together.  Dating your best friend's ex is pretty garbage behavior, but can I even be friends with Robert anymore knowing the way we feel about each other?  I absolutely love his company and losing his friendship would be an enormous loss for me.  Is the idea of staying "just friends" a fantasy? WTF am I supposed to do?!


TLDR;

I'm in love with my friend who is also another  friend's ex. The 3 of us were a "thing" for a while then they split up. I don't want to betray her by dating him, but it's hard to think of him as just a friend now.  Do I have to choose 1 or the other? Can I even be friends with him now? Should I be? Help!Hi! I am poly and partnered and don’t have much experience but am learning and open to your feedback. Even if critical! 

I’ve been on Tinder (I know, I know) for a couple weeks but have matched with a surprising number of men who have ENM info in their profile. Each of them has identified to me in our chats that they are into BDSM. I have nothing against BDSM, it’s just that I have no experience really and it does intimidate me a little bit. I am open to exploring it with someone who can do so slowly and with baby steps-and after we have developed a trusting and comfortable relationship. 

If helpful to know-I’m looking for a man to date: to flirt with, go on dates with, and have sex with, if the physical and emotional connection is there.

I’m wondering if I’m an outlier in the poly community because I don’t do BDSM? Am I less appealing to those who are?

Edit: I searched this sub and found some similar posts that I’ll read!I am newish to the community, I have done polyamory off and on for about 4ish years.  Today my partner went on their first date since we opened up and honestly, it was exhausting and anxiety-filled but I am wanting to learn and be friends with their PP (Potential Partner). 

I am looking for resources to help me be more comfortable being alone and coping with a bit of a dependency issue emotionally since I am my partner's caretaker (non-sexual) as well.  

I am also looking for resources to point me in the right direction to be more supportive of my partner since this is their first real foray into polyamory and I want them to get off to a good start.Me, personally? I prefer looks more (but I do go for personality too), I gotta be physically attracted to them in order for me to pursue them. I don’t bash anyone who doesn’t fit my perception of beauty, I don’t belittle them, or whatever. I’m kind to everyone regardless of physical appearance.This is more theoretical than something I’m dealing with at the moment, but I have with it in the past and don’t always feel like I’ve dealt with it in the best way I could. 

When it comes to kink I mostly enjoy non sexual or mildly sexual BDSM with people I’m not really dating. I seek it out more as a hobby and for the short term thrill than as a thing I want in my daily life. 

I’ve had partners not be happy that I don’t do certain kinks with them in the bedroom but do enjoy it outside the bedroom with other people. 

The honest thing is, I enjoy it with people who are already really experienced at it and who I don’t crave emotional closeness from. I don’t really want to go through the learning process with someone, especially if I’m happy with our sexual and relationship dynamic otherwise. I just want to zone out and drop in when I do kink. 

How do I approach this conversation when someone I’m dating has totally reasonable hurt or jealous feelings about this but I still feel the way I do? How do I reassure them? Is this something I should bring up in the beginning if they express an interest in kink?M/24 here,  I'm new to polyamory and I always wanted to be in a relationship like that, it's so much more comfort, trust, and overall amazing feeling, but how can you tell if someone is poly as well? I don't know anyone or met anyone else who isI'm in my early 30s and in a long-term nesting partnership with one partner (also early 30s) who has another long-term partner. I sometimes date, but am honestly pretty busy with work/hobbies/etc, and I get plenty of love/attention/affection from friends (platonically and otherwise), so it's usually not a top priority for me. I have had a couple of longer term casual involvements over the years, but no other committed partnerships.


One thing I'm struggling with in dating, especially with a non-escalator approach, is how to determine when something isn't working to the point it should be ended vs just continue to exist as a casual/comet thing. In the absence of a major incident, I find I'm more willing to overlook yellow flags because overall my needs are being met in my life. Or I'll let an "okay" thing go on for longer than it probably should because I don't have a really strong reason to end it, even if I'm hesitant about some aspects, because I can just de-escalate the relationship.



Just wondering how other people approach making the decision between de-escalating and breaking up or what kinds of things are on your "non-negotiable" list, regardless of the level of the involvement?this is a multi-part question and kind of long, so please bear with me….

My partner and I are “new” to poly even though I came out to them as poly almost a year ago. They are mono, a thousand percent. No desire to have any other relationships besides what we have together. They are being incredibly supportive of my journey. 

I did tons of research and joined all the forums, read books, websites, we started seeing a poly friendly therapist together, seemingly doing all the “right things”

Cut to last weekend when I went on my first date. I had a blast. I came home feeling guilty about how much fun I had with someone who was not my partner. I realized that my guilt wasn’t because I did anything WRONG but more because of what society teaches us is a “normal” relationship and it’s not easy to unlearn those standards.

But my partner requested early on that they didn’t want to know any intimate details of my date. Okay, that is fine with me too. Just be safe and honest. They also requested that they never wanted to become friends with anyone I am dating, but that is is important that they meet.

For me this causes some issues. If they have no intentions of being friendly with my other partners, why would it matter that they meet? Is my judgement not good enough to determine wether someone is able to be my partner? Originally they said it was because they “wanted to make sure the other person isn’t a d-bag” now I am 38 and my partner 40. I feel like I have had enough relationship experience where I can figure out if someone is a turd or not. 

My other worry is that they started asking details about my dates hobbies and interests. I have no problem sharing these things, just not sure if my partner actually wants to hear them or only *thinks* that they do. When I started listing things, it turns out they have a lot in common. This upset them, like why would I need to seek out another partner if they just end up being so similar to the one I already have? I see it as going down a bad slippery slope of my current partner comparing themselves to whoever I date. That seems super unhealthy to me.

My questions are: how can I approach the subject with my current partner that similar interests don’t matter if they don’t intend on ever being around each other? How can I make my current partner more secure what with we have established (5 years and a home together) and realize I’m not going to leave them for someone “better”? Help them see that comparing is going to be unhealthy the more dates I am going on? That the other people I date are actual people and not just reduced to what they do for fun?

If you have read this far, thank you SO SO SO much.

Basically I want to make sure my current partner can see that I am uncomfortable with how this is being handled after just one date. Obviously we are going to talk about this more together, but I wanted to seek input from anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation.

EDITING TO ADD: current partner and I have been friends 20+ years, together for 5+
When I came out as non-monogamous we had multiple discussions about how to handle and move forward, either with OR without continuing a relationship. I did not force them to stay with me. This is a decision we made as partners. We have been in weekly therapy together specifically to discuss polyamory for almost a year. This was just my first date, and the emotions that happened with both of us.even if that means asking my NP to not invite their fwb to social events with our other friends? Is it okay to ask that even if I won't be there? 

Bit of background: My meta and I aren't crazy about each other but we are amicable. My NP asked one time if he could invite him to something, I said no, my NP was okay with that and didn't bring it up again, and now I'm finding myself wondering if I should have said yes given that I generally value "permissabilty" in a relationship. My NP and meta have not yet defined their relationship beyond "fwb".

If my NP wants to include their fwb in their friend life, and those friends are mutual friends with me, is there a boundary I can set here? Where have you set this boundary? Should I wait for more a commitment between my NP and meta beyond fwb?My wife started with having an open pure sexual relationship (me staying monogamous) and has now come out as poly, she loves me but also has feelings for her “boyfriend”. I was not that shocked to be honest, the thought of her being poly crossed my mind since she started seeing this guy. Ask me anything.Hey there, and sorry if you are seeing a repeat post, I did post in another forum. My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. We were married young, and have only ever been with each other. 

What started as a random discussion , has turned into a rather serious one of us considering an open marriage. But neither one of us are interested in "just sex". It isn't about sex. We both feel like we would be interested in having a relationship with other partners. But we have no clue, how to start, where to start, and what questions to really be asking. It is exciting and terrifying. We love each other to the core but we both admit that there are needs, wants, living even that we would like to do. I don't know if I make sense but.. 

We both are nervous, new, worried about jealousy, competitiveness, etc. There are so many questions and it isn't exactly something we can call up our family and ask. We don't know anyone in the community so to speak. So we just , are very interested in this journey but are seeking the honest truth from it. The good, the bad, and the in between. Anything you would like to share would be great.. Thank you in advance :)My spouse and I have been together for 12 years and poly from the beginning. About 5 years ago she started dating her current boyfriend. Overall I really like the guy, mainly because he makes my wife happy, but also because he's fun to hang out with. We all watch TV and play video games together.  

However, he does one thing that is really obnoxious and I don't know how/if I should address it. He constantly gives unneeded and unsolicited advice to everyone. Some of it is so basic and common sense as to be insulting. For example; my friend mentioned that she was moving to an area with high housing costs. He proceeded to explain to her that if she got an apartment with an extra room she could get a roommate and save money. 

What do you think I should do? Should I talk to my wife, or to him directly? I don't want to sound petty or antagonistic. If he was a friend this would be different.Hi everyone—my name is Camila Kerwin. I’m a radio producer for Marketplace, working on a show about the role money plays in our lives and relationships. 

We’re hoping to connect with long-term platonic life partners whose lives have grown financially merged. We’re curious how those money conversations and milestones played out. We’re also curious how platonic couples interested in romantic relationships outside the platonic one find balance and communicate.

This is for an episode about forms of commitment that fall outside the “rule book.” I’d be so grateful to hear from you in the comments or as a dm/email. Thank you!

PS—Mods, please let me know if it’s ok to post this!I’m actually not sure if I’m poly or not but for the sake of argument I’ll say I am. I’m an ace gay person who doesn’t catch feelings for people. My partner is a gay ace poly person. We’ve been dating online for about six months. We’ve had great communication about various stuff but when it comes to us being public they become shifty and avoid it with “I don’t wanna be too exposed in public”. Things have been great but for the last month I’ve noticed some weird behavior from them.  Lately they’ve been constantly online talking and interacting with people on Instagram and Twitter and then way later messaging me. On Instagram they have it public for their work. Anytime I add a comment just supporting them and asking a question all I get is a like meanwhile they always rely back to other people. I try my best to be super supportive of them but they just give me a mere thanks. We have a lot of date nights being on the phone and watching them game. My main issue tho is that they want to keep our relationship a secret. We have a close group of friends but doesn’t want to tell them about us even though they said they were okay with them knowing. Am I being insecure or should I be worried? I’m not against poly people or anything because we have talked about it. They said if anything ever came up that we would talk about together. Im just confused and I can really use some help. Thank you.Like, I have a partner(A) and they have another partner(B). I do not like A's other partner, but I'm happy for them and am happy A+B get to have their unique relationship. But yeah, I dislike B, I am in no way dating B at all. Am I breaking some poly rule I'm unaware of? Is this bad """""praxis""""? 

"Am I the drama? I don't think I'm the drama."As I'm sure you are all aware, conversations regarding OPP come up semi-regularly on this sub. Usually, those follow the format of:

"I have a vagina, and my penis-having partner says we should do poly, but only under the rule of an OPP. What should I do?"

followed by lots of comments saying:

"OPP is misogynistic," or, even better as of late, "How about an OVP?"

So, my question: are there any bi-penis-havers who have encountered a demand for an OPP in a poly setting (i.e., "no other penis than the two of ours, but add as many vaginas as you want")?

As a secondary follow-up, have any bi-penis-havers encountered a similar restriction, but allowing for relationships ONLY with other penis-having-people? i.e., no vaginas? I have heard that there can be quite a bit of bi-phobia among lesbians (i.e., there is sometimes an aversion towards bi-women who have dated or are dating men)., so I wonder if a similar things has been experienced by anyone in this group.

Of note: I am not looking for advice, as this OPP situation doesn't apply to me. I'm just curious as to how this shows up in non-hetero poly relationships. Thanks in advance!Hello! I'm a student that practices polyamory, and would like to hear your insights/opinions on the topic for an essay I'm writing. I'm not out to many people that aren't my friends, partners, or partners of partners, so I don't really know what the general public, or people opposed to polyamory think it's about. If you could help me, I'd really appreciate it, and if people are interested I can drop a link to the essay when it's finished. Thank you for your time.I feel the need to share with new potential partners that my long term relationship goal would be to live with a partner, long term. However, a huge part of being poly is about *not* defaulting to that trad goal all the time. 

 I feel as though stating this NP goal sets a strange precedent for the vibe of the relationship, as if every interaction is measured against our predicted compatibility for years to come.

I could refrain from stati g my goal, but I feel that it helps to preclude ending up on a date with someone who already has a NP, or dating someone who is solo poly but doesn't really want an NP.

 When is the right time to say that I'm looking for an NP without wasting time or sounding un-poly?

edit: the community has taught me that I am more poly than solo

edit2: will add to dating profile, "poly and unpartnered with the capacity for ltr, but great connection is most important to me"

final edit: A warm thank you to the real ones! 

And to the not-so real ones, please embody the beauty of poly: use r/r4r instead of hitting on people who post in this sub; don't make assumptions about others' gender or preferences, and accept others where they're at!My comet partner and I don’t usually get jealous or fight about anything — either because we were securely attached and generally drama-free, or because the relationship has just always felt pretty low stakes. But today, I’m feeling frustrated. I’m starting to feel like not only have we drifted even further apart than usual, but that I’m actually resentful that they haven’t put in more effort. 

We’ve been dating for 2 years, but we don’t text/call that frequently, and only see each other once a month or less. I go back and forth between “this is fine, this is just the nature of our relationship” and being annoyed when they don’t text me back or when they go like a week without initiating a conversation. It doesn’t feel the same as when I’ve been in toxic relationships where I’m like desperate for them to text me back — it just feels annoying, not heartbreaking. 

On top of that, they’ve been discussing moving to live closer to their de facto primary, which would be much farther away from me. I can’t imagine what seeing them even *less* than I currently do would look like. 

On the other hand, I feel like I have lost my romantic feelings for them. So maybe none of this even matters or like I don’t have a right to be upset. Maybe they feel the same and that’s why it’s been like this. Either way…today I’m feeling mad about the whole situation.

ETA: I do have plans to talk to them and I’m working up the nerve to have the break up conversationThe company I work for is denying me leave for my gf's life threatening surgery because we aren't legally married. We are in a committed equal triad with our boyfriend. We have considered marriage for all combinations of the three of us, either he and her, me and her, and him and me, but for financial and insurance reasons, it makes more sense to stay as we are. He is able to take four days when she has the surgery, but I need a couple weeks after that because she can't stay alone after. I am pretty sure they denied me in hopes I will quit, but I can't without another job. If I call out for those days, they've said they'll consider that me quitting. I don't know what to do.

Edit to add update: was called in early today and terminated. The forged writeups from my former boss to do it. I have never had a write up in my life. Am consulting with an attorney.Me F(21) and my partner M(23) have been together for ~3 years now and we’ve moved into a polyamorous relationship in the past year. I love him so much and I’m confident in our relationship. Our communication is amazing and i never feel like I’m holding back when i talk to him. However, since becoming polyamorous he hasn’t let me date other guys, only girls. He’s allowed to see girls also. It’s felt unfair for a while but i haven’t pushed him because i don’t want him to resent me, but I’ve been having dreams about wanting to date guys lately and i feel like i have to bring up the topic again. He’s very insecure that if i start dating a guy I’ll leave him, but he’s not worried about a girl. 
I don’t want to upset him because i know he feels guilty that he can’t get past this, but it’s starting to bug me again. 
I guess my question is how should i approach this? Should i get more information about this type of insecurity/jealousy? I’d really appreciate help!I feel....weird. 

My husband and I started this under my direction because it felt right at the time. At first it was just nice to kiss people but then I started having sex with someone and though it's nice, I feel off. I feel like I'm not giving my husband enough and I'm just out living my best hoe life. He doesn't really like to be out and about but I do. I'm worried he is afraid to talk to me about how he feels. It's weird because we've always been very open with communication. I think maybe we just are feeling the feelings but don't know how to express them?

I'm starting to question if being open is for me but at the same time it's weird to think of going back to being monogamous. I like being open because I don't like any form of restriction. I don't like authority, I don't like being told what to do. I got big brother issues. 

But also...tell me what to do? 🙃I’ve had a not so great weekend in the jealousy department and I just want to vent . My non-nesting partner of 7 months (28, NB) spent the weekend with another one of their partners for her birthday. This partner is someone they’ve known for about 3 years but didn’t start dating until about May of last year .

For some reason, I can’t stop comparing myself to her and feeling jealous even though I’ve never met her face to face , and I’m having a hard time shaking that feeling  :/ She’s beautiful and she seems sweet from what I’ve heard . I know it isn’t rational, I know it isn’t logical and I know it isn’t anything my partner has said or done. I know jealousy can sometimes stem from unmet needs or neglect but in this case , I sat with myself and determined that isn’t the root . We’re close, our relationship is healthy, stable , and I can say with certainty that my needs are being met and if for some reason they aren’t , we communicate non-violently and do better .  THEY don’t compare us to eachother , so why am I? 

I don’t know if it’s the old monogamous mindset that if you know someone longer , it automatically means they’re more “important” to you. But I don’t feel that way about my partners spouse so why is this woman I’ve never met making me feel that way? I don’t know if I feel threatened by the length of time they’ve known eachother? (Their 3 years opposed to our less than a year). I don’t know if I’m scared that our dynamic (which we both stated we’re happy with) will change which realistically speaking , could happen one day regardless of whether or not she exists . I don’t know if it’s the fact she was the first person my partner seriously dated outside of their marriage so it just seems .. more important? I don’t know if I’m having a bad self image week and just shitting on myself for no reason lol , I really don’t know . 

I am dating around and going on consistent dates with 2 other people , but neither of those bonds are incredibly intense at the moment, so I haven’t dealt with the possibility of jealousy or insecurity with either of them yet and hopefully won’t , even if they progress . But HOW do you stop comparing yourself? How do you stop feeling guilty for being jealous? I know it isn’t my partners fault so I feel ridiculous asking for reassurance about our relationship if nothing is wrong with it . I feel needy for asking them to tell me why they choose to be with me . I also don’t want to make them responsible for my negative feelings . I don’t want to ask for a ton of information on their relationship to assuage my fears because I know that isn’t healthy. I do so much inner work and self reflection, only to still struggle with feelings like this sometimes and it sucks .I'm in monogamous marriage... Just the only option I knew. I've been reading and realize my philosophy (which has not being that well) had a lot of overlap. I distinctly remember in marriage counseling explaining I need more me/you and less us. If I want to do things alone, it's not an insult. If you want to do more things, for the love of God, go do them! Without me!

We are two individuals who share some stuff! Not one couple who occasionally do things alone.

If, for some reason, I could do it all again, I believe I'd be solo poly. And if I'd change that status it would be because I want to, not because "it's the thing to do"what i mean is my gf is poly and we meet when i was poly too. but lately i've been wondering if i am poly of if poly was my excuse for trying to get out of a toxic relationship.  
i don't want her to stop being poly not at all. her bf is an amazing man and id hate to see her lose him.  
i just think im not poly any more and that i might be happy just settling were i am.   
sorry for the ramble, don't have poly friends and i don't want to randomly bring this up to my gf.Firstly: I am fairly new to poly dated one guy but that went bad too quick. 

So I’m talking to a guy and they’ve practiced poly for 3 yrs, I’m the first person he’s talked to and taking baby steps. We like a lot of things and get along but he talks about his partner a lot! I really don’t like that but I also understand it’s his wife. Is it out of line to ask for it to just be about us? Last guy used to “accidentally” call me by his wife’s name very often so it makes me uncomfortable. 

What can I do?… because I feel particularly grateful today. I have been going through a terrible time trying to have a baby with my nesting partner R and just found out that pregnancy #3 isn’t going to work out either (rare chromosome abnormality - the others were a severe neural tube defect and a miscarriage). My other partner D has been so loving and supportive through these awful experiences. He has been helping me process my grief, while at the same time having to deal with the fact that I keep moving between pregnant and not-pregnant, which has implications for the short to medium term future of our relationship. He’s just taking each day as it comes with me and I love him so much for it. Before we started seeing each other he had zero experience with poly. But 9 months in, he is navigating this world with grace and compassion. I am in a terrible place emotionally but surrounded by love.Hello!

I'm new to the Reddit scene, but not the poly scene. I have been struggling with trying to find like minded poly people in my area and I'm not sure what else to do or try.

My (26F) partner (28M) (we date separately) and I live in the Northern Nevada area, and because we live in such a small town, I don't feel we have a huge community here. I do want to find an additional friends/like minded people/ potential partner(s) for myself and for him even, but I'm not sure which path to take. 

I have tried doing the tinder and bumble thing, and I don't seem to get any matches that last past the "talking for 3 days straight and conversation dies" or getting people who are curious about polyamory and then run off when they decide they can't "handle it" (those are usually the mono people that I try to give a chance, dumb of me honestly).

Any advice or websites to check out would be so appreciated!! I really do love this community, I'm just stuck right now..

❤️Hi all, poly baby here and I feel lost. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. My (26/nb) partner (25/f) wants to restructure our relationship, and I could use some advice.

For background: We started out as monogamous, and have been doing polyamory for about 6 months, and have been together for a year and a half. She currently has one other partner, her best friend/roommate (F/25) of like 5 years, and they started a romantic relationship after we opened things up. I currently don't have another partner. The three of us were talking and planning on moving in together later this year once all our leases were finished.

A few days ago, my partner and I sat and talked, and she said that 1) she doesn't know if moving in together is the right move, 2) she thinks that *long term* down the line she sees herself marrying her partner and not me (though she said that could just be their NRE excitement), and 3) she does not think that us being anchor/nesting partners is sustainable at this time.

We talked for the entire next day and she said that she is having trouble meeting my needs for time spent together, and she's noticing a lot of incompatibilities in our relationship now that our NRE has worn off. When I asked her about them and why they weren't brought up before, she said it wouldn't be fair to have a list of things I would need to change about myself in order to satisfy her, which is totally fair. Regarding us living together, she doesn't think it'd be smart as it could turn into a big point of resentment as I would watch things between her and her partner would grow more and more serious over time, and I agree with her.

She said wants to try to restructure our relationship. We talked about either going back to square one and rebuilding and growing our relationship as friends (as we kinda skipped that part and went straight into dating), or by continuing our romantic relationship with less time/commitment on being anchors. She said that the possibility of us becoming anchors later down the line isn't impossible, but right now it just doesn't seem feasible. We both still love each other, and want to be in each other's lives.

This is all very fresh so I asked for the week to gather my thoughts, and if I'm feeling up to it, we will talk next week and try finding either a poly teacher's peer support for couples, or find a couple's therapist that specializes in polyamory to figure out what our restructure looks like or if we can work through the incompatibilities.

I don't know what restructuring looks like, as all my other relationships were monogamous and would just end in breaking up. I know I want to continue our romantic relationship, and that it would be very hard to going back to being friends, and I would need *significantly* more time before I would be okay being around my partner, let alone seeing my meta or them together. Lastly, I feel that at this moment in time, I feel that even though it would suck and hurt a lot, that I can potentially see a future where my partner shifts from being my anchor to just another romantic partner, as that would be better than her not being in my life. And that if I were to start seeing someone else, it would offload getting all my wants and needs met by my partner. That wouldn't be the only reason I start seeing someone, as that's a really scummy thing to do imo. I just haven't been *looking* for a new person to date as I felt saturated and that all my needs were being met by my partner.

If you made it through all of that, I guess I'm just looking for advice from others who have restructured their relationships with their anchors/nesters/primaries. Thanks y'all.My partner and I have always talked about being open sexually, and now he has expressed his desire to be poly. I said I’d be willing to give it a try because I have fallen for multiple people before and was told I had to choose instead of being able to explore both connections. I said as long as we communicate and talk about what we want out of it and set boundaries and if I am in a crisis I need to be able to count on him. And I would do the same for him.  

After just one conversation, he went and started something up with someone he told me he liked and all of a sudden things happened lightning fast with little to no consideration or communication towards me. I feel very disrespected. 

He went to be with her for a night when something triggered some ptsd I had. I texted him just to get a reassuring response that I was not alone, and he barely paid attention or “thought it wasn’t that bad” which made me immediately feel that the request I had for our situation was not respected. 

He has expressed immense remorse and we are both new to being poly (I know NRE is intense) so mistakes will be made. I just am reaching out to get some advice because I want this to work and be happy for him and myself. I want to overcome this feeling of hurt. He since has done research into poly, has been working to reassure me after failing me, I want to believe him but with past trauma I’m having a hard time. Any advice would be appreciated :)So I am Poly, but I'm in a relationship that began before some of those things could be shared. (Long story, involved sharing a bed in an airbnb) We have been together for over a year, he knew I had been poly in the past but I wanted to give him time and security, I brought it up that I was poly and I wanted to have a conversation about it and was trying to be encouraging and comforting and supportive.

I wanted him to feel empowered and not afraid, no ultimatum other than it was "who I am" and I want to talk about it. He took it hard but then dated a guy without telling me under the impression that was the situation I was advocating for. He felt terrible and was very honest and volunteered he misunderstood our conversation (we have struggled with communication and are working on it). I brought it up again a week ago but he still feels bad about his date and how it hurt me.

I'm not sure he's poly but I don't want to lose him. 

What are some helpful ways we can have a conversation that isn't scary or intimidating? I don't want to force him on anything either, so at the end of the day if he isn't comfortable that's fine he know's we're stable for the forseeable future, but I don't want to shelf a part of myself indefinitely. 

What's your advice for talking introducing Poly?My triad and started to look at houses. As it stands now, they live together and I am seperate- we all have stable full time jobs as well. We want to move across country to buy the house because they are renting and it's not worth it. The way we see it, it's cheaper to buy a house than rent long term. I enjoy renovations and can do most of not all the work myself. 

How do you guys split finances? 

My first thought is to split bills three ways once we have the house, and have a contract signed to make sure it's all handled fairly. All seperate bank accounts and then one joint for bills. Does that sound fair?I'm excited! There is a new movie with jennifer lopez coming out called "Marry Me" that looks super fun so I invited my Meta to go with me and she said yes! My NP will be busy at work but he also has less interest in romantic comedies so this works out awesome!

Super fun time ahead!My partner and I have recently started dating solo. We talked about it a lot before deciding that we wanted to open up our relationship in this way. I’ve started talking to a women that I’m really starting to like and I don’t know how to tell my partner. I know he’ll have no issue as we both decided to open our relationship but part of me feels like I’m cheating on him even though I know I’m not. I have no real reason to be scared to bring it up but for some reason I am. Again I know he’ll just respond with something like “that’s cool” or “I’m glad you’re happy.” Is this mindset just from being in monogamous relationships for so long?



Update: told my partner and his response was “cool.” I really was overthinking 😅In response to the post asking for more positive poly experiences, here’s a something that made me smile. 

My boyfriend was out shopping with his wife and she saw a stuffed animal she wanted for Valentine’s Day. There were only a few left, but he couldn’t buy it right then because he wanted to surprise her. 

So while they were in the store he snapped a pic of it and sent it to me. They were still doing their shopping when I snuck into the store and grabbed the last one off the shelf. 

The giant peacock is currently hiding in the back of my car, waiting to surprise her on the 14th.

Helping him surprise her like this has made me so happy! 

I’m not poly myself. I think the term is mono-poly? I’m mono (pretty sure I am at least) but in a relationship with someone who is poly. 

I know a lot of people on this sub don’t like that. That’s understandable. I’ve heard some mono/ poly horror stories. 

But I love my boyfriend and I love his wife (friendship love).I feel like this would be the place but also want a more private place to talk to someone. 

Currently going though alot and wanting someone outside the situation with polycule experience to either talk to or dump info on.


Anyone got open inboxesMy wife and I have been in an on and off poly relationship/triad with another woman. I’ve always struggled with polyamory since this started. We all dated and it was too much for me so I requested we all end communication at least for some time because it was negatively impacting our marriage. It didn’t feel good being the one to limit everybody but I felt like I was going into depression as a result of it.

Several months later we saw the other woman out in public and decided to open communication. We agreed to being platonic friends but the other woman made alot of efforts to help my wife with her business and get back around us. They kept it platonic but I still struggled at times. Shortly after that my wife got VERY sick and our ex dropped everything and temporarily moved in with us to help. We have two young kids so she did make things more convenient even though I wasn’t comfortable with the amount of time she was now around us.

We remained platonic during this troubling time of my wife fighting for her life. Good news my wife has healed🙌She’s still recovering but she’s made it out of that dark tunnel. After that time several nights of us all together and drinking led to having sex again.

After this door opened back up I let our ex know I didn’t have bad intent and was trying to figure out if I could be ok with us getting back in a relationship. 

She’s basically abandoned her house and even recently mentioned she was switching her license in her town (1.5 hours away)to our town. This was a lot for me so after several days I told her I appreciated her efforts during those challenging times but it would make more sense to work from her area opposed to permanently living with us. I could tell this didn’t sit well for her and my wife also likes her around. But she said ok.

Since we had sex again we’ve slept in the same bed every night for months. Rarely does anything happen in bed because I’ve struggled with polyamory and been uncertain and they know it. My wife and I are way less intimate and affectionate with her around us 24/7. This is mainly due to my lack of comfort.

I’ve been trying to dive deeper with my wants and boundaries because I lost control of them both since we first opened our marriage two years ago to this woman. I find myself overwhelmed with anxiety trying to be a certain way for two women that I’m just not. I was originally open to a possible threesome if it happened but never needed that, or wanted an additional relationship for me or my wife. We were fully committed to just each other since 17-18 years old and we’re in our 30s today. 

Although I’m very attracted to the other woman and we naturally click in so many ways, I don’t have a desire to put time and energy into another romantic relationship. I often feel pressured because I move very slow and uncertain with our poly relationship because it feels like too much. I don’t feel I’m fully living my truth in it.

I’ve been feeling like it may be best to permanently end this triad and end any confusion. However I’m struggling with it because I do deeply Care for the other woman. I don’t like feeling like I’m limiting either of them but I also know I need to consider what I’m ok with.

I recently thought of the possibility of them continuing their relationship on top of our marriage. So I’d be monogamous to just my wife and be ok with them having their own relationship. In this, technically me and the other woman would both be committed to relationships with just my wife.

In a weird way I feel like this could possibly work. It would take the pressure off me that I’ve felt and struggled with for so long to pour into two when I don’t desire that. I desire the consistency of one woman. Funny me and the other woman have so much in common so our friendship is great when I’m not distancing myself due to the relationship pressure I constantly feel. If we all have a platonic friendship including them I believe I’d struggle with deep down wondering if they’re going behind my back. I don’t think they would but the thought of two people I care about doing that would constantly bother me. 

In a weird way I’m actually turned on by the thought of my wife having both of us to herself. In this I’d prefer the other woman living with us. She lives 1.5 hours away and I wouldn’t want my wife constantly traveling away from home to see her. If she lives with us she can just stay in the guest room and my wife could alternate who she’d sleep in bed with. We’d be right across the hall and could connect intimately without limits. They could fully express their love for each other privately without me restricting them and saying what they can’t do. They could love without a limit and go deeper than ever. I think they’d connect much more in that setting. My wife would have everything she wants.

Last night my wife and I had sex in bed for the first time in awhile while the other woman was in bed too. She was on top and after 10-15 minutes I pushed her to the other woman and did not include myself like I usually would. I just continued to encourage by giving my wife a gentle nudge into that direction. It was the least jealous I ever felt with everything and it was actually sexy. After words I nudged her over to cuddle with her too as we fell asleep. It was one of the most arousing nights I’ve experienced since this started.

The thought of them building their relationship/future together is a big turn on for me now for some reason.l and less pressure. When im dating both I feel betrayed naturally when they bond, with the thought of this their bond actually stimulates me.

I know this idea is fresh and I don’t want to make any irrational changes however I did mention it to my wife yesterday and she said she needs to think on it if she’d be ok with it too.

The thought of my wife having us both for her is more arousing for me even though I’m highly attracted to them both. Is this normal? Can anybody here relate or know anyone that find this possible dynamic sustainable? Any thought at all in this group is appreciated.When I look at poly relationships in the media, it's always some BS about how "it doesn't really work" 

or 

"only someone willing to accept a ridiculous set of circumstances and give up on all their dreams can MAYBE succeed being poly"

I've seen, in reality, plenty of happy, healthy, great poly relationships. 

I've been in the bdsm community in Houston for years and I know a ton of Polycules who are just happily chugging along, not a problem in the world. 

I've even already met some people in my tiny town in Norway who are just contentedly existing in their little poly world, living together, they have kids together, and everything is just.... fine.

So why is none of that being represented in this sub?

It seems like every time I get presented with something from this sub it's mono people complaining that their partner wants to be poly, unicorn hunters out on the hunt,  and people talking about drama. 

I wanna see some anniversary reports! Birthday celebrations! Success stories! "Why we've always been poly and I can't see my relationship existing another way"

I mean, I guess I understand why. Nobody cares about good news, right? Drama stirs the pot. Negativity drives engagement, right? 

But like, in a sub like this, where we're all starving for polyamory to be presented in a healthy light; Where we want the REALITY of polyamory to be seen by as many people as possible; the overarching theme of this sub *should* be "Hey look at us being amazing! Just on here to spread some love and give hope that this can happen for you too!"

I put this flair as "musings" because.... it's not a rant for me. I'm genuinely just kind of thinking about what I usually hope to see in here, and wondering if anyone feels the same. I'm not angry about anything. I suppose at least some of the mono people in here genuinely do want to know "how can I be more poly for my partner?".... and hey, what better sub to ask, right?

I guess I just wish I could see a lot more...I dunno... "cool" poly stories. "Wholesome" poly content. That kind of stuff. 

Anyway hope you're all having a good day. Much love

Edit: I guess one of the things I should have mentioned is that while my partner and I have an open relationship, we're not currently seeing anyone outside the two of us. That's kinda why I come in here to see the good stories. It looks like I need to filter for them, which I will gladly start doing! Thank you for the responses so far! I appreciate all of you taking the time!

Edit 2: holy shit that's a lot of responses. I really thought this would just be ignored. Uhm I'd just like to say I love you all and I hope you're all doing well. I'm not used to this kind of attention. Thank you for all the responses, I'm definitely going to keep looking for the good stories and I'll check out the other subs you recommended. I might not respond much for now as I'm a bit overwhelmed. But thank you. Thank you all. You're all very cool and valid and I hope your lives are amazing.I've (25f) recently entered a poly relationship with two amazing people (25m,23F) I've known for years. They're married. We've lived together for a little over two years now and have made a great team. We ended up sitting down and talking with one another and after setting up boundaries, we decided to give this a try. He and I have hit it off well and it feels like an honest relationship. We get along great and communicate openly about everything. There hasn't been a problem between he and I. 

She and I on the other hand have trouble communicating. It's not for a lack of trying on my end. In the beginning, she was all about this, she was even the one who brought it up to he and I. I really felt like she wanted me too. Sometime last month, communication just crumbled between us and interactions seem cold to me. I can't pinpoint anything that may have happened. I've offered to back off and have given her potential outs because I'd rather try and save our friendship than work towards a relationship she doesn't seem to want. Every time, she seems shocked and hurt that I'd say something and tells me she wants this, that I don't know how long and how badly she's wanted this to work out. But her actions don't show that. I feel like I'm trying so hard to earn the affection and attention of someone who doesn't want me in the same way. 
She says it's her mental health, which I get, I really do. But I feel like a stranger and unwanted when I can't even hold her hand. 
I don't know what to do.I’ll try to keep this brief. I am dating someone I would consider the love of my life. I’m absolutely head over heels in love with her. I recently came off of a long term monogamous relationship partially due to not being able to be polyamorous, but also because I was not in love. I have loved this woman that I’m now dating for a very long time, but was never able to act on it until now. 

I want to be poly but feel like a “baby” who is still getting used to it. I have talked with my partner (the girl I’m dating) and have expressed excitement for her when she talks to other people. I am still not seeing anyone else, as I don’t have any desire to at the moment. I’m also super busy with work so I can’t really handle too many relationships at once. She is more adept at handling many relationships than I am. She also has some (albeit limited) experience being poly. It is very much a part of her identity.

Anyway, she has been seeing a guy that I thought was something pretty casual, but it seems like it may be more than that. I think that is fine, and she has every right to do that, but…it just makes me sad. I cried earlier thinking about it. Our relationship is so new and so special, and while I relish the idea of her living her dreams and being completely free sexually, part of my feels robbed of the beauty of a budding relationship in some ways. I know it’s not true, but I can’t get the thought out of my head. She gives me a lot of attention, and we’ve spent a lot of time together lately, so I don’t feel bad about that. I think it’s just hard for me to understand what she is gaining out of this. I know I need to ask and seek to understand. 

I am going to talk to her, but it makes me feel annoying to even feel this way. I want to be a good poly partner. Is it always this hard in the beginning? Is there anything I can read to help me calm my jitters? What are some good ways to understand expectations of each other? Does anyone have a similar story?

I don’t want to be sad. I want to have fun, be free, and explore the depths of what is possible with love, especially with someone I am so deeply in love with. 

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to being a part of this community.I've been in a poly relationship with my partner Kate for 6 years. I've recently started seeing a new partner, Beth, which has been hard for Kate. Beth and Kate exchanged phone numbers last week and have been texting to get to know one another a bit.  
Today, Beth told me that Kate made her a bit uncomfortable by oversharing some feelings, impliying that I was not trustworthy, and saying a few things that came off as a bit passive aggressive.   


I don't want to put myself in the middle, but I'm also not feeling good about the situation. I can't imagine badmouthing my partner to one of her other partners. I feel really disrespected, but I don't know that it's appropriate for me to bring it up, since I was not part of the conversation and Beth didn't want me to make a big deal of it.   


Best case scenario, it's a big misunderstanding. Worst case scenario, my partner is actively sabotaging my new relationship. I don't think I can just carry on without addressing that it happened. Any suggestions on how to broach this with my partner while giving them the benefit of the doubt?So, my wife and I have started exploring different lifestyles. What we know for sure is that she is bisexuality, and we are both adventurous. Initially, we were thinking we would like swinging. The thing is, we really like having an emotional connection to our partners. Not to say, this doesn't happen when swinging. We decided to start looking for the situation that suits everyone involved the best. 

When we started looking, we quickly learned that every site is overrun with fee upon fee. A lot of the profiles were expired or spam. There are lots of single men with no respect or tact who simply ask, "Bro, let me fuck your girl."  On the other hand, you get a small portion of those present complained that couples interested in finding a unicorn (a lone female) are ruining the scene. 

So, where have you found success in finding friends and others interested in unconventional love and relationships? Okcupid was one of the sites listed. Feeld was the other app that was recommended. So far, the Feeld app has been the better option. Fetlife was recommended as well, but we haven't gotten there just yet. I'm sure the area you live in has a lot to do with the availability on any given site or app. The thing is, most of these sites are set up to nickle and dime.If you’re out there… S.O.S.

Does your partner(s) help you overcome your challenges with ASD, in addition to your mental health challenges?

Background: I am currently in separate LDRs with three women and one man. I am transparent to each partner about everything, but it would also be lovely that I find a A close distance partner or two. 

This is also based on me having ASD and mental health challenges.I recently got into a relationship with two amazing people. One I've known for four years and have always been in love with, one I met last November. We're all non-binary, queer and nerdy af. We're all in a group chat, we chat constantly, talk kinky things and validate and encourage each other. It's amazing, as a depressed, anxious person with body issues, to have two partners, to doubly reassure me that I'm amazing and worthy of love. 

I've overcome a lot of my intimacy issues in such a short time with this relationship dynamic. I finally, after a long time of struggle, have a healthy sex life, and feel so full of gratitude to know these incredible people. Our communication is great, we're extremely respectful of each others boundaries and mental health issues, and overall it feels like a little trio of best friends goofing around and fucking. We plan to move in together in the near future!Hey all, I know there's a book list in the resources, but it is quite short and misses a lot of books I see mentioned elsewhere, and the recommendations can vary depending on the poster's situation. 

So I was wondering, would you recommend specific books (or articles, websites, podcasts, youtube videos, etc)  in specific circumstances? For example, resources best suited to:  
\- single people coming to poly and looking to start new relationships  
\- couples looking to open their existing relationship\*  
\- people handling jealousy issues or feeling left out when their partner is experiencing NRE with someone else (maybe these are separate situations or have different recommendations?)  
\- general resources that everyone should read regardless of their individual circumstances  
\- any other circumstances I might have missed 

Basically, I'm a research junkie, and every time I see books recommended, I want them. Help a girl narrow down her shopping list, or at least put things on hold until such a time as they might be more useful?

\*or deconstruct their existing relationship and create new ones, I know there's a lot of further discussion around this as an area and the right approach, which some of the resources handle excellentlyJumping on the happy train and sharing a little something from my newly blossoming poly relationship.

Around Christmastime, my gf mentioned she wanted to give something special to her bf for Christmas, but wasn’t sure she could do it. I asked her if she needed my help getting it, and she said yes but was embarrassed to ask for my help.

She wanted to carve a piece off of the log her and her bf were sitting on when they first kissed and turn it into a necklace for him.

So one day while she was at work I took my tools out to the field, got to chopping, and got a sizable piece of wood off the log. I trimmed it, sanded it, bought some sealant and varnish, and got it down to a good size and shape. She was so happy when she saw it and so excited to give it to him.

We took turns applying the sealant and varnish and she did all the work to turn it into a necklace. When he got it, he was absolutely speechless. He still wears it every day and tells everyone it’s the best gift he’s ever gotten. I’m happy that I got to help out to make such a special thing happen for them. 

I hope to make many more memories like this one in our future!i’ve been seeing this guy (M22) who is in an open relationship. he’s been with his current partner for over a year. we hook up every now and then and have discussed keeping it casual and how we are both not looking for anything more than an occasional hook up with each other. 

i have been feeling frustrated lately because (despite our initial open communication about the nature of our arrangement) it feels like our dynamic hinges on his own desires/whims. 

I texted him a few days ago asking when he was free to meet up next and he left me on read with no reply. yet, last time we texted he said he wanted to hang out this next week. 

& he’ll text me out of the blue sometimes wanting to sext right away or whenever he wants to hang out. it sorta feels like i’m subject to his desires and mine are swept under the rug as the non-primary partner. 

i’ve experienced this before when dating someone with a primary partner / in an open relationship, and it led me to end things. i hate feeling like i’m an afterthought and the dynamic is uneven, if that makes sense.

**does anyone else relate to feeling frustrated when dating someone in an open relationship? **

it’s like, i know i’m not the primary partner, but i feel like i deserve open communication and respect. i don’t want to be left on read for a week wondering when i can expect to see him again, waiting for him to be horny and wanting to sext or whatever.Had a lovely weekend with my np+s.o. it was puppy dogs and ice cream the whole way through. We were celebrating the s.o.'s 30th birthday and had a complete blast.   


To top it all off, tonight I get to see my new spark. Tons of NRE, I'm on cloud 9 right now <3  


I will need to keep the NP happy by putting in more chore time around the house this week. But that's well worth it :)  


CheersIt's like marriage but in the poly sense of commitment to each other for the rest of your lives.  But without the government being involved.

Last post on this! J was emotionally abusive i see that now. Him and A broke up a month ago cuz A just couldn't stand the thought that he defended S. I didn't dump J until he put his fucking hands on me when he was drunk. While defending myself i broke his hand and spent the weekend in jail which i am fine with cuz the state i live in places a no contact order for cases like this. I am so happy to be away from him. A and I are still together and hes been helping me through a lot. A's boyfriend has also been coming with me when i go out places which i really appreciate.Hello there!  
I (28nb) think its my first time posting here, though I've been lurking for ages and always see some solid advice 😌 so i decided its my turn to ask for once! 

~~
So, a lil background: 
I have currently have two life partners, and we're doing very well. Its lovely and I feel it feels so comfy and safe, natural and effortless for once. 
However, being raised in a strictly monogamous environment, with outwardly negative views of anything remotely poly, i sometimes have a bit of cognitive dissonance. I can for the most part turn these feelings into ones of gratitude, strength and love with the help of CBT. 

I'm also an audiophile and love language so so much. 
That being said, i sometimes feel icky/shameful/guilty/idk when listening to music with very strong monogamous language(if that makes sense?) 
Has anyone else felt this? How do you get past it?Hello. I’ve been viewing different posts in this group for a while now trying to get a better understanding of this lifestyle. But I decided I should finally just make my own post seeking advice and asking to hear from anyone with similar experiences.
 
I’ve been with my fiancé for 2 and a half years. I knew later on in the relationship that he was previously in a poly relationship. It was his first one, however and before that he was strictly monogamous. Anyway, we discussed expanding our relationship early on in the relationship, but I didn’t think I would be able to handle it.

Fast forward to now and we have taken a step forward and testing out whether polyamory is something for me. I have grown as a person and have realized I have certain fantasies involving threesomes and other adult play. And with a lot of thought, I told my fiancé I needed to figure out whether or not it’s a kink or if I could really be capable of being in a polyamory or open style relationship. It’s important for me to figure out so I’m not stuck questioning myself.

My fiancé has been supportive and understands that I’m testing this and unsure. He’s already agreed that if it’s not something I can do then we will go back to monogamy without issue.

Try not to judge me too harshly here.

So here’s where I am now - I’m not interested at the moment in getting involved with another man. I’m honestly not interested in forming a relationship with one because my fiancé fulfills all my needs. I am however bi-curious and with that said my fiancé has been talking with another female. 
She knows the situation and is only open to trying this because she really likes my fiancé. She’s really into him, but wanted to get to know me and see what happens and if we could form some sort of relationship. 
She’s come over twice now and we’ve all hung out. The first time I had a very challenging time controlling my jealousy. It literally had my stomach in knots the whole time and I was incredibly uncomfortable. I was insecure as well because she’s super pretty and basically the opposite of me. (I’m a nerdy gamer girl that doesn’t care about fashion, having pretty nails, makeup, etc) but I wasn’t willing to give up just yet because I was confused and trying to figure my emotions out the whole time. I’ve talked to the other girl a little bit through messages even and we get along fine enough right now. We are both considerate of each other’s feelings and didn’t want to offend each other. We are both new to this and unsure how to really interact or what to expect. 

Second time we hung out, it was a little easier to control my jealousy though it still definitely was there. But my stomach wasn’t knotted up the entire time and I was able to talk to her more. We also engaged in bedroom activities, but it was just my fiancé going back and forth because we didn’t really know each other’s boundaries or what to. Probably TMI, my body responded eagerly towards it, but my mind did struggle a bit to control my jealousy which did affect my overall experience.

After that I couldn’t figure out how I really felt or what I wanted. My emotions have been a mess. On one hand I want to continue and keep trying, I want to see how my relationship with the other woman develops. I am struggling, but not ready to call it quits. On the other hand I hate sharing my fiancé emotionally and struggle when I see them interact without me being involved. I struggle to not become distraught or depressed when he goes to her house and leaves me alone. I get jealous of their texts and flirty behavior and most of all, I struggle with the fact that my fiancé has developed feelings for her and even misses her. How do I control these negative emotions? Is this something that just takes time to get over? I’ve tried distracting myself, but my mind always latches back onto the jealous thoughts which sometimes leaves me crying.

I question a lot of things and also get stuck on what if. What if he becomes too attached to her and becomes unwilling to go back to just being with me? What if he prefers her over me? These thoughts are like a cancer that’s keeps spreading. How can I stop thinking like this?

At what point should I be able to realize if it’s just a kink or something more? I’ve already planned on her coming over again.

Before commenting please know that the other woman does understand the risk that this could end at any point if I can’t do it. Sounds selfish, I know… which leads me to another issue. I don’t want to hurt the other girl and I don’t want to disappoint my fiancé. It’s such a conundrum.

So I’d appreciate any advice or would love to hear any personal experiences you’ve had that’s similar.


Sorry this so long.

Update:

She finally admitted she isn’t bicurious and only wanted my fiancé. She wants to be seen as an equal compared to me, but this was something I doubt I could do. There was a lot of talking and working through things as well as plenty of questions asked that I couldn’t answer for her. I was startled to discover that my fiancé has developed deeper attachments to her than he wanted to admit to me. I was hoping for more of a triangle here if a relationship was to form, but they formed serious attachments without me and I’m not sure what to do about that now. It seems perfectly clear what needs to happen because this wasn’t the original idea. My fiancé and I set rules and boundaries and this wasn’t supposed to happen, however I’m feeling turmoil over it because I don’t want him to be hurt having to cut ties with her and I don’t want her to become hurt because I do care about her feelings as well. I do plan to discuss this further with him when he wakes up.. just wanted to post an update.How did you get started? What helps to keep it all together?Hi folks! I’m meeting my long-distance partner’s boyfriend in a few weeks, and I’m really looking forward to it. We’ve been completely parallel for several months, but have a lot in common, and would like to become friends with each other. 

This is my first time having a meta, let alone meeting one, so I’m wondering if anyone has conversation suggestions to break the ice, or recommendations for topics to avoid. I usually don’t care what people think of me, but this person is important to my boyfriend, so I want to make a good impression. Would it be too much to bring some homemade cookies as a gift? To be very clear, we are both excited about meeting each other, and our shared partner is communicating well with both of us. We have not spoken directly, only through our partner. There is no drama, just your standard “meeting a new human” nerves. Thanks!This is to those who were put to an ultimatum by their mono partners to open up the relationship:

Why do you trust them to respect your boundaries now if they were so willing to force your hand to start this dynamic?

I mean this question with all the love in the world, I just so SO many posts where this dynamic is playing out, and people are doing something they're not comfortable with to try and save a relationship.. But man, poly takes a serious commitment to honesty, transparency, radical communication and boundaries. I can't imagine that someone who is willing to start the dynamic like that has the experience, maturity or self awareness to handle the hard parts of poly.

It just feels like a lot of y'all are setting yourselves up for a prolonged period of discomfort, followed by near inevitable heartbreak.

Is there anyone in here that was pushed to poly and fell love with it/had it work out with that partner?

I just want y'all to feel the love you deserve.(Female in my mid 20s here) I went on a date with a couple (also in their mid 20s) and had the best time with them. I matched with the girl on an app and had great conversations. The girl said they were looking to date a girl together and I was open to that so we decided to set up a date. I talked the guy for the first time on our date and he was really cool too. I think that was one of the best first dates I’ve been on. 


I’m pleasantly surprised I enjoyed myself with both and think I’m catching feelings for both. This is uncharted and scary territory. :(

Edit: in another reality, I could see myself dating either one on their own, but I do like them together. As maybe being in a triad.

Any advice?I feel so fulfilled at the moment. I have three very important men in my life; each holding a special place in my heart. They know of each other, but mostly just in passing. Last night my primary partner (A) out of nowhere wanted to reaffirm to me that he supports my other relationships. I thanked him, but asked what brought that up. He had just made dinner and was wondering if it was something his meta (B) would like, so that came to his mind. It made my heart full because it was so genuine. 

This morning I was having breakfast with my other partner (C). He wanted me to tell my primary good luck on a career move, because he thinks he is a good guy that I want to keep around. I was so surprised by this because this particular partner is usually very judgmental twards other men in my life.

B has always been earnestly supportive of my other relationships. 

This is the first time with this particular group of partners that I feel supported in my other relationships by each of them. It also feels good to know that they consider their metas.

Relationships aren't always easy to balance, so I appreciate the times when I get feelings like this.Hey y’all. My husband and i have reopened our relationship recently. We closed things off with new partners at the onset of c19. 

We had a really rough experience with poly previously when we originally opened up in 2019, where asymmetrical dating experiences between the two of us (me generally getting more attention with less effort) was a HUGE sticking point. it created a ton of depression in my husband, and resentment in me toward his reactions to my dating despite my efforts to attend to him and provide encouragement, try to meet needs within our relationship, etc. What made it exponentially harder was that we were long distance at the time, which compounded his loneliness and “fomo” and made it really hard for me to provide comfort and reassurance.

As we are reopening, we want to be more mindful, and have talked about involving a therapist or even a coach. We are nesting now and have just recently started engaging with dating apps. We want to know how to handle these roadblocks by getting the skills before it happens again.

I am wondering if anyone here has worked with a good coach who is helpful with these types of issues? We had a sales call with one today, but they were super aggressive trying to get us to whip out the credit card at the end and it was a major turn off.

Any recommendations for 1:1 or even group coaching for polyamorous couples would be so helpful. Thank you!! I am feeling overwhelmed with emotion bc I do not know how to handle my relatively new partner's long-distance partner coming to visit for three weeks after a year of not seeing each other and being expected not to see our hinging partner during that time. I understand that they haven't gotten to see each other in a year and that there is an expectation that they will spend every waking hour together, but given that she isn't poly-minded when I asked him to consider the possibilities of us meeting for a coffee date or something 2-3 times during her visit, she hit me with claims that I was trying to steal him away from her. yes, we live in the same city and I will be able to see him once the three weeks are over, but a part of me has never felt like our relationship was validated because his long term partner has previously said she isn't full comfy with poly lifestyle, despite her trying to be, and testing out other avenues of non-monogamy. I've made it clear that I am exclusively interested in relationships where are parties involved are poly, and KTP at that, (and I understand that not every poly person has this preference, but I reserve the right to have my own and choose my relationships based off of this criteria) and he reassures me that he thinks that is also what he wants but when it comes to putting into practice I feel like what his long term partner is comfortable with has dictated the foundation of our relationship previously, and my request was made not out of a place of anxiety but a need for validation in our relationship and that it can work out in the longterm because it is not just what he thinks he wants, but is \*seriously\* what all parties involved want and can put into practice. I guess I am just conflicted about whether or not my request would be valid if the meta was also poly, and how would other poly folks handle it if you were in her shoes as a poly individual. 

&#x200B;

conclusion: I feel like I am getting in the way of their relationship by asking for validation and I don't want to be made felt guilty for vocalizing my needs. because they have had a long term relationship, and since I simply came in the picture just this summer, only shortly before he expressed to her his interest in a poly lifestyle, and before he even told me he had a partner, is that this situation is much messier than I could handle. I asked that they figure out where they both stand before I can even consider continuing seeing our hinging partner, and if what they agree upon aligns with my relationship ideals then we can move forward, if they do not I have come to terms with stepping away from an incompatible situation instead of trying to force others to conform to my relationship ideals.I wanted to share my weekend, which was a tale of polyamory joy. There’s no really “advice needed” here, but if someone has a similar story or a question both are welcome.

This weekend I (35f) turned 35. My polycule is (names changes) my wife Isabelle (34f), my boyfriend Keith (29m), and my girlfriend Jean (28f). These folks all have and enjoy other relationships, of course, some of which have felt quite familial, but that’s not important to the story. 

A few weeks ago, when asked about my birthday hopes, I acknowledged a bit of sadness. I like large gatherings, and the restrictions in our area made that impossible. I asked to spend some time together as a polycule, and to have the plans be a surprise to me, even if they were as simple as “cake.” I’m often a bit of a caretaker, and asked to be taken care of.

Isabelle, Jean, and Keith started a secret group chat together and were hilariously conspiratorial in a way that was delightful in the weeks leading up. They all kept laughing at texts, and then explaining it was a secret and they couldn’t tell me. I felt deeply cared about in the days leading up. 

On the weekend, Jean came over on Friday and gave me a lovely book of film essays (we both love film criticism), and a collection of dice, candy, and jam that she bought during a shopping day for my birthday. We had some really tender sex, then went out for dinner and I cried about how much I like her (we went to the same place I’d taken her to her birthday a few months ago where she’d happy cried in public). 

On Saturday, Isabelle and Jean (who had slept over) worked on embroidery while I painted, and we had an afternoon of light crafting and hanging out together. Jean and I left to meet friends that evening for dinner and to catch up.

At our friend’s place we had a lovely evening of laughter and loveliness that culminated in a few hours of really great group sex. I’d told the other member of my polycule this was a possibility if everyone was in the right mood, and we’d all been tested as a caution. It felt free and I got to feel really happy in my body, reflecting that even a handful of years ago that wouldn’t have been possible.

On Sunday, the actual birthday day, Jean took me out for breakfast and antiquing while Keith cooked an elaborate dinner and Isabelle decorated the house, all in secret. 

Keith dropped food at the house, then picked me up. Jean went to help decorate and Keith took me back to his place to play some of my favourite board games, to talk together, and to enjoy fancy coffee. 

Finally, all four of us had dinner together.  Amazing food, a playlist of music I love from my wife playing, cocktails ordered from my favourite bar, my name up on the wall in giant bubble letter balloons, and people I love and care about all talking together about politics, art, and food. 

Jean got worn out first (we had a pretty big weekend) so I drove her home and she told me she loved me for the first time. It wasn’t planned, but it felt so amazing to hear.

Keith, Isabelle, and I played some more games, talked about group sex together but just didn’t quite have it in us, so we just cuddled up on the couch in a loving pile for a while with the dog. I drove Keith home (we have a date night planned for tonight) and returned home.

Isabelle and I talked until 3am, about our relationship, how much we love our lives, and how beautiful it is to have this feeling of family we have found.  She vented a little about some communication challenges she’s having with her boyfriend, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms. 

That’s it. Just thought you folks might enjoy hearing some of my joy, and a bit from our queer little family.What a week this has been; I just feel the need to share.... So, my nesting partner and I have had a very cool but slightly overwhelming week, full of firsts. Midweek, I got to introduce my boyfriend to her, and it went extremely well, and I got to just sit there over dinner and watch the two of them talk and become friends and I was basically glowing w happiness the whole meal. This weekend, my nesting partner had plans with her girlfriend to come to our place, a first, but our babysitting almost fell through, so I rearranged my plans last minute and we made it happen, AND I got to meet her girlfriend, also a first, and also super positive. THEN my own plans that I'd postponed got to happen-- my first overnight with my themfriend (is there a better term to NB partner? Please enlighten me?) which was a heady dose of NRE and a lot of deep and important sharing and conversation. Also sex, lots of sex. 

Scheduling can be so hard sometimes and there are a lot of moving parts when you're poly, but remember that the stars do align and things work out occasionally and it's beautiful when it does. *high five, world*All my life I have fallen in love with everyone and anyone I have gotten close with

I hated it... I would always be sad due to having so much love for everyone but so little back


Over time, I learned to block my feelings, to place boundaries. To add to that, I was raised in a more traditional household, and the idea of exclusivity was rooted deeply into me


Three years ago, I met my wonderful partner in crime, she is absolutely amazing, I don't think there is anyone in the world that can be more loving, sweet and adorable as her, and as a plus, she's a textbook Disney princess, she's just so lovable

She suggested the idea of open relationships, as she felt that it was the only way forward for our relationship, she is asexual closer to the repulsed side of the spectrum than the positive (but not completely sex repulsed) while I am definitely not

At first I was against the idea, because to quote my mindset "I love her, why would I want to be with anyone else?"

Then after a while, and with some pushing from her part I started trying things

I would only have FWBs, there wasn't much that happened, and I didn't build anything big, except with one friend

The only issue, is back then my mindset was still that I could only love one person, and I cared a ton about that friend, and I was terrified when she whispered under her breath "I love you" just as she hugged me before leaving to Amsterdam for a year

I loved her too then, but I didn't realize it... At that time I was locked to loving a single person, and the idea that she loved me and that I "couldn't love her back" broke me

I talked about it with my partner, but it didn't clear things in my head, it only placed them in the back, where I couldn't see it


Fast forward two years, to today


I met that friend again, we had talked and seen each other as just friends 3 or 4 times since, but today was different, we spent the entire afternoon in a park, just spending time together, talking, hugging and going into deep and meaningful conversations


As the afternoon went by I just felt more and more love for her, and I also felt more and more love for my partner... I can't explain it, but it just felt like feeling love for my friend raised the ceiling for how much I could love in general


As I'm typing this, I'm realizing that it's just a jumble of my mind pouring out here, but I'm going through a huge evolution in my perception of love


I feel like I can actually love those I love the most, that I'm not broken due to that, that I can actually love my partner while loving other people



Is this really what poly is ?

I know it's basically the gist of it, but I am a logical person, so far I only have data from myself, I need data from others, I need to know if other people have lived through the same evolution


I feel like I have just gotten so many answers to questions I didn't even think to ask



PS : I know this is a question thread, but I'm just so happy that I'm putting the Happy flair :)

Sorry not sorry mods 💜🥰Hey I just found this sub and im seeing a lot of positive and good vibes posts here so im sorry if my situation dampens the mood a bit but I need to air some things out. I’ve been with my two guys for about a year and a half now (Im gonna use fake names to respect their privacy) their names are Marco and Matt and Matt is high functioning autistic. We all started dating eachother at the same time but my two guys have known each-other as friends for a bit longer. We started out pretty good and I was happy with where I was. But for the past few months I’ve been feeling a bit of a disconnect to one of them, specifically Matt. Because he’s known Marco a bit longer than he’s known me, he tends to gravitate towards Marco a bit more which didn’t bother me at first but lately it’s been getting really bothersome, I’ve tried to talking to them about it and they both acknowledge the issue and matt always apologizes and feels bad about it, but then it keeps happening. Instances where I feel shafted or pushed aside for Marco or how he seems more excited and eager to spend time with and talk to Marco 1-on 1 than he is with me, or how his first instinct is to talk to Marco about serious and emotional stuff and not me, or making jokes around our friends like  “he’d be single if he had to break up with Marco”. I know it’s not malicious as he loves showering me with words of support and praise when I talk to him about other stuff but I feel his actions are speaking louder than his words at this point, I’m aware that communication isn’t his strong point but I’m lost as to what to do, I don’t want to keep bringing it up because I want them to be happy but I’m feeling left out and neglected in terms of attention by him and I get irrational thoughts that maybe they’re better off without me. I’m stumped as what to do now….I am not polyamorous, I was just pondering polyamorous relationships and kind of wondered what happens when you break up. Is it more like a slow distancing or does it follow a more traditional break-up route? 

Disclaimer: I hope I am not offending anyone. This is just genuine curiosity. 

Hope everyone is doing well!I think two pieces of info are important before giving advice. I think people should try to ask if its not clear:

* The age of the OP
* If the OP is describing an online relationship only (never have and probably never will meet)

Advice for a 15 year old in am online relationship is different than advice for a 35 year old in 7 year old relationship with shared kids and a mortgage. That seems to be overlooked sometimes.What is different about the two labels? Are they same thing with a little technicality thrown in?

For example, I'm pansexual but someone else may identify as omnisexual which is pretty much the same thing (attraction to all genders) but it has a different definition.My nesting partner is in the restaurant business and very social. She often goes to bars after work to meet friends. She often goes to friends places after the bars, and I will get a text late at night letting me know she’s not coming home. 

I have no problem with her spending time with friends, and no problem with her drinking and not coming home, as long as I get a message, so that I don’t wake up in the morning panicking, calling her to see if she’s ok, and her not answering because she’s sleeping. She often didn’t text before, but now does. 

Tonight I picked her up from work, and right before getting home she asked to get dropped off at a local bar to meet a friend/coworker to talk about work. No problem. Right before she got out of the car, I semi jokingly asked if she was coming home later. She paused, then said probably not, and that a recent new partner MAY be coming by and she MAY stay with him. 

I have no problem with her going out, having fun, meeting up with a new partner and staying at their place. What I don’t like is how I had to ask for more info to be told this. 

I drove home, was a bit flustered, drove back to the bar, pulled her outside for a second and told her just that. She can do whatever she wants, just be honest. She responded with that she wasn’t sure that her new partner would even show up or that she’s stay with him at all. I felt like it was just unneeded sneakiness. She responded in just the right way to have just enough plausible deniability to try and diffuse my feelings

Am I being too uptight and paranoid about this? Or should I let this go?My wife is good friends with my girlfriend (new relationship - my first poly experience). My wife and a couple who are also friends with my girlfriend were at our house trying on some clothes we are clearing out from our wardrobes. My girlfriend started with some sexy texts which I selfishly responded, which resulted in a goofy smile and blushing. My friends laughed but were hiding their annoyance. And I found my wife crying later because I was so happy to hear from my girlfriend.

I need to do better. Someone tell me how to do this better, please. Obviously responding to my gf was a bad choice. What do you all do to keep your relationships more frictionless?Edit: Guys, I’m a gift giver that’s all, point taken that it’s not really the right time thanks for pointing that out. Of course I don’t see this as some weird transaction, I just wanted to make a  gesture .
I’ve been poly for years & I’m no bunny boiler.. (jeeezus if chocolates imply that) we consider we have a love blossoming here so it’s time to meet the meta.

Of course he is his own man (good point) I appreciate the thoughts xxUPDATE: As of 2/5/22 I have officially moved out and cut ties with my former polycule. Thank you for all of your advice and perspective.... seriously. I thought I was going mad. 

Turns out it was a cult the whole time.

I am safe, free and processing. Still feeling a lot of guilt for "betraying" them and up and leaving without any word but... I have therapy tomorrow, so I'll work that out there. Thank you all again.

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/skmkoh/trouble_in_poly_paradise/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)Please, *please* break up your walls of text into paragraphs. It is (generally) not hard to do, and doing so means getting more replies because people can actually *read it*. 

I see so many posts on here that I would *like* to respond to, but I can't, because I can't f@cking read any of it. I know this may not seem important to other people (especially the people doing it), but this is an actual accessibility issue. If you don't do this, yes, you'll still get some replies. But you'll get a lot more if you do this one thing to make it accessible to people who can't read walls of text like that. 

I know I'm screaming into the void right now, I just hope that if I post this, maybe some posters will actually take the advice on board, especially with how many posts I've seen like this lately. Also, I hope this post is okay because it's not directly about polyamory itself (though it is about people posting about polyamory). If this post isn't okay, mods are free to delete of course.Hey, I'm looking for some kind words and good advice. I'm kinda young and figuring things out and I am feeling really poly. I have always struggled to differentiate between platonic and romantic feelings and never understood why I can't love multiple people. I brought this up to my long-term boyfriend and asked to try something out. He said yes but a few days later broke down crying in my arms because he felt our relationship wasn't special anymore. This hurt me so much and I didn't understand but tried my best. He wants what's best for me but told me that we should go back to strictly mono. I love him but this confuses me and has been hurting me. I feel confined and misunderstood and need help. I have had him read mono/poly articles off websites and tried to explain how I feel. At the same time, I can't be the reason for his sadness and would rather stay with him and be mono (the thought of that makes me cry though). I don't know if I should suck it up and just be "normal" though. Thanks.Hi all- 
I've seen lots of posts, resources, books, blogs, podcasts about entering polyamory, but they're generally aimed at couples deciding to open up. 
I was single when I decided to explore polyamory, and it's been a really comfortable, secure experience for me so far. I've never been able to be as successful in a relationship as I have now, and I appreciate the level of open honest communication that poly needs to work. 

But I've found myself dealing with some insecurities/confusion/negative feelings with my new-ish partner who has another partner. My metamour also has another partner that they nest with. We're all approaching this as non-hierarchical as possible and KTP, but I know that lack of prescriptive hierarchy doesn't mean a lack of a prescriptive one and that valuing your relationship of over a year vs your new one is reasonable. But sometimes I'm left feeling lonely or on the outside of the polycule looking in and I'd just like some perspective.

I've read alot of stuff. I've listened to alot of stuff. But I can't find anything targeted for being new to poly, single before a new relationship and dealing with the insecurities and questions that come with fitting your relationship with your partner into a life with their metamour that already exists. 

If anyone has suggestions for resources, I would really appreciate it.So my husband had his partner over today which was fine. She’s sweet, fun to hang out with, a friend And he asked me previously if it was alright ( I get anti people often And like my personal space). I said yeah totally and asked if they could maybe just hang out until 4:30 (about 5 hrs) cause I had wanted to play video games and wind down with him for the night. I also know that they lose track of time so I was expecting it to actually be 5/5:30ish. Well 5:30 rolls around And they want to go shopping And I really don’t mind, so I say np. She needs to go home and make dinner for her primary so they were going to hang out there for a bit. Then it hits 7:30 and she sends me a message asking if they can hang until 9. I go to bed at like 10/11. 

So a few things. 1) I like things to be arranged ahead of time so I know what to expect And am not thrown off. 2) I’m recovering from the anniversary of my best friend’s death (my lovable dog), a really sad breakup (someone who helped me get through my puppy’s passing), my grandfather passing on Christmas (who reminds me of the person I broke up with), And historically February is the worst month for me every year. 3) I hate being the bad guy And I feel like i have to turn this person down now instead of my husband. 

AItA? Should i be the one to answer them instead of my husband asking me then him answering them?

(Sorry if the switching pronouns got confusing. They told me today they might be gender fluid but don’t want to change their pronouns yet so I’m practicing using neutral and feminine)


*Edit!!!: turns out my husband had no clue and his other partner just didn’t want to interrupt his conversation to ask. It’s a behavior he’s done in the past so I incorrectly jumped to conclusions but he’s grown so much since he’s least done it. Everything is cleared up. No one’s feelings are hurt and more communication all around.Please join us for our next weekly session of PolyTalk Wednesdays on Zoom on 2/9 at 6 pm PST/9 pm EST led by [Lillian Bouncy Gold](https://www.facebook.com/bouncybouncyweee), [Uru Majik](https://www.facebook.com/wielderofsoundurumajik) and [Devin Koppel](https://www.facebook.com/DevinMarieK).

In the same way that I don't want anyone to rely solely on me for their sexual desires or emotional support.

I want to have this conversation with my current partner. We are monogamous right now, but he's told me that he is open to other forms of relationships. 
Before we talk, I'd love to hear why other people choose this way of life and love!TLDR: My FWB for 8 months told me he loved me. He's unaware that my husband and I agreed that I can be poly. I'm not sure how to tell him it's ok and that I'm polyam given that this was an ENM/FWB agreement originally. 


Really it's long, don't read unless you want to lol 


For a bit of background, over two years ago I told my hubby that I'm not happy with our sex life but everything else is amazing.  Together we tried couples therapy, sex therapy, and swinging. At a certain point I realized that I was pressuring him to do things he wasn't 100% into sexually and I felt awful.  In order to take that pressure off of him, we both began to consider polyam/ENM.

Our emotional "toolbox" wasn't ready for polyam so I decided to go with ENM. I didn't jump into a ENM right away, it just happened when I finally talked to a coworker in my same unit. We hit it off, became friends, and had a shared interest in reddit porn which originally started as a joke.  A couple of videos, naughty pics and sexy chats later, I opened up on how we can be FWB. It was a first for him but he agreed to STD test, use protection and "not have feelings" (his boundary). 

The next few months, my relationship with my husband and my mental health vastly improved. We were both pretty happy with the ENM arrangement but we still made an effort to learn about polyam.  We took away some great relationship advice and practiced it daily which indirectly stocked our "toolbox". 

During this same time, my FWB and I were having a great time just having sex and not being emotionally too invested. That was until we got placed on a military mission together. It was a harsh/stressful environment but it made us extremely close. Since that mission, we had more intimate conversations, more intimate sex and overall a more caring relationship. I could sense he was having changed feelings, or at least more towards me. However since he set a boundary initially, I didn't investigate. 

Fast forward, my hubby and I had our biweekly checkin. With new skills and a better understanding,  my hubby wants to be mono and supports me being polyam. This was decided a bit before my FWB said I love you.  

Once my FWB said I love you,  I said it back but i had to immediately leave after to catch my flight. I think after I left he started to freak out because he thought he disrespected my marriage/our arrangement so he shut down with me.

 I don't know how to present being polyam given that I am unsure what the FWB is seeking and to not come off as forcing the lifestyle.I am part of a trisomething. They were a thing before me and in general I have some insecurities because I do feel like the less important bit although they assure me is not the case... They know I have problems talking and communicating, I'm working on it. But... 

For sometime it's been they do their thing without me, be it videogames or TV shows or whatever, this time however I got bored and left the room to do something else. They had an argument over why I wasn't feeling ok, then one asked me, I said I was just bored and I was sorry. I was down the rest of the weekend which essentially continued the same. Today I asked one of them if I could cuddle cause it's been some time, he said sure but made explicitly clear he had other things to do as well so we couldn't cuddle all afternoon. Sure, fair.

He arrives and the other partner is playing a videogame that she's been playing all day and he starts watching. And giving advice and stuff. I try to cuddle to which he is half texting half watching and commenting on the videogame. I fall asleepnand when I wake up it is still the same so I just decide to work on my computer. They asked if I was okay I said yeah just bored and wanted to cuddle. And then we had food... And now we are getting ready to go to sleep cause work. I'm sad and just feeling a bit confused. I did my best I said I was bored, I said I needed some cuddles, I said I was bored again. I may have ommited that this made me sad but still.

So. I know I'm guilty of not communicating well, but shouldn't like partners couples people that love you and know that catch some of the obvious signs of this person is bored or sad? I just need an outsider's opinion. 

Tldr. The fact that one part doesn't comunicate is equal to the other parts to have a blind eye to whatever is happening?TL;DR at the end

PSA: This is my first post here, plus I'm not clued up on all the slang just yet, please bear with me.  


Quick background: Me (32M) and my boyfriend (35M, let's call him "K") have been together for about 3 years and a few months. Insanely happy, no major issues. We've kinda always been "open", meaning we have fooled around with good friends in the past. And polyamory has always been on the table, since quite early on in our relationship.  


In enters "S" (27M) who I've known as a friend (we fooled around once back in the day) since before "K" and I started dating. Beginning of the year we all three finally met up and totally hit it off.

&#x200B;

My issue: I don't think it's a jealousy thing. Meaning I have no qualms about the two of them doing anything sexual. If anything, it's a case of FOMO. Lol. It's the fact that "K" suddenly turns into a sexual beast when "S" is here. (I have no idea how explicit I'm allowed to be, lol, but yeah...)

It's not like myself and "K"'s sex life is lacking. It's the things he suddenly does with "S" now that get to me... (Again, not sure how explicit I can be.)

&#x200B;

I am planning on talking to "K" about all this. As soon as life permits...  


Am I being silly? Also, if I left anything out, feel free to ask.  


TL;DR: The sexual things my bf is willing to do with our possible triad partner(?)  (I'm new to this, not up to scratch with all the slang, apologies), but not me, is getting to me.Y’all this is legitimately the dopest idea I have ever followed through on. I’ve never felt more supported by two people in my whole god damn life. And the petamours are definitely a bonus. 

As a mono person, I thought this would be waaaaaaaaaaay harder than it is. However, watching the way we all coexist so well together has made this stupid easy. 

I’m just super happy. I needed to share with folks.In a previous post I mentioned my partner asking me to "prep" for their fwb coming over. I originally meant something different, but happily, a lot of the responses took it to mean Emotional Preparation.

So now I'm super curious lol. 

How do you all emotionally prepare for when your partner (in this case a NP) has a date with someone and you are alone?Edit: sorry for the confusion. I’m not asking about mono/poly specifically, though I see how my post makes it seem that way. I just feel like I’ve seen a lot of posts where someone is asking for advice about a situation that happened and it feels like there’s a knee jerk reaction of “break up”. But maybe I’ve been reading too many mono poly relationship questions. 

Hey y’all! Hope you beautiful people are having a ticking time! 

I wanted to vent some feelings about this sub/subculture. I kinda feel like a lot of the advice is “break up with them”, and I don’t feel like I hear any suggestions for compromise. Is it really that drastic that if someone wants to be poly and the other doesn’t, that you should break up? Surely there are steps in between before the break up conclusion. 

If you’re in a mono relationship and someone wants a dog, but the other doesn’t, they don’t break up. But maybe the point is, you can either have a dog or not have a dog, there’s no in between. And I also realize having additional partners isn’t the same as having pets. But the reaction is just so extreme in my opinion.

Honestly I want some advice about my own situation, but I’m afraid everyone is going to be like “break up”. 

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. Hope you have a good day!It’s been a few months. I want to do poly I think it’s nice. But I can’t help but miss our mono relationship sometimes. I still get weird feelings even tho I do want to try and continue. But idk my gf just informed me that they have recently started saying I love you to each other. It’s been hard to keep eye contact with her since. And I’m unsure why. I’d like to fix that but I’m unsure the problem. I’m happy she has someone but a part of me also wished we were back to normal mono. Very mixed feelings. She also want high commitment poly and I don’t want that high. We’ve agreed to keep a hierarchy. I know I want my gf but idk if I want to end my life like this. Still unsure still super open for things just idk. I have mixed emotions. When Will they go away so I can be normal lol😂 I’m still happy I just feel like something is missing unfortunately. I’ve also noticed my sex drive has decreased a lot. Very strangeI've been in the poly community for a few years now but it took awhile for me to find someone I really liked and get someone off the ground, so I'm in my first poly relationship. He's been absolutely amazing and so is his other partner, a casual friend of mine that he met around the same time as he met me. For the record, she's a doll. The problem is me. I don't even want to say it's jealousy because I feel like jealousy has an angry aspect to it. It's just anxiety. How do I deal with all this anxiety? What have you done that helped with those types of feelings? I've dated before but this is the first time I've had actual feelings for someone and I'm not sure how to process it all lolFirst post on here.

My partner is poly, I'm not. And I want her to be completely happy. But as a guy that's been cheated on in every past relationship, never feeling good enough ect. How do I get over or cope with jealousy/not feeling like I'm good enough? 

Our communication is great...but I always get the sense of "it's because I'm not good enough" or "they are better"

Another thing is I don't like the idea of her being intimate with someone else because I hold that close to my heart...I'm just looking for advice to ease my mind that makes me think all these intrusive thoughts.Almost a year ago my wife approached me about being poly. We’ve been open sexually for our entire relationship but haven’t dated other people. My wife is bisexual but didn’t come out to her family until after we were married so she never really got the chance to date women. I agreed to her being able have romantic relationships with other women because I wanted her to have that chance. 

I very clearly stated that my boundary was no romantic relationships with other men. My wife agreed to the one boundary I had. 

Flash forward to now and my wife has a GF and a BF (throuple) and has clearly stated that the only chance of survival our marriage has is for me to be ok with her being in love with both of them. 

Is this something I can learn or is my marriage doomed?Hi everyone. 
Story time:

My current partner and I started our relationship mono a couple of years ago.
We had a threesome once, but that was more of a one night stand thing we both enjoyed. 
However it did made us realise that we wanted more, and eventually came to the conclusion that poly is a thing that actually exists. 
Unfortunately we both never knew about this, as society is not really accepting this. We don't care about that really, but it could've made things easier in the past.

Now, we are happy together and we would like ideally a throuple... triad... all these terms.
A triangle shaped relationship, 3 equals.
Not 2+1 but really 1+1+1

But, I read a lot of negative things about unicorn hunters and unrealistic expectations and so, almost hostile sometimes. 

We would just like to expand our love, our hearts are big enough for multiple people. And as we're happy together we'd love to "share" it rather than a V shaped relationship. 

Of course, a lot of things depend on the 3rd party as well. We've talked about possible cases and what we would do with them. 
(E.g. feelings are feelings. If it so happens than it will end up as a V relationship, but we just prefer the triangle)

Question is: any advise for us?I've been interested in polyamory for a few years now, but have never taken any real steps towards the lifestyle. I've been married for about 10 years and the biggest barrier for me so far is starting the conversation with my wife. 

I have done a lot of reading to try to understand my own needs and we have a very solid relationship that we are constantly working together to improve, but I can't get past some of my own deeply engrained (monogamous) expectations about relationships. 

When I imagine a conversation with my wife, I can't come up with good answers for the following questions that I expect my wife to have:

1. Am I not good enough for you?
2. Why do you need more romantic/sexual partners? You have a lot of close friends, isn't that enough? 
3. Do you just want more sex? (She has a waaay lower sex drive than me)
4. Love is infinite, but time is not. How will you find time for more relationships?
5. What if someone else finds out? (We live in a smallish town)

The first 3 questions are my biggest concern. They're the most specific to our relationship and I haven't found much helpful information in my reading or podcasts. 

Anyone have any tips on how to handle this conversation?Good morning everyone, 

I’ve made a few posts in this sub so I won’t describe my whole entire situation again, but basically my NP is a hinge between me and my best friend.

Recently I’ve noticed that I have an automatic sad reaction when my NP tells me that she is going to go spend the night with her bf. It doesn’t really feel like I’m being jealous of him or angry at her, and I’m trying not to be possessive, but I just get kind of sad when I realize I’m going to be sleeping alone. 

I suggested to her that we start to regularly spend time sleeping apart (one of us in the guest bedroom) on some nights so that I can get used to it and not have this negative reaction every time. She seemed open to it but also hesitant because after she’s spent a few nights with him she starts to miss me and wants to be in bed with me; after she’s been gone a few days and finally comes home I want to be in bed with her too.

Does anyone have experience with this or advice? I want to explore and resolve my feelings while being as fair as possible to everyone involved.I’ve been thinking about trying a poly relationship but I’m not really sure how to go about it.What is everyone doing for valentines? My gf is planning on taking me out to a fancy (and expensive o.o) steakhouse for a nice dinner, and probably some nasty sex afterwards LMAO. Then she’s going to visit her partner a couple hours away on Wednesday and I get the bed and cats to myself 😎 

I’m just glad we get to spend valentines together in person. My gf and I are long distance but have been practically living together for nearly a year, and she went back home to see family for a while. We made the impulse decision that I’d go down this weekend to visit, since we miss each other so much. Super excited and happy.There has been several wake up calls recently in my relationship with my partner and right now I don’t know where to go to for advice apart from here.

A few weeks ago my meta unknowingly brought up the fact that our shared partner didn’t want kids. It was all news to me at that point, my partner had told me he wanted to have kids with me, and it seemed like that was what was going to be the plan.

Then I found out that prior to our relationship, when my partner and meta started dating, they got the news that meta would have a really big problem having kids, and they had both agreed to not have children. 

I feel like my decisions have been made for me and I feel extremely trapped and unhappy. Yes I know that I can have kids with someone else but I do want to have them with him, maybe that’s me being selfish but there has been a lot of things on my end where I have been sacrificing the things that I would like for the comfort of them. Maybe I’m wrong in the situation. 

I just need some perspective from others.So for the last 8 months I've been part of a vee relationship all began with the idea of just sleeping with the guys gf. Quickly we became close and feel in love. She decided for the mean time she couldn't tell him whilst he caught upto where we was and than we could move forwards. He was coming round to the idea I stayed over at there's we took turns to have the bed for the night very mutual.but he found out she loved me and felt betrayed and hurt even after so much conversation about how it wasn't about losing her be couldn't handle. But still enjoyed the sexual kinda sub cuckhold angle. in the end she's decided to end our realtionship due to not wanting to hurt me and not being able to give me what I need. I just can't accept this I had planned to move jobs move to a closer location we had discussed so much of a future that I'm stuck right there. I just like some advice from people more experienced.My wife and I tried hotwifing last month, after planning it for almost a year, and have had an amazing sexual journey. We also had great communication all along, clear boundaries and we're best friends. We were in a very happy marriage. 

After seeing her bull weekly over the last month, I noticed she had started to pay less attention to me. I told her I'm okay to continue, but only if she can redirect some attention (sexually) to me. I thought she was just caught up in the excitement. 

She then started to ask me if I was interested in being poly with him, which scared me as or agreement was for hotwifing to remain only as casual sex. I told her I'm not ready for more right now, but would be willing to discuss further. 

She continued to want to see him sexually and didn't make any improvements to her connection with me. For an unrelated reason, he ended things with her, and she afterward told me she had developed feelings for him.
 
She has not seen him again but they still communicate from time to time, and I can tell she still has feelings for him. I even discovered that some of their recent texts have been flirty. 

I consider this to be emotional cheating - am I justified?

P.S. Our hotwifing boundary was 'no penetration' (i.e. no PIV). 
I found out she had let him rub his cock on the outside of her pussy and then made her come by slapping his cock against her clit. She says she didn't think this counted as a violation of the 'no penetration' rule. She apologised and said it would not happen again. 
Am I crazy for thinking this was not okay?Before I start I want to say, sorry for my english in this text. It's my second language and I feel too hurt to go through this text properly. 

I need some insight if anyone has experienced the same situation. So my boyfriend and I had a fight yesterday because I wasnt showing enough enthusiasm about having sex in the car. I was not in the mood and super tired. So he told me in a very spiteful way that his other sexpartner does stuff that I don't do (We are in an open relationship). During the discussion he told me that he thinks we have "vanilla sex" and our that our sex is short. That he has better sex with his other sexpartners. Mind you that we have short sex because he cant last that long and we cant have spicey sex because he still lives with his parents. He doesn't take initiative to have crazy sex either. I told him that it's not my fault that he can't communicate his feelings. I think it's unreasonable of him to think that I'm supposed to know what's going on in his brain. I told him that I wanna break up with him because I don't wanna be with someone who can say hurtful stuff like this to their partners. He is trying to make me stay and work things through. He thinks that its not completely messed up of him to say to his partner that he has better sex with other girls. He thinks by him saying these things, we can work and improve our sexlife. I feel like there are so many other ways to communicate that he wants to improve our sexlife, he just chose the most hurtful way to do it. I told him that I feel immense resentment towards him. I don't even wanna look at his face right now. I feel extremely hurt and I don't know what to do. We have been together for 5 years and I think we have a good thing going on but I feel like I'm having difficulties forgiving him for saying that stuff. He is an amazing bf and would never disrespect me.  He is trying everything to fix this and I'm truly trying to forgive him but it feels impossible. Everytime I look at him, I get reminded of the things he said and see him fucking his other girls and enjoying it so much. I feel like when he said those things it broke our special bond that we had. I don't value it as much anymore. I don't see him in the same light anymore. He is crying 24/7 and is so afraid of losing me but everytime i look into his face I just want to be spiteful and say mean things to him. I wanna make him feel as inadequate as he made me feel in that heated argument. I just don't know how to forgive him. 

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? Has anyone here been told by their partners in an open relationship that they are having better sex with other people? How did you process it? Were you able to forgive your partner?I met this woman who is amazing a few years ago. She's practically a copy of my wife in every way, but she was stuck in a miserable 10 year lesbian marriage (divorce went through a few months back) and we used to have these long talks about how amazing it is that the three of us have everything in common. How meeting me makes her very open about being bi, about how it sucks when you meet your "soulmate" at the wrong time.

We've been on camping trips, the three of us, gone to movies, dinners, just hanging out at ours. 

Since she's been single she's had two terrible dating experiences lasting about a month each, and each time we've both been there for her, crashes on our couch watching movies together, and up until now it's been mostly non-physical.

Fast forward to today. We have plans for tonight, like deep plans. Over the weekend I asked her how she felt about my wife confessing to "like liking her, as more than a friend" and she said she was very open to it. She asked questions about what their first kiss might be like, etc.

Then she turns to me and asks me what ours was going to be like. Up until now, yes I've had feelings about her, comes and goes, but right then I admitted them to her, huge crush, kinda came crashing out. She's confident, don't worry, we're not her first couple, haha.

Made plans right then for tonight to be "a bit more" and when I relayed all this to the wife she got very excited, like very.

This morning though, I called her to see how she was doing, if we're still on, and she says of course, but to reiterate she'd like everything to go smoothly, organically, and if I was uncomfortable with it to let her know. At this point I asked about all the flirting in the last few days, texts, calls, between all three of us, which were very leading, and she interrupts laughing saying she hopes I was aware that she was just playing around.

Asked if she meant what she said about our mutual attraction. Nope it was just a joke. She admits I'm hot, but she's still "completely put off by men just trying to get in her pants." At no point was that even mentioned, or planned by me. I thought it would be just calm, organic, if it happens, but she's already said she hopes it does, which apparently was a joke. She thinks of me as more of a puppy. 

Honestly I just feel stupid at this point, but she's still planning on coming over, still planning on hanging out all night, and still planning on her and the wife doing things together, the only part that's changed is I'm no longer invited.

Talked to the wife about it and she doesn't know what to do either. Before we were more worried about taking care of this person, making sure she's comfortable, but now wife wants nothing to do with her, to call it off immediately.

What do I do here? Does anyone have experience with someone like this? How do I tell "technically my bff/soulmate" that her joking was too painful and we don't really know how to process it?I see it in this sub regularly, someone laments about having caught feels for someone just exploring poly who dumped them to be monogamous with someone else.

And usually I offer my personal strategy to avoid this. Start by only going out with people who personally identify as ENM. Early on in dating, ask the person if they could ever see themselves being monogamous for anyone. If they’re partnered, ask if they would ever close their existing relationship if there was trouble. Ask if polyamory is part of their identity. And if they answer in any way that suggests they would consider monogamy, then do not get emotionally attached to this person. 

This has worked really well for me. Until today. 

Turns out people lie. Either to your face about being committed to ENM, or to themselves about something so fundamental about their own identity. They let you believe it’s ok to let your guard down and begin growing feelings. Only to turn around and give you the boot to be monogamous. 

I’m trying to look on the bright side. They at least let me know they don’t have their shit together before anything got serious and I took a bullet instead of a grenade. 

But man does this suck. I can feel my trust in people crumbling. Which is a shame. “Jaded” is not a good look for me.How important is it to you to see polyamory in the media? Do you find yourself looking for poly relationships in books, movies, tv shows, etc? 

I'm asking from a somewhat personal place of curiosity. I'm still working through my own hesitations on being public about my relationship status. I'm curious how important you think representation and visibility is for polyamory, and why?My partner and I have recently opened up into being fully open and poly, and I've progressed from not wanting to know anything about her other relationships outside of the basics to being open about anything that isn't sexual. She is working a long shift at work tomorrow and asked me to watch her dog so she can stay over at her other partne's house. Is it wrong for this to make me uncomfortable? For clarification, we used to live together, and got the dog together, but she took the dog when she moved.


EDIT: I ended up watching the dog. I guess I should provide some amplifying info. It doesn't feel like she has the best handle on her NRE, because she has severely limited the time she spends with me and her friends. I guess that didn't really help the feelings I'm the situation. She asked me to watch the dog bc she didn't want to leave him alone to sleep over closer to work, which is 5 minutes away from my house and something like 30 from his. I haven't really seen her for more than like 5 minutes since they started dating so it's hard not to feel used in this situation. Thank those of y'all that gave advice without the shaming. I really appreciate itMy (45M) girlfriend has recently met a guy she likes. They had a nice first date and have plans in a few days. While I am happy for her and want her to have a fulfilling and happy dating life, I am feeling jealousy.

I’m journaling my feelings and working through them. But I don’t know if I should communicate my jealousy, even in a healthy and loving way, to her while I’m going through it or strive to present only the affirming feelings until I’ve dealt with it. And I would appreciate any advice from others who have gone through it.I've been actively poly for about 3.5 years now and have tried lots of different ways of meeting people including all of the major apps. I know that Tinder is super duper hit or miss for most ENM folx, but I recently discovered that the "explore" tab at the bottom of the app (second item from the left) is surprisingly helpful. 

 I live in a mid-sized city in the US (~1M people in the metro area). Normally, less than 1% of the Tinder profiles I see make some mention of nonmonogamy- ENM, open relationships, or poly. But by filtering for people who have marked one or more of their Passions as a social causes (LGBTQ+, Black Lives Matter, Mental Health Awareness, etc) the fraction of people who have explicitly listed themselves as being nonmonogamous is up to more like 5% of profiles. This is very helpful for me because I find alignment on social justice issues to be a good initial prerequisite for relationships.

I am curious if the same trend is true in other parts of the world!Hi!
First-time poster here.
I've been in an open relationship with my partner for almost 3 years now. Im the one who suggested it at the beginning, letting him know thats who i was, and he accepted it with enthusiasm.
Of course, in the beginning, it was hard, and I let him roam freely, getting used to it, without me doing anything, making sure that each time he would go on a date, i would ask him if he was still in love with me, and that when i would then in the future start seeing other people, he would know that the same way he still loved me, i would to.
Our rules are rather simple: He's my main partner, and everyone else comes second, it works for us. We tell each other everything and always make sure the other one is comfortable with whoever we are seeing.
In the three years we've dated, his depression, which i was aware of, worsened, and I found myself living with a partner who didn't care whether i was in the room or not, that didnt want to spend time with me, that would rather have his headphones on all day instead of speaking just a couple of words with me, in some instances, he would propose that i go out with whoever i was dating at the time, instead of staying home with him, since he rather see movies on his own.
I wasn't resentful, but it hurt me a lot, Depression is terrible, and i loved him through it all.
I started seeing another person, by doing the bare minimum, he was already doing way more than my current partner was. I developed feeling for this person, and although i feel that in the beginning, i was sincere with my partner, telling him i had feelings for him, i guess i wasn't as honest as I told myself.
This confession of mine changed my partner's behavior towards me completely, he suddendly realized how much he loved me, how he treated for almost 1 years and that he wasn’t depressed anymore. 
I didn’t believe him at first, and I kept focusing on the other person as my first point of happiness. 
I had a trip booked with him to meet up in Paris, my partner logged into my computer as I was sleeping and read all the conversations I had with him, and with my friends, and family. Complaining about one, and complimenting how the other made me feel. 
When he confronted me about it my whole world shattered, I’m not trying to play the victim here; but the thought of losing my main partner was unbearable. 
I still went to Paris, he wanted me to make my own decisions; and not to be forced into not going because of him, and that when I would come back, we would both sit down and talk about what we wanted in the relationship. 
So I did, I closed everything with the other guy, apologizing, and being as open as possible. 
And once I was back, me and my partner spoke about how we were both feeling and decided to continue the relationship with each other, only, monogamous this time. 
It felt so unnatural, but I was willing to give it all I could to make it work. 
We then went to a party and we both kissed another couple, after that he told me he didn’t want a monogamous relationship and was ready to start being open again. 
And I met someone shortly after.

Now my partner is telling me he doesn’t feel safe in the relationship, that I’m not giving him what he needs, and that he feels like he doesn’t deserve to live, and that he is hurting that he will never be enough for me. 
We agreed for me to take a couple of weeks break from this other guy, but I’m unsure whether he will be ever really ready to be as open as he claims to be. 

What should I do? I don’t want him to hurt.
I’m sorry for the long post, I started writing and then I couldn’t stop. 
Also, apologize for the bad grammar or poor syntax. English isn’t my first language.My partner bretrayed my trust and discarded me. My meta was manipulative and only self-interested. I lived in hell for 6 months, being an echoist and aiding in my own pain. (You can [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/rh268k/partner_majorly_cheated_with_a_stranger_now_meta/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) at my past [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/p9qdls/have_you_ever_had_a_meta_that_wanted_to_move/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for how it all started.) I attempted to end my relationship with my partner multiple times, and he's convinced me to stay. He is actively better, and he knows that I can never be put through anything like this again, which is honestly a promise and threat. This experience has completely demolished me, and I will not relive it.

During their relationship, I developed a trauma response to people who look like my meta, to various insecurities, and I suppose to intimacy itself. I've accumulated so much anxiety and anger that it's affecting my ability to function and do my work. 

Luckily, meta and my "friend" who decided to date them are both out of my life forever. The only contact we have is through the grapevine, which is more than enough. And I hope I can start healing from this truamatic experience, building back confidence, selfcare, and trust in those around me. 

There is another issue. I can not seem to be intimate with my partner without crying. I can be in a good mood and happy to be close together, and then it'll strike. Sometimes it's the feeling of closeness and comfort and trust, that brings me to tears and sadness because I've felt so alone. Sometimes it's an intrusive thought about my partner being with my ex-meta and how I couldn't live up to whatever meta was giving. Sometimes its a mood drop after sex, comparable to depictions of "subdrop" but that's never been something that happened for me. 

I suppose I can research healing from trauma or how to cope with sadness during sex or how to move on from spousal bretrayal or all of the above. But I want to hear from the community. Any understand what I'm going through? How did you move forward?

Tldr: Intimacy triggers sadness after being cheated on. Anyone relate?This girl was my first ever contact into polyamory. I was experimenting with the thought for the first time in my life and I got warm with it, I had traces of it in escape fantasies of mine. The first time she talked about it, I felt uncomfortable, however, a lot actually. I was raised with monogamous ideals and I couldn't even believe that a single person was expressing these feelings for me. I couldn't grasp the idea of multiple emotionally stabilising people with dynamics incategoriseable between “friendship“ and “relationship“, but all love. The point is, I had to develop.
But she did not give me any time. It all happened across a month. We had our first gay moment the second time we saw one another. We both understood how fast that was. But we both just found something with one another. I would see her three times that week and then leave for Christmas, for home. The first time she told me her boundaries were much farther away than what we did. Then that she wants me as more in her life... that she wants to see where things can go but that she wants things to go right. Leaving for Christmas was torture. It was hell as every Christmas but not having her by my side, feeling all this pain of past memories, loves breaking across Christmas... and then the pain of having to sort my emotions, she had one of her two LDR gfs over and I was so much in confusion about it, it was all so new to me! I felt fear but I also felt a lot of warm feelings...
Another girl I was interested in... took my love with her lips while I was away for Christmas. My love told me when I returned. My fears... of being excluded skyrocketed. My fear of being replaced. My fear that the other girl will be better than me... Because that other was gorgeous, more complete than me. I got scared. I didn't understand anymore why I was not having such a thing with her yet, why I was being overtaken! She said that's just how it goes sometimes in poly relationships... She tried to comfort me but we were dancing in circles, I felt terrible for having these feelings but she just told me that I had to work on them alone, that I need maybe a therapist, that jealousy is a false emotion... I felt more and more like a monster. She was constantly telling me I wasn't but at the same time confirming that I have the problematic feelings while denying that as well! She called romanticism off that night, she promised me she would stay to me like a sister, but I told her as well that that should not mean that we hinder our emotions from developing. Just not the big love as a goal. To detach immediately from a person that gave me so so much... she was being taken away from me... I was selected out. All I wanted was a beautiful triangle, I loved to hug both of them, we had a moment before the chaos we had a short cuddle as three and it was beautiful!!
But me and my love were both relationship nihilists anyway, we both believed that the FORMAL idea of a “relationship“ can be toxic and that we both want the consensus of our affections to be defining for us.
I talked to the other girl then. I got the feeling she wanted to push me away. The way she answered things, how she handled me as a person...
Then... my love showed her ignorance. She's the reason I'm terrified to ever consider poly relationships again because if what happened is connected to that, I am not safe. We were going out in a group and all three of us were there. They arrived together. They were cuddly and lovey-dovey with one another. She ignored the pain I felt. I had a breakdown on the railway station and they just went off to the café and had a nice little chat. She told me there that it was NOT something she DIDN'T care about, that she could just continue to do what she does and show me that way it's no harm?? I told her I was fearing to be excluded, I told her why, the progress, but she left me on the side as the extra wheel regardless!! They were proving my fear: I was being replaced. She was better than me... and I was the monster in the way. That night we said we would meet on Friday and talk. Her message to totally break off contact came Thursday evening.

She told me early on she doesn't want to hurt me. I told her that I trust her, because she looks out for me so much, which she did, pronouncing fears more than I did! She told me she wasn't deeply emotionally there yet but gave me such meaningful things. Did she abuse me, did she toy with me? I cannot walk through town anymore without panic attacks, so afraid am I to see them all happy in their bubble, not knowing, IGNORING what they did to me! I can no longer go where they go, I lost a whole friend circle because of them and it hurts so much!

To me, she demanded too much from me and didn't give me any time to grow. She just found someone better. And now I want to know: is this how poly people pick their loves? She had 2 LDR gfs when I came into her life. Is this how easily one is dumped? Because you can just return to your happy bubble? I don't want to sound accusing, I seriously want to know because this is the first impression I got here!

The “poly“ fantasies I mentioned... I'll have to ask about them as well in another post. I found a dynamic in them that may be toxic to wish for... but that's a different topic. PLEASE ask me any questions you have if anything's unclear, which I wouldn't be surprised, it's so tough to write this down... so much love, poly sounds so beautiful an idea but after what I've gone through now... am I the monster? Am I at fault and shouldn't be here? Or was my love actually just toying with me... Please tell me.OK so hi, I'm Demiaroacespike (meaning I almost never get sexual or romantic feelings and if I do, not for long) and the thing is that despite not feeling romantic or sexual feelings towards anyone, I think I might be feeling sensual and alterous feelings with more than one people (2 in this case).

In a hypothetical reality, would it still be considered polyamory? Because for me it feels different and way more than just friendship, to the point where I would want to actually marry them (but not in the traditional romantic way).

Got any advice? 😅Hello everyone!

I met a guy who is poly and we got together just to be FWBs. A year and a half later, we’ve fallen in love and though he still identifies as poly, he says he wants to pursue a monogamous relationship with me because I am not poly and because he has never felt a deeper connection with anyone else before. We’re deeply in love and have stated that we’re pretty much the love of our lives. I have no doubt that he’ll be a great partner as he is the healthiest partner I have ever had and our relationship is amazing. 

I am nervous that later on, he’ll decide that monogamy isn’t for him or that he’ll be unhappy being monogamous. We won’t be in the honeymoon stage forever and I’m worried that he’ll get bored. He says that he doesn’t feel like he’ll miss out on being poly. 

Please give me some insight.

EDIT: He’s having a hard time reconciling the monumental mind shift to go into monogamy from being poly but knows he 100% wants to be with me and everything that entails. He’s working to get past it he said. Not sure if that adds any more context.I’m new to poly, dating someone who has lots of experience being poly. It’s going really well, and I like them so much. I’ve also had thoughts about being poly in the past, so this is truly a relationship style I’m open to exploring.

I feel very secure and loved on our weekly dates, but without fail the next day I “crash” and am super sad for reasons I can’t identify. It’s like I’m coming down from a crazy high. I generally feel very positive about them going on other dates, so I don’t think this is jealousy. But just as strongly as I feel this person’s presence, I feel their absence and it really hurts.  

Is it possible for NRE to hurt? Can anyone relate / have good ways to cope? I’ve tried to distract myself with friends and plans but I always end up “crashing”I need help with a situation I'm in. Me and my gf have been together for almost two years she recently discovered that she was poly and she wanted to have a relationship with two of her friends. I told her I wasn't comfortable with this so she said we should take a break but we were still living together and she asked to invite the other guy over so we could talk. I was really uncomfortable and none of us had said anything about but yet but I kept leaving the room to calm down and when I came back up they were cuddling on the bed together. I freaked out and ran out the door( I know I didn't handle that the best but I needed to leave). The next day she invites him over without telling me( she said she was gonna break it off). She called me at work and told me they kissed and cuddled and that they were breaking it off. I was upset and hurt and she didn't text him for a little while but started back flirting with him through messages again. I read them and I was heartbroken I know I can't ask her to stop feeling the way she does about him but I want her to stop flirting. When I asked she just stopped texting him all together and got depressed and didn't really talk to me or want to do anything anymore. I said they can text but I was uncomfortable with the flirting so she wanted me to stop looking at her messages. After this I fell into a depression that I haven't really came out of yet and she has been doing better. She wanted to hang out with him I said ok but I wasn't ok with it and I communicated that to her she said they just wanna be friends now but I don't know if I can see it like that. They still touch in ways that makes me uncomfortable but she sees nothing wrong with it. She says she can't be alone and I can't always be there but what am I supposed to do. 


There is other things that have happened but this is a summary or the last few weeks. Any advice out there?

So I want it all out there she just told me that she picked me but she still wants to flirt with him hang out with him and hold hands with him as friends. I don't know how I feel about them flirting and then hanging out and holding hands and going bout to eat and stuff.One thing I’ve never understood is why (a lot of monogamous) people get possessive about their ex partners. Like if a friend were to get with an ex or even someone they’ve hooked up with then it’s a terrible thing. I find this weirdly possessive. If a friend hit it off with an ex and wanted to pursue that, I feel like it would be my stuff to deal with (like any jealously, possessive feelings etc), I wouldn’t get weird about it with my friend. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.

I understand if a friend did it without speaking to you first and can understand some difficult emotions coming up but I’ve never really got the big issue with it. I find it a bit confusing.

What do you think?

Edit to add: I’m an abuse survivor. Obviously it’s understandable if a friend gets with an ex who was abusive to you. I wouldn’t say that’s a case of being ‘possessive’ because you don’t feel a sense of ownership or entitlement over that person and their love. That’s more, “Hey, friend, take my pain seriously and keep that person the fuck out of my circle.”

And to add - I’m not saying that it is possessive in all cases when you don’t want someone to date your ex - I am talking about the distinct cases in which it’s commonly seen as a betrayal because the friend sees them as “THIER ex” - which is what I mean by possessive. 

And this isn’t a judgmental post, I’m just curious about this perspective 😊.Hey, I'm new to this and need advice. My partner and I opened our relationship because I'm bi and wanted to explore that part of me. 

After matching with people on dating apps, he scheduled a first date the day before we had organised a holiday. I was upset and flustered because he didn't give me much notice (he told me the day before the date) but ultimately I get through it and hopes he has a nice time. The date goes well and we're on holidays. I tell him I'm not texting anyone the entire time we're together, he says he's not either and he just wants to focus on me. 

On holidays, over dinner I say I'm slowly becoming more comfortable and thank him for being so patient but I might still need time before I am comfortable with him being intimate with someone else. He says his date didn't even go that way and it will take time for him as well. Then last night, last night before we fly home I find out he's been texting and sending nudes to his new date this entire time. 

I am shattered. I feel so betrayed and lied to, and completely manipulated. This is a normal reaction, right? Like, he completely broke clear boundaries and trust. I'm debating whether I should leave him because I honestly don't know how I can trust him again. 

Would love to hear others thoughts and any advice you might have?My wife (33f) is poly and I am (37m) mono.  Can I have some advice on how to let go and let her be who she is?  I have never wanted to share a relationship but this girl is everything I have ever wanted.  I love her to the moon and back and cannot see myself without her but I am having an extremely hard time letting go. I am really trying for her but this is a slow process for me which I feel is happening too slowly.  We started out as mono and got married.  1 year into the marriage she says she is poly.  We tried with some bad outcomes.  So she went back to mono which I see is basically killing her.  So I really am trying my hardest to see her happy and try out this new lifestyle.  Turning a new leaf as they say.Sunday morning and I’m lounging in my pjs making myself breakfast, wearing my bf’s tshirt and my NP’s sweatshirt over it, and feeling cozy and loved. ❤️Dear people of this subreddit,

I am writing this post because me and my girlfriend are kind of in the state of transition from a monogamous relationship to something that could possibly end up in polyamory because another person entered our lives. Right now we are not exactly sure where we are heading because neither one of us has any experience with alternative concepts of relationships but we want to learn and support each other to live as open and honest as possible because we love each other.

Currently we are looking for any kind of input from people, who are experienced and share their knowledge and ideas. We started reading the book "the ethical slut" (i don't exactly know how popular it is but it got recommended to us). And I wanted to ask you guys if you know any books, podcasts, articles, movies or whatever that helped you to learn and develop yourselves to the people you are now. That would be a big help for us!

Thank you for your tips if you have any :) (Also I am german speaking. So if there are any german people outthere who know german content we would be grateful for that too \^\^)

Lots of love!Hi, long time Reddit lurker and long time poly lifestyle

Hi, Ive been in poly relationships for almost two decades. My poly marriage ended when my husband started dating my friend and they both chose not to tell me. Despite having successfully navigated a primary dynamic for a few years prior, the relationship ended. Cheating is definitely a deal breaker. 
My next relationship, I was a unicorn. Went well for quite some time until they decided to cut me out, I guess they had been considering ending it for awhile but I was not privy to the conversations until the breakup. 
The next relationship was a solo poly dynamic and my partner forgot to tell me about someone they had been dating for months.

All of these relationships ended when each couple 
pursued a relationship structure that excluded informing me in a timely manner ie months.

Fast Forward to now. Solo poly dating solo poly. They had no barriered sex with their roommate. I was informed soon afterwards and initially was supportive but then my mind started to wander. I thought it was jealousy initially but in fact the situation triggered my past relationships and their lack of transparency and timely communication.

This time the partner is completely transparent and shared the experience right away. There was no boundaries against fucking roommates but there was a boundary in place for  condoms to be used for casual sex. Im told now that they would possibly like it to be more than casual and they 'felt' that their std screening was good enough. 

I chose to continue seeing this person but now we refrain from oral and unprotected sex until I see negative std tests from each person involved after the window period. Ive also decided that I am not comfortable going to their shared home. 

Im wondering if my reaction is related to triggers of the previous couples excluding me from important conversations ie. Shitty unicorn dynamics or those that feel the need to cheat in a poly dynamic. 

I have no intention of vetoing this new bond with my lover and their roommate but also realize that I would have not pursued this relationship had I considered their dynamic anything more than platonic. 

Any thoughts or discussion on this would be appreciated. 

ThanksTLDR at the end. 

I have been dating Jason for a little under a year now. So far it has been the happiest, healthiest relationship of my life. I feel supported, valued, and loved and I am so excited for our future together. Jason has been in a relationship with Becca for years and have been practicing poly for most of it. Jason owns his home and lives in it with Becca and Katie, Becca’s partner. I suspect they are all on this subreddit and will probably see this, but also, this is a conversation we are having irl too, so I’m not too worried about that (plus fake names of course).

I am going to graduate with my bachelor’s in May and prior to this relationship, I was so prepared to move wherever I had to to take the best position I could find in a relatively limited professional field. I’ve continued to apply for positions and some of them seem very promising, but I am so nervous about how moving will change our relationship. 

The most promising job is about 3,000 miles away, so it’s not exactly “I’ll see you on the weekend” distance. It would significantly limit the number of times we could see each other in person per year. 

Jason is himself in a little bit of a transition period with his work. A relocation was possible anyway, but is definitely less likely because of when he bought the home. 

Becca and Katie seem very happy and fixed in their jobs, and admittedly I haven’t had a conversation with them about what all of this would mean for them, mostly because I don’t think they’d consider relocating unless Jason was seriously considering it for himself. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on long distance, advice on relocating together, or advice on compromising professionally to maintain something as wonderful as this is. 

For the record, Jason is fully supportive of my career and choices that may force us to be long distance for some time. And I’m fully supportive of his choices in his career and homeownership and everything. I think he may even be less worried about long distance than I am. I just think that it’s harder to get that “quality time” feeling on FaceTime. 

I’m not really asking what decision I should make, but how to make the decision and what things I need to be thinking about that I may have not considered yet. 

TLDR: I am thinking about moving across the country for work, and I am worried about what moving might look like for my partner and I and our polycule.To start I am ND. I generally struggle with where I stand with people, specially if it's not been communicated to me effectively. 

I'm trying to have a relationship. In the past I've felt like I can be too much and to expect someone outside of my husband to "tolerate" me is asking far to much for me. But I desire to have human connection. So I'm giving it a chance. 

I starting talking to someone, it's been a month and it seems like we haven't moved past small talk. I try to incorporate a little bit if details here and there because that's what I need but I'm not receiving anything like that in return. I really like this person. They do seem interested in the little I do share but they don't seem like that are wanting to know more on their own level. I know some people can be more reserved than I am so I'm trying to give it time. But I feel like I'm being too much. Does this make sense to anyone? 

Thanks for reading this far.I broke up with my long term poly partner, who is married to their nesting partner. Our relationship was secret to the public. Theirs was not. This hierarchy of open vs swcret bothered me off and on, but I fought hard to make it work. But today I just snapped and was like. I'm done being a secret. Yet I still feel like dog shit. 

During our breakup, I was reminded (paraphrasing) "I signed up for this (poly)". I think they interpret this as in, "you knew you could get hurt" whereas I interpret this as "I knew I could get hurt, but I also expected things in return for the potential I could get hurt". That statement at its face value sounds terrible, but let me continue. 

The things I expected was a poly relationship, and how I see that is: communicate and commit time to each other as well as respect the boundaries of the nesting partner, a consistent date night, a commitment to grow together over time, within the boundaries of nesting partner and her, and make plans with each other based upon our individual and shared goals. I was accepting of and perfectly ok with not being a husband, father, ever meeting their family. But the secrecy just put a pall over everything.

In a sense, I feel like I was duped as many of the things i did want and wanted to be did not come to pass. I feel stupid. 

I realized yesterday after I washed her nesting partners socks (absently left over from her last visit, I didnt realize till I washed them), that things will not ever grow into the poly relationship I wanted when I "signed up for this." I feel hurt by how black and white that statement is.

I spent a decade in a  monogamous relationship and I struggled. I then spent years single and finding myself. This person who I just broke up with introduced me to poly, but given how things have gone trying to navigate a relationship with her, but also watching her and her nesting partner achieve what I wanted (shared activities, open and public relationship,), I'm questioning myself: was I ever poly to begin with? Was I asking for a monogamous relationship with someone who clearly reminded me during our breakup that they can never give to me the things I ask. Can someone really provide for two or more people? 

I know only I can answer that based on the life I want to live and love within. And my answer is I really want to exist, live, and love in poly relationships, but I'm having some real serious doubts based on how things went down that poly can really work given relationship hierarchies, secrecy to protect the other relationships...

...Anyone out there trying to make it work? Please tell me so. I just need a little hope that I'm not forced to choose between monogamy and its built in escalator or being alone.Presuming a voluntary relationship with some notable duration, does 'i love you' and 'i am in love with you' mean different things? does one mean more than the other?

no real reason for this, just getting peoples opinion.Last week I went on a date with a poly guy off of online dating.  I wasn't looking for anything serious(I'm moving to another country this summer) and he was fine with that.    
On our first date he started bragging about one of his partners.  How hot she was, how she has been in some fetish magazines, how she is willing to do all the extreme things he watches in porn.  On and on and on!  I was totally gob smacked.  I just stared at him with my mouth open cause it really felt like he was trying to neg me or he has his self worth attached to how many women he can bang.    
I made an excuse and left.    
Later that night he texted me and asked for a second date.  I told him how turned off I was by his bragging and was confused as to why he did that.  How it also showed me he doesn't respect boundaries and would probably just use me to brag to his friends or whatever.  He said that he didn't mean to hurt my feelings, that I was hot too (thanks I guess?)  and he was sorry.    


The silver lining is that him blabbing all this to me showed me that we are NOT sexually compatible.  So I guess that is good...  


BASICALLY!....  


 Is this normal for poly people to brag about the intimate details of their partners?  I would feel so hurt if I found out someone I was dating talked about me like how he was talking about her.  I get that some people are into sharing the nitty gritty about their partners but....wouldn't he at least ask?    
 If so I will have to make sure to not swipe on poly guys :/   


Thanks a tonSo based on the title, it's a messy situation, but I'm taking a risk and trying something new. I'm sparing a lot of the details, but before I begin I would really appreciate refraining from telling me to leave the relationship, because that's not really what I'm asking for.

Anyway, long story short, my \[20M\] boyfriend "S" \[21M\] cheated on me with another guy "Z" \[19M\] three months ago and they've been in a secret relationship. I found out only a couple weeks ago, and I was distraught (we've been together for two and a half years so it had a big impact on me), but we eventually agreed to start a polyamorous relationship with Z. I don't have any issues with Z, he's cool and all and we get along well, but the two of them are definitely more sexually compatible than I ever was with S. I have a much lower sex drive than the two of them, one of the reasons S cheated. Obviously not condoning his cheating, it's a miracle that I'm still willing to make things work after all of this, but I'm trying to move past everything so that's not why I'm here.

I've expressed that because S cheated on me, there's definitely a lack of trust there, which will take a while for the relationship (specifically between me and S) to be fixed. Because of this lack of trust, I expressed that I absolutely need to give full consent for when anything sexual happens. At this current moment, I am not emotionally ready for S and Z to be doing anything sexual while I'm not there (usually when I'm at work, because we tend to have opposite work schedules a few days a week). They've respected that, which I appreciate, but it's clear they \*want\* to do stuff together since I'm not always there. The problem, though, is that the mere thought of them doing stuff without me floods me with emotions of jealousy, being the 3rd wheel in my own relationship, so to speak, and being reminded of the reason S cheated on me. I don't necessarily feel bad asking S to wait until I'm emotionally ready, he broke my trust and he needs to earn it back, which will take time, so if I'm going to stay with him I feel like I really need to be taken seriously. However, Z is a victim in this too, he didn't know S was already in a relationship beforehand (because S never said anything), and now he's being forced to restrict himself for my sake. He says he's willing to do it, he's respecting my wishes and making sure I consent to things, but I can tell that his needs aren't being met, which makes me feel really bad, because I don't want him to repress himself just because I need S to restrict himself.

So at this point I'm not really sure what to do, and would really appreciate some advice. I want there to be a way where S and Z can do sexual stuff together without triggering my jealousy, but it's really hard and I can't really think of anything to help. I genuinely feel bad asking them to restrict themselves (especially Z) for my sake but I also don't want to compromise my own emotions. I really don't want to come across as the emotional, restrictive boyfriend, but at the same time I do feel my emotions/reservations are valid.

Some side notes that may or may not be relevant:

I have never even considered a polyamorous relationship before this whole situation happened. I was always strictly monogamous (never judged other people for it, it just wasn't for me), but I'm willing to give it a try, partially because I want to stay with S, partially because I like Z too, partially because I'm curious of how it will go. So all of this is so new to me, I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing. S and Z are new to it too, but the whole reason it happened is because S didn't want to have to choose between one or the other, and wanted to keep us both.

I am absolutely not "stuck" in this relationship, I am here of my own free will. A lot of my friends said the relationship was dead after S cheated on me, and urged me to break up with him, but I want to give this a fair shot before making any decisions. S and I live together, but I have made plans with a friend so that I can stay with them if I ever need to break things off. S absolutely knows that if I am going to stay, he needs to be on his best behavior and not break my trust anymore than he has, and he understands that I could leave at any time, but he genuinely does love me and wants me to stay.

Because my sex drive is a lot lower than theirs, sex is definitely tricky between the three of us, but we make it work. I'm not always in the mood to do anything, but at the same time I am perfectly content just making sure that the two of them are happy, pleasuring them as needed without worrying about myself. I don't really get anything out of it other than seeing that they're happy, which makes me happy, so most of the time I really don't mind. I'm not \*repulsed\* by sex, but at the same time it's definitely not as important to me as it is to them, which has been a struggle but we've been making it work so far.

There was one day where Z was having a really bad day, I felt really bad for him, and I told S that just this one time, I give my consent for them to have sex while I was gone at work, as a way to cheer Z up. I fully consented to this, but when I heard that they took me up on my offer I felt like I got punched in the gut. I definitely thought I could handle it knowing that I was giving my consent, but it still made me feel really jealous and gross inside. That part is obviously not their fault because I did give consent, but for some reason my emotions still couldn't handle it. I feel overly emotional and that I'm holding them back but also I know if I'm not ready for something I shouldn't force it, so it's all just really tricky for me.That moment you're sitting at home while your partner is on their first date. Just hoping they have fun.I don't know how much background i need to give for this situation, but I'll try to keep it short. 

I've been madly in love with my highschool sweetheart, he proposed to me on our 10th anniversary, the bond we have is special and i look forward to the rest of our lives together. Around year 4/5, we opened up, we explored hookups with other people mostly when he was away at college. The agreement was to just not talk about it and to not be emotionally bonded to our hookups. This never felt great to me, and i learned over time that i have no interest in sharing sex with someone i don't have a bond with. I advocated for trying to transition to something more poly-like, but he was very against it, so i would only bring it up on occasion over several years, but never wanted to push it as my relationship with him is my priority and i would only want it if we were both on board. 

Flash forward to the middle of the pandemic. We haven't had any hookups since we moved in together for the most part. We finally brought up the status of our relationship, and figured we've been technically closed for quite a few years now, but never officially called the open relationship off. We discussed some instances where we both hurt eachother pretty bad, and due to being rusty with hooking up, we decided we will be officially closed until further notice. We figured if we decide it's time to open up again, we can work on ourselves so that we can approach openness with respect and not hurt eachother. 

So about a month ago, we are at a party, and late into the night i notice he's not with everyone else, and i had a suspicion he was potentially cheating with someone we had just met that night. So i go and find them getting frisky, and i calmly told them this should stop because it's incredibly disrespectful to me. I honestly wasn't even too mad, but i needed them to stop so that my partner and i could get the chance to discuss what our relationship is when we are sober and clear headed. 

So when we do talk, i find out he's really into her and wishes to explore a relationship of sorts. I tell him that this is what I've been wanting for years, but that i had given up on it due do him not seeming interested, and that I would love to explore this further.  There was just one condition, and that was that we take it slowly, we read books and do research, seek therapy to have an outside perspective on our feelings and learn better communication skills. So i tell him it's okay to start talking with her, but given these conditions and that I am still hurt by his actions, i would need some time to heal from my trust being violated before we tackle any major hurdles. I went out of my way to express all of this to her as well, i shared some trauma i still feel from when we hurt eachother in our open relationship in the past, and she was respectful and grateful for my transparancy and allowing a relationship to potentially form. I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, i started reading a book on nonmongomy, and he started reading it too. Everything seemed great and moving in a slow, but steady direction. I felt safe, listened to, and secure in my relationship. Until last week. 

They both were at a birthday gathering that i was not able to make. My partner asked if it would be okay if he went without me, knowing that she'd be there, and i told him i felt comfortable and that i trust both of them to to not overstep the boundaries i established while we ease into this. He thanked and appreciated my trust. But they both ended up blacking out and sleeping together (unprotected), meanwhile, i was up all night calling in a panick, worried something bad happened to either of them because it was never discussed that he'd be out all night. This has left me severely heartbroken, and feeling betrayed and violated by both of them. 

Now I'm not a person that likes to simmer in strong emotions for very long. I prefer getting the feelings out, talking about it, and begin the healing process as soon as everyone's settled down enough to talk without hostility or potentially make haste decisions/ accusations. That's something that does not take a long time for me towards my partner who I've been with for almost half my life, but to get to that point with an aquantance, who is more a stranger to me if anything, is going to take me awhile. They both have shown extreme remorse and regret in what happened, and I understand that they had zero intention to voilate these boundaries before the night started. But after living most of my life trying to make other people comfortable despite my feelings, i try really hard to ensure I'm validating my own emotions, and while i'm experiencing this i know i just feel... I guess horrible, and i'm stumbling on how to stand up for myself and how i feel while also acknowledging their mistake and that it's something that we can work past. 

I'm sorry about the extremely long back story. But bringing this back to the question in my title.... How much time should give myself to potentially bring her back into my life? My partner said he needed closure, and to offer to be friends with her. I told him i can respect that, but since then he's wanted to meet up with her for walks on his lunch break, make plans to do stuff, and there is going to be an after work sport meetup playing my favorite sport (I've been looking for open gym meetups for a year with no luck) and she might be there and i just can't handle that. I guess I'm trying to make it clear to him my feelings about all of this without making it seem like i control his actions, but i feel really pushed to accept a lot of things I'm not ready for after opening my heart and having it betrayed so badly.So I'm posting to get some advice about poly and BDSM relationships. I've also posted to non-monogamy as I'm curious about how the open vs poly crowd would approach. We have previously been open/but realize this could become poly and are okay with and excited by that prospect. 

Just to give some background to the questions, my wife and I are both 41, been together 20 years. After the first few months/year of dating, we pretty much have always had a very low level sex life - we'd do it maybe once a month, super vanilla. It was fine, didn't cause a ton of conflict but we just didn't really click sexually, and she just didn't seem very interested. 

We had a child about 5 years ago, and things started to shift. I think a combo of her being pregnant and changing hormones + wanting to have some agency, she started exploring more sexually. Started with watching a lot of porn and finding that she was submissive and into BDSM etc. 

We had lots of talks about that, and she dove deeper into that world, joining Fetlife and making friendships there. She and I tried a lot of things that she was interested in, but it still didn't click, I'm not a dominant and just couldn't really hit that chord for/with her, so we talked more and she ended up finding a friend there she could play with, but it was long distance/online. 

Eventually we started talking about doing it in person, talked about an open relationship etc. But ultimately I don't really want to be open, and I'm also submissive so I'm excited by her journey, even if I'm not a part of it directly, so we just decided she'd go on that journey herself. Right when we decided to do that though, COVID started, and that hit a hard stop. 

She did continue playing online, and upgraded to video play and things and that was all great. Then when covid was calming down, she went to a few munches and a couple play parties. She had an amazing time, and also met someone who she played with solo and also slept with twice. It was pretty damn smooth, but then COVID slammed into things again. Now we're finally ready to get back out there. I'm wondering about some things we learned/experienced the first time though/running into now that shes out there again.

1. Does anyone have advice on how to manage a vanilla relationship and a D/s relationship at the same time? Most of the men shes talking to are interested in just playing, but also interested in a more involved D/s relationship. That's something she'd like as well, but not sure how to like draw those boundaries if it's a bit (or a lot) more than just play time. I guess a lot is like managing any other relationship, but what about rules/things that cross into the other.
2. Because she's still exploring, and some of the things shes into are even hard for her still, she can be EXTREMELY private about what she's doing. But, at other times, she can be super open about them and want to talk to me about them. We've tried saying that we're not going to talk about it, but then she will want my advice or just want to share something. I've also felt like I've stepped on landmines asking about things where she didn't feel comfortable talking about it but I had no idea. I feel like the line is in her mind and hers alone, so while I'm fine with that - is there language for how she can draw that line in a kind way, and I can approach that line carefully? Thanks everyone. This exploration for her and for us has been so good, and overall really smooth, so just looking  for some advice going forward.Been getting real sick of my boyfriend’s shit. (Joking: very petty dinner rant incoming).

Every time I say “Let’s get Korean food for dinner,” he says “Oh I just had Korean with X last night, can we do something else?” 

Like, idc who you’re out with but how come they’re getting all the good food. 

Tonight he was on his way out the door to go to his other GF’s place when he stopped and asked me “Is it ok if we get Korean for dinner tonight or would you prefer we got something else?” I told him I didn’t mind at all since I was actually craving Indian food this weekend. So we made a plan to order Indian together tomorrow.

I know it’s silly,but  I did feel special when he came in and asked me if it was ok!I’ve known I was poly for years, I’m also young and so it’s difficult for me and people around me to navigate relationships and feelings even with as much communication as we have in place. But in my first relationship I was too afraid to tell my partner I was poly because I didn’t want them to feel like they weren’t enough, so I repressed it. Now I thought I’d found the right balance with my current partners but things always go wrong and that hurts so much because it makes me feel like I can’t live the way I want to and still maintain loving relationships. It’s just so frustrating and I hate having all of these feelings.My NP/SO and I are ENM and poly. Recently my NP/SO developed an ongoing friendship and 2x's/week workout routine with a personal trainer who enjoys helping my NP/SO be more physically fit (no money is exchanged) and also sex after (so far every time they had sex with they had the opportunity).

This situation has caused a lot of anxiety for me and I am trying really hard to choose behaviors that align with my values.i.e. we can both explore our sexual selves in the way we want, we can explore our friendships and loves the way we want, jealousy can be toxic if not processed properly, etc...

I asked my NP/SO to know in advance of when they meet to know how each other is feeling about what they want sexually on that day and communicate that to me so I can process effectively. My NP/SO said they would do that. They didn't. They invited their meta over to the house for drinks on one occasion and dinner on another occasion. Sex did not happen naturally but my NP said I might want to "prep just in case" before their meta arrived.  We enjoyed each other's company but their meta left without a hint of wanting to play together. So now I'm feeling all the bad feels again - left out, and most importantly, not communicated with effectively because my NP/SO couldn't communicate effectively with their meta (they couldn't even ask the potential meta what time they would arrive so we waited 2 hours and delayed a meal as a result).

How should I deal with this situation? They want to keep seeing each other. I want to give them their space to explore their budding relationship. I asked for something specific meant to allow me the space and ability to process their relationship in a healthy way. My NP/SO said they would do that but they didn't. 

So many of the pitfalls could have been avoided if my NP/SO had a more open line of communication with their meta with stated expectations in advance. I asked for it and haven't gotten it (4+ weeks of asking).

Advice please?

Am I being unfair? Should I be more flexible with their budding relationship despite a habit of poor communication? Or do I have a right to set limits on my NP/SO's relationship with their potential meta since.... They can't communicate effectively with me if they can't effectively communicate with each other?to start, I'm perfectly ok with polyamory, i don't care if i have one partner or six partners. i am also tentatively open to having a partner date others as long as there is communication and consent.

i have this friend who we'll call dak, who I'll admit, I'm in love with. we go to school together, we live close so we're at each other's houses or hanging out elsewhere almost every weekend. he is the best and closest friend I've ever had even if I've only known him for a little over two years. I've been in a few relationships before, but i don't think I've ever had a stronger connection to anyone else, dak might as well be my soulmate. he knows full well my desire to be his partner, and if in honest I'm pretty sure he feels the same

dak has basically said he sees me as a significant other, makes flirting jokes with me all the time, has said he would have five boyfriends if he had everything he wanted, has said he basically feels like our friend group is a poly relationship. we have great chemistry, we've been asked four times if we're a couple, and one of our friends makes jokes and comments about how we're "dating", i don't think it would surprise anyone if we said we were. and we might as well be, for how we behave, the amount of time we spend together, we cuddle, hold hands, he has literally fallen asleep and slept the night on top of me (wasn't the most comfortable, he's a bit bigger than me) the only thing that makes our relationship not romantic is making it official or whatever

the only thing is, dak is in a poly relationship with two other partners, neither of whom live in the same state and he e-dates them through discord. i have only hardly talked to one of them, the other I've never talked to at all. i don't know that much about them but i will not pursue a relationship with him without their permission. the only problem is, dak refuses to talk to them about this. he has made the excuses that he is scared of their rejection and i should talk to them, or that they hardly ever respond anyway. i don't think i should be the one to talk to them, considering i don't really know them and they don't really know me, i feel like it should come from dak anyway.

I've been so focused on trying to get dak to actually talk to his partners that i haven't thought about what happens after or if they don't want me dating him. i don't really know how to go about this, any ideas or advice on what to do would be very much appreciated, thanks

fyi: my pronouns are he/him and any neopronouns, dak uses he/they, I'm not sure on his partners pronouns but he has referred to them both with he/him

tldr; i wanna date my friend who is dating two other ppl, i can't get him to talk to them about it, helpLooking for some help from someone in a mono/poly relationship. This is something may want to bring up to my wife and would like some tips on how to navigate this initial conversation.tl;dr My wife, who prior to our mono relationship was quite experienced at poly, told me, who had no experience with poly, that since I was curious about it, she wanted me to explore it, ie, try it out. Almost immediately, she seems to have regretted telling me that and I don't know what to do now.

I'm really just interested in lots of different perspectives here, it's a complex situation and I don't think there's any one right answer, so if you have an opinion that differs from others already written, I'd love to hear it.

When I (39M) met my wife (42F) 1 1/2 years ago, she was poly. She had been poly for 5 years, had done both hierarchical and solo poly, and had been in open relationships for most of her life before that. I was mono, I had no experience with poly or open relationships and didn't really know anything about it. My wife said she was looking for a primary partner, and that she wasn't looking for an open or poly relationship, but if the partner she found wanted that, she would be happy to do that.

We very quickly connected and the relationship was amazing. I was very intrigued by polyamory and she would spend hours telling me about it and explaining how it worked and how it didn't work etc. After a couple of months, she started expressing that she was worried that she might find it hard to be mono, and was worried that that might ruin the relationship. I decided to do more of my own research then, I joined this sub and started reading at least weekly, if not daily. I figured, if one day she comes to me and says "I want to be poly", if I do my research now, I'll be in a good position to maximise the chances of that working.

Over time, her fears settled, and went the opposite, she really liked being in a mono relationship with me, and she said she didn't have any desire to be poly. We got married. But, I was still really intrigued and curious about poly, and I stayed in this sub, and she and I continued to talk about poly from time to time. We would often say in rather lighthearted comments "when we go poly, then...", as if it was an inevitable thing on the horizon. I reached a point where I was completely comfortable with the idea (yet to be tested obviously) of her seeing other people, and I could also see myself being poly.

The other day, we were listening to sex podcast together (which we often do), and this episode happened to be a poly 101 episode. Nothing new for either of us, but we chatted about some of the things it brought up afterwards, and that's when she said "I think it's time for you to explore poly". She said she didn't want to hold me back from exploring that. I asked her about her reservations about poly, I said I was worried that maybe she feels pressured because I've stayed curious about it, but she said she was sure. She said she wasn't ready to be poly herself right now, but once I found my first partner, she might reconsider (she also doesn't want us to be in the all too common situation where I end up being unable to find someone while she has no problems finding many partners - I don't feel the same, while I'm more than aware that I may find it very hard to find a partner, I feel comfortable with the idea of her dating and me not - yet to be tested).

So, that evening, I opened the glass ceiling questions post in this sub, and I started going through them with her. And part way through she said "can we do this some other time". She then broke down in tears. We talked, and she still wants me to be poly, but she's also really struggling with it, she fears feeling alone. Not actually being alone, that's not a problem, we do things by ourselves all the time. But more the feeling that she is all alone - she's an ex-pat, all her family is on the other side of the world, and she often feels very isolated because of that. So sometimes, in spite of her having some great friends here, she feels like I'm all she's got. Which is understandable, I've lived as an ex-pat before (we live in my home country now), I know what that feeling is like.

So anyway, I don't know what to do. I was really excited to start my poly journey, I'd joined the local poly Facebook group. I am more than content in my marriage with my wife, I could be mono for the rest of my life with her and hold no resentment about it. But the idea that love is infinite really resonates with me and I really want to explore that. Should I put the brakes on and say "now's not the time"? Should I continue but slowly?My girlfriend has been toying with the idea of looking for a second partner, solely for emotional reasons. She told me that I'm enough for her and she's incredibly happy with me. It's just that she wants to be able to talk about certain topics she's interested in without needing to explain background information about it to me. That's the main she gave me anyway. We agreed to no physical intimacy because I don't want her to be intimate with someone else like that. She agreed with it because she's ace and it doesn't matter to her if the relationship would be physically intimate or not.

The main thing I'm wondering though: wouldn't that relationship be a friendship with a deeper emotional connection?So me and my partner have began testing the waters of the poly world around a year ago but it seems that we can't find anyone at all I'm a 22 year old bisexual man and she's a 29 year old straight trans woman we also live in Texas neither of us can seem to find partners at all any advice on thisSo we opened our relationship back in October, I had a second partner he had a hard time finding one. My second partner and I ended things this weekend. So my fiancé told me today he wants to close things back up and said even though he knows the break up is hurting me he’s glad because he wasn’t comfortable sharing me. So we are closing things again; he started seeing a woman a few weeks ago so he’s going to end things with her obviously. But poly works for me and how do I go about transitioning back to monogamy? I want to do this for him and I will be happy with just him of course. But I just experienced a LOT of loss this weekend starting with the loss of my 18 year old dog. I’m an emotional mess and just need advice. Please?Everytime my boyfriend talks about his other partners I just feel absolutely horrible and it eats me up inside, even more when his partners talk about my bf (we’re in a group chat so I hear these things occasionally) 

Is this normal? I don’t want to break up with him he means the world to me and I don’t want to lose him 

I’m sorry if this is worded badly im just stressed and I need answersI (16NB) came out to my boyfriend (15M) as polyamorous yesterday. I feel like he doesn't completely understand what's going on right now, and I know I need to give him time, but he just doesn't get it. I seriously need advice.

I'm not taking my coming out back, nor am I going to attempt that. I want to be myself and love who I love, and there's nobody else I have my eyes on as of now, nor do I think there will be in the near future. My standards are pretty high for who I'm looking for, so there's nothing to worry about on his end. I don't wanna change for him, and he doesn't want me to change for him. But things are still tense and I'm panicking.

The thing I think he's not understanding is he will always be my number one. It's just that if someone (ever) comes along they will both be my number ones.

Being in a polycule with my boyfriend would be a dream come true. It's not that monogamy makes me uncomfortable, it just feels like I'm being unfaithful when I get a little (or big) crush on someone else while I'm already taken. I've done my research. I'm poly. And I don't wanna feel like I'm cheating on my partner anymore.

Advice? Help?I need help coming out to my girlfriend, she isn't polyamorous but I am and I've thought I am for awhile and the more I thought about it the more sure I was. Any advice on how to tell her? 

If this isn't the right place to ask this, please direct me to a right placeI posted this question in another thread, but many replies were convinced that my poly relationship is the problem. I feel differently and thought you might be able to provide some perspective.

**Relationship context:** we have been together for about 2 years. Our dynamics have not always been good for me, but they are currently on the table and we are working hard on them. Even though it takes strength, it is valuable to me how we work on ourselves and the relationship.

**Problem:** Now to the real point: My girlfriend appreciates me very much for who I am, but it has now turned out that this does not count for my appearance. I am overweight. *Her saying this makes me feel insecure and I don't know if I can fully let myself go with her anymore. Or how I can really feel comfortable in my body with her. How would you feel about that? Can a relationship stand that? What other info would be important to say more about this?*

**Intimacy context:** her relationship with intimacy was not easy from her past. I have always had a lot of understanding for that. We've been working on it her relationship has changed and she has now an approach to her sexuality. But can only live it with a new Partner she sees as attractive. Since we are in a polyamorous relationship that is not the problem.Yes, this could mean that now it becomes apparent that a romantic relationship with sex is not possible for us. First through her process and now that she does not find me attractive. But unfortunately she has so much on her plate that she hasn't given it much thought yet. And i am unsure. So I thought I ask for opinions here.

Thanks for reading and I am looking forward to your answers.Hi! 

TLDR: I’m a queer poly afab person who has trauma around men. I don’t want to limit my options based on gender but I don’t trust myself around men pls help.


For some background info I left an abusive relationship with a man almost 2 years.  I moved a few towns away to a city and established myself in the queer community.  I’m queer (bi/pan/etc) and afab but gender fluid.  After years of lurking and audiobooks, this year I stepped into the poly world. For the past 6 months I’ve been dating both a women and a man and it’s been going better then I ever expected! This is my first time dating a woman and I’ve gotten incredibly lucky with the partner I’ve found.  She is one of those people who has changed my view of what people are capable of.  I’m finally getting the respect and communication I’ve dreamed of and begged previous partners for. She’s raised my standards of how I will allow people to treat me. The issue I’m having is more around the man I’m dating.  He’s great and I feel like I’m the issue.  I feel like I’m holding back my feelings because looking back, I’ve only ever been in abusive relationships with men, so I don’t trust myself around them.  He wants me to go out with him and meet his friends but I’ve been avoiding it. There are a few reasons
1) I still live close to my ex and his friends who played a role in the abuse, I don’t want to be in hetero spaces where I could run into them
2) I’ve never really felt safe in hetero spaces, bc previous spaces I’ve been in have been full of sexism, queer fetishization + gay bashing, and racism.
3) I can feel myself holding back on falling for him so I don’t want to move forward u till I sort that out bc I will feel that I’m leading him on.

I’m going to name theses feelings to my male partner tonight.  What I need help with is sorting out a game plan to work through these icky feelings around men.

So onto the book. It was recommended to me by my abusive ex’s current girlfriend.  I stayed friends with him bc I didn’t initially realize how bad the abuse was. When I realized, I knew I had to cut him out.  She wanted to meet with me, I didn’t want to meet with her but I decided to do it before I cut ties with him as she has a baby and I was worried for the kids physical and mental safety.  His abuse played a role in a disability I now have and I didn’t want anyone else, let alone a newborn, experience anything close to that. I explained to her all the ways he abused me.  She recommended I read ‘ why does he do that’ to understand the abuse more.  Despite our conversation and both of us realizing he’d lied to both of us, she has stayed with my ex bc ‘compared to the past this is the best man she’s meet so far’.  We are no longer communicating as I told her mentally, I cannot be attached to him and his drama anymore and she respected that.  

I’m having a hard time justifying that this book would help me bc she had the knowledge of the book yet stayed with a violent lying  man.  I know it’s just one person but the whole experience around realizing the abuse and talking to her feels so heavy in me.  So that’s why I’m here, ik I’m being biased so I would like to hear the opinions of people less closely involved on the book and sorting through this gendered trauma.

Also I am in therapy already so no need to suggest that.i dont want to make him choose, but i dont know what to doi’ll add a tldr at the bottom!

so basically i have two wonderful boyfriends, let’s call them Max and Dave. I’ve known Dave the longest but simply as a close friend I lived with, I entered the relationship with Max first. 

About a month or two into dating Max I introduced the question of getting with Dave as well! Dave and Max have met before and Max instantly gave the okay for me to initiate a relationship with Dave, Max has another partner of his own that was established way before me so didn’t see a problem with me dating elsewhere either. 

Fast forward about two months later (current time) and Max mentions to me that he’s honestly struggling with jealousy a bit. I get to see Dave more easily than him considering we live together but I honestly spend most of my time talking with Max, even if it’s just through texting. 

Max isn’t extremely jealous to them point of wanting us to break up or anything, nothing extreme at all, just generally feeling a little upset that while it takes me a bit of travel time to see him, Dave is always readily available. 

We talked about it a bit and agreed for now that I wouldn’t mention the things i’m doing with Dave to him for a while until he adjusts and he wishes to talk with Dave today (unless plans have changed). I’m just wondering if y’all know what can be done? This is far from being a bad relationship or problem of any kind but I do want to try and ease some of Max’s jealousy if i can. Any replies are appreciated!

tldr; I have two partners, one who I live with (calling him dave) and the other who is hard to see in person due to distance (calling him max) . Max is jealous that Dave can physically see me more even though I talk with Max throughout the day more. Any advice to help ease his concerns?Are there any other pansexuals here? Just wanted to say hi and connect 😊🙋‍♀️Hello there,

Some background: my wife and I are in our early 30s. We've been indulging in the cuckold kink/lifestyle for the past few years. Since this is the polyamory sub and some people may feel uncomfortable about cuckolding, just imagine a V-type relationship. I mean, that's basically what it is. The other guy (the "bull") and I don't have any contact. I've never spoken to him. I'd love to watch them during sex but unfortunately, he's not comfortable with this.

So far, my wife's experiences have been mainly sexual (as is typical for cuckolding). However, what distinguishes us from most other cuckold couples is that we don't really do casual sex stuff. My wife really enjoys having steady lovers... friends with benefits or whatever you want to call it. She's been with her current guy for over a year and they also do some non-sexual stuff together, such as going to the movies.

However, this is not enough for her. While she loves the cuckold/hotwife dynamic and wants to keep that, she also wants to develop a genuine relationship with this guy. I know she really likes him and she's been holding back her feelings. She told me she wants to be able to develop genuine romantic feelings for him.

My question: This prospect really scares me, not because I'm jealous but because of its implications. Let's say I let my wife fall in love with her bull/boyfriend and they're in a happy relationship. What if, one day in the future, I'm no longer okay with this situation? What if I want to be mono again with her? Or at least return to "regular" cuckolding? I mean... I'd have to ask her to dump her boyfriend for me. But what if she refuses? What if she says: "I love him very much and I don't want to break up with him"? My wife is the love of my life and I can't imagine being without her/leaving her. It would be completely unbearable. But clearly, you can't forever be in a limbo situation where one person wants to quit the poly thing and the other person refuses.

Now, if you think this is all very hypothetical, I should tell you that it isn't. We've gone through this experiment once before and it was a complete disaster namely because of the dilemma I described above. I wanted my wife to commit to me 100% and tell me that I'm her number one priority, so that I feel this assurance/guarantee no matter what may come in the future. But she refused to give me this guarantee. She wanted that other relationship to possess just as much priority as ours, which is something I could not and cannot accept. I'm just not made for this non-hierarchical poly stuff, it doesn't work for me. Hierarchical, yes, non-hierarchical, no.

We had to quit our "poly experiment" but I know my wife still secretly wants to give it another try. And frankly, I want to make it possible for her because I love seeing her happy. But I NEED this guarantee that, no matter what happens, she'll always be with me; even if it means breaking up with a guy she loves.

So... how do experienced poly people deal with issues such as this? Is there some kind of compromise? Some sort of trick? Do you have any advice for me?

Just one request: please don't lecture me on how important communication is. My wife and I have been together for 11 years, so we're well aware of that. Also, platitudes such as "it's really important to talk together" don't help me. I need something a bit more concrete. Thank you, and forgive me for my frankness.Hey, new to poly and so is my partner. We’re trying non hierarchical. We (me F32, him M32) haven’t been dating long, less than 6 months and are not official bf and gf. We never had restrictions in our relationships and we’re always allowed to date and have sex with whomever we wanted as long it’s safe. But now hes having NRE with another woman for the first time and I’m feeling envious and insecure. Our relationship has shifted and I’m feeling lesser.

What can I do with these feelings? How should I tell my partner in a healthy way without restricting him? What did you do in these situations? 

FYI: I’ve read polyam books like Polysecure, Ethical Slut, the Jealousy handbook, and listen to Multiamory religiously.

My partner and I have talked about my jealousy before but since he’s also new he lacks the words to articulate what he means and how to reassure me he’s not leaving me. He’s also a man who’s really bad at speaking 🤷‍♀️ he’s working on it.Hey, so I made a separate account for this post.  
  
I think if it weren't for us deciding to live a polyamourus lifestyle it would have been possible that we would have been our forties or fifties until this came to light.  
  
So, I'm glad we decided to be polyamourus. The only problem really is that while she's been able to explore her sexuality and meet several partners, I've been unable to meet anyone. I've kind of come to the conclusion that I'm just not attractive or that people don't want to be with a guy that they can't marry.  
  
It kind of makes me feel like a lot of women look at me like I'm supposed to be a source of income for them to take advantage of to be honest.  
  
Aside from that, how do other guys here meet women? I've been on several dating apps for over three years have only received a few likes and maybe three matches. When I go out, despite having no issue sparking up fun conversations with women, it doesn't seem like anyone is interested in me.  
  
So, any advice?Hey yall, I own a discord server specifically for polyamorous people (18 or under)!! I understand the annoyance of hate even from fellow LGBTQIA+ members. My server is easily navigatable and very laid-back. Come join our Poly Safe-Haven!!   
[https://discord.gg/6PaWFAEP](https://discord.gg/6PaWFAEP)

(if the link is faulty feel free to add me on discord at    sulfur#0593  )Like specifically if you have a regular schedule with a partner who has another partner, (we’ll say A is you, B is your partner, and C is your partner’s partner) and B is deciding to take on a new personal hobby in addition to having A and C as partners, and the result is B saying they have to spend less time with both partners, disrupting previously-held expectations about how much time is spent with A and C respectively (both get less time). 
Like say this is a hobby that doesn’t have to be done all the time, your partner is just choosing this for themselves as a personal priority and expect you to be OK with losing time with them, for an indeterminate amount of time, but it is temporary. 

Are there any ethical issues about B’s newly prioritizing personal hobbies over time commitments/expectations they made to their partners?

What would be some good ways to respond if you’re person A or C and don’t feel happy with the new priorities, but would like to find some compromise?Update: I just wanted to thank you all for being so thoughtful and helpful. I know my worries seem silly, but each of you took it seriously and helped me get out of my head. This is one of the most wholesome communities I’ve ever met. I love it!

I (26F) started seeing this wonderful, amazing man (29) about two months ago. He made it clear that he was polyamorous and I made it clear that I was 100% on board because of the open honesty he had with me. I am always so happy for him because he’s always so happy when gushing about my meta (30 they/them) who he has been seeing for about a year. He feels safe, comfortable, and needed by then. As long has he’s happy, I’m overjoyed for him.

A little background, he transitioned into the poly lifestyle with them. They were engaged and had a couple other partners when the two of them first met. When their engagement ended, the two became nesting partners. He had/has a casual LDR with another gal and my meta continued as they had, minus their fiancée. In my eyes and theirs, they have been dating for about one year. In that time, they have both had some financial hardships so my meta is living with their parents and he is living with his parents. I’m sure their relationship has had some strain because of that so I always bow out if he even *thinks* they get to spend time together. The way I see it, they went from spending nearly every day together to nearly nothing. I want him happy, so I want them to have as much time together as they can.

The poly situation is newish to him, but not new to them. (I’m even more new than he is to this lifestyle, but thanks to you lovely people on here, I absolutely adore the compassion and community your lifestyle harbors. Seriously. Y’all are some beautiful people.)

Here’s the rub for me. I’m 26. Old enough to know not to take anything too seriously. Old enough not to make a snap judgment based on one thing. But here I am, having an internal war over seeing his relationship status on Facebook change from single to being in a relationship with them as of 5 days ago.

Please, don’t think I don’t want the two of them to have that, but I feel hurt and confused because they both had their statuses set to single ever since they met. And just as our relationship is starting to grow beyond simple dates and more into a true relationship, they change something on their public profiles. Again, I feel the need to emphasize: I’m not hurt and confused that they’re in a relationship. My hurt and confusion comes from ‘Why’. Why now? I’m his first true relationship he’s had other than them since he transitioned into this life. I have that worry that they wanted it to be out there *because* of me. It almost feels like they’ve been sitting on top of Mount Everest for awhile, just holding their flag, and they don’t decide to plant it until they see me making the glorious climb to the top.

Again, I think I’m overthinking it. I haven’t had a chance to ask him about it or talk to him about it because I only saw it this morning and he is still asleep. I just thought, you all have been in these situations and I haven’t. None of my friend have either, so I’ve been feeling a little trapped in my own head. I’m hoping someone with some perspective could help me sort my thoughts out and give advice how to communicate my concerns to him.

If you want more info, just ask! My goal here is to be a supportive partner and a supportive meta. I really just need some help focusing my mind. I care so strongly for him, it’s overwhelming at times. I want to do everything I can to be supportive and understanding without worrying either of them that I’m trying to take him as just mine. That’s not me.

Any and all help/advice is appreciated. Even if it’s negative or something I don’t mind. I just want to grow and be a better person.**TLDR: I've been on a handful of dates with someone, he has a possible FWB coming to visit, we haven't yet defined our relationship and I'm not sure if the boundaries I want to request (tell me anything you would tell me about time with a platonic friend but fade to black on physical intimacy; be safe and change the sheets before I next stay over) are reasonable or me kidding myself about whether I'm okay with the situation.**

I've *very* recently started seeing someone (we've been on three dates, we text most days). We were both clear about things up front - we met online, his profile stated poly/open to mono, mine stated mono. It came up briefly on our first date, but I'd had too much to drink so we held off. I already had The Ethical Slut on audiobook so I started listening to, and I asked whether we needed to discuss "the mono/poly thing" on our second date, but we decided to take time to get to know each other, and pin that as a later conversation. He mentioned that he has a friend coming to visit for an event at the end of Feb who he had planned to be physical with, but if we had decided mono was the way for us by then he would sleep on the sofa. 

As I read and research more (I've read TES and Polysecure, various posts and links here, and watched some videos on YouTube), and as little things come up in conversation, the more I feel like a) asking him to be mono would feel icky and b) I may actually be poly. I fluctuate on my position on b on a daily basis (and I have tried as much as possible to think about it outside of this situation, if we decided not to pursue anything tomorrow and I was starting fresh dating new people, and mostly I think probably yes, I would also want to approach future dating from a poly stance), but a is constant. In an ideal world I'd like to have longer to work out what we're doing before someone else was introduced into the mix, but I don't know whether he is currently talking to other people and I also view a visiting FWB differently to a relationship. I'd like to keep the pin in the what are we doing/where is this going discussion until after his friend visits so that we don't have the pressure of outside time constraints and can continue getting to know each other.

It's when we come to the weekend with someone else that my feelings get... murky. Because we have conflicting schedules (I work a typical office job, he works in a bar), we spend one evening a week together, and I have a small sadness around someone else spending a whole weekend with him. It's not jealousy, I don't think- I have only a passing interest in the event they're going to and I'm really pleased he is able to go with someone that will enjoy it as much as he will, and it's not that I want him to spend a whole weekend with me instead, but I do wish we had the option of daytime activities *as well* (and because we haven't started looking at the long term for our situation, I don't know whether that could be an option), and (I assume, I haven't asked yet) as those will be his days off that week, it also probably means I won't get to see him at all that week. I want to know about his weekend when I next see him, I want to hear about the things they see and do at the event, or if they find some awesome new restaurant or bar. 

Is it reasonable for me to ask to hear that stuff with a restriction on hearing about what goes on when they're in his bedroom? I mean, I know that could also be something that comes from the other side, and I know he wouldn't tell me anything the other person wasn't comfortable with me knowing (assuming it didn't endanger me/my health), but if he turned around and said "oh hey, so and so did this amazing thing, could you try xyz" next time we were together that would be my worst nightmare. I'm fine with hearing "I enjoy having xyz done" (I mean, hell, I want to hear it, I like knowing what works for the person I'm seeing) but I think having a specific source for something would throw me for a loop.

Maybe it's just my anxiety combined with the newness of my thoughts and feelings on the whole situation and my approach to relationships potentially being flipped on its head, paired with knowing that shiny new person who makes me feel like a giddy teenager is probably imparing my rationality, but I'm worried I'm stuffing my fingers in my ears and pretending something doesn't exist rather than really accepting the reality- I'd be absolutely fine with one of my close friends sharing their happiness about a positive sexual experience, so is it a warning sign that I don't have that same level of comfort around hearing it from a potential partner?EDIT:  Sorry for upsetting so many people, I am learning and did not realize how much I knew that was wrong or contributing to problems you experience. The characters names are Brianna (A), Malik (B), Lani (C) and Antonio (D), and I should have AT LEAST included that in the post but I was rushing in writing it. I did not write these characters in service to any sexual fantasy or fetish, I wanted to include characters who reflect real people I knew years ago. Based on these reactions this is clearly not my place, so I will respect the feedback and remove the element from my story.

Original post:

I'm writing erotica that features a polycule as part of the main cast! This sub's FAQ helped me understand what is new information for me (like learned that "unicorn" describes women but not men, I think?) But my life has been monogamy so I want to be accurate in portraying polyamory and avoid cliches!

Here are the current details, please tell me if this is cliche or offensive, or needs to be adjusted:

* Partner A (female) is the primary of Partner B (male), they are in a quad with Partner C (female) and Partner D (male). Partners C and D are primaries. All 4 are bi/pansexual (different definitions so for sake of clarity, all 4 are attracted to people no matter orientation or concept of gender) and formed after years of knowing each other, no "unicorn hunting" just open couples who became good friends. They live together in a house that is also a staple of the local kink community, so people come by for play parties all the time.
* All four are polyamorous so they only get physically sexual with each other, so kink related play with other people is allowed, but only without fluid exchange and without penetration.
* A is a service sub, C is a Domme, B is a switch, and D hard subs for C but will Dom A or B.
* A and B have a play partner who C and D did not know about, who they only played with annually, and who C and D are suspicious of - is it cliched to have this be a point of conflict within the polycule? A and B did not intentionally keep their play partner a secret, it's just a rare occurrence. Like that one friend you have who calls you when they're in town. D is upset, he feels they intentionally kept a secret. And D will be the main one to be upset about this play partner.

Thanks and once again I want to be accurate, sorry if anything is offensive or a cliche, I'm learning!One thing I struggle with greatly is reading or listening to people describe themselves as practicing ethical non-monogomy yet using language and practices that do not seem ethical. Examples could include language and practices that promote things like "our rules include", vetos, or "I am allowed to...".

I personally do not consider those to be ethical, whether all parties agree to them or not. My ENM journey has included shifting my mindset and practices to examine situations where I might feel more secure having rules, or vetos, or objectifying/possessive language and learning effective ways to process my behavior so that I can address the root cause without attempting to control actions or outcomes. 

My question for the group is, do you consider it to be ethical to limit a partner by placing restrictions on time,  potential partners, or activities, even if everyone agrees, instead of examining the reason behind what drives though limitations?Hello all. New here. I’m doing my best to read on my own to get as informed as possible but I’m not sure where to go because I don’t know what I am yet. 🤷‍♀️
I’ve been married for 23 years to a man I met and married in the toxic church we used to go to. We went into missions and stayed there for 15 years but then moved to Ca and in the past 3 years have been slowly deconstructing from all the toxic things the “church” as a whole has done to us. 
My husband I believe is neurodivergent. He is unable to bring many things to the marriage. I’m not in the place to leave him- and honestly I don’t want to. I’m not attracted to him but I do love our partnership. He’s slept downstairs for almost a year now. We are not intimate other than a peck on the lips when he says good night and goes downstairs. We have 5 teens/young adults in the house but they all understand our situation. 
Yesterday I told him I was unhappy and felt like I was missing out on finding love. I said I don’t want to leave the marriage but I do want to reach out and find someone who can give me what I need. I am not looking for a man- only a woman. He released me to go find a woman who may give me what I need.
What is this? LOL am I looking for a poly? Do I put that I’m gay on dating apps? Do I put that I’m married and in a couple?
I’m so confused. Help meHello! 
Wanted the PolyA community's opinion on this... 

I've been struggling with meeting polyamorous people/partners contrary to my primary partner who's a very outgoing person so we're gonna try a poly meeting group in our city.
I'm very shy so this is already going to be difficult, I have not had another relationship in these 1 and half years of being poly (+5 years on my side of sexually open relationship with my ex)

The main issue being I'm a full service sex worker (5 years) and have no idea what to do about that.
Is it ethical for me to keep it to myself (as it kind of endangers me to tell civs and people I don't know) or is it not cool to hookup/ casually date people without telling them right away? 
Do you think the poly community would be more open to my job than monogamous peeps? (in the end it's just a job and nothing more)

I'm very apprehensive and very afraid of opening up about this to potential partners as there's a lot of casual whorephobia everywhere :/
I'm so far from that kind of situation yet but I want to know what the best thing to do would be


Thank you for reading meHi guys, new to this group and polyamory- a little background on me first- I’m 32F and I’ve been married to my husband for 15 years, we opened our marriage in Feb 2020 to explore different sexual desires with new partners, I met a younger guy (24M) in May 2020 which started off as a FWB thing but we became super close quickly and consider each other as best friends/lovers. My new guy is monogamous but accepts my poly marriage and gets along with my husband well. I fell in love with him but he said he loves me only as a friend. I would’ve loved to have a proper relationship with him but he’s not interested because I’m already married. Recently he has started going on dates with other younger girls in hopes to find a monogamous girlfriend. I’ve no problem with this and have actively encouraged him this whole time knowing that what we have would not be a forever thing since he always expressed wanting to find his own partner that he doesn’t have to share with. Lately though I’ve been feeling very jealous of the girls he’s been seeing on these dates. I’m so worried I will lose him and lose our special connection. I feel like I’m comparing myself to them and it’s starting to stress me out and upset me. I feel like my time is being limited with him and I’m scared I’m going to be replaced. That one day soon he’ll tell me that we have to cut ties sexually because he wants to go further with one of the girls. I know I’m in for heartbreak and I’m trying to pull myself back emotionally but I’m struggling. I’m not jealous when my husband is with other girls because I know he’s never leaving me for them. Is what I’m feeling normal for a poly relationship? Does anyone have any advice for me? Thank you in advance.I read all the books and blogs and reddit posts. No one warned me about the rampant narcissism and how damaging it can be in a situation like this.

I feel like there should be more discussions about abuse in polyamory, just like how there are in bdsm. An aknowledgement of predators and how they manifest in the community and how to avoid them.

Edit: See, because of this conversation on NARCISSISM, I'm starting to learn what echoing means and how it presets and how I might have aided the narc. Terms are important for identifying broader patterns and actions. Specific terms are important for understanding issues. Not using the term won't make the issue go away. It only protects repeat abusers. **And I'm tired of protecting them with softer terms and watered down phases. ** I will say exactly what I mean. 

If your biggest issue with this post is my use of the word "narcissist," then you're adding to the problem of protecting repeat abusers in our community.Hey all.  My husband and I have been together for 14+ years and married for 11+ of those.  We originally opened our marriage about 7 years ago but only became "active" in the last 4 or so.  

I am having way more luck than he is.  I tried to explain to him that in my opinion, it's easier for the woman to find men, simply because most (definitely not all) men think that sleeping with another man's wife is "hot".  Basically, like I belong to someone else , do it's hotter for men.  Whereas women are more likely to have the instinct to think, " he's probably just saying that so he can cheat on his wife.  What a dick. "

So, my question is..... How can I help my husband?   He is so sweet, loving, funny,  and s sexy bearded ginger.   😍   I want other women to know how great he is!!

 The lack of potential is really starting to get him down, I think, and it breaks my heart.I'm planning on moving soon, and would really prefer roomies who are comfortable with non monogamy.  I'm not currently in touch with any part of the polyamory/ENM community in my area   
 (but making such connections is on my to do list) so I can't just ask around about who needs a roomie/place to stay.  How do I screen roomies without being weird or awkward about it?

Edit-after someone else commented, I realize my wording could have been clearer.  I'm cool with monogamous roomies but I'd like them to be ok with non monogamous roomies.Hi all! My fiancé and I have recently discussed learning more about polyamory. I have felt poly since I was a teen but never explored that part of myself (partially because I was not out as a lesbian yet) and my fiancé has known this since we started dating and was comfortable with that fact. They have frequently checked in and made sure I didn't feel forced into monogamy and reiterated they were comfortable with me dating others as long as we communicated.  They recently expressed some interest in learning more and said they've also had some interest in polyamory in the past but never felt safe enough to explore it. We're from a Midwest city where everyone knows everyone and are moving to a much larger city for graduate school, so we finally feel able to freely explore this side of ourselves. 

The resources from this sub have been great. My fiancé and I have been listening to Multiamory separately and discussing it together, and have a few recommended books on hold from our library system. This has led me to wondering if anyone had any recommendations that discussed being queer and poly?

One of my main anxieties is that we are both nonbinary lesbians.  Neither of us would care if any metas were men or anything like that, but I wasn't sure how open most poly communities are to genderqueer folks and wondered if anyone had advice that way, as well. 

Thank you for your help and advice! :)Edit: please be nice, legitimately asking for nice but honest info.

Honestly not sure I have proper understanding of poly, but legitimately trying to gain an understanding. That being said would a harem be considered a polyamorous relationship? What similarities do you see? What differences? If I were to build a harem, what poly ideals would you all suggest for a healthy harem, if that's a thing?I don’t know if it’s just my location or what but my ability to develop a new relationship is weaker than a campfire in the middle of a rainstorm. 😭 It’s either all unicorn hunters, monogamous folks, or a OPP (My primary/nesting partner is AMAB) I’m about to throw in the towel, y’all.I feel silly posting this but I just want to get some ideas. 

My partner and I have been together for over a year, poly the whole time, and long distance. It’s the most loving and affectionate relationship I’ve ever been in and I’m very happy. 

Our relationship dynamic is that we are each others’ primary emotional partner, and we have casual hookups outside of that. I like when my partner goes on dates and hooks up with people. I get turned on thinking about them having a good time when it turns to that. I genuinely enjoy hearing the play by play. They always check in after a good night before they go to sleep and tell me how much they love me and I do the same. The next few days we’re often extra (textually) affectionate and the reunification sex is really good.

And yet. Sometimes when they first tell me about someone they want to see, or when they first leave for a date, or when I haven’t heard from them and it’s getting late, I get what I describe as a “pang.” It’s a short, sharp feeling in my chest like a tiny ice pick. Sometimes with a sinking feeling too. I confront the feeling and recognize what it is - hey you’re worried this other person is hotter than you, or you’re worried they will like them more, and you know that is silly. You’re going to hear from your partner soon or you know they’re having a great night or you are happy they’re being show a good time. This “first instinct” feeling gets me frustrated as I know it’s not rational or really even in line with my other feelings. Because a few minutes later I’m feeling happy again once I “talk it out” with myself. I feel like it’s maybe internalized toxic monogamy culture bubbling up, this weird instinct that I *should* be jealous/insecure even if I’m not really feeling that way. 

Does anyone else get this, even when it doesn’t truly line up with how you feel? I’m trying to figure out how to manage it and mostly how to prevent it.M27, F26(Me), F24

So my polycule and I have been together for at least 1.5 months. It started off with M27 and I being fwb, and then we introduced F24 and now we all get along and are in type of a relationship with eachother. We don’t use condoms, but we’ve all been tested, STD free, and only M27 has another partner but we know who she is and he uses condoms with her everytime.


So the question is, in your experience, does swapping vaginal fluids through penetration lead to penial eczema/genital acne? We’ve tested before and after this discovery and found that it’s not an STD. But we’re wondering is this a common thing? Is it something about pH balances? Or diet? Neither of the women have any abnormal symptoms, but he said after the last time we did it it became kind of inflamed and angry. It’s getting better with time. But I just wanna know the cause. Or if you’ve experienced something similar in FFMBonus points for author credit included46 y/o gender queer but female lesbian. I’m freshly minted into the poly world as of a month ago! I’m reading The Ethical Slut with my girlfriend and wife who happen to be very good friends. My wife is monogamous, but has some very deep friendships that are platonic only. She’s fully aware of my relationship.

Meanwhile, I suddenly have a huge sex drive and desire for relationship intimacy with more people. Part of me wants to sow some wild oats and part of me wants to pursue a friend whom I’m attracted to who is also poly and happens to be male, but is pansexual. WTF is wrong with me here? My wife is sooooo understanding and flexible. But I literally want to pick up women and build a relationship with this guy (and I’ve never been into guys, but now I’m curious). 

Is this normal? Does it get better, meaning do desires become more tame? 

TIA for your advice and experience.Really need some perspective and help here.

My partner of a year and a half (35M) was engaged to metamour (33F) of 6 years who was manipulative and abusive to not only him but to me as well. They ended in October - and in November he reconnected with an old friend in another state (Mid 40's F? Not sure) whom the ex-fiance felt threatened by. (She made him stop talking to her years ago because of this.)

I knew they were talking again and was supportive of their reconnection. I asked him if they were romantic he said no- so I figured this was plutonic.

Fast forward to early January; I stayed the night with him and when I woke up before work he said he "had been meaning to bring up" that he was leaving in three days to meet up with her for a few days and that it may be romantic. 

Not only that but he had bought the tickets back in late November/early December- which I felt blindsided and withheld by. He said his primary reason for going was to go with his roommate to meet roommates family. (I think it was mostly to meet this friend.)

We haven't been in the position where a new person has been added on either side since the fiance was such a nightmare. He said he didn't know if it would become romantic or not but he wanted to be forthcoming and say it might depending on the vibe as they haven't seen eachother in 5 years.

Then he went for the 4 days and he stayed the night/had sex with her for one. A LOT of firsts in a very short amount of time.

It's been a month, and they're still talking every day. I asked him what their relationship is and he said that they're friends who are romantic, but that she's not a partner- though he'd be open to that, but it would take a lot more dedication than what's available to them now.

 I felt/still feel gutted. I'm struggling with this. 
I'm having a hard time with how this all unfolded. It felt like he pulled the pin and ran; and after going through the bullshit with his ex-fiance I didn't know he'd jump into another connection so soon- especially without us talking about it first or having time to sort through the emotional rubbish that she left behind. 

I want him and his friend to have a relationship, but I don't feel comfortable with how it happened and I don't feel comfortable that he didn't consider my feelings in this at all. 

But- I also don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill. She lives in another state and she has children. She's planning to move to another country in 5 years. My partner and I are local and see, and make time for eachother every week and we're very involved in eachother's life. 

Help me with this? I'm really vascilating between feeling betrayed and feeling like I shouldn't feel betrayed.After a few mths of thinking about how I feel about sharing my wife I've come to the realization I can't. So after I opened up to her about how I feel its been hell.  I pointed out that I already felt second to this man due to her only talking to him. How she wears all the stuff he gave her but nothing I have her.  How I'm still last to know their plans and now she uses everything I say or do against me. She has said those are my feelings and she don't have to care,  but I have to care about hers.  So now she has been saying little digs like she's not herself cause I won't let her,  or she now says sorry about anything.  She even took her stuff down of the office wall that he got her. But she still refuses to wear anything off mine and now says I won't let them be friends even though I said I'll respect their friendship abs hope they respect my feelings and boundaries  well that's wrong to her.  What's next she refuses counciling with me to maybe help me gain comfortAnd of course some days are cis/straight guys having tantrums to insist they are queer.


Today is some super misogynistic harem building day.So I have been dating this woman for about a year and a half now and have started seeing a couple of other people too (occasional play partners) + my long term relationship with an older man which has been going on for 10+ years now. 

The LTR is with someone who is married and the main poly relationship I’m in is with a woman who has another partner she has been seeing a lot of, in addition to this older man she started dating about 4-5 months ago. Now they have been seeing each other at least 1 to 2 times per week and while I’m getting used to the way she spends time with him - this weird thing has started to happen… if I see her the day after she is with him… or later the same day, I am always incredibly horny. I often spend time thinking about what they are doing with each other and get so turned on, I have to touch myself. I find i love  it as it drives me WILD to know he was enjoying her and almost using her for his pleasure. 

I have similar kinks but 
I feel this isn’t the healthiest way to approach what’s going on with us.

Any advice?About 2 months ago I began dating someone I met on Facebook dating. For anonymity's sake, will refer to her as Sarah. It didn't take long for us to realize that we both wanted to become each other's primary partner. We spent almost 2 weeks together over the holidays, and it was absolutely blissful.

Unfortunately, since New Year's it has become increasingly difficult for us to see each other. In July of last year, Sarah left her abusive husband and moved from Hawaii back to Pennsylvania. She had difficulty finding work at first, and had to move in with her soon-to-be ex-husband's (STBXH) parents. Her ex finally sold their marital home in hawaii, and her child support is about to kick in, so she should be within her own place by April. Her STBXH he's coming in from Hawaii for a month in march, and Sarah will be spending most of that time at my house. I have no concerns that there's any funny business going on, as her STBXH is thousands of miles away in Hawaii right now.

She's a very ambitious woman, which is something I find attractive. Recently she took a second job, and let me know that we wouldn't be able to see each other as often until her financial situation was more secure. I told her that was absolutely fine, and even offered to cover her gas to come see me. Obviously I can't see her at her STBXH's parents house, and she has to drive 45 minutes to my apartment.

Around the time we had the conversation mentioned in the previous paragraph, I asked if we could speak with each other on the phone at least every other day, and she agreed it was a good idea so that we didn't lose touch. I also asked if we would still be able to see each other at least once or twice a month, and that seemed to be amenable to her as well. 

I have not seen her for 3 weeks, and she just canceled our plans for Valentine's Day weekend. She often takes up to 36 hours to respond to text messages, especially when she worries her response is something I won't want to hear. I want to be clear that I've never done anything to make her feel guilty, or berated her for having to cancel plans. We've only spoken two or three times on the phone in those 3 weeks as well.

I'd like to be able to work through this temporary time and continue seeing each other, so I've written up the following message. What are your thoughts?

&nbsp;

###UPDATE:

I ended up sending the following instead:


>I think I've been so focused on what I want, i haven't thought enough about what you want and need.
>
>If it were totally up to you, what would you like to do until we can see each other more often?
>
>I just don't want you to feel like you're being pressured to be part of a relationship in which you can't discuss your own needs and wants. I don't want you to fear being honest because you're worried about how I'll react. 🖤

&nbsp;

###Original message I was going to send:

>I know that what you're dealing with right now is a lot, and you don't have much free time. It doesn't help that we don't live close to each other, and I can't see you at his parents. I understand that the current situation is temporary, and that we're not always going to be fighting to see each other. None of these things are your fault, and I don't want you to feel like that's what I believe.
>
>You make me happy and I would like to continue seeing each other. I feel like we can talk about things and work them out, even when we disagree. I feel comfortable having you around Nathan, and we have similar parenting styles. I enjoyed spending an extended amount of time with you over the holidays, and don't see myself getting bored in a relationship with you. Bottom line: when I think about a future with you, I don't feel compelled to do better.
>
>Until we are able to see each other a little more often, I really only need two things. I would like to be able to talk on the phone at least 2-3 times a week. If you can't talk for more than a few minutes, that's absolutely fine. I realize that it's a small thing, but it shows me that you're willing to consciously set aside time for me. Second, I would like to be able to see each other in person at least 1-2 times a month. When I can't see someone as often as I'd like to, I push forward by looking towards the times we will be able to see each other. Knowing that you will fight to see me once or twice a month now, also gives me confidence that we will eventually be able to see each other more often.
>
>I hope you receive this message in the spirit I'm offering it. I don't want you to feel as if I am holding you responsible for things out of your control. Setting clear expectations will help both of us feel more confident, and won't leave either of wondering what the other is actually thinking. I just want to keep the lines of communication open 🥰😘."Hello,    My wife's gf is in a f/f marriage.   They have been working together for 6 yrs or so.  And about 7-8 months ago they wanted to start having sex and I said they could.  I have not been with or have any other partner.  I have known my meta for a long time though only threw my wife.  I've always found her as a great woman.   Last week the gf said she wanted to have a threesome on wed.  (we had all been talking about it off and on for a while)  So a couple of nights ago we had a threesome.  It was fantastic, amazing, definitely in the top 3 best sexual experiences of my life. 

Other than me not being able to get it up on the second go-around everything was so good.  I spent the next day with my heads in the clouds, and unable to concentrate.  All I could think about was the three of us.  Now I keep thinking of my meta and am starting to get jealous of my wife because she gets to see her every day at work, and they have sex at work, and text all the time.  And I feel like I want to be a part of that, but my wife has made it clear in not so many words that this is her thing, not hers and my thing.  

They've talked about doing it again, but I'm worried that this is just going to make it worse, but it was so good, and feel that we only scratched the surface of the pleasures we could give and receive.  I'm a bit confused.  Any advice the community has would be great.  There is no way I'm the first that this has happened to. 

Also,  on the ed problem, My wife was shocked when I said I wanted to get a blue pill for the next time.  But I"ve got other questions on that so maybe I"ll post over in r/sex on that if this isn't the right place.

Thanks, Reddit.I’m wondering if one spouse in a couple who have opened up their marriage can set a rule of, essentially “no falling in love”. 

Long story short- I am married and my husband and I are ENM. I met and began dating a man who was also in the same situation with his wife. I understand that when a partner does catch feelings, it can be difficult- and he and I definitely did. From the onset, I was communicating with his wife, asking if she was okay/how she felt, because I never wanted her to feel threatened or uncomfortable. I was assured by both of them that everything was a-okay. I was invited to their home, I spent time with her one-on-one and the three of us were also intimate together several times.
When he told her that he loved me, she said she was happy for us. It was never communicated to me that she was uneasy. After four months, she did get really upset during an evening when the three of us were out, despite the fact I made a very deliberate effort that night to not have any interaction with him that would exclude her, including going off by myself and giving them time alone.
Afterwards, he told me that her “breakdown” was not caused by anything I did, and that it was him not being as attentive to her at home as she would have liked. I will also add that they live about an hour and a half away from me, so we did not see each other on a regular basis, and we did 90% of our talking on the phone when he was at work and not at home.
But I backed off just the same, making sure we weren’t talking or texting when he was at home and generally just trying to be invisible in their life together.
I spent two days with him a month later. 
Over the next two months things continued the same, and was given no reason to think anything was wrong. I was told she had gotten me a Christmas gift as well and the next time we did see each other was two months later. I was told she wanted me to come have lunch with them. I did, and she was perfectly pleasant and friendly.
I spent two days with him, and two days after that, he told me he couldn’t see or speak to me anymore, that she had said if he did, she would leave him. He also mentioned that they were still planning on dating, but she didn’t want him to have feelings for anyone.
This seems…wrong to me, for lack of a better word. We’re human, and we aren’t very good at controlling feelings that might arise for others.
I won’t go into the fact that I am heartbroken, devastated and angry that both of them lied to me about her true feelings. And then to have our relationship severed so cruelly after six months…frankly none of their actions/decisions make sense to me, but is having that rule unfair and likely a wonderful set-up for another one of their partners to end up hurt?I have recently found out that I want to be in polyamorous relationships. I have found somebody I really connect with, but I am struggling with the idea that we are not advancing "correctly". I have before only been in monogamous relationships, which has a more explanatory relationship escalator. What is your experience with this in poly relationships? How do your relationships naturally progress? How do you have these conversations with your partner?I've been poly for over 10 years and am seriously considering transitioning back to mono. Anyone here transitioned back?I'm going out with a partnered non monogamous man soon, and I was wondering how much is appropriate for me to inquire about his other partners on the first date. I'm unpartnered and non monogamous, too. My curiosity wants to know about his other partners and what that's like but I also worry about the conversation shifting to be about his partners and not about us/our potential connection. Should I just focus on the date itself and let him bring stuff up if he'd like?Not poly atm, just an ally(?) with a question.

I guess there’s this romantic notion that being poly means never having to say ‘no’ to love, but I also know that practically speaking saying no is just a part of life that we must deal with.

Thoughts?My partner and I are considering a move to upstate or western NY (NYC area is also an option, but we'd prefer somewhere less urban, and I'm not concerned about dating in NYC). I've spent some time in NYC/upstate, partner has not. And it's been about 20 years for me, so my knowledge is far from current.  


How easy do folks find it to date, make friends, and form connections in non-NYC New York? Are   
 there any particular areas that folks would recommend for or against? Partner and I are both nerdy and neurodivergent. I'm currently just looking at how many polyam/alternative relationship groups are on Meetup and what profiles look like on okcupid for various areas, but I'd love to hear from folks who live in or have lived in non-NYC NY as to how you found it.Hey! So I recently got into my first relationship with my boyfriend last month, and in addition to being my first ever relationship, it's also my first polyamorous relationship. So this is all very new to me.

He's meeting up with an old friend this weekend, and he's told me that he'd like to sleep with him. I'm ok with that, and I've given my consent for that, but part of me is worried that he'll lose interest in me as he sees other people. 

I don't really have any reason to think that at all, and I know it's just my insecurities showing, but I was just wondering if you guys would have any advice on how to deal with these feelings. I've already discussed this with him, and he's very understanding and helping a lot, but I'd like some outside help tooThis question isn't directly related to polyamory, it's more of a general relationship question. But 1) well, we ARE poly and have been for a long time 2) i feel like you guys are My People 3) i think that polyamorous people are more open to rethinking traditional relationships in general.

Prior to March 2020, I feel like my husband and I saw each other relatively little despite living together. I had a long commute every day, worked out of the house, left for the gym, etc. We'd have dinner together and go to bed exhausted together, and of course also have weekends. Then covid happened and both of our jobs went remote only. I bought home gym equipment and started working out at home instead. Now we see each other all day long, which is awesome and one of the nice things that has come out of this mess of a pandemic.

That said, i find myself having an increased interest in doing things alone or with friends. I'm even contemplating a 5-day solo trip, something I've never done. It's not a matter of wanting a break from my husband or feeling sick of him or anything! It's more that I'm alone much less, and I treasure alone time. I also don't see other people with the regularity that i did went i was commuting and working in an office, and it makes me more compelled to plan girls' nights or similar friend activities.

I'm curious if anyone else has felt a similar shift. None of this is to the exclusion of spending time with my husband. We recently went on a long trip together over the holidays and it was so great! But people always seem surprised that i don't make all of my plans with him. Obviously we've all embraced the idea that one person doesn't have to be everything to you, but i still feel weird about it and I'm curious if anyone can relate.Just curious how people feel about hearing about their metas, especially about sex/attractiveness? New to poly and finding myself (25f) uncomfortable hearing about a fwb's sex life but she recently clarified that she wants things to be casual and I'd definitely started developing feelings. I just feel like I'm secondary/a booty call to her. This might not be the case but she really sucks at communicating so that also might be a factor because I'm just unclear/insecure about how she feels about me, especially sexually. 

Do people experience it differently on a case-by-case basis? Another girl I'm seeing who I view as more of a casual relationship mentioned someone she was sleeping with and I had no problem with hearing all about it. She didn't give as much detail as the other girl or wasn't nearly as passionate about her, but still. 

I'm just struggling to understand if there's a reason behind these feelings/thoughts or it's just that when feelings aren't reciprocated it feels shitty and relationships like that don't work?

How do y'all handle hearing about your metas? Does it bother you or not?My (31f) boyfriend (25m) and I have been together for about 8 months. I come from a background of long term relationships that were mostly unhealthy and toxic and codependent. My boyfriend has been pretty much single for his entire adulthood with the exception of one 5-month relationship. Our connection is amazing. We have been thriving together and our communication is on point. We just work really well together. This is the first healthy relationship I’ve ever been in where there aren’t codependency issues (still navigating this on my side, he is almost hyper independent from being single for so long) so it’s been interesting finally being able to discover myself for the first time in a long time, even being in a relationship. I’ve never felt more safe with someone before. 

So last night, my boyfriend expressed to me that he’s been “missing” the fact that he used to have casual sexual encounters with other women. He went on to say that he’s not at all unhappy with our relationship or our sex life and that it’s just a thought that’s sprung up over the last few weeks. He wanted to be open with me about his feelings and I respect him for that. Unfortunately, this crushed me. I asked him if he was missing a certain person or had plans to go hook up with someone in particular and he assured me that wasn’t the case, that he was just curious if I would be okay with that.

I told him that I’m not ready to make a decision right now and that it honestly kind of hurt me. I am a very understanding person and have a lot of patience in general, but it caught me so off guard and left me feeling insecure and unsure of myself. I know this is a reflection of my own issues as he went on to assure me that he’s in love with me and doesn’t want to lose what we have and that he’s not expecting me to make a decision right now. However the thought is looming over me and has been on the forefront of my mind all day. He’s totally okay with me potentially seeing other people but I’m not really one to hook up with people casually, I never really have except when I was much younger. 

I’m so worried that if I agree to it, that it will wreck my mental health and doom our relationship. I don’t know if I’m cut out for it. I told him that I want him to feel fulfilled and that if he truly wants to sleep with other people that I don’t know if I’d be okay with it, especially right now, and that I would feel horrible making him feel like I’m giving him some sort of ultimatum. 

I don’t really know where to go from here. In my eyes it feels like he’s already made a choice by basically telling me that eventually he will want to explore other people again. I just feel icky and sad and I need advice. I love what we have right now and I don’t want to ruin it. Help.Is it possible to have closed triad where each of the three individual members of the relationship feel respected, honored, and equally as important to the relationship? 

What, in your opinion would it take to make that a possibility?Hi all, just wanted to share a happy little solo poly story.

I've been solo poly for a few years now (I think this is the right term, I have partners I love, but they don't date each other. They do date other people, who I may or may not know)

Last Wednesday, I was hosting a social, which meant my two main partners and a play partner would all be in the same room at the same time. I'd spoken to them all about this, and one decided getting me in the middle of a group hug was the best idea ever. 

And he made it happen. I had all three of them surround me and hug me. I have never blushed so hard in my life. 

I think the blushing comes from the part of my brain that was brought up in a monogamous culture, and it was melting with everyone being together and happy. 

It still brings colour to my cheeks thinking about it now.I (M31) had a very long talk talk with my mom last night and she’s incredibly curious but also incredibly anxious. I’m married, soon to be separated for unrelated reasons (also a big part of the discussion last night), and we have a 3 year old son and she’s, of course worried about his well being. Are there any book recommendations out there to help her gain insight into polyamory? The discussion kept coming back to “it just sounds like a green flag to do whatever you want without commitments,” and I’m just not eloquent enough to provide a response.

My first thoughts are The Ethical Slut and Polysecure, but I’m looking for something more along the lines of a book meant for helping mono folks understand polyamory because someone they love is polyam.We use joyfriend for our relationships that are more than platonic friends. 

1. Phonetically, it’s proximity to boyfriend/girlfriend is clear but, semantically, it becomes its own unique and differentiated label and relationship type. 

2. Ethically, it’s non-binary/gender neutral so it’s universally equitable, appropriate, and inclusive. 

3. Semantically, It connects the relationship to a widely desired outcome, joy, rather than diminutive gender labels. 

Basically it all comes down to building a relationship upon whatever brings the consenting people joy!Hey all,

I've been in non-monogamous relationships for a while now, but I'd still say I'm a bit new at some aspects of this and I'd like to get prepared for difficulties before they pop up. Specifically what to do so existing relationships don't strain too much under the weight of new ones.

So I'm curious as to the diverse systems people put in place to try to mitigate the destructive potential of new relationship energy before it even happens.

Whether it's an explicit rule agreed upon in your polycule or individual relationships, a mode of thought you try to abide by individually, or even something as prosaic as a calcsheet or shared calendar, I'd be extremely grateful if you described what's worked for you and what hasn't.

Cheers

Edit: also, first time I've posted here, sorry if I did it wrongI'll try to keep it quick and simple here but it's poly, so... 

I joined a polycule, making me the 4th, back in June 2021. The cule has been a thing for 5 years. It consists of a married couple, and the wife's +1, who I am dating. My partner has been trying to bring in a 4th for the entire relationship duration. 

Now we have had our ups and downs, I very quickly moved in with them and integrated into their life and very large friend group that is also a LARP guild that the 3 lead. So it happened fast and hard and it was a lot of fun in the beginning. I really thought this was what I wanted. 

My partner is a character. They all are really, it's one of the reasons I love and care for them. However in the past few months our communication between each other has been awful. We were running into my meta not having enough time with my partner, neither of them communicating to me that they needed it more and when I would bring it up to try and solve the issue I was met with a lot of blame gaming in my direction about my jealousy and nothing would actually get solved or settled.

In addition, my meta can not handle hurting someone's feelings or making them uncomfortable because she gets violently angry with herself... so everyone just hides that their feelings are hurt to save dealing with the meltdown. 

Basically I have entered a very complex dynamic where the 3 have been comfortable with the way things function. To me it is not healthy. I have brought up my issues and concerns and am met with a lot of resistance for any growth or change. My partner seems to be living in this reality where I am just supposed to fit perfectly right in and be the "one" to close the polycule. 

I am at my wits end trying to communicate with my partners. I am trying so, so hard. We are kitchen table type poly but no one wants to sit down all 4 of us to talk because they don't have the spoons, or are uncomfortable and lack the awareness of root issues in their dynamic. I am about to see myself out. 

Any advice on how to end this gracefully and also maybe bring some awareness to them so they stop trying to make people fit into something that just won't work without big changes? No group communucation in kitchen table poly...... I just don't get itI promise this is not a typical failed 'triad' post, please hear me out.

I married Amy just over ten years ago, and we discussed our desires about ENM on our first date. Roughly 8 years ago an incredible relationship with a friend Victoria evolved very organically into a multi-year relationship between us all both as a team and individually. Unfortunately this dream team fell apart after a few years because Amy was struggling with communicating in a healthy manner occasionally when I was out of town for work and couldn't help facilitate conflict resolution, and Victoria was very hurt by this. Amy was struggling with pregnancy loss at the time and understably vulnerable, but her behavior did a lot of damage unfortunately. We were all heartbroken to be honest. But we did keep in touch, and it's always been very apparent that we still all care very much for each other. 

More than 4 years have passed since then, and about 5 months ago we started seeing Victoria again individually though we do often spend time together as well. Amy has made significant improvements over the last 4 years with communicating better, and conflict resolution. We had an amazing anniversary/birthday dinner last weekend at a newly opened Chop House, spent the holidays together, everything is going really well. 

However neither Amy or Victoria are great at being proactive about communication, even if they do so fairly well with a little guidance. Neither of them want to initiate a difficult albeit healthy discussion for fear of upsetting the other. In addition, it seems very important to Victoria that they establish a healthier relationship as Metamours before considering the relationship they previously had which is understandable given how hurt she felt not as a result of Amy's emotions during that time but the way Amy failed to navigate them and the resulting damage. They both still care for each other dearly, and recognize that learning to communicate better with each other is both needed and worth making a priority.

So I'm looking for any resources specifically about communication with a Metamour if at all possible. A tall order I know, but you all are so wonderful I knew this would be a good place to start. 

Thank you!I can’t be the only one. 

There’s always a slew of posts that read the exact same way. A mono person asking for advice when their partner wants to explore being poly. They have a habit of giving loads and loads of backstory as if their situation is unique in some way, but it almost always comes down to the fact that they aren’t interested in poly and should say no. The top comments reflect this sentiment.

Could we please get a megathread or a weekly thread or something for stuff like this? It’s way too common and the posts are never that varied, nuanced, interesting, or unique.

Edit: Another post fitting the above description was posted to this sub about 60 seconds after I posted this. But unbeknownst to me, linking to other posts *within this very same subreddit* breaks the rules? So the link was removed. But you can just sort by “new” at an given time and see what I mean.But it's all good, there is a pandemic going on and it's cold outside!!!I love these type of movies despite of the usual arc where characters have adventures with other people and go through a redemption arch to be with their soulmate. I mean, I always think if they were poly they wouldn't have much problem, there would be no conflict, and thus the comedy would have to be found in something else.

Then I go a level deeper and realize these are all actors sharing a romantic bond, that may be professional but it is physical and emotional nonetheless. Most of them got real families, and even monogamous relationships. But they make these movies possible because they include at least a little bit of polyamory in their life.

Then I see how real their love feels at the end of the movie, making me think they (as actors) do fall in love during the course of the production. And then, it hits me... This type of relationship is incredibly awesome. It's a mutual pact that has a specific date to end, where time is also limited to specific moments where you have to make the most of it. No wonder these movies get really emotional 🥲😢🥲

I'm not speaking here about every single movie out there, but there are incredible examples for this. Let's say Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, they always get back to do a new movie... And I absolutely love them as a couple.

I'd also love to see more explicit poly relations in romantic comedies in the near future. Do you know good movies that revolve around polyamory? Would really appreciate some references. Much love to y'all!1. Poly/kink/whatever is not a valid substitute for a personality

2. Neither are board games and/or larp. If you absolutely require these kinds of conceits in order to make spending time with other human beings bearable, then maybe it’s time for a step back. Maybe several. 

3. Poly is not a sexual orientation

4. Words like “frubble” and “polycule” make you sound like a horny Dr. Seuss character. Stop it. 

5. Relationship anarchy is a barely-disguised battle of who could care less

6. Insecurity is a normal response to being repeatedly emotionally dropped—it is not in itself a sign that you’ve got some growing to do

7. The disdain some people have towards unicorn hunters is often misdirected self-loathing for having essentially the same or worse long-term track record as they have 

8. A partner who tells you you’re fucking up your life by getting close to a different partner is probably not exaggerating

9. Trauma does not teach. If you learned a lesson, you were not traumatized. Calling every bad experience ‘trauma’ neuters a concept that is more important than your desire to promote mere upset into pitiable circumstance 

10. Love, like time and energy, is finite. Most poly people tend to have at least one-more relationship than they are able to handle, because they were handling the previous amount well enough and mistakenly thought more would be workable. Know when to stop. And stop sooner than that.I've been in the dating mood for about 4 months now, and I've been dating online, however I haven't met anyone that I felt was worth meeting in person. Part of that is because my primary and I have been separated for 8 months, and I've been the caretaker for our son. Trying to find childcare has been impossible...

My primary and I have been doing therapy for the last 6 months, and things are getting better between us, I've been staying at my mom's for the last 2 months. Anyways, she said to me, "Enough is enough, you two need to figure this out. I can't take care of you, and I'm too old to be taking care of a 2 year old." So I'm back together with my primary. 

I figure as long as we continue doing therapy, and I continue holding boundaries, things will continue to progress in a healthier manner. Things have been going well so far, and our son is so excited to have his dad around everyday.

But that's not the point of this rant. 

I am getting really horny...

I feel like I got to be really careful. 

I want to say to my primary, "You've had 8 months to work on you and take care of yourself and have time to do what you wanted, when you wanted. Now I'm going to do the same!"

But I'm aware that we just got back together, and that there's a lot that we need to focus on. 
But I feel that it's okay for me to have some me time as well...

It's been 4 years of devoting my life to him.

I'm focusing on my goals, my needs, and part of those needs is being polyamorous. We've had almost a year of therapy about it, and he's even dating online himself! It's an exciting stage for us.

I don't want to damper my sexual excitement.

And I want to make sure I don't f*** everything that moves 😅

Edit: thank you to the community who helped me understand that my hormones are raging because I'm excited about getting "adult time" not necessarily sex. It's been years since I've been able to get out of the house without the baby attached, and tonight I took myself on a date!Ok, I'm sort of new to this whole concept so idk if it is something you can choose or not. But I've been with my partner for 5 years (we are now married) and we have had a lot of problems over the years (emotional abuse, mistrust, etc) and we are currently seeking counseling for himself, myself, and marriage counseling.

However, in the entire span of our relationship I've always had sexual fantasies of others, sexual feelings towards my friends, crushes on my friends so on and so forth. I know to an extent this is normal but he sees this as a total threat to our relationship. As a child and teenager, I always loved the ideas of "partnerships" instead of marriages, concepts like sister wives, hippie "free love" and just being totally open, honest, and loving with a group of people and everyone being happy about it. 

So, as our relationship has gone on I've really realized that my ideal arrangement would be one partner I have for life, that we trust, love, and are always there for one another. But we also have seperate lives, can choose to be with or hangout with other ppl, have seperate bedrooms, and maybe even have a "clan" like a family, that we may or may not all be sexually involved with each other but we're all involved in some way, and just kind of live together. 

I'm reaching out bc I've been really battling this urge for a very long time... I feel wrong for wanting to openly express my love and im not sure if it's possible to choose or if this is just how I am. Any advice?I have some conflicting thoughts I'd like your opinion on. This is my first poly relationship. I'm \[F\] and my partner \[M\] have been together for a few months, and I'm feeling great about the relationship. I absolutely respect the fact he's married and care about him deeply. So when he proposed I meet his wife, I agreed - I felt like it's not a big deal to me to meet a new person, and that it was important to him that I did. Me and her recently met, without  him, and it went really well, on the surface - laughs, good talk, mutual motivation to get along I feel like.  We agreed to possibly hang out again, my partner was very happy about the outcome, awesome. 

However, she said a couple of things that gave me pause: one was that in meeting me, and prior to that meeting his former partner, her main priority was to make us feel comfortable, because she's aware of her status and her privilege. That made me uncomfortable somehow, and I don't know why. Then, both from him and her, separately, I understand that the end game is for all of us to hang out together, with her partner too. I don't feel comfortable with it either. My partner's previous girlfriend, he told me, did go on a double date as a first intro, felt uncomfortable, and refused to hang out with the wife again because she has had, so he said, issues with him being married and with the wife being a rival. I absolutely don't feel that way, and yet, the notion of continuing hanging out with her and eventually with everyone doesn't sit well with me. I don't understand why this needs to happen and the potential benefit for me (I do get that they might want to spend time together but also with their partners simultaneously, to enrich their trust and their bond...? I dunno). I'd rather respectfully text her once in a while, keep things nice, and just spend time with him. And I don't know how to go about it in order to not ruin my relationship, which I value a lot, and not to appear like a jealous hater. Maybe I'm missing some key poly insight here? Must we all follow the script they envision?Hi everyone! I'm happy and poly and in a really good place. My NP has a wonderful gf and since she has been ill with post covid complications we talked her into staying with us so we can pamper her a bit. So she is home a lot and I've spent a good amount of time with her. It's been fantastic!

So I'm definitely buying her a Valentines Day card. Anyone else buying their Meta a card too?day one my standards: 

•Sensitive
•Good Hair

Today: 

•Has Pulse
•Is Poly Experienced 


Thinking about this makes me chuckleNever have I been happier to see a buy 2 get one free in the greeting cards section lol
😆I (41F) am currently in the process of breaking up with my long-time nesting partner (47M), we have been polyamorous for 9.5 years.  I still feel like I am, at my core, a polyamorous person but have never gotten to explore this as a solo poly person.  I do currently have a wonderful long distance partner who I see every couple months; but finding genuine and kind poly folks where I live now (Utah) has been a challenge.  For you experienced solo poly people out there, what advice do you have for navigating as a solo poly person?I have been considering polyamory for some time and I have been wondering if its possible to only have multiple "secondaries" while not having a primary?Hey
This is not typical polyamory relationship, but I still would like to hear your advice and opinion. 

But please be gentle, don’t throw too big rocks on my head.

I’m married with 2 kids and for the last 7 years have been involved in a loving relationship with another man.

My husband is aware about this relationship, he had ups and downs with his approach regarding this.
(Ups - leaving candies in my car to give us something sweet when I go to the meeting 
Downs - not speaking to me…)
In the bottom line, currently my husband and I are in a good place in a way he deals with this.

On my lover side it’s not that simple, he’s wife is not open to this option, and yes, he’s cheating without her knowledge or permission.

To spice things up, I found out I’m pregnant, and this is definitely not my husbands child.
Having another child is a old dream for me, and my husband didn’t want to do it due to the situation.

From my side the ideal option is to keep the baby and grow him/her together with my husband (yes it is a long shoot to think he’ll approve, but there is a chance)

I don’t want to get a divorce, I love my husband and our family. We are good friends and a believe we can do it.

The lover from the other hand can’t live with the option of me raising his child without him. He suggested to get a divorce and try to make it together. 

Unfortunately, even though I love him very much, I don’t believe we’ll succeed in such relationship. Eventually he’ll hate me for breaking his family and giving him a child he never wanted. 

The last option is abortion, which makes me very sad :(

If you actually made it this far, this is amazing and I’d love to hear your opinion :)How do cohabitating poly people handle sexy time in their households especially when it’s a hinge based poly r/ship.

Asking this because my wife (f40) and I (m38) are welcoming her partner (m41) into our house to live with us permanently. They have been dating for 1.5 years now. 

Ground rules have been laid already about how we will go about our daily activities. 

In terms of sleeping arrangements, we are fortunate enough to live in a 2 bedroomed house, so she will be switching rooms every other night but all her stuff will stay in our room. 

My worry is not about jealousy but the awkwardness. Am a big introvert and I feel the first few months will be very awkward for me . PDA around the house, them being touchy-feely, hearing them at night have sex. I know this are all things that come with sharing a house with people who are in love and I don’t expect them to change for me or anything but how have people who’ve been in my shoes handled the awkwardness and will it ever not be awkward.Growing up I didn’t know polyamory was a thing, and the only mentions I heard of it were about polygamy in Mormonism which was spoken to me like it was frowned upon. 

There was one time when I liked another person while I was in a relationship and it gave me so much panic. It made me worry I was a cheater, like my dad, for having feelings for someone that wasn’t my partner at the time.

I’m in college now and when it happened again, I worked out my feelings and discovered this subreddit and so many other things about polyamory. I’m still dating the partner I was dating in that previous paragraph, and they support me wholeheartedly and it means the world to me. I don’t have a second partner (although I used to very recently, it didn’t work out and I couldn’t see a happy and healthy future with him) but it still makes me feel good to tell my partner all the good stories I see here and how happy it makes me feel when there’s a healthy story on this sub.

Seeing polyamorous representation, especially healthy, makes me ecstatic. Characters in video games I play, characters in media I watch and enjoy. It makes me proud I got to realize this about myself :)I don't know if I count as solo-polyam, but I am a solo person in the sense that I don't have a nesting or long-term anchor partner. I recently started dating two wonderful polyamorous people who are married and nesting with their spouses. Honestly, I've never felt as loved as I do now. I understand that there is an inherent hierarchy in the sense that my partners have responsibilities with their spouses that sometimes take priority, but in general, I don't feel relegated to a secondary status. I receive *a lot* of love and affection and my metamours don't have veto power over my relationships. My partners have done the poly work and are autonomous individuals who just happen to juggle multiple relationships.

But I still get a nagging feeling sometimes about my partners' married status. Which is weird because I *don't* want to get married. Like, ever! I never dreamed of a big lavish wedding as a kid. I've always been anxious about the idea of a wedding. I even joke that marriage is against my religion lol.

I also like having my own space. I would like to be in close proximity to my partners for ease of travel but I am a-ok with living by myself for the rest of my life. Which is fitting because it's unlikely my partners would be in a position to live with me.

Still, I find myself suddenly noticing wedding bands on people (I've never given two fucks about this until now). I find myself grieving about a married, nesting life I will never have. I'm sad that I never got the opportunity to marry my partners. Sometimes I feel envy towards my metamours because they met my partners before I did and therefore got to ride the escalator with them. Which sucks because I want to be friends with my metamours. I understand that there are other non-traditional escalator things we can do, but it still irks me that I can never legally marry my partners or be their legal next of kin :/

For people who have been in this position (either as the solo person or the married/nesting person), do you have any advice? Thanks in advance!I (F, 33) am in a relationship with a man (36). We love one another. We live apart and are content with that arrangement. He sleeps around a lot. Sexual variety is important to him and I respect that. We date differently which is okay. One thing I have noticed though is that his interest in me, physically, has gone down over time as the love grows. My interest in sex with him has not gone down. It is really hard to observe his energy surrounding a new potential hook-up at the same time that his energy about being with me isn't really there. I know that my physical needs aren't being met and I plan to deal with that and talk about it with him.

My question is to people who also value sexual variety or for people who have had relationships with similar types of people: if you are someone like my partner what would you want me to know about the lack of interest and do you have suggestions for how to help rebuild the physical connection from your experience? 
And to the people who have been in the "me" position, what is your advice? Is it something you think I will move past in time? Did the situation improve for any of you?I always see couples starting to be poly, but I don't really see just a single person getting advice and guidance. So as a single person who got in to poly 5 months ago, what do you suggest?Been solo poly for about 10 months, have a gf and a bf currently. I am happy with the individual relationships and feel I am receiving a lot of love. At the same time I find myself really missing having one socially acceptable/affirmed relationship where we would be a social unit, have that "default person" and I could be a wifey someday. 

My friends have met both my partners and been accepting and supportive even though poly is not familiar to them. My parents would lose their shit if they knew about any of it. The only poly people i know are the people I'm dating and maybe 1 other friend who I never see. I am finding it to be isolating in a way, and keep looking over my shoulder at the perks of monogamy being culturally validated.


Just looking for commiseration I guess.Any recommendations for resources on attachment theory that is poly and queer-friendly? I have already read a Polysecure, but wondering if there is anything else? I’m reading Attached which has some good academic info but needless to say extremely mono and heteronormative, also sexist (all the examples of anxious attachment style being women and avoidant, men). Any recommendations would be much appreciated. Thank youSo I 30m and my fiance 27f have opened things back up after putting things on pause while we moved into a new place so things would be less stressful. The end goal was always to open back up, but we got settled into a routine for the past 4ish months that was definitely a bit more monogamous. During that time we had discussed and agreed that when we did open back up, it would be slow and more geared towards fwbs, since she said she felt like I was enough, she just wanted options for stuff I wasn't into. ( very much daddy/service dom type, but hate inflicting pain, where as she's into it) 

Well now 2 weeks in she's got a new bf, and she's trying to force us to be friends(we got common interests just we are both introverts) she's constantly on the phone with him texting, even when I ask for quality time off our phones. I'm still not feeling like our apt is my safe space yet, and I'm not sleeping well, and she is constantly asking for him to spend the night. It's caused my anxiety to go through the roof, to the point that it caused a manic episode for a little over a week and I only slept about 20 hours total for the entire week. We argued non stop where I felt extremely out of control in general, not with violence or anything, just no control of anything in a big picture sense. I asked for a slow down, not a pause, and for us to see a poly friendly therapist so we could work on our communication. And was basically told that if that's what I wanted, it would come out of my time with her, and I would pay for all of it. Because she said I need to just go with the flow and let her enjoy this new relationship. And I'm not fighting the relationship. I genuinely really like him. We are super similar. But I'm finding it super jarring to have everything discussed before hand about what we wanted to the situation now, and between my anxiety and my hyperfocusing from my adhd, I'm just feeling extremely tired and worn out with it allhello friends,

this is my first post on here, i’ve been really impressed with the way this community cares for each other. and hoping i can get some advice.
i’ve been with my current partner for almost 3 years, and about a year ago we moved in with one another. at first things were great, we had been planning this move for over a year. and had talked about being hierarchal, us being primaries and building our life together. over the past few months things have been increasingly difficult and honestly completely exhausting. they have started to see a few other people but one person in particular who they fell for pretty fast. i was happy for them at first, but then it seemed like all of their energy went towards either themself/work/this new person. for context i have autism so it’s very difficult for me to meet and connect with new people. so i became very lonely during this time. i spent a lot of nights alone, something that was never talked about in our plans when we decided to move in with one another. long story short things kinda blew up and i’m currently staying with a friend and we’re “taking space” we talked a few days ago and the summery of it is that they don’t want a primary relationship anymore, or maybe they do someday… but it’s very difficult to do with me. i’m blind sighted by this switch in relationship wants/needs that suddenly changed when we moved in together and they started seeing this new person. i feel unwanted, or i guess only wanted in a way that benefits them… i really love them. but obsessing over what has gone so wrong is taking a huge toll on my mental health. i could really use some advice/thoughts on this matter.
thank you all <3This might be long and jumbled, apologies.    


I've always ever been monogamous, with the exception of a very short period where I was in two, non romantic casual, sexual relationships where both parties understood it was casual.  I met my wife  nearly 7 years ago.  I was a bachelor, and she was a single mother with 3 children.  I wasn't looking, or necessarily ready for kids, but I fell for her fast and it's been an incredible ride.  She had A LOT of emotional damage, and I was her 'rock'(her words, which I'm proud of). As I'll mention later, trust was an issue for her and we experienced A LOT of triggers she has when it comes to relationships that she eventually discovered through therapy.  

&#x200B;

At the time we met, she never mentioned she was poly by nature, but maybe sometime in the first year she mentioned "I don't know that I could see myself just being with 1 person my entire life"...over the years I became stepfather to the older children and adoptive father to the youngest.  I feel like the family adopted me.  I love them.  My wife and I connected on so many levels, we have, from almost day one, felt at home with eachother.  She still tells me I'm her "person".  

&#x200B;

In the past two years she had encouraged me to try and find a girlfriend to invite to our bedroom, or engage with a couple(we tried some apps as we don't really have time to get out).  This was to be done together, and we generally did.  At the same time she started to engage in trauma therapy for herself.  Over the year, we were ghosted a lot, she got jealous a few times when I had matched with people(who never responded to any messages), and eventually she fell out of interest with the search.  Later on, her trauma therapy helped her heal, and she got her in touch with her submissive side sp we explored a dom/sub relationship in the bedroom.  We made fetlife profiles, but didn't really engage the community at the time.  

&#x200B;

Time goes by, we didn't update things, and suddenly, she shows interest in the apps.  She tells me she trusts me more than anyone she's ever known, that I'm her home, and that the stability, consistency and love in our relationship along with the healing her therapy gave her made her realize she wasn't being true to herself in a purely monogamous relationship.

&#x200B;

So, at first, I was hurt, LOTS of emotions exploded in my head all at once.  Fear, rejection, insecurity.  I was already feeling insecure because our social circle is incredibly small, and we almost never get a chance to see the few friends we have due to commitments with the kids(this has been causing some insecurity/feelings of isolation lately for me).  So many times I gave up social invitations both on my own, and together, and now, the person I have the closest human connection with wants to explore connections with others.  Me, being me, I immediately wonder how this doesn't impact the already minimal intimate time we get together.  She tells me I could meet someone on my own too, which, sure, I could, but that would mean losing time with her, or the family, or maybe giving up sleep.  


I'm just a bit lost, as far as perspective goes.  I love my wife and my family.  I don't want to lose them, but I'm in an uncomfortable place.  Initially we were trying to match with couples online to at least share in the experience, because for me, that's a nice introduction to things, but she's already texting with someone she finds interesting.  Last night, she was doing it on the couch..I was intentionally not touching my phone so I could be present for the little time we get together in the evening, and she was texting someone.  Maybe I'm being too sensitive?  The last few nights, my insecurities have been brought up, she reassures me, I feel reassured at the time, but still, nagging emotions.  To her, she's been patient and is ready to explore, to me, she only just really came out as truly poly 5 days ago.  I'm still trying to understand my place.

&#x200B;

This guy she is texting teaches a class she's interested in, and she told him she'd go...which is frustrating because she doesn't even prioritize doing things with me outside the house...so I said "i'd love to do that with you", and she seemed excited to know that, so now I'm going.  I'm going to be introduced to the community there(we live in a very rural town)...I'm just torn.  We have relationships with friends that we almost never nurture, and we're driving half a state away to make new ones? I don't even know if I should be meeting someone she might want to have a solo relationship with someday(is it better they stay nameless and faceless?).. just very confused.  


A fear of mine is that this will only make me feel more alone and isolated when I know she's seeing or connecting with other people, and the only connection I can really fit in is with coworkers or with the kids in our free time.  The idea of trying to squeeze in a second emotional relationship, to me, is just added stress.  So, I may be projecting, but it just seems like if she's expending emotional energy on someone, I am going to see even less intimate(not necessarily sexual, but time for just the two of us) time with my wife than I already do...

&#x200B;

So, community, I'm curious about your perspective on this situation.  A monogamous partner(who is open to explore, but alas, I'm a standard cis-het dude) and a polyamorous partner ready to go.  

What can I do to help educate myself and maybe get a better grip on my emotions as it relates to poly partners?  

Am I being unrealistic to expect that when we have time together, it shouldn't be spent texting other people?

Is it unreasonable to expect some compromise, at least at first?

We are trying to establish some counseling, but have only had an intake appointment so far. Hopefully we can have our first appointment next week, but holy shit $$$$.

&#x200B;

Apologies for the length, and I am sure I could have told it more compelling in a more concise way, but I'm tired.  Thank you for any support!

Edit- just want to add, the texting, while possibly jumping the gun given my discomfort, isn't sexual. I imagine the guy probably does have that interest, but they have just been discussing careers, as he is younger and is getting into something my wife studied.

Edit- thank you for all the responses..I want to engage and reply to everyone, but I won't be able to right away. I want to say that she sees the turmoil and confusion in me but yes, I need to make it clear that I'm not comfortable and I haven't exactly consented to this. We need to at least go through the counseling process(recommendations are welcome!! I'm on the east coast but any online therapist that can work with this situation would be welcome! ) before any more poly steps are taken.

Edit- she does also have a more flexible schedule than I do..I work 5 days a week, she works 3. She has time outside us and the family if I were ultimately comfortable to explore and she had assured me it would not interfere with us or family life.  I'm not exactly optimistic that that's completely possible because not everyone she meets would have her schedule.. still, thought I'd mention it.

edit- I just want to say you all are incredibly supportive, even the posts that suggest I leave, as you're coming from a place of concern for my personal situation.  This is a fantastic community!I know the tittle is a bit odd but I couldn’t think of a way to phrase it. My wife and I are opening our relationship. We are starting slowly and have had several experience with others women in group sex. I am male and my wife is female. 3 ways led is to discover things about us that lead us to polyamory. 
My wife is bisexual in the purest term. I don’t mean that in a slur or anything or to say people aren’t “pure bisexuals” I myself had to discover my problems with being bi sexual. I learned I am not emotionally attracted to men but sexually I am. I struggled with this until I learned through research and into myself and the culture.

What I am sealing advice on though is my wife dating other women and my insecurities. My wife is slowly working on herself with dealing with trauma from her past and how she views attachments. Polysecure truly opened our eyes to the different ways we felt due to our past. Without getting into her trauma because it’s not my story to tell she is not ready for me to date other women yet. I respect her boundaries completely and feel good about where we are at.
The boundaries right now are that I am allowed to make new female friends and build relationships with them without her. This is a big step for her, she has a lot of anxiety about other women. They don’t come from a place of control but trauma. She is comfortable with me having sexual and emotional relationships with other women when she is involved. We had the start of a triad with a threesome partner but it didn’t work out.
She is working on her fears and anxiety and slowly expanding boundaries for me. I on the other hand have given her open freedom with women as long as her medas are willing to have basic communication with me. Friendship is not required but prefer(we are most comfortable with dinner table poly or potentially triad) and honesty about progression. This for us is saying things like hey things are getting more sexual or saying they have had sex with the partner. But not sharing nudes or details about the experience or partner.
These are our boundaries and I am comfortable with them but I would like to know or be aware of things to prepare for. I am envious or the nre and I have a relationship with that gives me some of that energy. I find myself wanting the new relationships and exploring. We have boundaries of ways for me to ask that I not be told but would like advice if there are other things that may surprise me about seeing my nesting partner date. I am not looking for advice on or thoughts about our boundaries or what “seems unfair.”I'm looking at going on a date with an existing couple of fellow women as a single woman myself.. am i expected to like them equally? To give them equal attention?

Do i have to worry as long as I'm honest? Or is it going to be an emotional minefield stepping into something like this? I'm totally inexperienced in polyam btwmy bf and gf are literally the only reason why i havent imploded the sweet little gestures of helping me eat and motivating to get me out of bed makes my heart so full

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/skq0x7)Last year I was on antidepressants that destroyed my sex drive, and my anchor partner and I pretty much stopped having sex all together because my body just wouldn't respond at all and my brain couldn't experience sexual pleasure. 

I'm now on new meds and slowly recovering my sex drive. We've had sex maybe 3 times since, and she's expressed interest in increasing sexual intimacy. She says she is struggling to reframe me as a sexual person again after me being functionally asexual. Which... I sort of understand. But we've been making slow progress. 

At the same time she has 3 new long distance partners that she flirts with constantly. They're in NRE and she kept starting to talk dirty with them when I was in the room till I told her I couldn't handle that and she should wait till I leave. 

Last night we got high and she kept forgetting and starting to talk sexually with them, but when she noticed she'd apologise. Then towards the end of the night I tried to initiate sex with her (we'd made out earlier in the night so it wasn't out of the blue) and she fell asleep instead. It really hurt my feelings. 

I'm usually understanding & able to cope with sexual rejection quite well bc I understand sometimes people aren't in the mood. I accepted what she said and fell asleep next to her and didn't push the issue at all.  But it seems like she's just overtaken by the interest in NRE shiny sexy interesting people to the point where I'm not a focus. 

I understand that I'm not entitled to sexual attention from anyone else, but I'm wondering how I can express that my feelings are hurt without her feeling obligated or pressured to have sex with me. 

Thanks for reading.My partner and I have been together for 2 years. We started dating while I was still married to my ex, but I was his first non-monogamous relationship. Then the pandemic happened, my marriage ended, and we somehow wound up in a forced monogamous situation for a few months since I wasn't seeing anyone else at the time and nor was he (and, you know, pandemic germs). The intention all along was to open things up as the world opened up, and so in August, he started dating new people and I restarted seeing someone I had been seeing for years.

Throughout our talks before opening up, we both agreed that the ideal scenario would be something closer to kitchen table rather than parallel. I want all of my people to have the opportunity to love my other people. That's really important to me. He agrees that this is a huge perk of polyamorous relationships.

My partner started dating an ex of his in August. His first love. She's recently divorced and while polyamory wasn't something she knew anything about, she had many guys she was seeing and they all knew about each other. She was uncomfortable with my existence and in the beginning, requested that he didn't mention me. He eventually wasn't okay with that and asked her to be more accepting. This is getting better, but I don't suspect she will ever want to meet me. And at this point, I just don't feel great about meeting her either. 

As my partner and meta's relationship becomes more substantial and serious, it's becoming clear that this will remain a parallel situation indefinitely. It surprised me how gutted I feel about being defaulted into this kind of dynamic. It's not what I wanted, but this part isn't up to me and I don't get to choose how others' relationships work. Furthermore, as my partner transitions to ENM life, he doesn't seem super excited to get to know my other partner just yet (though they've met a few times). He does, however, say that he would ideally prefer a less parallel dynamic and is struggling himself with his new partner's boundary, but is unwilling to consider breaking up such a meaningful relationship over that. And I agree with this. 


So that's the background. My question is: what can I do to adapt to this new reality?  I feel very resentful towards my meta to begin with from the way everything started (that I'm working on), and this doesn't help. But more importantly, the idea of having my loved ones and their loved ones in a somewhat cohesive network of people was a huge part of who I've been as a polyamorous person in the past, and now it's no longer an option with the relationships I currently have and want to keep, and I don't have time or energy for more. I don't want to feel this resentment, so I need to find ways to adapt.

How would you adapt if you were in my situation? What do you think I could to do to help fill the bucket of what might be missing in my life that was once filled by KTP? I'm looking for ideas and inspiration.My partner and I recently got into a poly relationship. My partner has been in poly relationships before, but I never have. They’ve been transparent with me about being poly since before we even dated. I honestly wasn’t very open to it the beginning, which they were fine with, and we stayed monogamous. We’ve been dating for almost a year now, and recently we met a girl that we’ve now started dating after having a discussion about it. I’m fine with it, she’s fun, I like her. It is long distance though, and I can’t even imagine what it would be like if we weren’t long distance. She’s going to be visiting for my partner’s birthday in a month, too.

I don’t have a problem with our relationship as it is right now, but sometimes I find myself feeling extremely upset about the whole situation, and I can’t even figure out how to communicate why I feel this way. I don’t really know why I do. It’s not that I want us not to be poly, I do really like her, but I’m just struggling a lot right now. I’ve always found poly relationships interesting and loved the idea of being in one, but I know I struggle deeply with communicating and I have some jealousy issues that need to be checked. I have no experience in this sort of situation, so I don’t know what to do.

I also keep picturing the future if we continue to be open with our relationship. They’ve joked about us dating some of our other friends that live in our city and I really hate when they do that, because they know I’ve already had jealousy issues surrounding some of these peoples’ behavior at the start of our relationship (like, one of them tried to make out w my partner at a party when we first started dating, and i found out through someone else. i also know my partner was seeing this person before we began dating. i am not at all interested in her). I know it isn’t fair of me to dictate who my partner sees, but I would feel a lot more comfortable with them dating somebody I actually trust. I don’t know that they’d do that in the future. There are just so many things that scare me about opening up our relationship.

Anyway.. sorry for the WALL of text here but I don’t have many people in my life to talk to about this. Any advice would be really appreciated. Am I just not ready for this..?Tl;dr My bf and a mutual friend got together, theyre hanging out this weekend. This isnt a betrayal, im just butthurt that he didnt tell me even while i was trying to make plans with him. Friend is also into me (none of us are dating as a couple), thats super cool, im also sad that i dont get to spend more time with either of them, trying to be chill about it.

---

So first of all, my bf (24m) and i (23nb) dont live together, dont have kids, and (i thought) dont have any other serious partners at the moment. We also havent been able to see each other in months, first because of covid stuff (my family had it) and now because we've been busy.

I will admit, ive been struggling with my sexuality lately as well, and sex has always been a big part of our relationship. I'm not sure if im into men, and im not sure im into sex in general-- that means a lot of his bids for attention get turned down, cause its almost always a sexual thing. I have also been working up the nerve to ask out our mutual friend (23f), but I wanted to talk all my stuff out with my bf before getting into another relationship. If he wasnt comfortable with a very low-sex or asexual relationship, we had to figure that out-- still do, I guess. I tried to make plans this weekend, but we never got anything nailed down. 

Then (23f) sent me a video about how she wants to come out to her sister/roommate as not-straight, and poly, because she *started dating my bf last week,* but *also is into me* (!!!) and wants to explain it when/if we come over

To be clear, none of us have any intention of dating "as a couple." We haven't even hung out with just the three of us before. These are individual relationships between individuals that developed organically. 

The issue is, they're getting together this weekend, and my bf didnt say anything about it while i was trying to make plans-- i heard from the friend. My bf and i kind of operate under "dont ask dont tell," but a) thats only been for sexual relationships (aside from sexual health, thats always a "tell"), and this is one of my oldest, dearest friends. I thought when something important or exciting happened in our lives, we could talk about it, and this feels both important and exciting.

Im struggling a bit with jealousy over spending time together (with either of them), and im hurt that my bf didnt tell me about his plans, but im also thrilled that my crush likes me back and there are traces of compersion already for both of them. i think i just need to feel my feelings for now, and talk to him about it later-- at any rate i dont want to spoil their first weekend together by making it about me.

Idk if this is a vent or asking for advice-- if anyone wants to give advice thats fineI (32M) recently came out as poly, which sadly ended my marriage of 13 years. It's been nearly a year since and I'm just now trying to search for a partner or partners.

I've moved to a new state for work and I'm living alone, I have a few friends in the area, but the COVID restrictions are still pretty prohibitive. I'm also looking into the kink scene, but most places have pretty strict rules regarding single males joining and it just feels disheartening. 

How should I start when I don't know anyone in any poly circles in the area?My husband and I are new to polyamory and although I have a therapist, I’ve read books and articles, and I’ve had big difficult talks with my partners and my family I still feel selfish. I’ve been with my long-distance GF for almost 7 months. We are so emotionally and mentally and physically compatible and loving them has only made me a better person and wife. So, my question is, what are other polyamorous peoples experience with feeling selfish. I just want to know I’m not alone and that time and work will help.I just wanted to share some happiness. My partner has been talking/seeing this  lovely woman for a while now. We originally had a "don't ask/dont tell" dynamic. That all changed in October when we went to a haunted house as a group, with another friend. Everyone was so nervous (except me because I don't think things through) because it was such a big change to our existing dynamic. And everything work out Spectacularly. Shes staying with me for a week while her new place gets ready, we go out all the time as a unit, and I get double cuddles sometimes. It's still early, but im so happy and suprised with how things are going.*Sorry, I was careless. Accidentally I posted this as a comment to another post when I meant to do it as an OP. Sorry for any confusion.*

We (F27 M27) and our partners (F34 M34) had a commitment ceremony on MLK Day. If all goes to plan, we will move in together in a couple of weeks. It is not a rash decision and we have discussed this for many hours.

Any TO DO or NOT TO DO suggestions for us?

Please, we are only interested in hearing from people who have actually gone through this themselves. What did you get and what did you miss?

Thank you😃

*EDIT in response to u/Emeraldead's recommendation*

My husband met our new M while he was working on an intensive school/work project. Over time I met him and his wife and we all clicked. This grew into the deepest type of heart to heart friendship I had every experienced in my life. It wasn't something we had sought but something that found us. Yes, we fantasized and my husband and I talked about it openly. 

Our partners had developed similar feelings for us we learned eventually. They are from a Native American heritage that had a long tradition (historical, not current) of family co-living. Finally, finally, finally we all broached the subject. That was a beautiful moment but I will save the details for another time.

We actually went on a retreat where we discussed many issues at length: relationships, decision-making, intimacy, disclosure to family and friends, how to handle "panic button" situations.  That included how to control dominance (especially male), arrogance, ego, anger and forgiveness. How to talk about talking.

From our friendship we all know a lot about each other's pasts but now I don't think there are ANY skeletons left in any closets. Luckily we are very compatible on religion and politics.

A lot of time went into talking about finances and both couples have invested funds into the living situation.  

We talked about equity because they are older and further along in their careers and education (although we are doing quite well). Even though we are becoming one family, we want to prevent co-dependence so after the housing investment each "family-ette" will maintain its own financial independence. 

There will definitely be children so we talked about cross-parenting.

The easiest conversation we had was about the vision for the future.  We all see this as a FOREVER relationship and set our first NO MATTER WHAT milestone for 20 years. We are meeting with a lawyer next weekend to do as much as possible (until our state formalizes poly marriages) legally to cement our relationship.

We still have not decided how to call each other.  I'm this other guy's wife? Partner? Friend? Roommate?

We think we have done a good job of planning and our decisions are set.  The TO DOs or NOT TO DOs we are requesting are the SMALL easy-to-overlook things that can make a big difference.In the FAQ for the sub, it says to make sure I am poly before yammering on about it.    
How do I do that? How do I know if I'm poly and not just lacking commitment? Or don't just want to sleep around?   
When I was in high school, one of my friends said I was like a kid in a candy store with the girls I liked. It never felt that way to me though, but back then I didn't even know about polyamory, I was raised Catholic.   
I'm in a relationship right now, but it just feels like... Not enough? That sounds negative but it doesn't feel like it's her fault.Edit: Speaking with her now. Better sooner than later.


Background: My wife (40,F) and I (41, M) have been together 14 years, married 12 and poly for 6 years. One kid, 11 years old. She's had 5 relationships during that time and I've had 3. During some of her relationships, especially at the start of them, she had a tendency to go overboard on NRE, filling up all her time with the new partner and leaving none for me, and only communicating basic necessities (grocery lists, I'll be home late, kid got detention). When it happened the first time we were very new and I assumed NRE was more important than it was and didn't say anything for weeks until I felt overwhelmed. Went to therapy, both couples and personal. Learned better communication. The next time it happened I spoke up after a few days, we talked and she did better after.

Situation: She reconnected with a friend about 4 months ago that she lost contact with at the start of COVID. They've been texting regularly and she told me a few weeks ago she has been developing feelings for this friend. I encourage her to pursue (he knows we're poly, and I've met him before) and she does. They set up their first date (which happened two days ago) and continue chatting/texting as normal. The afternoon/night before the date she goes basically silent on me again, only asking about dinner, and just becoming absorbed into her phone. I try to prod her out of it by reminding her it's her turn for some fan fiction we are writing together (we work on this pretty heavily, sending ideas or character conversations back and forth throughout the day, it's our huge shared passion and she usually bugs me to keep up with it if I go a day without responding/adding to it). She says she'll respond shortly and goes back to her phone. I wrap up the days chores and by then it's bedtime for me. I hop in bed and say good night, we tell each other I love you and then she goes back to the phone. I go to sleep. She goes on her date the next day, all went well, she had fun, she checks in with me when she gets home, but still absorbed into the phone, talking or texting with her new partner. It's been like this for three days now. At this point I'm curious how long it will go. A week? Two? Do I say something now or wait to see if she really has changed?

Not sure what other information is needed, ask and I'll answer.My wife and I (m58 f50) decided to try out poly starting with the idea of an open marriage. She has found a few young cubs to play with but nothing serious. However, I found someone around our age, settled in life, has her own career, and knows what she wants.  
Now wife wants poly only for her benefit.  I am wondering if she really wanted this to begin with or to simply find a boy toy? Thoughts?So I'm currently in a relationship with my fiancee (8 years now) but I'm having serious feelings for a mutual friend of ours. My fiancee knows and she's said in the past she's open to the idea of a poly relationship, and when thinking of people we even brought up this friend specifically. But the three of us went to the farmers market last weekend and she basically opened up to us about some serious personal shit she's been going through, and it struck me because she said that we were the only people who she knows for sure are genuine when we're being kind, so I started to get emotional too. Basically stuff about how I haven't had a good friend in a long time and I felt honored that she trusted me enough to be open like that, and my fiancee was there holding both our hands, comforting us. But since then I've been freaking out, because I'm seriously interested in her, but I'm afraid that if I ask her, it'll ruin our friendship. Like, best case, she says yes and it works out. Second best, she says no but we're still friends. But my anxiety always blows the worst case out of proportion, that she'll say no and it'll ruin everything. I just don't know what to do, I need help.I’m a lesbian also. I’ve been in The nugget missed relationships most of my life. All of my partners with the exception of one, have slept with other people. I’ve never had an issue with this. I don’t really have that jealousy thing going on. And I’m not really sure where that comes from.  I would love to have more than 1 relationship.  I like to be intimate with my closest friends. I like to maintain my autonomy, and I don’t wanna mix my financial or living situation with anyone. But I’m deeply passionate and loving and still desire connection with people . Looking into the polyamorous community has been intimidating because I’m seeing a lot of people just wanting to have sex with more than 1 person.  I can’t seem to have sex with somebody that I’m not emotionally attached to so that’s not really an option for me. Is this how it normally is? I feel really alone in this.Hey all,

Long time lurker, first time poster and sorry it’s a super long post. I don’t really know where to even begin with it all or if this post is even allowed here. I (37f) am in a relationship (35m) and have been for the past almost 9 years. I guess I would say that I didn’t really know what poly was until a few years ago. I would say that I always have had some form of it. My NP and I opened our relationship up almost 3 years ago. We listened to podcasts and discussed what it would look like for us to have other partners. After all of that, we kind of went with it. Of course, there were learning curves along the way and it turned out when I had a partner, he wouldn’t, so there would be jealousy and vice versa. We are in a place now where we have both had the same partner now for over a year.

My struggle with it all is I am at a point in his and I’s relationship where I don’t really feel that he is trying anymore. I have talked to him about this but whenever I bring anything up, I feel that he feels that he needs to bring up everything that I do or don’t do that he doesn’t like. He tells me all the things that he sees wrong. Which fine, whatever, but it turns into him basically not even acknowledging what I said, or he picks out what he wants to talk about because the other stuff is basically right and he doesn’t have anything to “gaslight” me. I am always anxious or worried about bringing anything up to him because it always turns into him making me feel like shit and I end up regretting even talking about it.

For example, him being on his phone reading emails, being on Facebook, Reddit, Tik Tok etc. has always been a thing, even before we had other partners. I have asked him time and time again to be off his phone and spending time with the family. He really doesn’t do it, but when he goes to his girlfriend’s house, he is off his phone for hours at a time. I have told him this and he says well you aren’t on your phone when you are with your boyfriend. I said I’m not asking you to be on your phone with her, I’m asking you to give me the same type of respect not on your phone that you give to her. He can’t seem to grasp that that’s what I’m asking. I made a whole year of planned dates for him for Christmas a year ago and he stopped opening them in September because there were times it was hard to get away with my work schedule and kids, so he basically stopped trying. Then he said that was my gift to him and I was supposed to be the one to pick the date for them as well, I guess. Turns out 2 of the dates that I had planned for he has done with his girlfriend, which kind of left me feeling some type of way. He constantly sends pictures of what he’s doing or where he’s at when he is with her and I told him that I don’t want to see it. It’s just not me. He makes me have my location on on Snapchat all the time and is constantly watching what I’m doing (even though he says that he doesn’t even look at the map) although he always seems to know if I turn it off or makes a comment about it. I just feel like with my boyfriend I like to have some privacy and not feel like I’m being watching. It kind of feels controlling and stalkerish to me. We had an expectation that our location had to be on when we were meeting new people, but I don’t know why it needs to still be on when I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. I tell him what I need in our relationship, but it turns into what HE needs and he doesn’t seem to care what I need. I feel like it has turned into a complete roommate situation but at the same time, when there is no intimacy, I don’t even want to be in his sight. It has turned into me having a lot of resentments towards him, and each passing day seems to get worse. I try to talk to him and have a conversation about our day, but I feel it is basically pulling teeth.

Has anyone else experienced their nesting partner seeming to put in more effort into their other relationship than their own at home? My boyfriend and I are in a LDR and he travels for his work too. We only get to see each other once a month or every other week, depending on his schedule. He makes me feel more loved and appreciated than someone that lives in the same house as me. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how you went about solving it. We have discussed therapy. But I don’t think he cares to go. I’ve tried the app relish to try to work on stuff that way, but he said he didn’t like it and didn’t really do the work for it although he’s always on his phone. Any suggestions would be helpful or insightful words. Sorry for the SUPER long post.

TL;DR Nesting partner gives more attention to his girlfriend and wondering how others have overcome this, if they have?My wife (nesting partner) and girlfriend are in a group chat with me, and I like to send just a single random kiss emoji to them. I say it's efficient, and I like to live dangerously...My partner and I decided to date people together. We serendipitously met this amazing person through our friend and we hung out last night and things got steamy. This was my first time doing anything like this and I loved it except some moments of jealousy. We all kept describing it as an MDMA high. 

When we got back home I immediately felt overwhelmed and somewhat sad. I didn’t regret anything at all but I found myself wanting to cling more onto my partner. This morning I just feel sad. I ended up crying in the park. Is this normal? Does it get better with time? Also, how do you deal with jealousy during threesomes?I am a young (Highschool) possibly polyamorus person and i thought it would be smart to ask this community of their opinion on boundaries and how I should determine is i actually am polyamorus or I am just interested in a lot of attention- thank you in advance!My partner is: 
Aromantic / Pan-Sexual, 
and Hyper-Sexual in terms of his drive and needs.  

I am Pan-Romantic / Demi-Sexual with a very low Sex Drive to the point that it rarely ever has any interest to me.  My needs are more so for companionship, romance, and attention than sexual.  

We are much closer than best friends.  We are engaged.
I work and he can’t do to disabilities.
We both truly love each other.
We both feel we are better suited to Polyamory instead of Monogamy.
We both are trying but struggling to fill each other’s needs.  I mean sure our finances are ok but I worry he needs more sex than I can give him, and he worries I need more companionship, attention, and romance than he can give me.

He is also annoyingly subservient to me and I have to make all our important choices.  He is older than me and wiser in many ways.  I often to to him about life advice.

In contrast some times I have immense issues comprehending social skills while my intellect is not low I just don’t get people easily.  I am told I can come off as blunt or rude when all I am doing is matter of factly stating an opinion, thought, or idea.  I try as hard as I can to treat all people with immense respect and kindness, so I hate when my actions are perceived as rudeness when all I try to do is be truthful.

I want children he doesn’t care if we have kids or not.  He says we could adopt.  I want biological kids.

I’m Genderfluid but Biologically Male, therefore I want our potential person if we can find one to be a woman who if she doesn’t click with him is at least ok with an Open Cohabitation of all involved.

We are exploring Polyamory but have never been in a Polyamorous relationship before we just feel it’s what we would both want.

Please share your thoughts and advice.
Peace be with you.Hi All. In retrospect, what were the signs that your partner was falling out of love with you and didn't know it themselves or they just didn't want to tell you to protect you?So my boyfriend, girlfriend and I got tickets to a Star Wars event in Disneyland on may the 4th, and we want to create some custom t shirts and I need help with some creative ideas that include some sort of poly theme. He’s “daddy” in our relationship and then there’s me and our girlfriend.People gets so weirded out about poly likes it cheating or dumb shit. My girlfriend and I think it’s cool and want to try it especially since we’re young and we want to try things out.I'm (33m) relatively new to the world of polyamory. Early in the pandemic, my wife came out to me as Bi. A part of me sorta always suspected there was more fluidity in her sexuality and so instead of being shocked/surprised/anxious about her news, I was happy/proud/supportive. One of the things I did was started to do more research and learn about both bisexuality and non-heteronormative sexual identities. In my learning, I came across a definition for polyamory and it stuck with me. In short, through meditation, therapy, a lot of conversations, and learning more about myself, I'm in a really good place with my sexuality and identifying as poly.

I have a really close friend living in another state. She's been supportive of my journey (knows that I am poly). The truth is, I've had feelings for her for quite some time and only in applying this new lens did I realize these feelings. My wife believes that this woman has always had some sort of romantic feelings for me, but I'm not so sure. For context, I'm kind of oblivious to people flirting with me and I also have very low self confidence and self esteem (working on that as part of my sexual journey). So it is hard for me to even imagine her having feelings for me in the first place. I've come to the decision however that I'd like to tell her about my feelings for her and see if she has any interest in an ENM long distance thing or what. (Wife is very supportive and understanding, so that's not what this is about).

Edit: my wife is ok with me exploring polyamory. We have created a good foundation of communication and honesty in my journey, and she's even starting to explore other partners herself.

Ideally, I'd like to tell her how I feel in person because I feel like that's the best way to go about it, allows for a deeper and more caring/intimate conversation. I am planning on visiting her this spring and staying with her and would like to tell her then.

However, I have been thinking about this idea and recently started to wonder if saving this information for an inperson share isn't the right way to go. For one, while I really don't think there would be any issues if she doesn't like me back like that, I really don't know that for sure. I would hate to potentially make for an awkward trip if that happened. I'm starting to wonder if being honest and upfront is a better way to go so that it sets the context up for my visit.

So, I'm looking for any advice. Am I putting too much stock in being romantic and telling her in person and I should just find a way to have a conversation with her before my visit? Or is the idea of doing it in person better bc it is intimate and allows for a better dialogue about it and that I should just take the risk?Throwaway account

But I've been thinking, am I in the wrong for thinking I don't want my partner to live with their other partner? Or at least as all 3 of us in the same house? I feel like as a primary I want that aspect but idk if that's wrong? As it currently stands my partners partner will be living with us next year because they're in an awkward situation living  wise but part of me doesn't want that to be full time but I'm worried my partner will want to have us all live together permanently which isn't something I think I want. 

I also begrudgingly agreed to let them live with us because their living situation is very similar to how mine was before I got my own place so I know what they're going through.

Idk, I feel like I being selfish.

Edit: spelling mistakeHello folks! Poly pan lady here with 6 years ENM experience but really one year actively Poly/dating. I have a nesting partner and we are both dating separately. 

My NP has been having great success in creating connections via online dating platforms and establishing relationships/love with some folks already (he’s a straight, Demi, cismale) and I feel like I am STRUGGLING. 

I have lined up several dates with folks and they keep bailing on me (even ones who asked me out to begin with). So it’s getting quite frustrating for me to want to continue trying. I feel like I’m pouring my energy out over and over, and not getting any return. All while doing my best to be excited for my partner and to embrace his success but feeling rather envious. I truly believe I am poly by orientation and I don’t have any problem with my NP finding loving, meaningful connections as he should be and I’m so happy for him and our polycule. 

Now, I have been doing a lot of work on myself in terms of understanding my trauma and attachment style over the past few years. Also connected to that, working on my self worth and confidence which has always been a struggle for me since I was a child (due to trauma).. so these constant cancelled dates are adding a new layer. 

My question is/are — how do you keep going when you hit roadblocks? I know I’ll find my people someday, but what do you do to cope? I’ve refocused on myself and my relationship with my NP, but this blasted Envy Monster keeps creeping up it’s ugly head. Do you take a break from the online platforms? Do you go on a crazy swiping binge!?

Would love to hear what other folks do, or perhaps, I’m just looking to see I’m not alone in this and open to new tools or ideas to consider. 

I’m tired of letting it get me down every time it happens and in my head, I can say “they aren’t worth my time if they can’t show up”, but I still feel down. Which isn’t bringing great energy into my relationship with my NP as it’s a very exciting time for him. And us really as we have expanded into a wonderful polycule. 

Thanks all!Hi. So I met this guy who is so extremely cute for class, an Anthropology class, and I have to do an assignment to show an American custom. I got assigned to try and show dating. Which is fine, so me and this very cute guy agreed to go on a date. However I have only been on two dates before, and either went well. So how do I not fuck this up. Plus me and this guy have already had sex and kissed. So there isn't many bases left to coverUnder mononormativity, stuff like no longer wanting to have sex with a partner, being less attracted to them or interested in kissing them, wanting to move out and live alone, is often seen as a problem or a relationship ender. 

I've recently seen folks in polyamory talk honestly about how in their LTRs sometimes they just don't feel that interested in sex with their partners anymore and that's OK. When I saw this I felt so relieved! I've been reading Esther Perel etc and tryna 'fix' this!

I'm wondering if my partner who I'm in a LTR with (5.5 years) is now more like a friend to me. We rarely have sex. I don't feel much romantic interest in them. I think they're gorgeous and I love them. I want to live alone. 

A big part of me is like...is this OK?! Is this allowed? Am I fucking them over? Because they have romantic feelings towards me and sexual desire to some extent. 

I don't want to end the relationship just because normative society's script says that now it's no longer worth pursuing. Because the script says this means things have 'fizzled out'. Because our relationship is still a beautiful thing in many ways. It just doesn't look like an idealised partnership (and is very different from my relationship with my other partner).

Has anyone had an experience like this?I’ve been in a long-term off/on relationship with my partner; we entered into a poly configuration about a year ago because he asked, and I didn’t want to lose him. He told me after I asked to be primary that he would practice solo poly. I wasn’t enthusiastic about it, but we live about 1.5 hours away from each other and knew his needs weren’t being met. 

I feel like polyamory will help me grow and open up opportunities to meet other romantic partners. We’ve been open at times, but primarily mono and lived together for seven years. We see each other once a week, typically weekend stays. We have opposite work schedules and different days off, so I stay at his house while he goes to work, but he doesn’t do the same for me when he visits. It’s reasonable that he likes to use one of his days off to recharge, but for example, today (a day he told me he’s taking for himself), he changed our commitment (online gaming) and is hanging with coworkers and a new partner - they all hang out 3-4 times a week. This is after last week that he wanted to prioritize me more. He’s been late or has asked me to change commitments a few times now, which I’m trying my best to deal with. Alcohol centers all of his interactions with his friends.

I’m honestly too busy (school/work/performer) to invest in dating atm, but he’s had other partners while I haven’t. I’ve had some casual sex, but crave an emotional connection. Another reason is I recently gained some weight and feel insecure about meeting other people. (I’ve been working on my body image and practice yoga/meditation and workout regularly) I’m trying my best to sit in my discomfort with not having another partner, digesting book after podcast, and all the information and tools possible to learn about polyamory while he’s just basking in NRE.

I feel grief and loss from losing primary, sad that I feel like I put more effort into traveling to see him, and now have to be on the sideline while he spends time blossoming his new relationship. I’m mostly venting here, but what is one to do when the effort isn’t being matched? Especially since he told me his new partner is exactly like him (music, interests, conversation, style). 

We have a deep connection, but I’m not getting what I’d like; it feels silly to leave him because I feel less than, but it doesn’t resonate in my nervous system. Thoughts?Hey ya'll, my primary partner and I have been together for 3 years, in a sexual relationship. We are two guys. He recently moved to another part of the state, but before that, the sex between us had become few and far between. Today he said he wants to transition to a non sexual relationship. I want a sexual relationship with him, but understand that if we want different things, we cant be together. He wants to remain friends and in each others lives, and I dont know how to do that. We probably talked and texted several hours out of each day. He was my main support person. 

When a primary relationship ends and people want different things, how do you move forward? If we continued, he would feel fulfilled, and I wouldn't.I normally don't care for hearing people's 'how I met your mother' stories lol. But when it comes to polyamory, I eat that shit up like I haven't eaten for a week!

Likely because I'm polyamorous myself with *really strong* compersion haha. I just find those stories to be so beautiful. Just everything about polyamory makes me so happy (at least when it's ethical and done properly).

So what are your stories? Whether it's current relationships or past. Whether you started off monogamous and things changed, or if you were specifically looking for a polyamorous relationship. Was it a slow process? Fast? Was it spontaneous, or something you've felt deep within yourself for a while?

Just anything you'd like to share. I wanna hear you all gush about how it all started. I'd really appreciate it! I love hearing these stories!! Way better than any romance novel or film. 😪Just found out my father has cancer and it is aggressive. We don't know any more than that so we don't know how long he has and such. 
However my girlfriend has already agreed that she would travel with my husband and I down when he passes to help support both of us both of us. She doesn't date my husband  but they are still good friends. 
In this way we have that extra support of somebody who isn't directly involved to ensure that we're eating and isn't involved with all the strong emotion that you deal with with family and funerals. 
My husband was closer to my dad than his dad so that's why hes also losing a father and why he can't be necessarily the support that I need because he will be grieving just as hard as I am.
We will be paying for everything and are getting a home rental. My family doesn't know we're Poly and they're not going to find out at this time because they don't need to. All they beed to know is that this person came down there because she really cares about usand she wants to help thanks to help and she was capable.
 Even if for some reason between now and the time my father passes  my girlfriend and I break up the fact that she was still willing to do this it's a great blessing.
 Just wanted to share a small story of Poly within my life.  Thank you for reading.Edit: Thanks for the advice and your responses, much appreciated!

I’ve been into the whole poly thing for awhile, but there is something that I never knew how to word, what do I describe my current partner to a newer partner?

I have been with my current “girlfriend” on and off for years, but I don’t like using the word girlfriend as much, same with other women. 

Sometimes I use the word girlfriend, but the majority of the time I call everyone I have a romantic and sexual relationship with my “partner” or “friend” and even sometimes “lover”.

So the girlfriend I’ve been with the longest doesn’t live with me and often visits town quite often. I often meet new people, but I have a hard time explaining that I have a current partner and what to call that person. 

Also I should mention that I move around a lot and never really have to put myself in this situation, because I almost never have two partners in the same city/town. 

Am I in the right to use the word partner when talking to other partners? What is the best word you guys use to describe someone you currently see with someone else you are seeing?

I tried explaining as best as I could, but I could answer any questions if I have to, thanks.My wife and I have been poly since before we met. I've expressed a desire to have a kid at some point. For a long time she didn't know if she wanted to have kids or not. She's recently decided that she does want to have kids. But she doesn't want them with me. She wants them with her other partner.

As much as I wish everyone could live together, I don't think it's realistic. Watching her go through pregnancy and raising a child with someone who isn't me would be pretty difficult.

I'm feeling pretty lost at this point.What I miss about monogamy is the spontaneous meet ups you get to have with your one and only because they’re usually free. Now I’m doing polyam, there’s a lot of riches with it but I’m feeling like the natural growth with my partners are halted or feels clunky because we have to schedule time with each other and with our respective partners. I ideally would like to spend 2.5 days per week with a partner. I have two partners which eats up alot of time so I see them at least once a week sometimes every 1.5 weeks. We discussed this and we also want more time together but it’s been difficult to make it happen.

What do you do when you want more? I feel like if I never feel like I get enough attention and time with my partners our relationship will fade. :(for example wanting to have multiple partners all together but not have a partner go & talk to other people on their own of the opposite sex. 

Sorry if this doesnt make sense, im new to the scene & trying to figure out my feelings betterI'm looking for a MFF type relationship where more F could be added but I'm not interested in Ms and I'd I know this is a fantise but I'm willing to put in the work on my self and build the relationship to make it a reality and I'd don't know if it's bad to only want an exclusive relationship with 2 or more people of a US thing kinda really would like adviceIf so, how does that function for you and your partner? I am very new to this world and trying to figure out what feels possible.So, my partner, Jason (27M) and I Alex (28NB) have a lot of chemistry with another couple, Sabrina (28F) and Matt (26M). 

All four of us are bisexual. Both couples (myself and Jason, and Matt and Sabrina) have been together for at least seven years. The four of us have been friends for at least that much time as well, though a bit on and off due to life circumstances.

Jason, Matt, and I are definitely poly and interested in multiple relationships. Matt and I in particular are open to romantic relationships. Jason is interested too but he's someone who needs to experience things to really feel them out. Jason is definitely interested in multiple sexual partners, and he's also a very romantic and emotional person, so honestly I expect those will end up going hand in hand. Sabrina has talked about polyamory and it's clear she *wants* to be into it, but she also struggles with jealousy and wanting to feel special, like she is the only one for her partner (which reads to me like she is genuinely monogamous, but I can't tell how much of that's coming from her and how much of that is coming from being raised in a culture that really hits you over the head with it.) I am the only one who has had multiple partners at once before, but to be honest, I was just a kid and none of the relationships were that serious. I've been with Jason so long that I may as well be inexperienced with this too.

Nothing has happened between the four of us except for a lot of touching and a lot of flirting (both sexually and romantically, but the romantic flirting honestly has mostly been from myself and Matt, whereas the sexual flirting has come from everyone pretty equally.) There's definitely chemistry (emotional and sexual) between all of us in every direction (remember, we're all bi.)

The thing is, this all is happening very organically, and it's kind of beautiful. We're communicating pretty well, and consent is being asked for at every move. All four of us, at least as I know so far, are really good communicators and at least within the couples, communication has been healthy for many years. I am trying to bridge the gap by checking in with them each after we see each other and make sure it was a good experience, and so far it has been. But now all of this tension has built up, flirting has gotten much heavier and more sexual, and we're going to see each other in person again soon, and I'm worried that each of us may go in with wildly different expectations of what that's going to look like. My *hope* is that we'll all come in knowing what we're comfortable with and what we want, requests for consent will continue to happen, and no one will be uncomfortable. All of the flirting between us since we last saw them has been just that, flirting. There hasn't been any direct, serious discussion of what we are actually comfortable with or want, at least not since we last saw them in person when we talked candidly (though briefly) about our feelings on polyamory.

My question is, do I stop our inertia and ask everyone to have an honest, direct conversation, and risk ruining the "magic" of the flirtatious stage, or do I let it play out and just make sure that everything that happens when we see them in person is consensual and check in with everyone in the moment, trusting that it will go as smoothly as before?

I care so much about these people, and I'm particularly worried about Sabrina since I'm not sure exactly where she stands, and or whether she is even sure where she stands. Plus, I don't want the group to pull her in a direction she doesn't want to go by the shear power of there being three people who want to go there. I also really admire Sabrina and Matt as a couple and it would absolutely crush me if Jason and I came between them. I want to add to their relationship, not take anything from it.

TL;DR: How much should you discuss directly/beforehand with potential new partners (in this case, a couple + couple) versus just feeling things out?I’ve been a lurker on this sub for a while and finally gathered the courage to post something for insight as things are getting quite tough for me now. I apologize for the VERY long post. Thank you for being such a wonderful community and it's been enlightening reading everyone's experiences and I hope to be more active now that I'm posting. Now here's my situation!

\*\*Context:\*\*I have been dating my partner for quite a few months now and, from the beginning, his stances on polyamory never really stayed stable. He went from monogamish to non-hierarchical to hierarchical and now back to non-hierarchical. My partner told me he has avoidant tendencies and hyperfixates on the concept of polyamory to the point where he’ll research it, go to the internet for advice, make friends based on their polyamory stances, and listen to podcasts about it. I am dating two other partners and he is dating one other partner (but often goes on “first date binges” at his most emotionally-distant times of his cycle.) I really care about him but I’m having trouble because he often highlights how different we are and how high my needs are and sometimes compares me to his other partner who doesn’t ask much of him.

My partner has told me that he has a very hard time with emoting and expressing his emotions directly. He also told me that, when I give him positive feedback verbally (like “I’m very happy with how we’ve been spending time together” or “I love the way you look at me”), he feels anxious and uncomfortable. I’ve done my best to dial back the times I say things like this, but it’s hard because it’ll slip out when I’m at my happiest. My partner told me that his love language is acts of service and likes it when I do things for him, but has a hard time giving me my love language of words of affirmation. I know he’s trying and, to be fair, he’s much better about it than he used to be.

\*\*The issues:\*\*We have different communication styles. I am very direct and take time to sit down with my partner to talk without interruption when things are important to me. He prefers a more casual aside while doing something else when it comes to speaking about our issues so he doesn’t feel like he is in trouble or getting scolded. I can be very cold and clinical when expressing things that are vulnerable to me and I’m working on that. It’s been a struggle because he is not very good at multitasking but also has issues with keeping his attention on one topic. I’m not sure what communication style will work for him, me, and our relationship.

On the topic of his style of communication, I’ve been struggling because he doesn’t really have subtlety with sexuality and has an apathetic tone with everything else. He’ll say things in an overly hokey tone like, “Oh boy. It’s a shame you can’t stay tonight cuz you work!” vs. “I really wish you could stay over with me tonight.” As for initiating sex, he’ll usually just say, “So…sex?” or “I’m feeling horny. Do you want to have sex?” I understand communication is different for everyone and I can work with it sometimes, but it’s pretty much every time. I just want him to say, “You’re turning me on so much. I want you right now. Do you want to join me in the bedroom?” Just something with some seduction and nuance. Not just “...sex?” I’ve brought this up and he has told me that none of his other partners have complained about it and that he wouldn’t care if I asked him to engage in the same way. It’s very impersonal and, while I want to have sex with him, it takes me out of the passion and attraction when he asks like that. He’ll often have my meta over, tell me they had sex, and then say that he’s horny and wants more sex with me. I have told him I want a bit more time between my meta and me after he sees us. It’s a bit too much for me to know they’ve been together as recently as that morning and then he wants sex later that day. I know some poly folks are okay with it, but it doesn’t make me feel special and I don’t like it.

Now, I have read a lot of this subreddit’s perspective on boundaries being rooted in “insecurities”, but I would like all of you to hear me out on this next part before jumping to insecurity. The way my partner is handling polyamory has been a little rough. I feel like his relationship with his meta heavily affects us. He let me know that my meta has the same difficulty with poor verbal communication and that she shares the same hyperfixation on learning about polyamory as a construct as him. He said that my meta “doesn’t have any needs, boundaries, or jealousy” and that makes their relationship easier than ours. I’ve said some unpleasant things out of hurt about how I feel that she isn’t valuing him and isn’t invested if there’s no needs/wants/boundaries…and while I don’t think I said that to him in the most healthy way, I do feel that it’s true. My partner talks a lot about wanting to grow, but then talks so positively about my meta’s ability to “not ask for much.”

My meta has a boyfriend and has a non-hierarchical approach to polyamory which puts my partner in the exact same love space as her boyfriend. She seems to not ask much of my partner and does all the fun things, has compatible sex, and can talk with my partner for hours. Now, I won’t lie and say I’m devoid of jealousy…but I have made it clear that I don’t need my partner to see my meta less, change the frequency of communication with me, or see me more. I just need him to show me that he cares about me. This can come in the form of “I know we’re different, but I care about you and want to work on meeting you halfway.” The problem is that I care so much about my partner but he’s very quick to throw in the towel because, “Someone else can give \[me\] \[my\] needs better than \[he\] can.” I’ll bring up that I feel sad/vulnerable and need to talk and he says things like, “I was preparing for a breakup anyway.” or “I’ve known for a while that you might want to leave me.” I think these feelings are completely valid, but it feels…defeatist to me.

I understand that everyone approaches relationships differently. I think my partner has a lot of emotional work to be done and I don’t know if polyamory is helping him with that. He said that polyamory “accelerates” his insecurities so he can deal with them faster to hurt less people in the process. My partner has told me that he’s disappointed that I don’t research polyamory as much as he does. I tried to explain that it’s more important to me that I get to know HIM and I don’t particularly have an interest in how others conduct polyamorous relationships. He’s complained about not having a honeymoon phase with me, but I feel like it’s because his stances constantly change. I’ve had New Relationship Energy and honeymoon phases with both of my other partners, but with him…it seems that he spreads himself thin and it makes him lose empathy and focus.

I recently started dating another man with whom I have a bit of history. My partner told me, “I was actually pretty happy when you started dating (partner C) because it meant that you could be with someone who is more like you. I can’t give you what you need.” This hurt me because I don’t believe that polyamory is dating people to compensate for each partner’s weaknesses. I love the openness, trust, and honesty that polyamory brings. I enjoy my partners for their individual personalities and essences as people, not because “Partner C does what Partner A doesn’t want to.”  It's frustrating to me that, when I bring up any issues I want to talk about or doubts about our relationship, he says "I don't want to pretend to be what you need because I don't want to lead you on." I find it so hard that it feels that this sort of statement is a way for him to absolve himself of responsibility because I was "warned" and still chose to stay.

I sometimes feel like my partner views polyamory as a tool to better himself and not as a way to get close to someone else. I’ve told him, “I don’t want to be viewed as a tool for your self growth, I want you to look at me as a partner and as someone you want to be a part of your life.” and he told me that he doesn’t like the term “tool” and rather that he “utilizes” his friends and partners for what they can give him. I personally feel like this is not a great approach to dating and becoming intimate with people in the ways that polyamory necessitates.

So, I’m looking for thoughts and advice past “You’re not compatible. Dump him.” He and I have already talked about this and he reassures me that he cares about me, but sometimes flips about whether he wants to be with me because “\[he\] isn’t sure if he can give me what I want.” I’ve talked to all of my friends about my wants and needs and all of them have reassured me that I’m not clingy or inappropriately needy (they definitely call me out on my unhealthy behavior, so they’d let me know.) My partner is trying very hard and I can credit him for that. I used to be in his situation where I’d clearly want stability and love, but I would inadvertently push away. I care about him enough to want to be with him and help him work through this so we can be happy. I told him, “As long as you feel that you want to be with me, I want to be strong with you to help us grow together as friends and lovers.”

At the end of the day, I really care about my partner. We have similar goals with relationships (growing together, maybe having a family, etc.) We have similar sexual desires with exploring things like kinks, BDSM, and swinging (which we haven’t done because we aren’t secure as a couple yet). We don’t have the exact same love languages, hobbies, or careers, but I’d like to think that couples having differing interests is a great environment to learn more and to grow. I want to grow with him and I think he wants to grow with me too…but he has trouble because of trauma, how women have been with him in the past, and he has trouble understanding his own emotions and articulating them from a personal perspective as well as a cultural one. My other partners and I are completely comfortable with our boundaries and it seems that my approach is hard for him specifically because I’m so in-tune with communication and emotions.

I used to be in his position where I was emotionally avoidant and distant. One of my partners showed me, in the context of non-monogamy, that I don't need to be afraid of emotional connection and intimacy. It has opened a whole new world for me in which I want to grow and become close to my partners to share intimate parts of myself. I know my partner wants this too, but he's said he just doesn't know how to handle stability and that he's just "too different". I want to support him. I want to tell him he can do it. I want to tell him that it won't be easy, but WE can do it.

So this is what I want, r/polyamory. Can you please lend me your thoughts? What if the genders were reversed? Would that change anything? Thank you all in advance and I apologize for the novel. I wasn’t sure if I should just post once or multiple times. I opted to post one megapost to save time.

Tl;dr I’m having trouble with an emotionally-limited partner and want to know how to approach it so that we can grow together as a loving partnership.TL;DR: My GF has found a new girl, and I don't like how I'm being kept out the loop, or how the NRE we had feels like it's been stripped from me and given to this new girl. I guess I also feel threatened in my role in my GF and I's relationship. I am also new to poly relationships so any advice would help a lot. Thank you.

-------------------------------------

For context, my GF (24) first thought she was poly back when she was around 18 or 19. She became sure after she went through multiple relationships with varying levels of monogamy, with the most recent one being with a guy who was very monogamous. She found that she felt trapped, and eventually cheated on him with me. We kept in contact after that and she realised that we operated on the same wavelengths in most aspects. She left her BF and started a relationship with me.

6 months later, and my GF has recently met and been texting a girl she feels she really gets along with. Having read through their messages, they've been talking about a lot of random topics but it's always sprinkled with dirty talk and there's a lot of flirting going on. At the moment they also live 5 houses down from eachother so that would also "make booty calls really convenient", as one of my GF's messages said.

Btw I know it's awful that I've read through their messages, I feel ashamed for feeling like I need to but I'll explain later on in one of the ending paragraphs.

My issue is not that my GF is seeking thrills with new people, in fact I've told her many times I find it incredibly hot thinking about her sleeping with other people. My issue isn't even that my GF spends a lot of time texting her, cos I understand just how exciting it is to flirt with and discover things about someone new.

My problem is that...

A) it pains me that my GF is talking to someone the same way she USED to talk to me, and that the way we used to message eachother has turned sort of stale, at least from my perspective.

And B) I don't trust my GF to not mix up her emotions with different people.

We had sex last night which began with my GF watching porn with her vibe (as is always the case when it's more of a tactical wank for her and I just happen to be laying next to her). But she paused her video and while keeping the vibe going between her legs, started to message this new girl (even if the messages proved not to be overly saucy). She eventually put her phone down and just carried on with her eyes closed, something I've never seen her do before. When she gave me the queue to jump in and help her climax, she didn't make as much eye contact as usual, and I could see her actively thinking while we were having sex. All in all it just felt like I was there as second best, in the sense that who she really wanted to have sex with wasn't in the same room as her.

To throw a real spanner in the works, as much as I worry about how our relationship is going, I'm 98% sure my GF feels completely fine. My GF mentioned to me that she told the new girl that her and I are "primary partners" and that we're just looking for fun on the side.

We've also had a couple talks where I've mentioned my fears, albeit not very well, but the message still got across somewhat and my GF was happy to clarify what she wants from us, and tried to say things that would put some of my worries to rest (but again, not very well, hence why I'm now writing this post). She said something like "not to make you feel inadequate but I feel like you're not going to be enough for me, but that's in the same way I feel like no one person will ever be enough for me" and that she "never felt like she was in the right relationship cos she wants someone she feels she can grow up with" which I'm guessing is how she sees me.

As things stand, my GF feels secure and comfortable in our relationship, but she doesn't know that I don't feel the same. We got together on the grounds that we would be entering an open relationship, but being new to this, this is the first time I've realised that this is the reality of our relationship and its the first time I'm experiencing the consequences of being in an open relationship.

And as mentioned above, the reason why I read through their messages is cos it gives me the understanding of what's going on that I simply don't get from my GF. I've told her to keep me updated with how things are going but it still requires me to dig it out of her. Again I understand the NRE going on but I don't want my GF to shut me out entirely, even just saying to me "btw we shared nudes last night!" or something like that would be much appreciated, cos then I can be happy for my GF and join her in her new excitement. But right now I just feel shut out of the loop.

Not that this matters much for this story but I've also been going through depression over the past few months due to family issues, although now that those have somewhat settled what I'm feeling (purely from my GF's NRE) has evolved into bad anxiety. When my GF's texts are slightly off, or when I overthink what's going on between her and this new girl, or whenever I just feel shut out, my anxiety spikes and I get a knot in my stomach, which makes me lose my appetite and therefore become a little bit shaky from lack of nutrition. Going through their texts feels like a slither of control on my part, because at least I know what's going on and I can get over whatever emotions come my way and I can be rashional with my thoughts.

This knot in my stomach is the same thing I felt when I suspected and found out that my last GF cheated on me, and when I could do nothing to stop my long distance GF from self harming in the relationship before. Needless to say I feel like my relationships are never the easiest haha.

So yeah, all I really want is 1) for my GF to involve me a bit more with what's going on, like I'm not asking for bulletins every 5 minutes but the occasional update would be nice and put my mind at ease, and 2) just to make an effort to actually focus on me when I'm with her, or to be honest with me and herself and not try humour me when she'd rather think about/talk with this new girl. I understand what's going on in terms of the NRE so I don't appreciate being made to feel like sex between us is now a token gesture. If we have sex I want it because she wants ME, not because the other girl isn't around or because it's too soon in the talking phase. I'd rather my GF be honest with herself and sleep with who she wants to sleep with at any given moment.

Anyways I feel like I'm rambling so I'll end it here. Again I am new to this so any and all advice with how to handle poly relationships would very much be appreciated. Thank you for your time spent reading this. If you wanna tell me I'm an asshole for forcing my way into knowing what's happening, please tell me in the comments, and again if you think I'm justified in my thoughts and fears, please let me know in the comments along with any pieces of advice you might have for me.

Many thanks.I am thinking that it is time to call it quits with my GF of over a year.  The stress that it is bringing on with me and my wife is starting to get to be too much.  But I also feel like an ass if I do because of what she is going though.

She has the beginning stages of Breast Cancer.  Started back in the early fall.  She has been placed on hormone therapy.  This has killed her sex drive.  To the point, we have only had sex on time since before Halloween, and that was after a night of drinking.  Now it is go to bed and go to sleep.  Minimal snuggles/cuddles like she used to absolutely love.  Plus she has no problems with plans of being together being cancelled.  I know she wants her one forever man that I cannot provide, but I feel like she is keeping me as a security blanket.

Does all this make sense.  Am I stupid for staying.  I caught feelings and I think my heart is overriding my brain.I’m just gonna say it quick, what should I do when I still feel sad whenever I see my poly partner have romantic talks with another person? Like I’ve accepted myself as poly because I’ve made another partner and both of my partners like eachother but I still can’t help but feel obsolete whenever I see my first partner talk romantically with someone but I love her so much that I don’t want to lose her, she loves me too and she doesn’t want to lose me either. Sorry if I worded this terribly it’s late at nightHas it always been easy for you to date while polyam? Have you changed anything (strategies/profiles/the nature of the relationships you offer) and had success? 

Women have weighed in here numerous times about what they want, but that just seems to add to the frustration. 

So maybe if men who have multiple partners, and who are happy and thriving could weigh in about what works for them it would be more helpful?I’m 8 months into a triad and issues around sex aren’t resolving themselves. We can’t figure out how to sort out sex without going through three committee meetings first. Exaggerating of course, but you get the idea. I know communication is important but this is exhausting. 

There is me (39M), my wife (40F), and our bf (30M). We all have sex individually and also together. Our libidos are fairly in sync. Me and the wife both want sex about once a day but the bf prefers even more frequent. If someone is sleeping over for a one-on-one date, everything is simple. But the problem comes when we’re all together. Bf usually stays with us through the weekends for two or three days. As anyone who has them knows, threesomes require a little more energy and we aren’t up for that every night. So when the bf is here, night one is usually ‘awesome! Let’s all screw’. But night two, usually we all want sex but someone isn’t up for a threesome. The once a day thing also creates an issue here because physiologically, I just can’t go twice a day so just having sex in pairs separately isn’t the best option. I know a hard penis isn’t necessary for good sex, but that is usually what they’re after. Besides, we have shit to do. If we all had sex pairwise every day then like half the day would be filled up. Not feasible. 

So my question is mostly directed at triads who live together: how do you handle dyad sex when all members of the triad want sex but the only option is one dyad getting the opportunity? Do you have a preset schedule? Rely on someone bowing out gracefully? Usually we talk about it to death and then someone still ends up feeling left out or it ends up feeling clinical and not-spontaneous and the mood is a little off. 

Another sticking point is that the bf always wants to be included since he’s the one with the highest libido. Sometimes the wife isn’t interested so he and I get time together but the reverse is almost never true. I suppose he just needs to work on being comfortable stepping aside?

Any suggestions for waking that tightrope of avoiding hurt feelings in a quicker and more reliable way?I wish I could at least be there, in safe distance or something...

Somebody please tell me about your happy polycule, or your story, or even just vent to me if you’re having a shit day too. Just want to be reminded it’s not always gonna be this difficult for a newly out polyam person like myself, or maybe feel normal for a minute.

(So sorry if this isn’t the place or I’m breaking any rules, mods feel free to delete)Hello! My girlfriend (21TF) and I (19NB) are newly poly. And I just realized why we’ve been having problems. We missed the most crucial step, which is disentanglement. 

I struggle with codependency, especially as someone with severe PTSD. I get jealous and my PTSD gets triggered. It’s the worst, because I actively enjoy being in a poly relationship, but then I get upset and all of a sudden I feel like my only way to fix things is to break up. It’s because I have become incredibly codependent on my girlfriend, and her having another partner is a struggle for me. 

How can we work towards disentanglement when she already has a partner and I’m actively searching? She won’t break up with either of us, and I don’t want that happening either. Is it possible to come out okay on the other side if we have to start late?Edit: I just want to make it super clear that when I say Comet will be "in my area" I don't mean in the same town as me. He will be 1.5 hours from where I live and 2 hours from where I work. Only that last night (11) can he be *in **my** town.* I cannot spend Mon-Wed with him as I will have to be at work at least 2 of those days ... 

I have a comet relationship (long distance person I last saw at Halloween) and a new local FWB that I'm trying to get to know... 

I've been waiting for a month to hear from Comet about his business trip that will bring him to my area.. He said he'd be in the office from Mon - Wed and we'd work around that... 

In the meantime, I planned my first 1-on-1 overnight date with new FWB on Fri 11 - we've only had one overnight together and my Partner (long term non-nesting and local) was with us - great fun, but we *need* 1-on-1 time. 

This morning I wake up to an apology about the late notice, and Comet will be around from Sat 5 to Sat 12... FWB and I had planned a date for 11 since I'm off on 12... But the 11th is the best night for Comet to spend the night in my town before he flies out on the 12th! 

Ahhh!!! I wanna do both!!!  

I'm asking both Comet and FWB about week night availability ... I'm hoping to  have more information by tonight.

**What would you do?** Comet that you won't likely see for another 5 or 6 months or local FWB that you *really* want to get to know better and already had plans with?  I feel like a shitty person for this, but I also know that feeling shitty means I'm in touch with how much I could potentially hurt one or both of them...Hi, so I’m(33F) recent acknowledging grey Ace who is in all things except legally, married(35M). Since I became Ace we opened up our relationship. He found himself a girl, who was also in an open relationship with her spouse. 

My boss happened to tell me that he is poly but his wife is not, he wants a girlfriend. Him and his wife are very much in love and I thought it would be a great match if I was his girlfriend.

Instantly my husband disapproves because of age difference. My husband broke up with his girlfriend and basically begged me to call it quits.

I have such a hard time having understanding about my asexuality from anyone and it hurts me that he would take this opportunity away from me. 

I know it’s weird that it’s my boss but i really don’t care, I get things done at work as I have goals. Personally I’m more interested in the autonomy in this potential relationship. I can go home to my husband and daughter, I can also go out on a date with no pressure to have sex. Is there something I’m missing here?Idk if this deserves to be here, but I recently went through a throuple breakup. I'm here because I felt this community would have the best knowledge on polyamory and what might have happened in my situation.

What happened is all on me. Me and my girl had dated for 6 months, I knew she was bi, and we saw an opportunity with a girl who had come our way. I was down to experiment - 2 girls sounded amazing, and I liked that my girl could see that side of her preference filled. And we were gonna do it right, and make it not an FWB situation but real love and care, especially because in a way we wanted to give the new girl a better situation than the last relationship she was in. (New girl is also bi and was into both of us.) We did all the typical couple (but throuple) stuff, and had lots of one on ones between everyone, both sexual and non-sexual romantic, as well as some very cool interesting threeways. I gave it my best, remained un-jealous and giving love to the new girl.

Well, 2 weeks into it, I noticed one nagging thing that grew inside me. I wasn't attracted to the new girl. It got worse and worse. Soon, to me she was like my sister, and I was repulsed by every kiss, I didn't even want to be near her. I didn't feel jealousy, just worse repulsion than if she was a dude (I'm straight).

Every second doing one on one with her, conversation or sexual or romantic, I just wanted to be with my original girl. I finally let my original girl know. I told her I was fine with her continuing to be amorous with the other girl, but admitted I would probably eventually get jealous only if she was spending time with her that she could have spent with me. Her and the new girl mutually decided to stick with platonic relations. To me, clearly they understood that me asking for that was downgrading new girl to coming 2nd, or being a kind of FWB to the original girl, and that wasn't fair to new girl. I'm glad they're still gonna be good friends, because it just seems so wrong that I should walk away with my girl like always and new girl should end up alone. And I'm still ok with them doing stuff particularly when I'm not around, I made that clear to both of them. 

So my questions here are: have you seen this kind of thing before? Is it just because my brain unlike others is wired for monogamy? Is it just because we were doing things wrong, or was it the wrong girl for me? And last, is there anything we/I could've done better, or any recommendations for helping new girl and original girl feel ok from here on out?In an open marriage with strong foundation and good communication skills, but we need to take our communication to the next level. We’ve read Polysecure, Opening Up, Mating in Captivity—all great and helpful. What I’m seeking doesn’t have to be poly specific. I’m looking for a book (or blog, podcast, or other resource) that provides specific principles and tools for how to structure and engage in relationship conversations around very challenging topics/emotions. 

We’ve read some Gottman but it feels pretty basic. We’ve got the basics and beyond down. But we are dealing with some real sticky stuff and we need to learn truly advanced communication skills, and have a text/resources to work from so we can align on our own communication principles in our relationship as a foundation. 

Thanks!!I’m non monogamous but not poly. My roommate is and I’m really trying to wrap my head around it. I’m not sure if this relationship is truly bad or if I just don’t get it. 

This relationship consists of three people, A, B, and C. All three are 20-23. A is committed to both B and C. B and C are committed to A but not each other. However, C isn’t actually in love with either of them. A and C just plan to get married if they’re both single at a certain age. 

A and B (my roommate) got engaged after knowing each other for about half a year, dating for two. They have never met in person and will likely be unable to for at least a year or two due to how far apart they are. When they are able to meet, they plan on seeing each other for maybe one month out of the year considering the distance. They will also likely never move in together as A is allergic to cats (and also has a really nasty phobia) and B has a cat, an ESA they are unwilling to give up. Neither of them are willing to move to where the other one lives, either. There’s not even a plan to actually get some sort of legal marriage.

I feel like this barely qualifies as a relationship by monogamous standards, but I also feel like I’m going crazy because B’s mom actively approves of the relationship and it feels like no one has said anything to them. I’d just like to know if there’s something I’m not seeing.I(26m) have very recently (just over a month) ago discovered I might be interested in polyamory so I've been talking to people, reading articles, I bought a book. In that time, I met "Z"(25f) who is in a long-term relationship that also recently (about 3 months ago) become open and poly. Both her and her partner have been sexual active outside of each other but have yet to be romantic outside of their relationship. "Z" and I have gone on a few dates and had a discussion where we decided we both really like each other and would like to pursue each other with romantic intentions. I am told her partner knows about me and is excited for Z. Z knows I'm still learning and exploring and says she's fine taking that journey with me. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for in this post. Any advice, support, resources. I'm just kind of at a loss right now.Since I was young, I noticed I could feel my concept of being "in love" with more than just one person. Of course, because of being raised in a mono normative society, I never even thought about having an open relationship or polyamory.

A quick background of myself:

ENFP 3W2 

I've been in 5 relationships in my life. I'm 24 years old, never cheated on any relationship until my very last one and after that, I've been in a hellish battle against my own self. I started thinking about open relationships and polyamory when I was 20, I thought maybe I wasn't happy enough and that's why I was contemplating the whole open relationship - polygamy thing. 

I think I met the love of my life already, we were extremely happy together, we broke up because I left the country I used to live in. We never had fights, the relationship was full of trust, truth and comfortable wamr conversations. Even in that relationship where I was genuinely happy, I fell in love with another man. That's when I finally felt convinced, I am a polygamic person, the huge feeling of love I felt for my ex, wasn't limitating the fact that I found another man I felt like loving too.

I actually talked to both my partner and the guy I fell in love with, but my ex boyfriend wasn't feeling comfortable with the situation so I left it alone and continued my relationship normally. 

I keep doing the same mistake of not talking about being in an open relationship or in a polyamory relationship when I'm starting to date, and when I talked about it, it was too late. Now I am in an stable good relationship but I feel stuck. I am extremely extrovert, I love knowing people. 

I have felt like something is wrong with me because of this, that maybe I'm just a not mentally healthy women, or maybe just a slut. I'm going to therapy for my depression and anxiety. I haven't had the opportunity to talk about this polyamory - open relationship thing with my therapist. But honestly, I feel so lost now.



Thank you for reading.Probably not the best way for me to start a post in a polyamory group but I’d love to hear what other peoples dynamics look like in the polyamory world. 

I have two partners, one is my nesting partner and we live to together while the other is sorta new in my life (we’ve been talking just over a year) we date separately. my nesting part also has a partner who he loves deeply. We communicate to each other about our partners and continuously express our/their needs. This isn’t to say our dynamic is perfect but this is how we like it ☺️ 

Honestly just genuinely curious about other peoples dynamics and how they make them work :3My partner and I have been together 15 years and started opening up our relationship about seven years in. Neither of us have found a long-term meta yet, but we also have been devoting time to careers/school and whatnot. We're not currently in a poly-relationship, but I wanted to avoid the anti-polyamory crowd in other forums and perhaps gain insight if anyone has been in a similar situation.

Basically, my partner came home really upset one day and told me he ended up telling his ex (who is married) that he loved her.

For context, it took him awhile to get over her emotionally after they broke up. Once he finally was moving on, she had suddenly reentered our friend group when she got together with her now husband (many years ago) Ever since she came back into our social lives, she's been flirty with my partner. To the point where her now husband would be visibly uncomfortable. But obviously being friends with her now husband, my partner would try to avoid awkward situations.

She and my partner always messaged on and off. She'd also occasionally send him pictures of herself dolled up (not sexual, but definitely sensual). But he told me they had been in near constant communication for months recently, which was different. And my partner has the personality trait where when you talk to him enough, he will eventually be completely honest, even to his own embarrassment. Well, she had indicated that she suspected he had feelings for her and he came out and said he loved her. Then she ghosted him, he tried explaining that he just needed to be honest after all these years and he wasn't asking/expecting anything, not trying to get with her or break up her marriage, etc. etc. 

After a few months, she texted him back. She's removed herself from all social accounts. She said she fell into a depression and told her husband what happened. The husband felt betrayed by my partner (his friend) and she wasn't sure how/if we could all get together again. That she wasn't aware how deep his feelings were and that she felt their relationship was purely platonic.(despite her not always acting platonic towards him) Also that she needed to focus on her marriage, which has been damaged by my partner's actions. 

So....from my perspective, he's definitely gotten himself into a pickle. He should have established boundaries with her a long time ago to protect his own emotions as well as his friendship with her and her husband. However, I do think she and her husband are projecting more blame onto my partner than is called for. All he did was be honest to someone who considered him her best friend. Just posting to see if anyone has any helpful advice or whether my partner just done fucked.Hi everyone. I’m married and my husband is asexual. We are not in a relationship romantically but we do co parent our kid and live together. Neither one of us wants to get a divorce because we genuinely like each other and there’s a global pandemic and the cost of everything is going up and so on and so forth. Etc etc etc. we have not had a sexual relationship between us in over four years. The problem which isn’t a problem is that I’m sexual. We’ve had discussions and he’s cool with me dating outside of the marriage and I even had a boyfriend for a while but it didn’t end up working out with him largely due to me not wanting to get divorced. ANYWAY…. I was thinking when I do want to date again I could seek out poly minded people and possibly people who already have nesting partners? I like to have sex with people I feel a connection with. Not into one night stands they are meh to me. And also ideally would like to spend time with someone who didn’t want all my time. How do you suggest I go about all this? Thanks all.Hi everyone!
First time posting, so please be kind. I've been describing myself as polyam for years now, I try my best to be honest and kind to people I'm dating. As of right now I am only "dating" and not in any committed relationship, and I'm in a point in my life where it's hard for me to communicate openly since a lit of things are changing and I don't know what I want from relationships. Is this bad? How can I have honest conversations with people I am dating if I don't know what I want? Advise appreciated!

Thanks for reading <3Context: My word vomit text to my friend. I was connecting the dots during a long shower. We we're together for 5 and half years and poly the whole time.


So when his ex gf, Emily, was going though like mental health issues and really bad body image issues he kinda made it sound like everything was her fault and like she wasn't trying to get better. He made her feel like it was all her fault and he made me believe it. They like were having relationship issues because she didn't feel sexy and like idk all the details but I wouldn't want to be naked with someone who made me feel bad about my body. 

After I got assaulted I felt the same. I feel ugly and used and I wasn't really feeling sexy. We fought a lot about it because I just wanted support and he would make me feel like it's all my fault I'm not getting better and he threatened to break up with me if I stopped going to therapy (even though I wanted to go) because I was really depressed and it was hard to take care of myself. He made me feel anxious and like it was my fault I didn't wanna have sex. 

Like I remember feeling bad for Emily because she didn't deserve how I treated her and I realized he was doing the same thing to me. 

He had trouble with us (Emily and I) and finds someone new and tell us that it's our fault things aren't ok. He was always saying he loves me and everything about me but he would tell me it's hard to be with me when I'm like this (anxious, depressed, scared) as if I wasn't trying to recover. 


Idk if this is tmi but....
We were in a serious dom/sub relationship like he bought me a collar and that's like getting married in the kink world. Like essentially we were dedicated to each other. He decided to uncollar me and it felt like he broke up woth me all because "we weren't doing kinky stuff anyways" and then he tells me "it's because you've matured and you're so strong" 

I did a bad thing a few weeks later (he was logged into his messenger on my laptop and I went through his messages. I don't justify anything I know it was a complete invasion of privacy.)  I was really paranoid because I felt replaced. He would come home woth bite marks all over him and he wouldn't let me do it too.

 I found out he collared his new gf and I was replaced and I asked him too. I asked him if it was because he wanted to do the dom stuff with emily instead of me because I knew I couldn't give him what he wanted and he lied to me about it. For like months.



When i told him I wanted him home (after the assault) and he never was he was like "well you said I could go to new gf's house" and like yeah I said he can do what he wants because I'm not a controlling person.


He would also like slap me hard or grab me really hard after I told him he can't do that anymore and be like oh I forgot and I was just so abused and numb I said "oh it's ok".


Ps. I know I fucked up a lot. I screamed at him and I did throw my phone at a wall once but that's the reason I broke up with him. I was so hurt and I didn't want to keep fighting qnd one day become an abusive person. It genuinely scared me that I was capable of screaming that way and acting so violently.  I was so mean to him and I didn't want to hurt him anymore. Come for my throat, or don't I just wanted to get this off my chest. 


Tldr; realizing how fucked up my relationship was after a breakup.A very TLDR: My girlfriend of 5 1/2 years introduced the idea and relationship dynamic change of going from monogamous to poly, which I can logically accept after the initial shock, I believe emotionally in time.

The only downside is she introduced the idea and change after already having met somebody she started to talk with, and now is coming out as she has felt she has always been poly and it's finally bubbling to the surface she needs the relationship change to experience this within her self.

We are suppose to move soon and it is sadly seeming way too emotionally overwhelming for me to have to make a decision if I want to continue our relationship or not so suddenly.

She has made it clear she needs to explore her poly side over maintaining the relationship at this point.

I am deeply emotionally invested and overwhelmed at how to manage so SUDDENLY with the idea of the change also when the idea includes the reality of the change, another partner already being in the mix. I am open to changing at my own pace and believe I could. I am not opposed to going poly, I am opposed to having the change forced on me it feels like.

What should I do here? I am feeling overwhelmed enough to leave sadly.**It is much easier to deal with negative emotions, and communicate well, when you are generally happy and emotionally stable.**

* There are tons of well studied routes to happiness - exercise, financial security, friendships, nature, meditation, etc. Pick what you are lacking and improve it.



* If you are depressed, additionally pursue medication and therapy. Lots of great therapeutic methods can be self guided. I like CBT.

* If you specifically have a self esteem issue, figure out the fundamental cause and improve it. Does not having partners make you feel worse about your body? Well, why not join a gym *as well* as look for new partners? Both are routes to feeling healthier and more attractive.

**It is much easier to communicate with a partner and accept their actions if you generally have a secure attachment with them.**

* Find ways to increase your connection with each other - go on dates, improve your mutual sex life, plan fun trips together, write down what you love about each other. You should be actively and frequently celebrating how great your connection with; you should be in the 'honeymoon phase' indefinitely, if done right.

* Communicate openly and honestly with them about fears and insecurities, and trust them to take care of you. Did they take care of you? Problem solved. Did they not? Don't date them.

* Polysecure is a fantastic resource on this front. Give it a read and actually go implement the steps to build a better relationship; *then* try navigate poly together, using the increased comfort and trust.

**It is much easier to attract partners when you display traits that a majority of people find attractive.**

* No surprises here - improve your fitness, style, and grooming. Display interesting and attractive hobbies that match the people you want to attract; you're probably not going to date an Insta model with D&D campaign screenshots. If you don't have attractive hobbies, try to find some you can enjoy.

* Put yourself out there, and show your best side. If using online dating, this means high quality photos (not selfies) probably taken by a friend who wants to help and will take hundreds to pick from. Otherwise, *leave your goddamn home*. Dates won't magically appear in your room because you're a good person; go to a bar or meetup!

**It is much easier to find someone who treats you well when you are able to attract a variety of people to date**.

* If you only get one date every two months, you're going to be very likely to want to start dating that person simply from scarcity. What are the odds that person is going to match all your criteria for an excellent partner? If you can attract more potential partners, you will have vastly more capacity to vet for the qualities you want to date.

* If someone clearly doesn't treat you well, *stop dating them*. Trying to hang onto them, fix their mentality, and claw your way into being a priority for them simply won't be fun for anyone. You shouldn't bail at the slightest hurdle, but don't overcomplicate clearly massive issues that propagate heartbreak and tension; just leave the situation making you unhappy.

**Working on all the above parts of your life can take a ton of effort. If you feel unable to work on them, look into methods of improving your available energy first.**

* Physiological factors are great for this - get enough sleep, eat healthier, drink more water, exercise more, and clean your house. You are virtually guaranteed to have more energy available once you hit the basics.

* Social methods are also wonderful; tons of books recommend having accountability mentors and methods to help keep you on track.

* Be kind to yourself and celebrate small wins. Don't expect overnight success. Congratulate yourself on following the *process* and trust that the results will come over time as long as you do so.

**Only once you have a majority of these factors under control should you start looking at poly-specific troubleshooting to improve your happiness.**

* I'm not saying you need to be ripped and rich before you complain or start improving your poly communication; that would be absurd. What I *am* saying is that if you're regularly unhappy with a partner, but you're also sleeping in till midday and eating like shit and work a job you dislike... *maybe your frustration is only an outlet for a deeper dissatisfaction for your life, and as long as you avoid treating it, you will continue to encounter new problems*.

* I do think there is scope to ask for troubleshooting on particularly niche scenarios. Are two members of your triad asexual and you need specific input? Sure, that's probably where this sub can help. Are you simply not getting matches on Tinder? *Go find literally any standard Tinder guide for your sex/gender/demographic and follow it to a tee, build an amazing profile, and THEN see if you still struggle.*

* It won't do you any harm to read poly literature and advice while you're also improving your life generally; you can do both! But you should conceptualise it just as one piece of the puzzle of happiness, and maybe even a very small piece if your life or relationships are otherwise dysfunctional.Hello! 

I'm curious what some of your reconnection strategies and rituals are with the folks in your life. 

A bit of context is: it's much easier for me to feel disconnected from my partner than it is for them to feel disconnected from me. We don't live together, but we live near each other (by coincidence) and tend to see each other 1-2x a week, usually spending part of our weekends together and sometimes the occasional weeknight hang out. 

However, if one of us travels somewhere we keep in touch but both of us tend to prioritize being present wherever we are/whoever we're with and so we'll have daily "hey, how's your day" check-ins but nothing much beyond that. A note is: feeling disconnected seems to be time-bound for me; I don't necessarily feel disconnected after dates.

So, my struggle is that when re-uniting from those situations, I don't feel super connected to her and it's causing some kind of cranky feelings in me. We are both interested in figuring out a reconnection ritual so I'm able to feel a bit more grounded and present, so I am curious and looking for ideas about the ways in which you reconnect with partners after being away for whatever reason (travel, work, dates, etc). 

My therapist suggested the (in?)famous 6-second kiss and obviously the idea of kissing my partner is great and also perhaps not ideal for every situation and/or mood.I believe I’ve seen people on this forum reference some sort of link or article about skipped conversations before opening up - things like thoughts about posting on social media, holidays, etc. Does anyone remember what this is called? I can’t for the life of me seem to find it again.Hey everyone, im in need of advice.

My LDR is having a bit of a situation. My meta is in the hospital at the moment and i feel bad that im not close enough to help. My partner is having to be a single parent at the moment and while they have another partner that lives in the same city as them, i feel like im useless and all i can do is offer emotional support. Im used to leaping in and helping and i cant. I feel like an absolute worst partner. 

Like im glad that they have the other person there and im greatful that they have them. I just .... well im rambling now. 

I guess what im askin is if anyone has an advice for me.A few months ago I (21F) started seeing my partner (26M) strictly in the terms of being a secondary partner. I don’t have the emotional capacity in my life to dedicate to a primary partner right now, but I shared with them that I enjoyed the “relationship practice” and of course the comfortable sex that goes with having a regular partner. All was well and good until I started finding out through off hand comments that he and his primary partner (23F) hadn’t been seeing/sleeping with each other for weeks at a time (she lives over an hour away). I thought this was odd as he is extremely physical, and also odd that he avoided the topic whenever I would point out one of his comments, even jabs at his primary for her behaviour. A week ago we took a short break while he was moving to the town his partner lives in. We reconnected and he seems to think a breakup is nigh, believes Ms. Primary is emotionally cheating, can’t stand not having sex, etc. While I don’t mind being an outlet for physical frustration, I set a boundary early on that if he did want to share details of that relationship that I would not be commenting on it as I had never even met his partner and had no perspective to draw from her side. I’ve always been terrible helping friends through breakups and this situation seems especially precarious. Now that an ending of sorts seems inevitable I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how to support my partner while maintaining boundaries. Or if maintaining a secondary relationship is possible when a primary is ending !Wondering if there are any other poly Latinos that would care to share their stories about de-programming themselves from their upbringing in terms of jealousy and masculinity, etc.So dumb I know but I was at work looking at the V day menu and I was thinking about how if you're in a triad it kinda sucks bcos everything is for 2 like the deals and sharing desserts etc. Then I started fantasising about being in a triad or even being the hinge in a kitchen table set up and hanging out with my faves and I just got really really sad that I can't have that.

(I'm not going to go into it but my husband and I started off as poly and somehow slippery slope slid into monogamy with no way back)Tried to log into my account and turns out I’m banned. No idea why—my messages/profile are perfectly appropriate. I had a couple matches I really wish I hadn’t lost convos with! Anyone else have this issue?How much, and how often do you talk to all your partners?
My BF is a big wig exec, with a wife and kids. I also have a husband, kids and career. But it seems our communication time keeps dwindling... He says it's because he's busy with work and home stresses, but I'm kinda expected (it feels), it be available when he's ready to talk. I'm just getting frustrated and feeling lonely, and wondering i guess, if I'm asking too much of him?So I spent three years in a close triangle with two girlfriends. To be honest I loved it, it made me feel safe and it’s not just about sex. I love to see both of them just chatting and spending time together. There’s something beautiful about that. But we needed to part away, so now I’m just with one girlfriend. This got me thinking, because I’m not happy at this moment. What I really want is to be able to have a comfortable house and live together with 4 or 5 more partners… I know it may sound crazy, but I consider myself as a closed poly relationship… but I wish I could find this in my life. Just 6 living beings together, having respect to each other and appreciating life. It seems unreal, but I don’t think I won’t be happy until that day. I’m a guy, but do you, as a woman think it is possible? Or I’m just out of my mind? I would love to read your opinions, everybody can comment, including guys… what do you think?
Edit:
I think that my message is getting misunderstood. I’m not talking about sex, it’s way more than that. I’m neither the center of the relation. It’s about growing old together and  spending time with the ones you love

I just learned it’s called commune or something like that, sorry if I offended anyone. I’m talking about growing old with the ones you love, not about being the center of a relation I read a lot about NRE like it's a given, but...what if NRE never fades? The first blush of attraction never fades for me. It's more like ERE (Eternal Relationship Energy) While I'm not in Love love with my exes anymore, I still care for all of them deeply, decades down the road.

My longest RS which is "it's complicated" still fills me with giddy joy when I receive a text from the object of my affections. It's like NRE just...well...never-fading. So it's always new, so technically NRE just forever lol.

I know other poly folk who also do not experience NRE at all, but just "normal" attraction. 

I am wondering what other "universals" of poly...aren't. For instance I get told jealousy is a given a lot. I've never been jealous romantically and I know of others who have not. Also never had any issues regarding politics/religion/finance/age. 

I don't claim to know everything, just wanted to spur some discussion and viewpoints.I have a friend who I love dearly, who only became my meta a couple of months ago when she started dating the guy I'm seeing (with my blessing of course).

Our hinge and I are estranged at the moment, and I could really use my friends. I would normally reach out to her to be there for me in these moments, but since it's about him, I'm not sure it's appropriate.

Even if it wasn't about him, I just want to make sure she knows we're still friends, and our issue has nothing to do with her. I just have no idea how to approach the conversation since I don't want to disclose the details of what's going on with him. Any advice? :(Hi Folks!

I'm (27M) in a 5.5yr relationship with my partner B (28NB). We've been cohabiting for 2.5 years in a houseshare and have a history of pretty codependent relating. When we started our rship I was polyam and had another partner, who I broke up with after a betrayal of trust about 6mo into my rship with B. I expressed a desire to be monogamous at the time with B and they agreed. 

For the last couple of years I'd been pretty clear that I want to be polyamorous again, and am very keen to have sex with other people, especially as the sexual desire in our rship was decreasing. We opened up to sex outside the partnership around a year ago. Then in October I met my current boyfriend R (37M) when I was on a weekend away. I went home, had a crisis, and told B that I need to be able to explore things with R. That I need to be polyam. I knew I was risking my rship with B and felt prepared to do that, but we worked it out, and decided to give it a go, having a long distance rship with R and living with B still.

A few months on, add the death of a close friend, add my having some big life realisations and dropping out of a course, and I'm strongly feeling the urge to live alone. AND I want to move to the city R lives in. I spoke to B the other day about our rship and expressed worried that things were maybe 'fizzling out'. They were upset, but didn't say much in response. 

I don't know how I feel. I don't know if actually I'm just not invested in this rship with B anymore or is NRE is making things with R seem so much more attractive in comparison? 

I feel like I keep asking for more - more freedom, more space (emotionally and in terms of living situation), more things that actually B doesn't seem especially enthusiastic about. I'm worried they're just agreeing with what I ask for and being appeasing. This frustrates me as it plays into a dynamic where I'm the one calling the shots and they're not really saying what they want. I really resent having to guess how they're feeling. In terms of our rship history this sets me off as I've been the 'carer' codependent and they've been the 'helpless' one - and believe me, I know that I fall too easily into that role and that it's disempowering for the people in my life. 

There are a lot of things I love about my relationship. It's steady. Nobody makes me laugh like they do. They're kind, considerate and we know each other so well. Part of me really thinks that becoming a LDR for a little while will bring back some of the energy into our relationship. Part of me isn't really fussed either way. I also know that grief from the loss of my friend is tinting how I'm seeing all of this. I just don't know what is right. One of my best mates said the other day that in B's position they wouldn't be nearly so placating and I feel the same way.  

GAH! Thoughts? Please be kind - I worry that I'm being an asshole. Honestly I'm a person who's been in care roles and had a lot of responsibility my whole life and in some ways I just want B to be assertive! I've done so much thinking, processing, therapy, writing, reading, to try and do this right. I've been trying to work on this relationship for so long. Am I just using distancing as an excuse to try and break up the relationship?! I know only I can answer this. It's so hard. 

Thanks for reading this long ass message! xHere's the situation: an ex FWB of min recently messaged me with a new, anonymous social media account after a year of absolutely no contact. The only reason I know its him is because he sent me pics as well. His messages indicated that he doesn't think that anything ended badly (I haven't replied). A couple of months ago, I had FINALLY reached some form of peace and experienced a lot less pain with knowing that I wouldn't hear from him again or know if he's even ok... until the other day. The unhealed part of me wants to lap up any ounce of attention he would give me if I reply, my pain wants to unleash immediate verbal hellfire on him so that he for sure KNOWS how bad he hurt me, and my common sense says don't interact.

The backstory: This man was a coworker of my husband (I know, I know, I don't need to hear it) that I instantly connected with when we first met on a company vacation (spouses were welcome, so I wasn't the only non-employee, AND this was pre-virus times). We chatted a lil bit on the last day, he did the coy "so, do you have any single friends" conversation because I was heavily pregnant at the time. I didn't realize until he started flirting with me months later that it was his extremely subtle way of hitting on me. Conversations between us grew more frequent as time went on and the flirting became more frequent as well. At the time, my husband and I identified more as a swinger couple, so flirting was definitely allowed. Come March of 2020 (literally the LAST weekend before lockdown struck), we attended a different coworkers St. Patrick's day party, and he was there. He made his flirting VERY obvious, with no care in the world to who else saw it, and we were still just in the "chatting/friendly" stage. This of course, spiked my interest in him tenfold. A few months later (when lockdowns were lifted for the summer), my husband invites him over for a night of drinks and video games, and it turned into a night of me being a pillow princess, so I was over the moon. This evolved into a semi regular thing, where 2 or more weekends a month, we were having "hangouts" with him. My husband then started encouraging me to be in FWB company when he would go out for fishing trips on weekends towards the end of the summer (this was unprecedented) because he knew I was smitten and trusted him at the time to not be a dickhead. This led to me gaining an attachment, I was honest about my feelings and told FWB, and he didn't discourage it, in fact, he started doing more to make me feel special. I even became the ONLY woman he was seeing. Then fall came around and we started seeing each other less, so I put on a brave face and dealt with it. We had one last crazy night full of fireworks and all that jazz in mid-October, then our only contact was thru messaging. I had noticed some vibe shifts a little before this and had called them out. I literally spoonfed him a way out when he lost interest, saying that he can tell me if he wants to simmer things down or have them stop all together, that I understood and would be fine with that "I trust that you can be honest with me, since I've been honest with you". He decided to deny that anything had changed on his end, lightly gaslit me about "being insecure" and continued to string me along, acting like he was willing to see me and then suddenly being busy (I know, I was still very naive then). Once November went by, he virtually ghosted me, and I decided I'd give him his space and muted/hid the conversation so I wouldn't bother him and so that I could take the space I needed to start processing us basically being over without anyone saying it. I knew things became very one-sided and I didn't understand why I let myself get so attached, so I did some research and self reflection, resulting in me realizing permanent monogamy wasn't something I could do (in my reflections, I realized I always "struggled" with having romantic feelings for more than one person at a time and didn't have the knowledge or vocabulary to identify why I had thos feelings until recently). Husband and I had a heart-to-heart about it and reached level ground about being open to polyamory after I processed my grief down the line. 
Then, my birthday came a lil over a month later. I woke up from having a dream about ex and decided to send that "Hey, I miss you" text. I got hit with the "yeah, I'm kinda seeing someone" reply. Since we had been able to talk about other partners like buddies during our fling, he proceeded to describe how they met and his his feelings about the relationship, even though I didn't ask and had tried to end the conversation with "oh cool, I'm happy for you". When he talked about his feelings for her, they mirrored what I had felt for him, to an absolute T, which hurt even more. When he asked "do you know what I mean" after saying all of that, I fucked up my shot to be 100% honest with him and just said "yeah, that's kinda what I felt with you, at least with our sexual connection", instead of "wow, you feel for her exactly what I felt for you, good to know you're capable of feeling that way about someone" (I know, I'm petty). And after a minute or two more of chatting, that was when I went no contact. 
6 months later, I hear from my husband that ex's gf broke up with him and his resulting behavior after that got him fired, partly because he relapsed back into doing hard drugs. Based on the glimpse at his behavior from his recent messages, he's fixated on getting revenge on his ex by looking "hotter" than when they were together, and he thinks my self esteem is still low enough that he could possibly use me as a "revenge fuck" as well. This was NEVER behavior he exhibited when he was still sober from hard drugs, plus his physique in the pics he sent were thinner and more gaunt than I've ever seen him, so I have a strong feeling he's still strung out. 

Any insight would be helpful, please stay away from expressing judgement about pandemic situations, those events are in the past and not what I'm asking about. I know I still obviously have some healing to do since the sad pining feeling is becoming frequent instead of nonexistent. 

Thanks for getting this far!My (27f) polyamorous boyfriend, Tom (36m), committed to being monogamous with me whilst I finish off my PhD, as I am new to it and need time to talk it through with him. I've thought I might be poly since I was about 18, but never had the right person to explore it with. We have only been together 5 months, although we've known each other a lot longer than that, and we were dating openly for two months before we committed to each other. My PhD fininishes in April.

Tom has a lot of experience in the poly world, he was previously in a very happy 7 year poly relationship, and he is someone I really really trust, he is open and communicative, and makes me feel very safe. Despite that, I struggled a lot as our feelings for each other developed. It threw up a lot of traumatic emotions from a previous relationship with someone who shut down any discussion of polyamory, but nevertheless proceeded to serially cheat on me whilst conducting an impressive campaign of gaslighting and emotional abuse. Tom completely embraced my needs and said we could keep things simple (i.e. just the two of us) until I had completed my PhD and had the headspace to talk it over with him.

However two weeks ago he told me he was having second thoughts about monogamy, and isn't sure what he wants in our relationship anymore. There are people in our circle he is interested in, and he said he felt horrible because it was like he was cheating on me in his head. He says he would be heartbroken if we ended things, and he thinks perhaps he just needs time and space to adjust to being in a monogamous (at least for now) long term relationship, which makes me feel like I'm asking too much, I of course don't want him to be unhappy in the course of being with me. 

We're taking space right now while we both think things over. He started a new job recently which means we have very little time to properly have this out. I am also very much still getting to know myself and what I want, and it's entirely possible that come April I may well decide polyamory isn't for me, and whilst I'm annoyed he's left me in the lurch at such a crucial time in my studies, I'm aware I may be leading him on too. 

In that vein, I've been trying to think practically. There are two people he is interested in that, academically, I could be okay with him exploring relationships with, and we've discussed maybe returning to our 'dating' stage, which was open, and start over. But I'm not sure if I can just press reset like that, although maybe this would be different if there was someone I was interested in (currently there isn't). I also don't know if it's healthy for us to have to 'approve' our prospective partners? Is that a valid boundary? 

I want to find a way through this, but I'm scared one of us is going to get really hurt, and i've been experiencing lots of intrusive thoughts along the lines of 'fuck it walk away it's too much trouble at this very stressful time', but this could be something really wonderful if we can get to the other side, and I have quite strong feelings for him. What are other people's experiences with polyamory in its early stages? How normal is this? Am I being horribly toxic? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. 


TL;DR my polyamorous boyfriend committed to a monogamous relationship with me but is now having second thoughts. I am interested in polyamory but don't have the emotional capacity right now (due to trauma and studies). How should I approach this?I (26F) have recently started seeing my partners (37F) other partner (35NB), as well as us all forming a triad. I left an emotionally abusive relationship last August and am still finding things that trigger feelings from back then, and one thing that seems to be giving me massive anxiety is hearing my partners having sex when I'm in the house. Me and 37F were also in a triad with the partner who I left last year, and there was a situation where I heard them upstairs while I was stuck downstairs in work meetings and such and there were big feelings of exclusion, being unwanted and being forgotten about. I know logically that I was working so wouldn't have been able to join in and they were of course allowed to do things without me, but the way it played out felt very much like I didn't exist and they didn't care about me being there (they were rather vocal). It was resolved at the time, they both apologised and feelings were all worked out, but the anxiety that comes from feelings that mix of feelings again is pretty bad. 

I obviously don't want to feel like this and it probably will lessen over time as the triad and my relationship develops with 35NB, but right now it's making me feel like I'm adding a burden and stress to both of them when they're having their time together when I'm around on top of me feeling very stuck. None of us live together, but we all spend long periods of time together and have time for each individual relationship during that time. I have had discussions with both of them about this as well, and they close the bedroom door while I'm around, but there is a bit of a hole in the floor between that room and the living room where I spend my alone time so sound still travels (and again, vocal). 

Basically I wanted to try and get all this written down so I could make more sense of it in my head, as well as getting some opinions about whether it's ok to feel like this still at this point and if anyone has experienced anything similar? I love them both, they're both so helpful and want to help but I think everything that can be done has been done.We (m/f) have started a poly (Vee) relationship with (m).
All agreed to this format, but I (m) am starting to wonder if this is what our new partner is happy to continue with.
We haven’t done this before, but have had casual fun with guys in mmf threesomes for a few years previously.
Wanted to go into more of a deeper relationship with one suitable guy, which we think that we have found.
He seems extremely keen to be a part of our relationship, in which we’ve all had time together socially and sexually and then each of us has had separate times with her too.
I wanted to have a friendly relationship with him too, which he claims he wants, but I’m starting to have my doubts.
I could be overthinking though too.
Originally he’d be keen to meet up with us both, and he’d answer my messages not long after I’ve sent them.
Now he’s pulled out of meets involving the three of us, but still has his meets with her. Her and I can message him around the same time, he’ll answer her almost straight away, me sometimes the next day.
He is very shy though and much younger than us.
We’ve had guys before that wanted that totally separate relationship with no involvement from myself which we have not gone into for that reason.
Could I possibly be right in thinking this new guy could be the same ???I posted on here looking for some advice to opening up my relationship with my primary, who claims monogamy by default. I’m poly and while they were aware of that, our relationship was closed for a long time and that led to some false precedents. 

Everyone on here was supportive and some gave me some honest truths that were tough for me to read, but needed. 

My partner has handled this with as much grace as I can possibly expect out of anyone in their shoes. We saw a couple’s coach who specializes in poly 2 days after the discussion, with my partner’s consent of course. There has been a lot that has come up and it hasn’t been easy, but by simply having the discussion our relationship has improved leaps and bounds, our communication and the processing of bad habits (that tend to go with oppressive monog relationships) have already lead to deeper understandings of ourselves and our relationship. 

They are actually getting excited about trying poly themselves, but we’re both taking it very very slow because there’s still work to be done for us both. We’re still unsure if they can do it, if this is something that they want, but they’re willing to put the work in to try and I’m doing my best to hold space and work on myself too. 

These situations can work out, but I know it’s rare. My partner and I both understand that, but we’re going to make the most of our experience together and fingers crossed we can grow together, but we both just want the other to be fulfilled and happy - whatever that may entail. 

I’m thankful for this community for your support, empathy, advice, honesty and resources. You folks are awesome.I'd like to see more fun and positive posts in this subreddit, so here goes.

&#x200B;

I'll start. I have learned so much from this journey, but here's what stands out to me after a little over 3 years. I don't need to have multiple partners to be happy. I just need to love myself, and be able to share that love with others without expectation. Just because I am polyamorous doesn't mean I **need** to have multiple partners. I've found that what's more important to me is that I am able to freely express myself with others, and let things grow into whatever they may become. As long as I am honest and open with all parties involved, I am free to learn and grow with whomever consents, as are they.

&#x200B;

Now your turn. What's one thing you've learned from polyamory (about yourself, others, or polyamory in general) that is invaluable?Sometimes i have a gut feeling that the way things are being shared is not appropriate. Other times it doesn’t align with logic but it feels okay. Do others feel this way? 
Do you have explicit rules? Does it depend on who your partner is as a person, what insecurities they have, etc?

Any interesting experiences with sharing gone very right (or very wrong)?

curious what the poly community has felt and learnedMe: It's difficult in my location to find people to date.

Poly Reddit Sub: That's because you are presenting yourself to others as a single male. Potential partners want to know you're in a relationship and not just a single guy looking for sex. 

Also Poly Reddit Sub: That's because you are presenting yourself as part of a couple. Never use the words "we" or "us." Those words scare poly people away. Just present yourself as a guy who's looking for other relationships. 

Me: ....I've been lurking here for a while, I've read Polysecure and good chunks of More Than Two, and I've been curious about CNM and poly for a while now. I've had minor explorations here and there, but suddenly I feel I'm deep in it and uncovering a lot of things about myself that are unsettling and scary and, well, I'm happy to be on the ride, but I'm stuck right now and not sure what to do.

The short/medium version of the story is I started dating a woman about 6 months ago. Things were intense from the get-go but for a number of reasons we were tentative to fully lean in (can provide more details if it would help!). We were both interested in poly (and new to it!) so were always very open about our other intimacy exploits. This was always fine. Our connection was strong and this extreme openness also brought us closer.

Fast-forward to about a month ago. It became abundantly clear that we were both falling hard for each other. She has pretty much never felt that way before, and I haven't for almost a decade, so it has been completely intoxicating, a real roller coaster ride. Most of the time it is wonderful but it is also overwhelming and sometimes any kind of disconnection would be temporarily quite painful. The care for each other is there, but we didn't exactly know how to proceed with what we were feeling.

Anyway, she has been seeing another guy for 5 months now (one month less than me). She maintains firmly that they are just friends and have no romantic connection (I believe her), but they do have an intense sexual connection and they hang out very often, probably more than she and I do. Over the first few months I was totally on board and happy for her about this, but as my feelings for her have grown and their sexual chemistry intensified, I am struggling with it more and more. We are aware of this and both willing to work on it (how/when we share/receive, etc), so that is a good sign, and we have improved a lot since the beginning!

Last weekend, we went on a 4 day trip together. It was our first ever trip and we weren't sure how it would go, as things are always intense between us. Well, it was wonderful. Really wonderful. Our connection grew immensely, and it was the first time we danced around the topic of love that we feel for each other. It's vulnerable and scary and overwhelming and wonderful. We came home Monday morning, both on cloud 9, reeling from the experience.

Well, Tuesday evening we hung out again and it turns out that after we came back on Monday, she spent the evening and hooked up with guy friend she's been seeing. It crushed me.

So, here is where I am suffering, and confused. I cannot pinpoint where this feeling comes from. We are in such a good place, so it's not really jealousy I don't think. Their connection is different from ours, and it is so clear how much she cares for me, how supportive she is, how she feels some kind of intense romantic love for me, and so I don't think it is fear of losing her or being replaced or anything like that either. I would say that I was very emotionally hungover on Monday, so I didn't have room to process what happened and maybe that made it a lot worse, but something about the proximity of her experience with him to us first talking about love together made it really hard for me to stomach. The only thing I can really point to is that this is just some old socialized mono-normative emotional response that is deeply rooted within me, but maybe I'm also missing something, I don't know.

She was so looking forward to share this experience that she had Monday evening with me because she really learned that these two intimacy experiences didn't inhibit each other and that was really exciting for her. I wanted to share in that joy but I was just crushed, and I shut down. I am not sure now where to go from here. She is there for me and supportive of me and is really willing to be there with me to help me feel safe and shed the pain that I feel, but it is just there, lingering heavily.

I really do feel in congruence with poly philosophically, but this intense feeling of hurt has really made me even reconsider if poly isn't for me, and that is scaring me as well. I want to process this and let it go, but I am really having a hard time. Any advice for me?Okay... I know Valentine's is a sappy Hallmark holiday, but fuck it. I'm feeling the romantic vibes right now and I want to know what everyone is doing to celebrate! What are you getting your partners? Do you have fun plans for the day? I've been riding a poly high for a while now, which has got me in the Valentine-y spirit. Let's share what we're doing with our partner(s) for this corny holiday!Just thought I’d share my little joys. I’ve been with my partner G for over 4 years, and we opened our relationship last May. G and I are now in a quasi-triad with my best friend of 4 years, P (platonic between P and I, romantic+ between P and G). I have another partner, O, who I’ve now been with for a little over a month. It’s all been Rocky at many points, but we’re finding ways to better communicate our needs and enforce certain boundaries, as well as address insecurities. 

I’m traveling 5 hours tomorrow to visit G for their birthday, then this weekend G and I will visit P, and next weekend I’m spending Valentine’s Day with O. Feeling very content and loved right now! :)

I drew a little constellation drawing, but I’m not sure how to add it to this post. If you know how I can do that, lmk!My ex and I were polyamorous and I met my current partner while I was still with him.

My ex's style of polyamory was toxic. No communication, would force me to make boundaries with my partners that he didn't force on his own, even one time mentioning that he'd been thinking it would be better to make his newer gf his primary partner and have a child with her even though we're married. 

He cheated on me before opening the relationship with a close friend and often made me feel expendable. 

I left him and fully expected to move on by myself. I did not expect my bf to want to stay with me as a 1 on 1 relationship especially since I was going through a divorce. I moved 5 hours away and somehow we still video chatted visited each other and eventually moving in together.

6 years later although we had not dated others we both still identified as polyamorous. He has decided to start back going to kink events and participating in that community because he use to enjoy it.

Every time he goes to an event my chest gets tight and my brain keeps telling me that I'll be replaced and he'll not want to be with me anymore because he'll be happier without me.

One time he stayed home from an event he was looking forward to and I was wracked with guilt that I'm in his way of being happy. 

How do I overcome my past trauma to be happy in an open relationship again?I (straight male) am enjoying an 8 year swinging relationship with my bi female partner. We have not tried a triad or unicorn in our relationship. We became friendly with another couple, also straight male bi female. We spent time at parties and weekends away. There was always a separation with my partner playing separately with him and spending lots of time chatting to him. This developed into my partner and him breaking the 4 way communication rule. I accepted this but did not engage in seperate conversation with his partner only contributing to the group chat. My partner recently told me that our male friend had asked her to be his girlftriend and that she is very excited about this as she has feelings for him and wishes to be his girlfriend in a polyamorous relationship. I have said I will go along with the experiment but his partner and I have both said we are happy swinging and are not looking for another loving relationship. I am asking, from your experience are we playing with fire or not.I have been sleeping with a married for about three years. They are in an open relationship. The wife knows and we have even spoken on the phone. This Christmas we decided to exchange gifts for the first time. Now Valentine's is coming up. Any ideas what men want for the holiday?Hello everyone, I (F31) have been in a semi-closed triad with a married couple (M48 & F41) for close to 7 years now. They have two kids together. We were friends for a couple of years before. We had a very very rocky first year and a number of issues that have resolved, but others that have cropped up. The triangle eventually turned into a V. 
Anyway, I’ve had a life altering 12 months with the death of my father and my late ADHD diagnosis. This has brought on a lot of personal growth and research. 
This is my only poly relationship and after what feels like my brain waking up this year I can see a number of red flags in this relationship that I couldn’t see before. (I have been no saint myself and am working on it but wow it’s intense really drilling down to those vulnerable parts of the psyche…)
I did research into poly when we first all got together but didn’t really look into it as much as I thought I did. I think I was young and just having a good time so went with the flow of things. 
7 years later I am feeling envious of both of my sisters as they married someone they love, bought a house with someone they love (and can decorate the way they want) and are now having a baby with this person they love. 
It makes me realise that I think I want that too. I have nothing against poly at all, but am finding myself wanting a mono relationship- and I guess the things that come with that which I won’t have / get in this relationship. 

Anyway, I just needed to vent and I was wondering if anyone else had felt this way at all in any kind of poly relationship. 
Thank you.My boyfriend and I would like to find gatherings of ENM folks in-person.  How would we go about finding a local scene in a conservative Midwestern state? Not looking for additional partners, but for community.So what are y'all doing for Valentines Day with your partners?
Are y'all having separate dates or group dates?
My Vee is planning a group dinner date and book store stop.My LD partner and i have known each other for about a year now, and we love each other more than anything. In the past year, though, ive had at least three different crushes, and one of them has lasted for months. Ive talked about this with my partner, and they suggested i might be poly. They said they would accept me even if they dont really like the idea, and wed find a way to make it work. I have no idea what to think or feel at this point, and would love to just know if im poly or not. Any advice?So, some backstory.

i have been with my partner who i love to death for almost 4 years and they are “heavily” polyamorous. I’ve always known i’ve been on the NM spectrum, even before i started dating and before i met them i was not opposed to polyamory. It was not something i was seeking but i dont think it wouldve been completely out of the picture if it came up naturally. When we met, my partner got involved with 2-3 other people in similar relations as us besides me, and i was trying to keep up. Looking back at it i definitely wasn’t ready for it but my young naive self wanted to try it. It ended up being an extremely traumatic experience for me since i was only seeing those people because my partner was involved with them, and i never actually had feelings for them, nor did they for me. They werent poly, or even non monogamous for that matter and it sort of turned it a cat -rat chase for ”my”partner with everybody despising each other throughout the months it was going on( except my partner)

Like i mentioned, i am not opposed to non monogamy, and want to do it in the future except now every time i think about NM i have complete, sometimes days long traumatic breakdowns. I was left so hurt from these past events that thinking of my partner being with somebody else, even in a casual way, breaks me. I don’t know how to recover from this and i feel like i am being forced into a monogamous mindset by my own mind because of this trauma. I’m becoming the person i’ve always hated,  jealous, protective, defensive and angry all the time. I am so unhappy, because this is not who i am. It would break me even more to if i have to leave the love of my life because of this shit.

My questions are ; how can i ever have something non monogamous again?  Has anybody been in a similar situation and if so, please, how did you get back to your normal self? ….Is my relationship doomed?

edit: I want to point out that my partner is trying their best to be as good and helpful to me as possible, i am not forced to do anything i don’t want to and I am allowed to leave ( but really that is the last last resort for me, hence why i am trying to find solutions).So I am 20, I have been actively learning about polyamory since I was 15 and at this point can't date monogamously. It just doesn't feel right even though I am happy with my one current partner.

My partner is also 20 but when we met a year ago they were monogamous. I put down a boundary that I wouldn't be comfortable with that and it has been pretty good since. They have had to learn a lot and I have supported them through their struggles and pushed them to get mental health support and so on. Us as a couple have a very healthy and sustainable relationship. 

They are still getting out of the monogamous mindset, especially when it comes to dating. I have probably tried to date one other person but that didn't work out due to that person actually wanting to be more of a friend than anything. 

The dating issue isn't about me dating it is with my partner dating. We both have had sexually flings as you do but they often put me above other partners. As would be in a hierarchal polyamorous situation but personally I am uncomfortable with that. I rather they treat their other potential partners as an equal to me. They understand this completely but still struggle to get it across to others.

To clarify I am not pushing this idea onto them. If I were to date someone in a relationship like I with my partner I would want to be treated as an equal and I want my meta to feel the same. I don't want to be superior to them at all, just different because we are different people.

So this is all essentially **backstory to this point**.  

My partner has been started talking to this girl a month or so ago. Possibly longer I don't know exacts and personally I don't give fucks about that. However when they told me about her, I asked the obvious "Does she know about me?". Well the answer was no and I had to encourage them to tell her because they wanted to do it in person. Problem with that is she is 4-5 hours drive away. So eventually they did. Which is great cool it happened, I hope so. I take their word for it.

Couple of weeks later they meet up, which is cute. Love that for them. Now eventually I got jealous. One they both are in the same time zone (GMT+13) while I am in a different one (GMT). Yeah big difference. The main route of my jealousy is well I couldn't talk to my potential meta. Which yeah yeah metas don't owe me time, however I want at least bare minimum for us to get along. Especially since I plan to live with my partner in the future (no set in stone plans but it has definitely been discussed a lot) in which I would either be moving in with both of them or at least the meta visiting our place. I don't feel that it is a ridiculous thing to want. 

This was eventually sorted she started messaging me. Is an amazing person, attractive, kind and so on. (Clarify I don't want to date her just complementing her as a person). However somewhere out of the blue she has this sort of mental dip. Says to my partner that she well doesn't want to do this polyamorous situation. Removes both of us about 2-3 in the morning her time on Snapchat. Then posts on her story, to where my partner can see but I can't, in a guilt trippy sort of way. It is things like "Mr. Perfect comes along but he already has his someone" and so on. In this whole situation I tell my partner to contact her friends to ensure her safety and support. We want people to be safe here and some of the things she was posting was suggesting that she was vulnerable and need support not from I or my partner but a friend or family member.

A couple of hours afterwards, she adds my partner back so they start talking again. I genuinely have no clue what is going on. Especially since she wants to be monogamous and I am not in the business of converting people. I do however want her to feel supported and so on. She hasn't messaged me or been in contact with me which is fine. I have tried to send friendly messages of support whether she has read them or not is up in the air. 

Just through this whole debacle I have felt almost as some mediator which I am okay with but it is overall been emotionally draining. I did think she was comfortable with me but maybe it is just my partner who somewhat pushed me above her unintentionally or it was interpreted that way even though we are at different stages of our separate relationships. It just feels like it is getting complicated and that she might end up resenting me but pretending to be okay with polyamory. Like is it really possible to become polyamorous even when you've had a emotional breakdown stating you don't want that? 

I feel conflicted and really I can not do anything. I am on the other side of the world, feeling a bit hurt and overwhelmed.

Thank you for reading this far. If there are any updates I will add them here. If you have any thoughts I am open to them. However I might ignore them if I feel that they don't really understand what I have written above.I’ve been in a poly relationship with my partner for a couple months. This is new for me and He has a NP who he’s married to and has been very open and accepting of my needs and questions and boundaries. I’m very much in love with him. Yesterday I had been slightly too nosey found his NPs social media where they promote their SW. some of the videos they had on there were of both of being together and I knew he had been in them because he said he was but I didn’t think I’d ever find it or see it. I feel hurt but I also know that it’s not any of his fault that I feel this way and I had a conversation with him about it and how I was upset but I’m trying to move past it. He said he was extremely sorry I had to see that and that I didn’t sign up to watch him have sex with other people. But all day it’s been bothering me. How do I process these feelings? I’ve never been in this situation before and I don’t know how to go about thisI’m curious if there are folks who have transitioned from solo poly to nesting with a partner? I’d love to hear the good, the bad, the ugly… what issues came up, if any.

One of my partners and I are thinking about making this transition, with intention and off the escalator, and I’m just trying to evaluate if it even makes sense for me. I worked hard to get to the place I’m in right now, emotionally/financially, and I want to make sure I’m making decisions that are supportive for me.

I don’t know anyone polyamorous who’s made this switch so I’m hoping there might be folks here who have to help soundboard :)Fair warning: this is part genuine advice-seeking, and part venting about a situation I wish were different (but that I’m trying to handle with grace.)

How do y’all manage feelings of possessiveness? I’ve (31F) been seeing an amazing married poly/man (34M, we’ll call him D) for almost a year. His wife prefers DADT (proven ENM; not cheating- she just doesn’t want to know anything). He is also not out as poly to his family, so my ability to exist in his world is limited. He isn’t seeing anyone else besides his wife and me, and I don’t have any other partners at the moment, though I’m not prohibited from doing so.

Our connection is incredible- it’s sexual, and companionate, and intellectual, and romantic. He’s the D in our D/s dynamic. I love him very much, though I’ve hesitated to say those words aloud because of his wife’s boundaries, which forbids the boyfriend/girlfriend title. But I will ultimately want a nesting, primary partner/relationship structure in which I can make integrated future plans, and D knows this. I know I need to look elsewhere for that, as much as I wish it could be D, and he wishes things could be different, too.

After dragging my heels for a while, I’m starting to get the ball rolling on a poly dating/hookup platform. Unsurprisingly, this platform is full of swingers and unicorn hunters. Not to judge, because…

D and I have been talking about bringing someone / a couple into the bedroom, and had agreed (out of excitement about each other) that we’d explore this fantasy together. We discussed how, in an ideal partnership for us, generally our sex lives would be one and we could go on adventures together. But as an effectively single unicorn hunter, I’m considering putting myself in the unicorn pool too, out of fairness, and because… I’m single and free to have fun, right?

It stands to (my) reason that, by starting the dating process, and by even bringing up potentially going on trio adventures for myself, he will have more time/incentive to seek out solo connections with other people.

The feeling that arises in me from that potential situation is different than the jealousy that I feel (and am able to mitigate with compersion) with regards to his wife. It’s more of a possessive feeling; and irrationally of losing something that was never mine in the first place, or having my delicate-seeming, precious place in his life replaced by just anyone else.

Obviously, people don’t own each other, in general, and especially in Polyamory. My head knows that. But my heart’s in a tender state about this whole situation. What’s the best way to get my achy heart to listen?I thought I should post some silly/positive here.  


Last year me, my fiance, and one of our girlfriends were holding hands walking downtown together, and this lady turned to us with this bright smile and just said "FRIENDS HOLD HANDS!".  


We've only been poly for a little over a year and deeply love our girlfriends and care for our metamours (we sent gifts for them too at christmas and care packages during the year since we don't all live together).  We just love this phrase "friends hold hands" like...the idea of poly is so outside the mainstream...so when like..3 adult women are giggling and holding hands and being all gay on each other in public, it just didn't register.  Anyways I thought it was cute and wanted to add some positive vibes here :)A little glossary of this all: 

My existing partner: A
My new Partner: B
My new partners fiance: C

Timescale: Meeting B has happened within the last two months.

I'm new to Polyamory, me & A decided to make our relationship polyamourus early on in our relationship.
Me & A have recently formed a polycule with B. Me & A are very into B, & It works well for the dynamic as A & B have each other & are supportive of me waiting until I'm ready - I'm a Demisexual virgin, with severe body issues. Sexual intimacy scares me, but I know I want it eventually.

Me & B matched on FB Dating & got chatting really quickly. B was very upfront about C (who lives down South - they're long distance, a big distance at that).
Initially it was me & A being open to getting to know & possibly start dating B & C as a unit. It become increasingly aware that C was not interested in either me or A. C asked B to tell us they were not wanting to go any further. 

Me & A continued to get to know B, but we're aware that B didn't want to push out C from all social things. Occasionally we'd all video chat & C would be brash & in one call told the story of when they were younger & violently defended themselves in a situation - but definitely didn't need to defend themselves to that extent. 
Warning bells started ringing in my head about C & I tried to be as honest with B as possible without hurting their feelings. 

I continue to get to know B, & B has experienced SO much trauma from different events in their life. B is open about a lot of it & says that them & C decided to get engaged at a time when they both wanted to commit suicide, so decided the engagement would deter those feelings. B has also gone into say that C's had drinking problems in the past & describe their relationship with C over the last few months as only slightly emotionally abusive.

Flashforward to only half a week ago. Me, A & B forming our polycule. C has suddenly realised this is actually happening & is now telling B they don't want B to be with us, or at the very least stop talking about us as much with them. B feels hurt that C has lied about being okay with B being polyamourus. Big bust up happens & C threatens A & me. C takes off their engagement ring. 

Since then B & C have talked things out & are working on themselves & remaining engaged. B is still in the polycule with us. 
I'm very worried for B, I care a lot for B but will not controllingly create an ultimatum for them to leave C. Any advice on how to continue to help B see they deserve better? & should at very least break off the engagement until C really commits to seeking help.They have the whole day planned out and I can't wait to go to the wedding and it's all gonna be amazing!!! These two are in love like nobody I ever saw and they totally deserve it. 💕Hi, I’m not sure I’m posting in the right sub. I am curious if anyone can help me out together some of my thoughts and feelings? 

I’m in a committed relationship with my boyfriend, who I want to be in my life forever. He’s the best and I feel butterflies and giggles and big teary eyes of love for him all the time 🥰 
He’s my first real relationship, due to a lot of religious trauma. I’ve been comfortably out of the religion for 10 years and now I’m experiencing my first desires to still have sex with others. It’s pretty frequent that I think about it. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year and I want to continue this relationship for as long as he wants to be with me too. We both have discussed how the plan is to stay together because we’re in love and it’s cute :) I’ve mentioned polyamory quite a bit and he seems to have not ever fully rejected the idea. He’s a quiet guy, the most he’s said is, “I like dating you.” He’s also very traditional with some millennial spin. I’m very nervous to bring it up to him as a real discussion. I am saddened by the thought of him being hurt that he’s not enough, if that’s the case. And I wouldn’t know how to make him feel like I mean it that I want to stay with him. 

I actually don’t want to make this change in our life right now. And I’m not really sure I want to in the future. I do want to make mine and my boyfriends relationship strong and full of love for a lot more years, just us. 

The reason I came here to share my thoughts is this: I daydream about having small intimate relationships with a few of my very close friends. Not all of my close friends. A few of them I’m not attracted to in that way at all. But it has been a few years now where I on and off have had “fleeting” fantasies of being with these few friends that I am attracted to. And I feel this… guilt? In my fantasies my current partner is my primary partner that I want to build a more traditional life with. And still be free to express attraction and intimate friendship/relationships with these one or two friends. I’m not sure what this makes me, since thinking this way wasn’t allowed most of my life. And I’m not sure how or when to present this to my boyfriend. I mean maybe I could even show him this post sometime? 

For a little bit of background, I met all of these friends before I met my boyfriend. Years before I met him me and my friend lived together and one night I let my hand linger on her hand for… science. And later that night she confessed she would sleep with me, and got in my bed and held my hand. I froze and didn’t make any moves because I kind of couldn’t believe it. I had just lost a friend to fooling around and I did not want to lose her but I also wanted her… She waited and I stayed frozen. She got up but was gentle, and got in her own bed. The next morning I tried to bring it up, I wanted to explain my feelings. When I started with, “I’m sorry about last night-“ “What about last night?” “Oh uhm, you know” and I looked at her and she said, “I don’t remember anything from last night.” So I said ok and we never talked about it again. 

That was 5 years ago, and we’re still good friends today. Only friends. 

I used to think about it infrequently, but lately it’s been on my mind as we’ve started talking more. It’s why I’ve started to think more seriously about not being monogamous. I’m just looking to see if anyone has been in a position like this. I can’t tell if I’m being a terrible girlfriend for having these thoughts and feelings. My boyfriend and I are really close,I think this would be big territory to enter. 

Anyway, I know it’s a long read, thank you in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this.My kid (my girlfriends kid who has adopted me as her father)  turned 11 yesterday, and the polycule (minus my girlfriends wife, she had to work) wanted to do a hot pot night. If you don't know, hot pot is putting a big boiling bowl of broth on the table, then dipping thin meat, noodles, veg, etc in it. It's really fun and we love doing it, but hoboy is it work.

First one of us can't eat chicken, so we gotta make sure none of the broth is chicken based, easy enough. Then I only eat spicy, but the kid only eats non-spicy, and then my fiance wants "options\~" (whatever that means). So we end up with three pots of broth. Then the kid wants to sit next to mom, but also wants to sit next to me, but I'm sitting near the spicy pot and moms on the other end near the beef pot. But it's okay because kid will sit next to her "uncle" (mine and my husbands fiance). Then my boyfriend hates pork, but girlfriend likes pork, so we need both pork and beef. THEN the kid wants TORTELLINI, which it's her birthday so of course she got to boil some damn tortellini thrown in there along with the bok choy and udon noodles. But let's not forget my husband likes to "experiment" so he made a giant fork full of all the meats and just dunks it on into the spicy broth. But oops its too spicy for him so let's get him some milk.

Then the night ends with me itching my nose ring with spicy broth hands and having to dunk my nose in a glass of milk while crying over the bathroom sink.

Being in a large polycule can be really, really fun, but also really, really chaotic.

&#x200B;

Edit to clarify, my husband didn't take literally all the meat we had, we just had a wide variety so he took his portion of each to dunk. I ate what he couldn't handle, as is per our marriage agreement. I didn't post here for a while. 
Some context. I'm married to Don. Tanja is married to Bianca and I'm in a relationship with Tanja. So Bianca is my metamour. Don and Tanja are besties. 

Please do not judge me for this, I try real hard to make this work. 

Don is totally fine with me and Tanja being together. But Bianca is not so much. We used to be all friends and then Tanja and I started dating. Tanja and Bianca were open, but not necessary Poly. Tanja wants to be Poly and Bianca struggles with it. Bianca is insecure and feels their not enough for Tanja, but they project it on me. Making me 'evil', like I'm stealing their time with Tanja, Bianca told me I'm An intruder. 

Tanja en Bianca talked about and Bianca tries to accept that Tanja and I want our Poly relationship. Bianca does this for Tanja. But I notice it's Often very difficult to meet with Tanja or I get snidy comments when i see Bianca. I notice that Bianca unconciously makes it harder for me and Tanja to settles dates etc etc. Tanja talks about it and tells me Bianca is really working on themself and their insecurities. Bi refuses to talk about anything personal to me, just surface. So communication ..nope. except once they poured all that they dissaproved over me in an emotional moment. 

Problem is, this always comes back to me in some way. Through Tanja.
I notice how Bianca feels like I don't treat Tanja good enough and finds me unthankfull when i don't like something or discuss a dating plan etc. Bianca finds I should be happy with the time I get, I already take so much. Bianca finds they didn't choose for this so doesn't want it to affect them whatsoever, which I know is naive, but if I would say something like that that would be totally out of line. 
I'm walking on eggshells here. 
I know Bianca is nesting partner etc, but they make it such a powerplay. I don't know how to deal with it. 

It affects both my relationships. And it makes me feel so inferieur. Tanja talks about it to Bianca, but is very protective and doesn't want to Hurt them. 

This is all very toxic. I worked on my relationship with Tanja so hard, I don't want to give up. But damn, idk if I can do this.
If I end it, it's gonna be real weird for Tanja and Don, because of this history. All of this is also really hard on Don who notices me being Hurt and struggling. It's really hard not to take it personal. 

Tltr: my metamour is too ensecure for Poly, but tries to for their partner. These insecurities come to me in unpleasent ways. They dissaprove of me.

Edit: made full names. Apologies for assuming the insecurities

EDIT, I hear what you are saying. Tanja invited me into their life whithout actual real consent from Bianca. Meaning no harm ofcourse. This was confusing for me, but explains why Bianca always seems to want me to 'know my place'. This is between Bianca and Tanja. I shouldn't believe that Bianca is ok with it, because reality tells me otherwise. I should take a step back, because the place Tanja offers me, does not exist.So, I met two people online recently who are a couple and one of them and myself started to hit it off really REALLY well. Long story short we both really like each other now but I stopped it because it's not fair to the other person and I don't want to come between things in their initial relationship. In a twist, the other person who I'm just friends with likes me too but I don't like them in the same way. Im trying to commit and get closer with both of them now as they want to start a 3 person relationship but I'm finding it really hard. Any advice?So I'm part of a closed polycule where essentially each person has two partners. I had a revelation recently during a bit of pillow talk with my partner. We got to talking about how we are actually really content where we are and how the two partners thing works well with our schedules. I am a bit insecure sometimes still when it comes to the relashionship I have with my older gf (less so as time goes on but still once in a while and she understands) so I asked her "do you feel like anything is missing? Do your husband and I fulfill you emotionally?"


My heart felt so good when she responded, without hesitation, "Absolutly" and she followed that by rolling over to face me and saying "the two of you overlap in all the right areas and each of you fulfills me in a way the other can't sometimes" 

At first my insecurities spiked -how do I not fulfill her what am I missing- then my rational mind reminded me that this exact situation is what polyamory is about. So I kissed her and said the first thing that came to my mind "we are like yin and yang" to which she smiled and nodded.

Since that moment I've been doing something I always say is not a great idea in polyamory: I have compared myself to my meta. But this time it felt good. We are both into health and fitness (he's a power lifter I'm an body builder), we both have similar outlooks on things like respect, family, and politics. And soon we will both be in law enforcement (I'm in the process of becoming a CO after which I intend to join the PD).

But he's also into things like MMA, Metal Music, and working in his truck. I practice Judo, and occasionally listen to metal in the gym but outside of pil and tire changes I'm not mechanically inclined.

I am really into things like arts and literature. Shakespear, fashion, fantasy books, advanced personal hygiene regiments.

The summary is that he is more of a manly man and I'm more artsy and probably a little metro. And the more I think about it the cooler a concept it is for me. And the more secure I feel with her and our polycule. I found a meta who is the same in all the right ways and different enough in all the ways that make it so that together my partner feels she has everything she needs.

Hopefully this has been at least half as interesting to you all as it was to me when I realized it. I'd love to read stories of polycules on similar paths (especially in the case of only two partners but I like to hear about any number).I wrote this letter for my spouse of almost 10 years. I haven’t sent it, and I doubt I will, but I want to know if I am just too inside my head. There’s a lot of context there that just won’t be available to y’all as the readers, but even gut instinct responses may help me orient myself better. It’s honestly probably a bit confusing but writing it helped me clarify what my feelings are.

I’m not looking to die or anything drastic like that. So don’t worry about me. I just feel a bit helpless.


“I want to precede all of this with the reminder that I am working on managing my mental health better. That a lot of my dissatisfaction and melancholy is driven by a coating of an ever-present dread and numbness that I have had trouble shaking off for a while; many of these thoughts aren’t new. Weed or alcohol takes the edge off temporarily, but I know where that leads, and it cycles into this desperation I have, of not feeling like I have an option or a way out that leaves us unscathed, so I delay.

We’ve had multiple conversations on the state of our relationship, our thoughts on ourselves and each other, and how we are for the most part trending towards something good, wholesome, and worth fighting for. And I yearn for the freedom to make good on what we’ve set out to do: with poly and our partners-both existing and potential-as well as our nonnormative perceptions and way of life and all that entails.

But I struggle. Most days I’m able to stave it off but good days really are good; I feel the passion and energy filling my body to the brim, and my desire to shape it into something grand and befitting of what I expect myself to be capable of, bursts out of me. But I struggle once I start, and after a short period of time I am mucked by the weight of my life and its responsibilities, the concern of not doing well enough, the guilt of where I’ve left pieces of my existence and connections in disarray or on a semi-permanent hold, and my persistent inaction to address many of these things.
And this cycles on and on and on and on, sometimes with greater emphasis and other times as a minor adjustment. As you’ve said before, they come in waves, and they have their crests and troughs and I accept that. It’s just difficult. And these waves, I can feel them becoming overbearing over time. They are made more distinct as my life with you trends towards becoming more stable. 

When I feel like I don’t have to worry for your health-emotionally/mentally/physically-a majority of my being feels relief and joy. You are in great health, and my time and efforts no longer have to be spent mostly on worrying/caring for you. 

“We’ve overcome this hurdle together, and only good things can come from this!” is the appropriate mantra.

But then the rest of me feels the impact of this burden that I’ve carried all this time, the part of myself that I’ve put on hold, because I can only take care of one person at a time well. With the new stability comes the raging torrents that I’ve dammed up and compartmentalized for years. 

I cherish your newfound vitality, and how you’ve taken it full stride. Making up for lost time and experiences, and taking back what’s been taken from you. Even discovering yourself better, and coming to terms with who you are. Truly, I love and treasure you and the journey you’ve taken to get to where you are. 
I just, I feel bad for how I feel outside of that. I feel left behind. Your health was something that we’ve worked through together. Now that I have space to work on myself, I find myself alone. Even beyond that, you’ve found yourself someone else to truly enjoy your vitality with you, and I feel separate from that. 

And I don’t know how to fix that. 

My desires conflict, between wanting what I truly feel is best for you-which is all that you’ve desired for so long-and wanting to make up for the time and experiences that I’ve lost with you, not only shared by others but feels taken from me. 

When will I have the time and energy again to enjoy you as you are now? I’m grinding to maintain our way of life as well as trying to improve myself, both of which don’t really leave a lot of time and space left for you-which gets shared with others. And I tell myself that I’m being unreasonable but I can’t find reason for these feelings to go away. 

So I’m stuck, hoping some outside force changes either my perception or my predicament. I’m still actively working on myself as I’ve mentioned, but the progress is slow and difficult, especially as I need to process new, more immediate things as they come up, pushing aside what was already there needing to be thought on, waiting to be properly judged by me.

The only reason I was able to process all this today was because I took the time, from work, from you, and from everyone else, to process what we talked about the other day, about my meta coming inside you-how because of your health it wasn’t something I’ve been allowed to do-and how it contrasted with receiving flowers in the office from you the next day (due to Valentines, unrelated to that conversation I assume). And it’s not specifically that instance, but what it represented. I think we’ve stagnated.

Instead of feeling completely elated about the flowers, I found myself wanting for more, someone to care for me after not really having been cared for for so long. 
It’s what I seek in these dating apps; I don’t actually want another relationship, but I yearn for an intimacy that doesn’t have the baggage I’ve accumulated.

I can’t even do that; the pool for an married poly guy who’s just not interesting outside of a real life event is ever so small.

I can’t help but fantasize about running away, leaving everything behind. A fresh, new start, where my decisions and actions aren’t encumbered or mired by the past or present. I think things would be simpler, and the lines clear. What do I want for myself, and can I get there by myself, with no one else to answer to but me?

Or fantasize about things just stopping. Not dying. I abhor the idea, the pain and suffering that goes with that, even beyond myself and into the hearts of those left behind. But ceasing to exist, everything that I am, wiped away? I don’t know if I’d really mind that.

These are my thoughts, and it’s what I think about consistently in a disordered, chaotic fashion when I don’t write them down. It’s not really a plea or a cry for help, but I want to get unstuck. I want to move forward. So as best I can, I submit these feelings to you in the hope that you understand where I’m at.”My wife and I are pondering the merits and symbolism of not inviting our individual partners into our bed when the other isn't home. To dedicate that space to just us and to utilize the guest room or other spaces in the home for our perspective partners. We'd like to get an idea of how common this practice is and the pros and cons involved. What do you do and why?I'm in a new triad relationship and I love spending time with my partners, add to it NRE 🙂. I am also in a loving nested relationship and work full time and travel for at least a week in a month. I meet my triad partners about twice a week. My nested partner did feel like I'm not giving enough time to him, but now is growing used to it. However, I am still unsure how to manage scheduling so that no one feels left out, and issues don't develop later. More importantly, how can I work schedule in which I manage to get some me time too.I have worked in the adult entertainment industry for 10 years on and off. 

My husband has always supported me and made me feel nothing but loved. Last year, we made the decision to open our relationship and after some conversations and thought we started dating other people a few months ago. 

Some people have been completely open to what I do, others not so much. One person in particular that I’ve seen a few times now still doesn’t know if he feels comfortable with it. I was thinking about inviting him to sit in during one of my work shifts to see what it’s really like, and maybe that would ease his mind. Is this a good idea or an absolutely catastrophic one? I really like this person and I truly want to make things work. To be clear, I am always by myself when I’m working, I don’t make content with a partner.Hello, my favorite part of the internet- I have two romantic partners and two sexual partners. I live in a hierarchy because my girlfriend needs to feel like my number 1 to feel safe (not because she was first or because I particularly wanted it that way), which I accepted. My second sexual partner and I have only been seeing each other for a month, keeping things causal. I have the most sexual chemistry with this man than I’ve ever had with anyone, it’s intense and makes me have a huge 13 yr old girl crush on him. I think about him all the time (again mostly sexually) and it makes me feel like I’m not being fair to my primary. What the fuck do I do?My partner (35,f), her partner (31,m) and I (30,f) live a kitchentable V relationship. All three of us work, and none of us are living together. We meet once a month to have a nice brunch and discuss when we spent time with our partner, go on holidays and see her family. 

Usually we both see her 2 times a week. I‘ve had sleep issues in december, early januar.  So we decided not to spent the night with eachother until my sleep issues are solved and unless we both have a free day the next day. 
Now she really had a rough time at work and generaly a lot to do.

This weekend she planned to spent Saturday with her partner. And Sunday with me. Now her partner wants also to spent Friday with her (fine with me) and I expressed my wish to spent saturday to sunday night with her. However she needs some qualitytime alone which I completely understand. We discussed possible solutions and She will discuss it with her partner. My metamour and I always try to make things possible even spontaneously for oneanother and her. However I feel a little scared as I feel I have no control over the situation. Eversince a relative died last year it is not so easy for me to not be in control of things. Doing therapy and my partner and metamour know.

So my question:
How do you guys deal with your needs not being met?

Any ideas on how to deal with the occasional feeling of dissapointment?

Poly is about trust in your partner and letting go of control. Any polyfolks having similar issues after the death of a loved one?UPDATE: Appreciate all the feedback. I was pretty upset when I wrote this post, and I'm so glad I reached out here before I made any dramatic decisions about ending the relationship. After some reflecting, I realized I was triggered into flight mode by some past trauma. I reached out and explained my feelings and we're both feeling a lot better. We both have some work to do, clearly. But we decided we want to keep doing it together :)

Hey folks. I would love stories, tips, words of caution, or advice from those of you who have attempted to "downshift" a relationship that has gotten a bit complicated to something simpler or more casual?

More context on my situation:

One of my partners (I've been seeing for about 5 months and it has gotten pretty serious, even though we only see each other 1-2 times/week) has been having some jealousy triggers that I've been trying to help him work through. However, he recently had a trigger moment and reacted in a way that left me feeling really hurt and confused, and like all my efforts to reassure him are just not working.

He's been profusely apologetic. I know he's trying, but I'm still feeling hurt and confused, and I'm not sure I want to continue putting myself in a position where I have to expend this much emotional energy. But I don't want to break up, either. He's a great person and I know he wants to work it out.

I'm wondering if we might be able to "take a break" for a few weeks, and then when we've cooled down a bit maybe we can try and date in a more casual way? Like, no more deep conversations about "us," no more working through emotional issues together, just having fun and keeping it light and sexy?

I feel like he'd be open to this, but I always appreciate the insights from this community before trying something I've never tried before.I matched with this guy on tinder his profile said nothing about him having a girlfriend or anything. We talked on the phone he tells me he’s in an open relationship. I said okay thanks for telling me this does not bother me open to it just a bit of a red flag they just moved to the area wanted to make new friends so I invited them out 3 times they canceled every single time. We did not speak for about 2 weeks. He apologized we made plans for coffee he wanted to bring his girlfriend. I’m not interested in women sexually. I told him this and he said “I don't get romantically involved with anyone who's not into both of us” which I agreed is far so I said we can all just be friends. We all ended up going for coffee it’s was good and they were very sweet, just seemed like there was an elephant in the room.Hey guys, I have come before to this sub seeking for advice and often it has been very helpful. 
Today I feel a bit confused, I’ll explain why: 
I am a person that likes to make details for the people I care about. Small acts that sometimes cheer up the other ones. 
Right now my partner is in quarantine since a week and I have tried to propose visiting him from the street, taking baskets of food, watching shows together, and other stuff that over these two years we have learned as society. 
For context, I’ve seen that her friends and neighbors around the block are also doing this type of stuff for him (like the other day an old lady pass by her house and talked with him trough the window). 
However, I feel that the actions done by me make him uncomfortable, or he just ignore them, or try to talk me out of doing them (when they involve plans. For example he don’t like surprises so I try to tell him beforehand if I’m thinking of a cool “surprise” to do). 

Anyway, after two days of noticing that my actions were not super welcomed, I stopped to propose stuff because I don’t want to push him. 

However, before (months ago) he has complained that I am not doing that much for him and to take care of him when he is in difficult situations. 

So I feel confused because he emotionally downloads a lot white me when he is in crisis (he calls or send voice notes for me to listen and be of support) . Moreover he has mentioned in the past my lack of “like coming and making me feel accompanied and not alone”. But now for example that I’m doing these things he acts as if they were a burden. 

I am not sure how to read him. Maybe is my lack of people skills. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and if you have any advise or point of view I would be very glad to read it.So I’ve been getting close with a friend for the past few days and, we have so much in common I love it. I am in a closed triad but, flirting is cool. I kind of have a crush on my new friend and, because of that crush the first thing I did when I came home was love up on my partners because of how the crush is making me feel. I guess my question is does this sound normal to anyone ? Sorry if this makes no sense.Hello…my husband and I started out as swingers and slowly transformed our relationship into polyamory, dating another couple exclusively, for almost three years. This other couple is having marriage difficulties. Three of the four of us want to continue dating. The 4th (the other guy), says he wants to, but wants to be ok in his marriage first, and intentionally or not, is stringing the rest of us along if he wants to continue this or not. Help?! I honestly feel he’d like to end it for the sake of his marriage, which I totally understand, but won’t, because he 1) is afraid of the after-effects with his wife and 2) doesn’t seem to care about my relationship with him. Advice on how to proceed and not be a bitch or a helpless needy heartbroken “girlfriend”?I'm in a situation with a friend that is sexual. For the last year we had just been fooling around a little bit but didn't actually have sex bc we were worried it would ruin our friendship. I had a crush on him at one time, he made it clear he didn't have any feelings. Over time my feelings faded and at this point I have zero romantic interested in him. No spark or anything and I know 100% for sure I wouldn't want a relationship with him. I don't know whether I'd call myself poly exactly, but I tend to not feel like monogamy is right for me. Anyway, so after a year of fooling around and not actually having sex, we finally did have sex. It feels like everything has changed for me though. I don't know how to describe it, it just feels awkward, weird and uncomfortable and I worry about him not being as interested in being my friend anymore. I'd be interested in hearing anyone's experience with this type of situation and if it ruined the friendship or if one person became less interested in the friendship afterwards. 

A lot of people tell me that I am in denial about my feelings towards him because I experience jealousy even at the idea of him dating or having sex with someone else. It just happens to be that neither of us have been dating or having sex with anyone since we started this whole thing. It's not exactly intentional, some of it was due to covid and just lack of trying. I don't know if I'd be able to tolerate it when (it's inevitable) he does start dating. He also has some jealousy about the idea of me doing the same. People think we are lying to ourselves about our feelings, but I know that I am definitely not his type and that he's not at all attracted to me. I know that I don't feel any romantic feelings or any type of spark or anything like that towards him anymore. So why the jealousy and feelings of possessiveness? Maybe the friendship is doomed since we both feel possessive and jealous towards one another and we both are going to start dating at some point?I’m in the process of TTC with my (31f) partners (28m, 36 m) and I was curious if others had good advice/their own stories to share about the process of being pregnant/going through a pregnancy with multiple partners. 

I split my time between houses as equally as schedules allow, and me and my nesting partner are in the process of buying a house closer to my longer distance partner so they can be more available for appointments and other baby things. 

How did this situation go for you, do you have any advice or pointers? We’re all very excited and super happy about adding to our family 🥰


edit: i guess i didn’t realize that there weren’t (many) other people who have done this or are willing to share their experience. Thank you for your input and suggestions ☺️I’m just wondering if there’s any way to know if you’re not polyamorous, like any signs or stuff like that! thank you!OK, so this is a really vulnerable post for me.
I'm a man in a longterm monogamous relationship with a woman who's starting to express desire to explore other people. She insists she really loves me and wants to be together (with our 2 kids and shared home) but the idea has broken my heart.

I told her it hurt my feelings, but I really do want her to speak her truth and find whatever her best version of happiness is. I told her as much. But now she's suppressing the feelings saying she wishes she never said anything. I feel like time has allowed her to open up parts of herself she'd never thought to explore, and while I want her exclusively, I don't own her and I want her to be able to grow as a person if that's what she wants.

I'm just beginning to understand polyamory, and I'm not sure she's even put that notion into words, but I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced something really similar where a family was involved. I know asking her to choose between a family life and an authentic love life for herself is an impossible choice, but I'm honestly just so lost. I don't have any polyamorous friends, so any advice would be appreciated!Never posted before, my primary, of 5 years, relationship is breaking down as he isn't trying anymore. He moved out a month ago and well I think it was the final nail.. I can't remember when I didn't organise things or make us go out..or we had any intimacy other then cuddling. What doesn't make it easy is my new secondary is super giving, loving, open and adventurous . My primary says the only time we talk is about polyamory, nothing else and well thats true, we only share music and gigs otherwise. I dont know what to talk to him about anymore...It feels like my primary has become my friend and not my lover anymore. What should I do any advice?Just a great feeling when you can openly discuss with your partner some conversational road blocks you've run into with a potential partner.

Nothing more, no hidden agenda, just happy for the support being poly brings in unique situations like this.Hi!

I've been reflecting on my past relationships, which ended a few months ago.

I'm struggling to let go of certain things, and I'm kind of curious to know what you would've done in this situation.

&#x200B;

**Context**I was in a relationship with Kai and Mandy (I was the hinge basically). Kai and Mandy knew each other but weren't close.

&#x200B;

**What happened**

I bought Kai a ticket for a concert which was on Kai's birthday. Kai got very excited about the two of us doing something together.

The next day, Mandy mentioned the concert and said it would be nice to go. I said we were going to go with Kai, as it was Kai's birthday and all...  
My communication here wasn't very fluid as I got very nervous and tense about the whole thing. I was already anticipating it would be a mess (I guess I should've been calmer and more clear about it...)

Mandy said that they understood it was Kai's birthday, but could I please ask Kai if they could come as well, so it would be the 3 of us, as Mandy really wanted to go to that concert.

I then mentioned we already had the tickets, which were numbered, so it would be a bit weird cause we wouldn't even be sitting together...

After that, Mandy got super angry and felt abandoned and sad about the whole thing. They started bringing up other issues and essentially said I was putting my relationship with Kai before ours.

&#x200B;

I told Kai about the whole situation, expressing I felt it was a bit of a mess, and also asking if they would've minded if the 3 of us went.

Kai  got super angry, said that Mandy had too much influence on my decisions, that I was too wishy-washy and that no, they wouldn't want another person there at the concert.

&#x200B;

In the end, Kai and I went to the concert, but it's left this really bittersweet memory of it. Every time I think of that situation I want to cry and I feel really guilty and terrible about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Thanks for reading** if you made it through that...

How do you think this could've been handled in a better way? So it didn't end up with everyone being angry or frustrated.We are new to actually trying enm/polyam. And do not want our relationship to fail or turn our lives absolutely upside down without a decent reason. If we happen to fall for someone else more or they want kids all of that is up for discussion but me and her have shared we do not want more kids or someone living with us. That we prefer to have our home. 

Long story short wife and I have been married for 10 years, we've tried being open a number of ways in the past with a few times it ends poorly and we close to work on ourselves.  She has cheated in the past via text and actually cheating multiple times. But still strong and trying this out. 

This time around we are being as open as we can be. I'm trying real relationships instead if hookups. She is being way more open with me about this new guy. Because I told her if we don't do it kitchen table style then it probably will feel like the past and her hiding things again.   Most nights we spend talking about our relationships and comforting each other. Our goal is to normalize this between us and our other relationships and check our comfort levels.  Eventually leading to fewer check-ins, more comfort and having the trust and understanding that we are both still ok with this. 

We have few rules, condoms are a must, no anal because it can easily go wrong and cause more issues it is cool to do just needs to be right and not pushed., no fluid transfer (there was an incident and just not cool lol) no shared toys and not our bedroom. These are things that affect both of us and we have 100% agreed to them. Some were hers as well.  Anal and swallowing are the 2 that it affects our relationship as well. Anal because we still have lives and when it goes wrong or even right it can cause days or so of pain that limits us. And swallow / transfers because one point it regurgitated and I tasted it. So that got taken down for now just until we can find a medium for those. My boundary being that I won't kiss or be intimate with her if she does swallow, and anal because of a bad experience. Toys are for the relationship only and must be purchased new. Like I'm not using someone else's and we're not using them with someone else.  That is our marital bed and without explicitly being ok with it from all parties involved it is not to be shared with others.   We both agreed and make sure that our boundaries and rule is spoken before any relationship really gets to a certain point. Nobody is going into it without knowing these things and they have full right to discuss them with us or individually. But we don't have to agree.  Like if they say they only have sex raw. Then I guess they're not having sex. Just that simple. 

Recently this guy I figured was kind of like me but just single was pretty cool (he knows she talks about him with me) however in our recent talks, it's been made apparent that he is ?testing? Boundaries of our relationship.  Saying condoms, he replies with a sad kind of comment. No anal, he replies with I guess that's cool.  She says take it slow, he replies with that's cool I can do that and I can rock your world. Like small things that are nudging the lines.  I trust she won't break those for someone, or that if it is serious enough that they would be open for a discussion about opening up more. 
 
But I'm also a bit insecure about things. Being that I'm pretty tall and bigger guy, I'm very average downstairs. 5-6", 5" circumference. So things seem smaller to me. So I pride myself on my abilities. Like I last long, keep rhythm, basically I know for fact of being told in and out of relationships that I'm very talented in that department.  
 
The most recent one hit me. I want her to have great sex as well. But also I feel pretty upset about it. I can't really pin why.   Like reasoning is that is what I'm good at and competition? I'm insecure about my size?  I'm really not sure why I'm not cool with it, and not sure how to go about finding the reason to help get over it.  Is there any questions I should ask myself or her? Is it just presex jitters that I'm having and will dissipate over time?  Any help on that front is appreciated.Let's say hypothetically you were opening up your relationship for the first time, and you and your partner were looking to date other people. Then let's say you both happened to match with the same person on an app. What do you do next? Do you move forward with the original goal of dating separately, but with the same person? Is that even possible? Or are you just now dating together?

What issues do you think would arise from this situation? What should the outside person be aware of?Hey guys, 
Lately my partner has been seeing a fwb and they have developed a dom/sub relationship and I'm not sure how comfortable I am with it. In our BDSM relationship I am the dom, and I'm not handling them having another Dom very well. If you have any advice that can help me battle those gremlins it would be appreciated. Thank you.I (Male 26) have been in a polyamorous relationship with two females for 5 months now. I was in a relationship with my first GF for 7.5 years before we met our other partner. Throughout that entire time, we have never had an issue with ED. And most of the time (95%+) of the time my penis works perfectly fine in FMF. However, every now and then I lose my erection midway during sex. I don’t know what the reason for this is, this has never happened in such frequency before. We have sex every day and I experience ED pretty much once a week. 

Any advice?I don’t know if I’m in the right place, but I believe me and my an incredibly close friend of mine have a queerplatonic relationship. There are some aspects that feel romantic, like wanting to cuddle and going out on dates, but that’s it. I’m allo. She’s asexual. 

When we first met years ago I asked her out, but her never been in a relationship before, she told me she wasn’t comfortable with it. I accepted that. And continued our relationship as friends. We grew incredibly close over the years. She’s the closest thing to me, which is odd because I’ve only felt that with romantic relationship. 

We defend each other fiercely, we’re each other’s main support. We started a joke years ago that one day we’re going to get married. But it evolved Into an actual goal. For background, I’ve been married before an can never see myself doing it again. But can see myself marrying my best friend because it’s the most healthy and positive dynamic I’ve ever had. 

Sometimes it all FEELS romantic. Like I acknowledge that she’s attractive but that’s it. Where the boundaries blur I think is the possession we have over each other. 

For example, things between me and her became iffy when I began a relationship with my partner. They got along well enough, but my friend did express she was afraid of me going distant. After we talked it through, all was well. Until… my partner cheated on me. And now they exist on opposite spectrums of my life. My friend now hates my partner and has become increasingly protective. And my partner has just accepted now that’s she’s better off not coming between us. 

In retrospect, I told my partner when we started dating how important my friend is to me and to date me would mean also accepting her and our dynamic. 

Friend sent me a tiktok about platonic life partners. That led me to reading about queerplatonic relationships. That leads me to believe that’s what we have. Every now and then, romantic feelings will stir, but they are always rooted in my friendship. Like I’ll want to hold hands and cuddle and call her my wife one day. 

But I also love my partner. 

So is this queerplatonic? And Becuase I have such intense love for both in my heart, would this be considered polyamory?

EDIT: yes my partner knows. She knows about it all. I’ve been honest about me and my friend from the beginning because I do realize and understand that some people may not be okay with that. Which is perfectly fine. My partner does think it’s weird that we are affectionate in a sense but I have told her it’s platonic, and I don’t want anything romantic with her.TLDR: How do you know when to break up when your partner is basically a comet, and there’s really nothing “wrong” per se?

I’ve been dating this person for a few years. In the beginning there was some sex and romance, but not so much anymore, partially because I’ve come to terms with being gray ace, and partially because of covid/just growing apart/not making plans. We say “I love you” and go on dates very occasionally (once or twice every couple of months). It’s always nice to see them, but recently I’ve found myself not wanting to kiss or snuggle or do anything romantic really. I don’t really want to sleep over either, I’d rather be alone in my own bed. I’ve been racking my brain to try to figure out what romance means to me, and whether I want that with them.

I want to have a conversation about shifting our relationship to a friendship, I think, but I’m so bad at this. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing because I don’t feel like I have good enough “reasons” and I don’t want to make them sad.I’ve got a history of dating avoidant people who really struggle with understanding their own emotions and then communicating their feelings and needs.

Once again I’ve found myself freshly in love with someone who is both new to poly and isn’t great at communicating about their inner world. We have talked about emotional intimacy and support and agreed this was part of our dynamic. They are also dating two other people, one of whom is their primary partner previously monogamous with - and the transition has been hard for that couple. 

In the last month my date has been withdrawn , distant and down. When I’ve asked about it, they expressed that they 1) have a hard time sharing their emotions and 2) are confused about what to share or not share with me, particularly regarding how they are being affected by their other relationships. 

Since then, I feel them becoming more avoidant - which is, well,  awfully triggering for me :-/ because I have no idea what’s going on! I don’t need to know details, but basic information about how they are feeling would be so helpful for me (yes, I have told them this)…..and this kind of communication also feels like a prerequisite skill for good poly dating, no? 

Im going to have a conversation with them soon  - do you have any advice for how to talk about this…..how can I support them in learning communication around their feelings? Or about poly communication in general!?My wife recently had a break down about us dating other people, she wanted to pull back from communicating with or dating others. Now we are very new to poly, so she’s only been on a couple dates, and me zero. But when it was getting close to me going on some first dates, it got “real” to her and she panicked. Which is ok in a sense. I’m glad she told me and didn’t keep trying to push forward if she wasn’t comfortable. Unfortunately, it made it so I had to ax all my communications with new dating prospects and I felt like an idiot. 
She is now going to therapy (with a poly positive therapist), which is great and I appreciate her continuing forward with this. 
However, downside is I am just sitting here waiting for her to be good with poly life again and or decide she doesn’t want to do it at all and go back to monogamy. And again, I will be fine with whatever the outcome is, because I value her and our family unit. 
Problem is, since her emotional breakdown, I have no excitement about being open to dating again. Reason? I don’t want to get my hopes up again, start conversations, dating, only to have it pulled out from underneath me if she has another breakdown. It’s shitty, and it doesn’t feel worth it. 
Advice?Hey guys I have a question! So me and my primary spend a lot of time together, we work together, we have a few nights a week together, and we run errands together when we have the time to do so. We’re both very busy people and they have someone they’re talking to right now who they’ve been friends with for about 9 months, I am not talking to anyone else atm, which is cool, I’m happy for them! But sometimes it’s a little frustrating because when we’re spending time together they’re constantly texting each other which I know is inevitable I don’t mind them texting. I spend more physical time with my partner but sometimes I just want to have time for myself with my partner where their focus is solely on me. I’m a very understanding person and I know they only get physical time with each other once a week because their schedules don’t match up, but I make sure during that time not to message my partner 100 times throughout the night so they have time together. It just sucks when I’m talking to my partner they’ll text them back in the middle of me speaking or when we’re doing an activity like playing a game or something they’re constantly on their phone. It makes me feel like they don’t want to be spending time with me but I also know they don’t have a lot of time together so I get a little nervous bringing it up.. is this something y’all would bring up? And if so how would you bring it up? Does it seem too controlling? Because that’s not my intention I just want to have us time.. advice needed please.My partner is recently asking to open up the relationship. We have been together for 4 - 5 years, and he does have a significant history of infidelity. We worked through it (it was not easy) and I have encouraged him to see a therapist who believes that he has a sex addiction. 

He’s recently come to the conclusion that perhaps he fits into the poly/non ethical monogamy world and I’m worried - for a lot of reasons. I’m grieving for the love that I thought we could have had and realizing that I don’t fit into his future anymore. However, putting myself and my feelings to the side, How can this be good for him? I wouldn’t tell an alcoholic to hang out at a bar. Would love to hear perspective from those with a history of sex addiction and/or hyper sexuality. Did it make you happy? Did it make things worse?I'm mono by choice but I am dating someone who is poly. So my gf has encouraged me to date someone more local. I'm honestly apprehensive about this because I'm concerned about now having to spend on 2 persons instead of 1.

I'm not broke but I am trying to be frugal given the rising cost of things. Even with my current relationship we try to keep things cheap and cheerful. Going out on dates can be quite expensive where I live. There is only so much free or creative stuff we can do.

Seeking advice!Hello

I am newer to this space and just trying to gage other people frequencies to dating. 

Wife and I are newly ENM and have started dating. I understand the lifestyle is that she get far more dates than I (M)

I understand it’s a personal comfort level thing. However I am interested in knowing from more experienced people. How often do you go out with someone outside you NP? How many other partners do you have?
Looking to Learn what dynamics can make this successful and fun

ThanksHey there!

I’m asking this out of curiosity. Some of my friends are in a polycule and me and my SO occasionally hook up with one or several people in this polycule. We always practice safe sex but i saw two of them having sex without a condom, while he has a nesting partner too and doesn’t use condoms with her either.

A fee weeks later a girl from this polycule comes to me and asks where i get my regular STD checks, because they are really expensive where she gets them. She told she wants to get tested because she wants to stop using condoms with yet another partner, who is married to another woman.

First of all i find it beautiful how they all practice ENM, i know the members of this group and they all treat each other so well. It’s just great. 

Her question made me realize that they maybe eventually all have sex with one another without protection. Which is fine off course, when everyone is tested. I would not do it so quickly myself, because i would need a very very solid bond of trust with all of the people and i have trust issues.

How so you guys handle this kind of situations?A while back I made a post about how my primary was trying to have me make up with an abusive ex who she was still dating. Despite the advice I received from everyone in the comments, I decided to do things my way, just the person I am I suppose.
After much work, a lot of late night talks, and some good old fashioned crying, it finally clicked with my primary. When I pointed out what he did to me, emotionally, what he did to his partners emotionally, and what he's been doing to her, emotionally and physically, manipulating and using her just for sex, not caring about any risks involved with her rather shaky health. And how he always wanted to paint me as the villain for calling him out when he did something bad, something finally made sense to her, that the whole situation with him was nothing but pain and stress and emotional agony. We talked it out, and we finally both came to the conclusion that having him in both of our lives was a horrible choice to make, for everyone's emotional and physical health. So, she finally decided it was time to break up with him. She just wants to wait till we move in together come march, in case he tries to do anything, saying as he said he would either "do something that she would regret" or kill himself if she ever broke up with him. Which I can understand her wanting to wait till I am there with her before doing anything officially. She'll still be in contact with her other partners, but we'll finally have him cut out of both of our lives, and it takes a huge load of my shoulders to finally know that.found out today that a guy I had started talking to and hanging out with already had a girlfriend. When I called him out on it he said he didn’t know why he didn’t tell me and he had felt really bad to and intended to the next time he saw me. The couple of times we hung out he made himself seem very very single. I dug further onto his social media page and from the stuff he posts it seems like his girlfriend is okay with it so it doesn’t seem like he’s cheating. Why would he omit this information from me though?I met three people on Hinge at different times, when I thought my conversation with one of them came to an end and it wouldn’t work out. I’m now actively talking to all three of them and enjoying our conversations. However, I’m pretty sure none of them know that I’m talking to someone else at the same time as them and I’m worried they’ll think I’m a cheater. I’ve always had an open mind about relationships and always believed that people love who they love, whether that’s one person or many.
I believe I’m polyamorous, but I haven’t been able to experiment that part of myself yet so I didn’t put it in my profile at the time we met. I also don’t know if they will accept that in our relationship, especially when I found out that one of the people hasn’t been on Hinge since talking to me and told me that if they like me and I like them, they don’t see any reason to seek other romantic relationships even though we aren’t officially dating yet. Which is what prompted this post.
Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated!!To start this off you need some back story.  When I met the woman who is now my wife she was in a polyamorous relationships and had 4 kids from a past marriage.  I had never been around Polyamory though I knew some basic premises of it.  That and I had always considered sex and love two separate things. I was so into her I had to give it a chance.

Two months in I found out I was not emotionally capable of being in a poly relationship.  I loved her so much I had to try and make it work though.  For two weeks I scoured the internet; Reading every article about Polyamory I could find in an attempt to find a way to make it work.  Finally I had no choice but to have the hard talk and break it off with her before it became too hard.  

She met me at my house and I sat her down to talk.  Through tears I told her how I was personally not capable of handling being in a poly relationship and that I was sorry I couldn't be with her anymore... She paused, then grabbed my head and passionately kissed me.  Next thing I knew she left the house and I thought I would never see her again.  However, the next day I get a call from her saying she had broke it off with everyone and that she wanted to be with me. 

We dated for a year before we were engaged, and engaged for a year before we got married, and now we have been married a little over a year.  We are active in the kink community and play with others.  We had defined ourselves as emotionally monogamous and sexual open (basically kinky swingers). 

About three months ago my wife tells me she wants to find someone to do impact play with because I have a hard time getting into that particular kink. I agreed. I wanted her to have her needs met and that was a need I was struggling with.  

After a couple weeks she tells me that to be in that dynamic she needs to have a connection with the person she is doing that with. Kind of pushing my emotional limits a little bit but I want to see her happy and satisfied so I say ok, I understand and I went with it.  

After another couple weeks she said she had been talking to a guy and that she then felt she needed to have the connection she needed that she needed to be in a relationship with the person to have that trust and so began the talk of poly... My heart sinks because all I can think of is how it ended the first time. But being the overly understanding push over I am for her I tell her I will try and give this a try again.

In my past a vast majority of the people I dated cheated on me / left me for someone else.  Over time I came to expect it and became numb to it all. I was like "oh well, there goes another one".  I never became jealous, I was numb to it.

The first week or so of them being in a relationship I was doing ok. He was out of site, out of mind. She  would always be at his place or meeting him going out when she did go. 

Then came the day I found out I do have not only jealousy but a new major insecurity. He came over for dinner when 3 of my 4 teenage daughters were home. *Now you need to understand that it took a long time and a lot of work on my part to gain my girls trust (who were abandoned by their father) and love*. 

Three things happen that night. 

1st, my wife came out wearing white see-through shorts with sexy panties and swooned all over me and this guy. Something she has never done with me there and to top it off;

2nd, he hit it off majorly with my kids, they loved him. It was in those moments a rage I have never felt hit me accompanied by insecurity and heavy guilt for even feeling that way.  

3rd, I had to mask my feelings and remove myself from the situation. I went to our bedroom closet in the dark and had a complete breakdown.  He finally left sometime later and my finds me. We talked about it and I told her how I was feeling.  She says she understands and that she would keep him away from the kids until I was more comfortable.  

A week later the kid of mine that was not there had been told all about the guy and her and the others begged my wife to have him come over again so she can meet him.  My wife calls me and tells me this asking if it was okay while I could hear my girls in the background.  I wanted to say no but I knew the girls would know it was me denying it. So I say ok feeling pressured. The rest of the day all I can think about is him being there with my girls, feeling dread and nausea from the constant adrenalin rushes. That night was the same as the previous; Back to my closet for another breakdown. 

I finally take time to write out a list of boundaries and once I was finished, I condensed them all to basically one boundary that I offered a compromise for if she found it unreasonable. 

**Boundary One:**  I do not want him to be at our house with our kids home.  It is hard enough to let him into my safe space with me there because I feel like I have no where to go but hide in my room. For now, I need this.

**Compromise:** I am willing to offer was that if she was admit about him being around our (her) kids, I want as much advanced notice as reasonable of him coming so I may have time to leave the house and do something else to be out of that environment.

**Boundary Two:**  I will not take part in sexual activities that involve partners. 

**Would Appreciate:** Never ask me to be friends with partners. If I want to be then I will pursue it myself.

Another thing I told her is that "While I respect that you are Poly again please respect that I am not." I told her that for me nothing has changed. I will play with her and others (not partners) but I will never seek an emotional relationship with anyone else. I am not capable of it. 

She was pissed off to say the least, however she said she would not bring him to the house anymore *(a tighter restriction than I was requesting but it stays within my boundaries so ok),* that she would lay off trying to have us be friends, and that she would not ask me to participate in sex with them.

He is constantly being way overly nice to me (to the point of creepy) all the time and she continued to try and push me to be his friend (Telling me that we are so alike and have so much in common). I told her that night that I did not want to pursue a friendship with him. While he is nice and we get along, I don't feel that kind of connection with him and I don't want to hang out with anyone dating my wife.  Every time we hung out together the three of us, I never knew how to act, I always felt awkward, out of place and wanted to leave. 

Fast forward to why I am here crying to you all:

Our refrigerator went out and was too expensive to fix to we needed a new one.  Now we have 2 refrigerators however the second one (in the garage) was smaller than the one that broke and instead of waiting a week until I got paid her partner bought us a used fridge. It took swallowing a lot of pride to accept it but I did.  Then, standing in front of me while on the phone with him she asks me if it is okay that he can come by to drop off the receipt so I can go pick it up the next day (kids are home and this was a boundary she agreed to.  

I wanted to say "just tell them my name and have them check my ID" or "Send me a pic of the receipt" or "meet me somewhere."  But no, I give in again out of guilt that this guy just bought us a refrigerator ( which I will be paying him back for ).  Thinking when he says stop by I assumed that he would pull up and I would come out and get it or she would so that my boundary being violated would be mitigate at least a little bit. No.. He shows up with box's of pizza and hangs out with her and the kids for two hours. I only broke down a little bit.. No, I totally broke down again.

It was getting time to leave and my wife wanted me to come down and say goodbye to him "After all he did buy us a fridge". I get that she feels obligated to him because he bought it but I don't. I feel dirty, having money put above my personal feelings and boundaries. 

  I suck it up and put my mask on. While walking him out she tells me that he is going to meet me at the store tomorrow to help me load it and follow me home to unload it.  Laying in bed that night I could not sleep. My feelings of sadness and insecurity went numb and has been replaced with resentment and rage towards him. I feel disrespected in my own home. I feel I was trapped and emotionally manipulated into giving up my boundaries. He knew what he was doing. 

Since then I feel disconnected.  I cant focus, I just daydream about hurting him any time it gets quiet.  I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression I already deal with and it is everything I have to try and hold myself together.   

Please note: I am not against Polyamory or those who practice it. Most of our friends are poly.  I just cant handle it.  I personally don't have the emotional capacity to handle it but I will anything I can to try and make it work for us. 

Thanks for letting me ventDo you bring any partners to family social gatherings? Why or why not?

Are there certain gatherings you go to alone and some you go with one or multiple partners? For example wedding, holidays vs. casual social hang with siblings 

Is there a certain guideline or criteria that makes you feel more or less inclined to integrate lives in this way? I am asking especially in non-hierarchal situations with multiple partners or relationships without shared responsibilities that would make it necessary to integrate family.

Why do you think family integration is important to people?

Edit to add: on the flip side, why do you want to meet and form relationships with your partners’ family or not?So I felt I was poly since 2 years ago (I am 18) and now I start to create a relationship with another poly person, but before any talks with them about it I would like to be properly informed. All I know is that I get few crushes at a same time and basics like individual dating, hierarchy, being open about being in relationships to a new potential partner and stuff like that. I would take some book recommendations and good internet sources if you had some.TL:DR at end- Excuse my lack of knowing terminology... So... I'm in the "worst possible" dynamic... Two mono with a poly hinge... I'm one of the monos, but I knew she was poly going into it, and she wanted a primary, and this woman is amazing... I mean... Just perfect, the kind of love I have for her is just... I'm 33 and have been with someone most of my adult life, and she made me realize I didn't love any of them, because THIS is love (for reference a two page gush over how amazing she is was removed here) However, I'm ok with poly in a "family together with more than two people" way (if there's a word for that) but the other mono, who wasn't an issue at the beginning because he "didn't want anything serious" has changed his mind about that, and she's "trading days" between us... So right now two mono who want to be primary... I'm actually not too worried in the long run... I know I love her to the end of the earth, and he is less... Sure, so it's a matter of time (though I hate to see her get hurt when he leaves) before he bails... In the meantime though... How do I deal with feeling ignored on "his" days? I don't mind sharing, but I really don't like trading...
TL:DR- how to deal with being ignored when it's your metamore's time?Have you ever been to a sex party or club with two or more partners? 

Were there any issues at the party or did you guys have fun?

We're you all completely wanting to go to a sex party before you went or did you feel uncomfortable with it?

I'm just curious about other people's experiences as this topic has come up with differences in everyone's preferences and readiness to go to oneTldr at the end

My wife has been talking to a man (Tim) that she has known for years.  They tried dating about July of last year but it only lasted a couple months because of friction between my wife and Tim's partner.  (This is a whole different set of problems that can be elaborated on if needed)   The end result was Tim's partner blocking both myself and my wife in every social media outlet and cutting all ties.

Tim's partner asked that they no longer speak with each other because of anxiety it was causing her.  Tim reluctantly agreed but has secretly kept in touch with my wife and they have continued to talk while he's at work, send flirtatious and sexy texts with each other, and have even had sex one time while visiting Tim at work.

Based on some issues that I had growing up I find this cheating and lying coming from Tim absolutely disgusting and has turned my opinion of someone that I once thought of as a stand up guy and a friend into a that of a person I don't want in my life or as someone that should be anywhere near mine and my wife's kids.  I've expressed these feelings to my wife but have also told her that while I find his behavior absolutely repulsive that she is a grown adult who can make her own decisions about who she spends her time with and what she does.

Her stance is that he has said that Tim is looking for a way out of his current relationship and she does not like Tim's partner so even if she gets hurt it isn't a problem to my wife.  She has known Tim for many years and isn't going to throw their relationship away.

I feel a level of guilt about their relationship because it just feel absolutely wrong for me to stand by and watch these things happen without being able to do anything about it. I don't want to hurt my wife, but I honestly cannot accept Tim's behavior and don't want him in any shared future with my family.  I have come a long way in accepting polyamory in our marriage but I feel like it should be with someone who I can trust and respect.

So what should I do?  Should I try to find a way to reach out and contact Tim's partner and tell her about this? Should I tell my wife that she can't talk to this guy? Should I just wait it out for Tim to eventually leave his partner? Should I just accept that this is how the world works and sometimes there's no right answer?

Tlrd: My wife has been talking to an ex-boyfriend after they were supposed to stop talking, and I'm uncomfortable with the moral dilemma of how to handle the situation.

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of advocation for divorce.  That's not going to happen.  I would rather try to find a way for us to work through this rather than ruin a 13 year relationship and tear apart our family.  I love my wife despite this current situation.hey! I have been in a committed relationship for over a year and we had said from the beginning we wanted to be polyamorous. I have had sex outside of our partnership but this is the first time I have a crush on someone. My boyfriend knows about my crush and is fine with it, he has a crush on someone else to. My crush also knows I'm poly and I think my crush reciprocates (although I'm not sure).

It's both very exciting and I feel guilty and scared and like I'm doing something wrong.  I've considered myself poly for years but this is my first time acting on it in a less sexual way. I really care about my primary relationship and I don't want to mess it up or start comparing them, especially because we're a year into our relationship and I'm starting to notice the ways we aren't 'perfect' together, even though I still love him and want to be with him.

Do any experienced poly people have advice for first infatuation? Advice, warning, or resurgences would be appreciated.My Nesting Partner has blown my mind. I need to share it. I want to know what's the community's feedback. This is a super positive and grateful post.

Background: I have been with my nesting partner for 2 years. We have baby twins together. We have been talking about polyamory from the start, but we didn't have time to explore before she got pregnant. We took the time for her body to heal from the C-section, therefore her self-confidence to build back up.

Recently, she has been feeling ready to take on the multiple challenges this lifestyle has to offer. We both went on a date with a different person and everything was fine. Our limit was easy enough to understand and respect. We just had a conversation where she asked me how I would feel if she pushed the limit and I said I don't know if I have a limit. She says she's not ready for a coitus with someone else. But she thinks she wouldn't mind me going all the way. I said I'm used to follow the boundaries of the "least comfortable" person involved so that everyone is comfortable with what's happening. But then she blows my mind with a: "I don't want to have that power over you." Giving me the right the choose the boundaries I wanted with my new partner.

This triggers a chain reaction of reevaluation from my past relationships. Have I forgotten myself in my last relationship, only trying to make her comfortable. Is it a lack of self-respect? Is it supposed to be like this? Have I unknowingly been on a leash this whole time?

I should probably point out the fact that in my last core-relationship I had to take a step back multiple times from a new partner to make my NP more comfortable, ultimately  letting them go altogether. Only one managed to stay for a few years.

To me this is a mind boggling concept. It means I might of let my last NP have the power to choose who, when and even how I would spend my time with new partners. I did it out of respect, but I'm asking myself was I respected in the process?

I feel the need to share this story, to clarify my train of thoughts but also because maybe somebody else needs to read this. I sure would've loved to read this a few years back.I was really liking his profile until he got to the part about his mmf triad (no problem), but ended "note: I come as a package deal".   This seems so cringe to me from a poly perspective.   Like, do I present myself for an interview with the team?  

I just wish there was clearer consensus about terms sometimes.I grew up traditional Christian, my husband is atheist. We've been together 10 years, have kids.

I've been trying to figure out what I want because I love him but I also have had feelings for other people during our courtship and marriage.

I recently began talking to him about why I want to open our marriage/try polyamory.

Due to the kids, I'm cautious about truly living poly with cohabitants and otherwise.

But he says he's open to it. However, he needs time to adjust to me being with other people and that he wants to do things together (sexually). As a part of that adjustment, he proposed he wanted me to see him with another woman and that I would need to find this woman because he wants to make sure that what he does doesn't hurt me (even if I keep saying it's okay). My iteration includes me having independent time with the opportunity to explore other people without boundaries but still keeping us and our family intact, I wouldn't want hook ups but would like a long distance friend that maybe sometimes I visit.

I am interested in connections with people outside the purely sexual stuff and that things happen organically, so I'm not sure what would help him outside of exploring that sexual experience/experiment that he says would help him to adjust better since he says jealousy would be an issue for him, and wondering what I'm doing.

I'm not even sure if this is poly or an open relationship question. I feel like I fall in between.Hello! I'm not very knowledgeable about this and really want to learn. So, I was raised in a strict monogamous religious family and anything outside was very demonized. Come undergrad college, I started questioning and became comfortable with wanting to have multiple partners and was ok with them having other relationships too. However, the upbringing had me thinking I was a horrible person and that continued for 3 years. So at the time, I was in a monogamous relationship with someone just as religious, VERY controlling, and was abusive (undiagnosed BPD later found out so explains but not excuse the behavior). I don't wanna go into too much detail but the resulting break up traumatized me. Since then and upbringing, I recognize I am not healthy for poly relationships and I'm ok with being monogamous but has me questioning if I ever was poly. I am in therapy for those who would recommend. Any light any of you can give me?Hi, I’m dealing with ocd that has turned into genuine questioning of my identity. I think it wouldn’t be horrible to date two people but at the same time I’m horrified at the thought that I could possibly be polyamorous. Me and my fiancé are in a monogamous relationship and I’m scared that I’ll want to add another person while being with him. it’s really upsetting me and I don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be poly but I might be. This was a theme months ago and it was the worst, now it’s a new theme except I don’t know if I’m poly or not genuinely. I really need help as this is freaking me out. Thank you.Wondering if this technique has worked for anyone?  If so I’d love to hear about your experience.
Short background story: My partner (M) and I (F) started our relationship as FWBs approx. 2 years ago and have been “partnered” for about 6 months. He has had several poly relationships and I had 1, many many years ago. Because I’ve had some less than stellar relationships in the last couple of decades I am dealing with relationship insecurities and have issues trusting new people.  The suggestion was made that I “fake it til I make it” and can get to the point where I can be happy when he goes out with someone else. 
Since I know I’ll be asked…
A) We communicate really well and I am confident that he truly hears me when I express my feelings.  
B) I knew he was polyamorous when we met and would never want him to change that about him.
C) yes I am a little jealous that he is able to make connections so much easier than I am. 
Any experience, positive or negative, would greatly appreciated.My husband/nesting partner (M43) and I (F34) have been together for 10 years, married for 8. We’ve always been non-monogamous, but never fully poly. Both of us entered the relationship thinking we probably wanted kids someday, but not now, maybe never. This year we’ve been realizing that we’re coming down on different sides of the fence. I still think I want kids in a few years, and he’s realizing he doesn’t want them. This has been a painful realization because I always thought he would be the father of my children. In mono relationships this might be the end of things, but I’m trying to figure out how we might stay together, but still fulfill our life goals. 

Polyamory is an option. However, I’m afraid of the old opening further to fix a problem issue. It doesn’t help that our sex life hasn’t been great lately, in part due to trauma I’ve experienced. Also, while he doesn’t struggle with jealousy too much, I do. I really want to be polyamorous, but I feel like I’m bad at it. I’ve read The Ethical Slut, More Than Two, Opening Up. I listen to poly podcasts. We’re in couples therapy with a poly-affirmative therapist. While I think I need to find someone to have babies with, I struggle to feel comfortable with him having the same freedom to fall in love with someone else. He works 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and I already wish we had more time together. He (understandably) doesn’t feel comfortable with me being free to fall in love with others when he’s not. I’m just feeling kind of hopeless about finding a way forward. I love him, I’d like to be poly, and I think I want kids but I don’t know how to get out of my own way. I’ve struggled on and off with depression for the last 5 years, which doesn’t help. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and worked through it successfully? How have you managed having kids? I’m thinking the first step should probably be to process my trauma, but I’m feeling so shitty about this whole thing that it’s hard to start.I talked to my partner last night and it turns out he's Polyamorous too! I still can't get into the relationship like I want to because the person I want to create a relationship with is in a monogamous relationship. She wouldn't like polyamory. Whether I can be with him or not I'm very happy that it's now an option for me and I don't have to feel bad.So I've been struggling a lot with my emotions towards secondaries I try to add to my mix. 

Myself and my primary have been together going on 7 years I believe, and we have a nice solid foundation that I adore. We have both been poly a little longer than we've been together. Throughout our relationship we have both had our fair share of partners, my issue is that I always tend to 'jump the gun' so to speak and get attached rather quickly. As a demisexual I know this about myself and am really trying to hold myself accountable for how I feel. I've had some rough spots in the past with it but I'm really trying to tame it down. 

Unfortunately this is a lot harder than I'd like it to be, and I struggle with it with every single relationship in one way or another. Sometimes I wonder if I'm too picky or if I'm being abusive in some way and just don't know it. 

I guess my question is how do you keep your own expectations realistic? How do you recognize when you're being overbearing? If your expectations become unrealistic, how do you real yourself back in? 

Just not sure how to move forward really, I don't want this to be an issue I have forever. Thanks for any ideas in advance!You guys are hilarious
Edit : which one is better a long-term poly relationship or a short-term with different partners.Just a general question for the floor. EDIT: Wow, kind of blew up. Lots of discussions, opinions and anecdotes. I just heard it so much in our circles I decided to ask reddit!We just started our open relationship maybe a year ago we met someone that’s perfect for us we’re perfect for him. We’re still seeing how everything goes but how in the world would I come out to family if we became a thruple!?
I’d like to add since I’ve been called a unicorn hunter I’m bi my husbands bi the man we’re seeing is bi they’ve gotten to know each other and are close and I’ve been friends with this person since middle school but life moved on we disconnected and then reconnected on tinder.Today I was thinking about the 90s British comedy 'Goodnight Sweetheart'. The plot to this is an ordinary 90s guy finds a time portal to the same area in WW2. He then falls in love with a lady there and has a time travelling affair with one gf in the 90s and one in the 40s. It's trash and so is the main character 😂.   


There's loads of examples of shows like this, but I remember thinking (I was a child) "Well obviously you love more than one person at once why doesn't he just tell them?"  


Has anyone here seen Goodnight Sweetheart and thought similar? Or what other shows do you look back on and realise it sowed the seed as it were.My husband and I (woman) are thinking of becoming more open, separately. I would also like to explore my sexuality. 
We have talked about it a lot and have decided to not do anything for at least 6 months. Does anyone have any suggestions for reading materials, podcasts or blogs? 
Any tips for beginners?I don't know if this is the right sub to look for advice but people here are awesome so here I am. The title is weird but I honestly don't know how to summarize all of this.

I (24F) have two partners, partner M (36M, going on 3 years) and partner T (29M, 2 years) and I also hookup from time to time with other people.

It started as monogamous and casual with M then he broke it off. Not long after, I met T and hit it off and we started a non-monogamous relationship that evolved as poly once I realized I had feelings for M as well. It didn't take long for M and I to start dating again and everything went smoothly. Of course, each relationship had its problems but communication did wonders.

With T, it started as a "normal" relationship, we even lived together for a year before realizing we didn't really like it. Last week, he announced that he had some very mixed feelings about our compatibility as a couple so we broke up. He had lots of examples (I need way less time with him than he needs, I don't want to meet his family because of personal issues, etc.) and it had nothing to do with polyamory. I thought everything was perfect so this was a big chock for me.

Few days afterwards, we met so we could discuss some things because I didn't feel like I had enough time to process everything and I naturally proposed that even though we are not a couple anymore, I would love to still have some sort of a relationship with him. After 2 hours of discussions, we realized that there were some "perfect" moments we had together and that maybe, we can choose to only have those moments together. Let's just say that we thought of keeping all the good part of the relationship we had and toss the rest. I have never met anyone who did that, it's weird but it sounded like it could work for us.

It would mean I can go on with my life exactly as I wanted to and given that there would be no relationship, he would stop hoping for more (more projects together, more time with his family and friends, more holidays together). We are also still in love with each other.

I am looking for advice on how to go on from this and maybe other people here have similar relationships? For now, we are giving each other some space but we are thinking of meeting again for further discussion. Maybe you guys will have a different approach that we didn't think about.

I am sorry if this is messy and of course, the grammar isn't perfect because english is 3rd language.Just posting to see if anyone has any advice or wisdom here. 

Maybe like 5ish years ago my wife and I started branching out a bit, went to some swinger events, and got involved in cuckolding. It was a lot of fun for both of us, but it was just occasional, and we did it with randomish guys that we either met at swinger parties or online. Like a lot of people, we ended up stopping because of covid though.

Once vaccines came out we started talking about maybe getting back into it. I was all for it, but my wife sort of dragged her feet and just didn't seem too enthused. I chalked it up to covid worries, stress from life etc. and didn't really push it. Last month we were chatting about it and I mentioned that vibe to her, and told her that we didn't have to do it again if she wasn't feeling it. 

She was appreciative of that support in the moment, but a few days later came to me and said that she was actually VERY interested in getting back into things, but her hesitation was because she doesn't want to do it the way we used to. Basically, looking back, the casual nature of things always left her feeling a bit empty, and she wouldn't want to go back to that. She said she'd actually be more interested in it being more like an open or poly relationship, and she'd ultimately love to have a boyfriend, in addition to our relationship. 


This was surprising at first, made me a bit nervous, but also excited, and just a flood of different emotions. We've been talking about it a lot since, and it's been really good for us to get all of our feelings out there. It took some time to get used to and okay with her having sex with someone else, and I have to assume it's like that plus more to get used to an emotional relationship as well. I'm reading the suggested books etc. but more what I'm curious about here is the logistics of it:

- We don't want to leave behind the cuckold dynamic, it felt really good to us and still does. But I understand that if she has an actual relationship with someone else, that it won't all be fodder for us, the way previous experiences kinda were. How do people handle that? She's said that it's all about finding the right person and negotiating it with them, which make sense, but I think the abstract is hard for me to wrap my head around and I'm wondering if anyone else has been there/worked this out. 

- How does a V type relationship (I think that's what we're discussing ultimately) work in terms of balancing needs? I get that there likely has to be some sacrifice from all sides, but curious about how that person could possibly meet the sexual, emotional etc. needs of multiple people. I guess that plays into the above, but curious how others feel about it. 

- Does anyone else have this sort of relationship/have gotten into it while having a family? We have a young family and navigating the early stages of dating and stuff around that seems super hard. 

What else is there to consider here? 
Thanks in advance!Very new to poly and wanted to thank all of you in this sub for creating a relatively healthy place to discuss this lifestyle. It is extremely helpful. And way better than r/relationship_advice where everyone tells you to "get a divorce".

My wife and I have talked about opening our relationship in the past but never decided on committing to it fully. Two weeks ago she tells me she has developed feelings for a new friend of hers and wanted to talk to me about opening our relationship so that she could explore this new friendship more intimately. Nothing between them has happened physically and I wouldn't label this as cheating in my book. My wife was just being very open and honest about her feelings. She put the ball in my court and only would continue this other relationship if I was ok with it.

At first I was caught off-guard and emotional. Jealous and confused. Hurt. Angry. All these weird primal feelings surfaced right away. But I love this person. I know she loves me and wants to be with me. We have a beautiful 2 year old daughter and a really bright future as a family. There is a lot to lose. So I felt unnerved but determined to make it work. I value her happiness deeply and want her to live a fulfilled and beautiful life. Also, I am interested in the polyamorous lifestyle myself and I believe it can benefit me as well.

So after a lot of discussion, I agree to open the relationship and allow this person to enter our life. It has been a really difficult couple weeks wading through all the emotions. I have experienced this really spectacular dip in confidence that I am currently still working through. But this sub has been amazing in providing the discussion and resources that I need right now. Hearing that the things that I am experiencing and the feelings I am feeling are common is extremely helpful.

My wife and I are communicating more and better than we ever have before. I truly feel like we are going to grow through this new arrangement both as a couple and individually. I am challenging my beliefs in monogamy and expanding my thoughts on what it means to love. It's liberating. 

Thank you for providing a healthy place for discussion.My NP and I have been trying to find other couples and partners for a long time with extremely limited success. 

We have attended parties and meetups and have joined apps and websites. 

But we just can't find anyone in our area that we are attracted to or connect with. 

What is the best way to handle these "dead zones" or "desert areas" or "wastelands" in the poly world? 

I know there are couples and partners elsewhere that we would hit it off with because we meet them when we travel and we find them when we change "home location" in an app or website to a different state. 

But we don't want long distance relationships and it's not feasible to travel all the time, and we can't move. 

Any recommendations?I'm somewhat new to being polyamorous and I just had a situation where I was a 3rd with a couple. Ive been in a different kind if poly relationship before but this was the first of this kind. When I went into it, I had no idea what to expect. Since then, I've been doing a lot of research and listening to the Multiamory podcast. I think I mostly understand where it went wrong on all sides but I'm going through a breakup with 2 people at once as well as a breakup with a different partner and have nobody in my life to talk to about it. Would anyone with a little more experience be willing to talk to me about the situation a little more?

I have to say, 3 breakups at once is a new one for me. I know I did a lot wrong but this one is still really hard.I’m 42m. I’m not poly myself (I prefer one partner) but the person I’m with is poly and has another partner shes lived with for 5 years and has a son with (3 years old). I am 100% fine with this, know about him, etc. He also is totally fine (and he’s also poly) and knows about me and everything. So far everything is working out just fine, but it’s still new to me. 

Sometimes I get afraid that I’m taking her away from her other partner. Like, she has a MAJOR crush on me (and I do on her) and we talk on the phone for hours and hours every day (when he’s not around). He knows when she’s on dates with me and stuff, but I’m fairly certain he doesn’t understand the extent of her feelings or how much we actually communicate. Does that even matter? I’m feeling afraid sometimes that I’m interfering on their relationship (because I’m not used to non-monogamy). 

So I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to tell if things are working as they should or not? Are there red flags to look for from her… or even from myself? How do I know if things are headed south in a relationship dynamic like this?I just want to say that dating a married couple, and having feelings for them both, reciprocated, is not impossible. I date other people, as do they, but I feel a real connection to them and want to continue seeing them, even though they are married and I am the unicorn. I see them as my primary couple, who I have not just sexual chemistry with, but also genuine friendships. I've read so many negative comments about how this kind of relationship is not recommend, possibly hurtful to the unicorn, or basically a fantasy! I just don't understand why such an open-minded community could be so set against this particular lifestyle? Ok, rant over. Just wanted to post about my anecdotal experience. It's obviously not the norm, but I'm enjoying it quite a lot!Polyamory sometimes makes the anxiety, imposter syndrome, and disorganized attachment worse. 
It's the same worries, thoughts and anxieties as when in a monogamous relationship, but with having multiple partners the idea or thought morphs from
"You are a shitty partner and should do more for the one you love and stop being such a pessimistic burden" and turns it into "You're a shitty partner to both lovers and its a miracle they even stick around and you should do more for both to show you care."
It doesn't matter that the thoughts aren't "real" and that my partners love me...for that period of time it's this massive wave of I'm not good enough for not only 1 person but 2. 
And "flipping the thought" to something like "you have 2 people who love you" doesn't help.
And I realize it's all based in trauma and a lack of feeling secure in my environment.
And I'm doing the work of personal therapy, couples therapy, psychology evaluations, regular check ins/RADAR, and books, podcasts and personal stories.

I know its not something anyone can really fix (esp not strangers on the internet who know nothing of my history). But sometimes it's nice to just voice shit to a bunch of people whom it doesn't matter what they think of my words.I’ve a read a few comments like “No, they’re UH - Run!” 

Is that because this is a poly group and people are looking for real relationships, not hookups — or is there something bigger?

My partner and I (poly/married/bi/NOT swingers), casually think threesomes with other girls would be fun, but we would also want to be respectful and stay on the right side of things if we actually pursue it. 

So is wanting that experience universally frowned upon (I can’t imagine)? — Is it just a context problem? 

What is the biggest reason people are labeled UH and shunned?So I'm fairly new to dating while being openly poly, I already have a partner but they live pretty far so I've been wanting to find someone who lives closer but I have no idea how or when to tell someone I'm poly and have another partner- do i put it in my bio? Bring it up right away? Both? Something else?Without out going into detail, I keep Rubber-Banding about going poly. The other people involved are happy as clams but idk about myself. I keep going back and forth between happy acceptance and furious rebellion. The rubber banding happens so often I don't know what the true emotion is. Normally I'm a cool, stoic person and I can normally compartmentalize or bottle things up just fine, but this decision, this one decision won't stop eating me up. I don't know how to process this. I can't talk to the others involved because then I'll feel like I'm guilt tripping them and being manipulative. Also like I said they are happy, happier then ever in fact. I couldn't bear to take that happiness away and if I left it would be worse then if I said something. Normally I would just process this on my own but I can't even find a starting point.Edit: This was worded poorly, I clearly have a lot to learn, and I'm sorry for the mess I caused.

I'm confused and went looking for answers in a clumsy and inconsiderate way, I will try to learn from this experience and not let it happen again.

Thank you for responding and I hope I haven't upset anyone too much. I hope you have a nice day and again, sorry for this post.

&#x200B;So. Friday night, my boyfriend’s friend was in a drag show. We go to the drag show, it’s a good time. Drag queen friend mentions going to after party at my favorite gay bar. I’m immediately like “🥺🥺🥺 we go to gay bar?” Boyfriend is straight and is like, “……maybe? It’s kinda not for me.” I’m like, “you’ve been invited by two queers it’s fine.”

Boyfriend drives us to the gay bar, where I proceed to get drunk because someone didn’t have dinner.

I’m doing drunk girl in the gay bar shit like . . . flirting with all the pretty women and getting a drag king friend to do makeup stamps on my cheekbones. Boyfriend is very good at not giving a fuck and is chilling with the drag queen. I also keep periodically making out with him because drunk. (It’s the kind of place that has a bouncer watching the bathrooms so people don’t bang in them, so this is normal behavior for the space.)

There’s this one super cute woman, so I start hitting on her. She seems confused. So I say I think she’s beautiful and can I get her number to take her on a date some time. She makes the “doing mental math” face and goes “Uhh, will your boyfriend be there?”

I’m like, “Oh shit, I’m poly, and also drunk or I would have mentioned that sooner, is that a problem?”

“I asked a question.”

Me: [*suddenly evaluating the optics of being a woman at the gay bar with a man I keep making out with*] “OH FUCK. No, we date separately. I haven’t met his other girlfriend. He hasn’t met my girlfriend. We don’t even do threesomes. I’m just messy.”

I think my vibes of literally just being a messy bitch were very strong, because she gave me her number anyway. 🤷🏻‍♀️

This has been your update in: “Messy queers doing poly”. You may all now point and laugh.UPDATE: Spoke to my gf and she understands and is making an effort to be engaging when she messages me. Gosh I love this woman!

So I'm a first timer dating a poly person. Our relationship has been strong even with LDR but I feel like we are at the end of NRE. Nothing has happened to rock our relationship but I'm not used to the lesser texting and affection.

I also don't want to mess up my relationship by being needy. Am I hooked on NRE?

I notice I tend to get very uneasy towards the end of NRE even with my regular mono relationships. Like I feel as though the relationship is ending even though nothing bad has happened.

But Im also wondering what if I'm right. Maybe my gf is bored of me. Her video messages are shorter, a little duller and less regular. Should I be worried?I am in my first polyamorous relationship ever and have been dating my partner for a year. I just tried including somebody else and went on a date with them. I told my partner about them and that I'm only looking for a sexual relationship with this person and that we might have sex. We had sex and when I came back home my partner was upset and stressed because I hadn't been answering my phone during the date (we didn't discuss doing this) and asked how my date was an I said we made out and stuff. I was waiting until the next day to tell them we had sex because they were rlly upset about me not responding and I was afraid to tell them we had sex because I wasn't planning on having sex that night. Truthfully I didn't want to have sex but felt coerced into it (not their fault, I have a hard time saying no). I was in a lot of pain the next two days from tendonitis and genuinely forgot that we hadn't discussed it yet and never got around to bringing it up because we never talked about the date. Three days after the date I told them we had sex as we had been talking about sex. They rightfully are now extremely upset with me saying I lied and I think I've broken their trust forever. I didn't intend to lie but I know I fucked up and am just owning my fuck up and expressing my love to them and how sorry I am. I don't know what else to do to have them not hate me anymore, any advice appreciated I really fucked this one up.I've noticed a pretty common theme in here is people posting relationship issues and saying "Should I break up over this?" like they think that actions leading to breakups are on a spectrum and whatever the other person did has to be in the "bad enough to breakup" section of it to justify a breakup. But really, you can breakup for literally any reason at all. Or no reason. Just wanting to breakup is reason enough. You don't have to wait until it's bad enough. 

So, what are some of the reasons you have broken up with someone? I'll go first. 

1) He accidentally sent me a text meant for a prostitute asking what her rates for various acts were. When he realized his mistake he tried to play it off like he was joking and thought it would be a fun role play. (As far as I knew, we were not open and I certainly didn't know he was frequenting sex workers)


2) We'd been enjoying drinks on the patio of a café when it became apparent that an elderly couple was having car problems and trying to push their vehicle out of the road. I jumped up to help and I realized he wasn't coming along and gave him a questionable look, he said "why? So if something goes wrong they can sue me? No thanks" and I immediately said "we're done" and went to help them out before leaving him sitting there.


3) I found out he voted for Trump.

I wanna hear your breakup stories.From apps to date night ideas, I want to hear the best you've got to offer to help people in non-monogamous relationships date betterMy son has been talking with these two girls at school for a while and they decided to go to the movies together. They are all on the autism spectrum and it's wonderful that they have each other as friends. They've been trying to figure out what this is, and have declared that yes, it's "a date".

I'm not out as poly to my kids, but they have seen their parents with different elements of our polycule most of their lives. I never tried to influence my kids to be poly or mono.  I just want them to find their own way. I have an older kid that has decided that they are gay and another that's trans. This is my first kid to explore poly. 

Just wanted to share this moment of poly parenthood.I guess this might be some sort of rant.

&#x200B;

I'm feeling pretty frustrated by this sub. Some of the comments and suggestions are wonderful. Some of them have really gotten me thinking.  As a back story, I am new to this and still working through all of the preprogrammed thoughts I have around monogamy. I'm struggling as I work through my trauma's and fears - which seems to be somewhat normal. Partly I attribute in my own personal journey the fact that I can become really comfortable in a set routine; the routine being monogamy. Without someone mentioning a new way of being happy and fulfilled, I may have never come to it.

The reason I am feeling frustrated is: Some of the recommendations and suggestions are really over looking BOTH parties. Yes, we can ask the poster questions to try and gain clarity - but we need to understand that this is still from their perspective. It is valuable information but we never truly know both sides unless both parties are present. Yes, I have been considering WHY this is triggering to me specifically. Another reason I'm posting is to potentially work through this.

I am struggling - but that doesn't mean that I don't align with polyamory or non-monogamy. That doesn't mean that I do not see great value in structuring my relationships non-monog/polyam. Even when you're completely enthusiastic about these structures  you can still struggle.Hi everyone! I’m new to poly and I’ve been reading some basic poly books that have been recommended to me, but I wanted to expand my search and see if you have any not so well known books that helped you in your journey to poly!Hello,
I have been in an open triad for 4 months now. I have a nesting partner and our other partner lives close by. I have a FWB that I also see on a regular basis. I also just started a new internship as a student, so most of my day time is already filled with work an I only have the evening to hang out/have dates.
So, lately I have been struggling to manage my time in a way, that my other responsibilities (friends, family, pet, household) and my hobbies don't suffer.

How do you manage your time with partners, friend etc? How does work - life balance work in poly relationships? Any tips?I'm feeling confused. A little over a month ago, while my ex and I were together, she said she's interested in having an open relationship because she wants different experiences, since we're each other's first. I am understanding of the idea, but I just don't think I'm comfortable with doing that. My heart feels crushed every time I had the thought of her with someone else. I expressed that I'll think about it, but I was definitely leaning against it. She said initially that if I said no, we would work things out because I'm her end goal, but I don't think that applies any more.

A couple weeks later, she ended up kissing a coworker she has feelings for, and we broke up the next day, and we've been no contact for a few weeks now (but she still contacts me on occasion).

I can't help but feel regret for breaking up with her. I wish I could feel better about being open just so I could be with her, I love her unconditionally. This bomb was just dropped on me so suddenly and she stresses that she is still in love with me, but it just doesn't feel that way. I was only left with 2 options, stay with her and share her with other guys, or leave her.

Should I have given it more of a chance? Is there going back from this point? Ever since we broke up, she hasn't dated or anything, so she still hasn't moved on from me, I think. She doesn't want a serious relationship with any one other than me, so I don't know what to do. I want to go back to her more than anything, but she already made up her mind that she wants to be open. Should we get back together and give it a try? The kiss alone really messed with me, so I don't know.Recent poly here (18 M) . After getting over my immense jealousy and neediness whenever I even think of the possibility of my partner flirting with someone else, I’m now more calm. I used to be really conflicted with literally everything, I have now conquered my jealousy (for the most part, it’ll still slip by sometimes) and I’m now happier as a result. I now have found another partner I can happily say I love and I couldn’t be any happier. My partner loves them too and that makes me even happier.To my husband: Thank you for your strength, understanding, patience. We didn’t go into our marriage polyamorous but we see one another. I am so so grateful to have you as my constant. 

On behalf of anyone that has been heartbroken while still being blessed to feel so loved, thank you ALL for your strength.Like the title says. Been with J 1.5 years. J lives with M (moved here recently). J has been amazing in many ways. I've learned a lot. I'm grateful. First person I ever said I love you to, had good safe sex with, learned about meal making, home stuff etc.

When M was set to move here, I was pretty sad. There wasn't much communication at all. It was immensely painful and difficult to feel so unsupported and unheard over such a large transition. I'd raise the topic and be told to just enjoy the moment, she'd get mad at me for bringing it up etc. And sadly, I've noticed for the last year, that's how a lot of our communication goes. I spoke with M who says J handles their conflicts similarly, and it often feels like gaslighting. 

J can be tender and sweet and obviously cares for me, and M. But I don't feel I can be myself around her. She still doesn't say "I love you" to me. M has confirmed she doesn't care about this boundary. Obviously, I don't want to force or pressure anyone, but when J gets mad at me or accuses me of pressuring her when I ask about that, it hurts. 

Lately J has had more time and wants to spend more time with me. We had 5 days together and honestly....I was ready for her to go. She wound up giving me COVID and I was so happy we did not quarantine together. We are very different people. She likes to "poke fun" and "banter" with me, but often it makes me feel bad and insecure. I tried taking her to my fave skate spot and she was so antsy and did not connect with me at all about it. I try inviting her to my fave hike spots, she hates hiking etc. Then when I make plans without her, she berates the plans and fishes for an invite.

It's just exhausting. And when I've brought it up in the past, she accuses me of being too sensitive. 

She wants me to call her, we talk, but I feel like that emotional support I'm realizing I need from a partner in the day to day just isn't there. I'm fortunate to get great support from my best friend, and J is there in an absolute crisis, but sustained support isn't. 

I noticed I was starting to really resent her, so I took a step back. Resentment or acting ugly isn't fair to anyone. But my problem is I have no idea how to address this. Past attempts have left me feeling even worse for bringing it up and in tears, and like it's on me to make her feel better. I bring something up, she brings up all the good things she's done for me, which is true. 

I sometimes miss her, I miss the potential we had, but I feel like I'm in a trap- the more I show affection and love, the more it feels like it hangs in the air unheard. But when I pull back, she pursues. And it's awful. She came over and we had sex, and after I just wanted to cry. Because I felt so disconnected and alone, like I have for months. And I feel so dishonest keeping these feelings bottled up. 

I've read about attachment styles and worry we both oscillate between anxious/avoidant. But I'm in therapy and am working on it. She is not. 

I'm realizing my needs are not being met. Poly isn't the problem here. I notice I need a partner who can say 'I love you', who shows up or offers support when things are hard, who listens when I say "hey that bothered me" etc and wants to find solutions together. At this point, I'm unsure how to approach this w/o it leading to a break up talk. I've tried many times and she accuses me of blindsiding her, or if I tell her in advance something is on my mind per her request, she approaches the convo very hostiley. 

I just feel tense and constantly on eggshells. I feel terrible and dishonest bc I'm pretending everything is fine, to see if I can recapture that love and spark and care between us, but I don't feel I'm being myself. 

Any advice for approaching this w/o it seeming like a pent up tidal wave or pure break up talk? At this point, I worry we are just 2 different people. Without love and communication, even if caring/connection exists, what do we have? 

TLDR: my needs aren't being met by my partner. Attempts to talk met with hostility, dismissal. Feel very alone and unheard in partnership. Advice for talking without it being a pure break up talk?Hey everyone, been reading in this sub a bit to get a handle on some tips for entering into a poly life with my wife. 

Long story short, there had been a conversation to entering this lifestyle, and 2 different approaches after. There was a bit of a slip up and things got somewhat dicey and I’m looking to find tips on how to navigate this further. I found out a few months after the relationship had gotten physical that things had progressed to that point.

My expectations of a poly relationship come from the desire to grow together as well as individually. My main concern is the relationship that I have/don’t have with the partner she has chosen. It has caused some drama and fighting within the dynamic and there is another party involved on the other end as well. A lot of my reaction has come from jealousy, but at the same time I want my partner to experience this love as it helps increase her happiness and self esteem, which in turn has positively effected our relationship. 

So I guess to start, what tips do you have for establishing a relationship with the chosen partner once things started off rocky, and what ways would you suggest help to handle jealousy within the dynamic.My partner and I have been poly for 2 years or so, we haven't been able to meet many people that are poly. Most people we find just want to have threesomes. ( which is funny as poly people get called the unicorn hunters. ) With others as soon as I bring up poly females act like I'm cheating already (24m ) , I was wondering how you navigate that situation? Like do you acknowledge your currently relationship first or does that comes after. We are all about respect in our relationship so I dont want to act like I'm single.So I am currently in a partnership with my nesting partner, his partner, and another partner. The dynamic with my nesting partner and their partner is quickly turning into an absolutely wonderful dynamic and we've been talking about moving in together this fall. 

I know some people use the term "poly saturated" and I'm not sure if this is it, but between these three people and also scheduling triad sleep overs and stuff with friends and family I am kind of like. Realizing I might need to make a change because there just isn't enough time and I feel like I'm running around non-stop. 

Any thoughts, stories, advice, or info appreciated. 

Tldr; Have you ever had three people you've dated at once? If so, what's your story? Did it work out? What did you learn? Pros? Cons? Residual advice looking back now?So I started getting back myself and learning that I'd like to explore the ploy lifestyle. But it's hard to do that when I don't know how to when I'm a lesbian. Any other lesbians here? Any advice?I'm in a long distance poly relationship with a woman who is married. I'm questioning if it's worth it as I don't see it going anywhere further then where we are at now.... I'm never going to marry her and I'm never going to be able to have her kids.... what is the point of dating her? I love her to the moon and back I'm just not sure what the end game is hereAfter quite some time trying with another person who's polyamorous but who's partner was against it (I respected the boundaries no worries, nothing happened). I now finally get my actual try. I had feelings for this person for about 1 year already but never dared to actually admit it. After talking with my partner (who is very very supportive of me chasing this) I finally gathered all of my courage and asked this person out on a date and.... they said yes! We've been talking for quite some time now and the vibes are just amazing and getting better with each day to come. Finally I've been able to be more stable mentally and my genuine vibe has changed to great. Just wanted to drop my excitement here. Also still kinda scared to actually do this... but it's going to be worth it.So I'm at a point with my life were I feel finally comfortable to meet new people or the ones I knew from a lot but just on Instagram ecc

There is this one particular person that I met on an app months ago were I was a little timid and scared ball of food
They are pretty cute and I was interested in them after we talked some times month ago

We talked yesterday and agreed on meeting each other after we were talking about how they were interested in someone but it was difficult and how for me was the same 
Then they told me they are interested in me and that we can totally met since they are poly 

I know the concept and is something that honestly I can try and eventually being in, but idk ho to make them feel comfortable since this is new to me 

Hope I didn't use some bad terms describing being poly ecc 
In that case sorryMy husband and I have been together for over a decade. I have a second partner and I've been with him for about a year. He has recently started seeing someone new. And I'm having a much harder time with it than when my np sees new people. Others feel the same? Thoughts? I’m (F25) currently part of a triad with A (NB33) and S (F34), and for the most part the past two years have been wonderful. We have open communication and have dealt with difficult things before. However, there has been a recurrent issue with S that A and I are nearly at the end of our ropes dealing with.   
 (Context, A and S have been together for nearly 10 years, married for seven. I’ve been dating the two for around the same amount of time.)   
 S has some serious jealousy issues. When A and I are affectionate with each other, S sees it as an invitation to join or thinks she also needs attention right at that moment. Example, A and I are making dinner, I give them a kiss on the cheek. S sees this and will pout because I didn’t also give one to her. Or, A and I are sitting on the couch having a conversation, S walks up after not having been a part of it and interrupts by sitting between/on top of us without asking. Every time we have sex, S gets extremely upset and jealous, expecting that we then have sex with her since obviously we are “in the mood” even if it was hours prior, guilting us when we refuse to be pressured into sex.

Because of S’s issues, A and I both feel like we can’t be affectionate in front of her. We have told her this and that it makes us uncomfortable, yet her behavior hasn’t changed even though she says she’s not jealous. Most recently, I have been experiencing touch aversion from her and feel like I can’t trust her. A has explained similar feelings to the whole situation, especially since S acts like things are fine even after we’ve talked with her. 

A and I are seeing therapists about this and plan on talking to S more once we can more fully explain our feelings since we know this will be a very difficult conversation. But in the meantime, things continue to be extremely uncomfortable for both of us and we aren’t sure what to do. 

TL;DR, One of my triad members gets jealous of the other and I every time we are affectionate and demands reciprocation. The two of us have lost trust in her, but she denies that she has gotten jealous and pretends everything is okay and she has done nothing wrong.

Are we being unreasonable asking her to not see affection between us as an invitation? How have you dealt with jealousy from a partner?We were both seeking polyamory when we started dating, and made an agreement to get our finances in order, solve a few other life problems, and open up to polyamory when we had more time and energy. Several years later, we've bought a house, climbed out of our respective situations, and have healthy lives. She's not satisfied with our position, and fears her current level of stress will only rise if we seek other partners.

I have a friend who is special to me and it's difficult not to want more with her. I'm struggling to be honest about that with my primary. I haven't cheated or broken any of our rules. But it's currently painful.

I feel the time we've spent as pseudo monogamous- we still flirt with friends, go on dates, have many interactions that aren't culturally monogamous but haven't had intercourse with anyone else- has made her want to be monogamous for life, or at least a good while longer. I'm scared I'll miss an opportunity to be with this person whom I have love for.

I'm scared to hurt her. I'm scared to ask for what I want. I feel that the response will be "you should have started out poly" but managing multiple relationships while building a financial future for children and old parents is a time consuming task.

I guess I'm asking for advice? Or maybe i just needed to get it off my chest in a place that feels safe. Idk. M (32) Midwest.

Update: Talked with my wife about it last night and she was perceptive and empathetic as always. Helped me realize that I'm still working through some painful experiences with past partners and unfairly applying their behaviors to her. I'm not going to pursue my friend at this time.  My wife and I will be taking steps/preparations to dating openly, separately by summer. Like most issues, honest conversation was the answer. Thanks all for your input, it really did help. Has anyone dealt with a partner moving out of state? 

My boyfriend had some big life things happen  within the last month and is moving out of state in 7 months. We’ve only being seeing one another for 3, but I’m already panicking over the eventual loss of this relationship. 

I still have some fwb but I’m completely in love with him and the thought of not having him in my life weekly feels devastating. The fwb are very casual and I haven’t had a connection like the one we have (ever) and I just really don’t know what to do.

I’m curious if any of you have moved for one partner alone—And if you have, how did you come to the decision? What would be some pros and cons for you?So my primary partner and I have been together for 6 months and are in a D/s dynamic as well. Due to living arrangements on both our ends we haven’t been able to play as much as we would like so that pet of our relationship isn’t as strong as I would like it. I have a history of abandonment and neglect which makes me super insecure( I am working on this and have made lots of progress before this relationship and while in it as well). I know my partner is looking for another partner and would like some type of bdsm to take place in that relationship as well as ours. I’ve having so much trouble with the thought of him being someone else’s dom right now and it’s only in theory at this point. I know that once the living situations change (for him in a month or two and we should be living together by the end of the summer) we will be able to have more time for d/s and that will give me the confidence to feel secure with him fulfilling that roll with another partner in addition to me. But asking him not to have a true dynamic with someone else for the next 9+ months seems like I’m controlling him which is not what I want either. It’s the middle of the night and we talked about this hours ago and I still can’t get my brain to stop thinking about it long enough to be able to go to sleep. Advice please!!I am 39 and have recently had a sexual awakening of sorts.
I thought the idea of sex with other people sounded erotic.
My husband and I started swinging,
But I wasn't really getting what my fantasy was and I talked to hubs.
He said I think you are poly 
I want to go out be romanced I want it to be an extreme connection that creates a deep friendship and sexual meet ups... no super often.
I type this and I feel selfish and like an adulterous person.
Please help me gain clarityHey! Looking for advice, I am dating a married guy (they are legally married but separated currently, still living under same roof for sake of their kids) me and wife and him were friends before they opened up. Recently I’ve noticed the wife has been moody (not with me but I also feel I’ve been slightly ignored if I’m at the house) which is fine! I’ve been feeling like its best to give her space- never sure where she and him are at so I just say hello and interact with the kids and stay out of her way since it’s her house and if she wants quiet time or space that’s totally fine. I usually go to the house when she’s out on dates with her BF but I’ve been wondering if I should reach out and ask if we’re all good? Should I leave it? Any thoughts navigating this? My gut again is just to give her space.So pretty much the title. I've (F26) been seeing this lovely guy (M32) who is obviously poly, for over a month now. He asked me in passing a couple days ago if I'd like to meet his wife who is his primary partner. I said yes but now I'm super nervous and unsure. What if she doesn't like me? Or I don't like her? What if she tells him to stop seeing me? I just want it to go well. 

Those that met your partners primary partner, how did it go? I'm very new to all of this so any advice would be great. I'm just freaking out a little.Hi all! 

I’m in a long term monogamous relationship currently (the only relationship structure I’ve experienced) but I’ve found myself struggling and have struggled in previous relationships also. I didn’t want to admit to myself that I find it hard to be monogamous,  especially to the partner I’m with, as it would be so difficult to convey that I have urges to be with other people, whether it be physically or emotionally, but that I still love my partner I just want to experience other people and things and that I can hold space for both at once.

CNM (poly, open relationship, swinging etc) is relatively new to me as a concept and the more I’ve read into it, the more I feel like I would be suited to that kind of relationship structure but I feel so unsure as it is such a huge change in dynamic and I don’t want to ruin my current relationship. 

So basically, I would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience in being unsure if CNM would work for them and how that turned out, whether it confirmed that it’s the right dynamic for you or it wasn’t quite what you expected but it’s a journey and a learning curve etc. 

(I know this is a broad and individual question, it’s just so new to me and I appreciate any response!) 🙂 

Thank you! ☺️☺️I had an accident and I am on crutches now. I hate being limited and although I put a positive attitude some days sucks. But all this just showed me how all my partners are amazing and how much they care for me. 

I am more of a giver Tun a receiver so this feels quite new to me. 
One of my partners is temporary nesting with me so he can take care of me and the other ones came by to bring snacks and hugs. I am beyond words with appreciation and love. 

I also feel the care of friends and family which is huge because I live abroad and I am so used to be independent and rely on myself. 

I just wanted to share this!A little background...super new to Poly here. Still have quite the mono brain. Poly makes sense logically but I am insecure with a quite anxious attachment style. My partner and I have known each other all of our lives but have been in a committed relationship for about a year. I do have a nesting partner. My partner in question has one other partner as well. We are LDR, as he is with his other gf. We have quite the extensive history together and we're childhood sweethearts. We both anticipate we will be together in some capacity for the rest of our lives, and we have plans to be nesting together within a year or two.  I have been having jealousy trouble of course as a result of the anxious attachment and codependency mentioned before. My partner is wonderfully caring and is trying to help me work through these feelings. I am also working through research, a peer group and some online therapy. Here is the issue. Due to the fact that both of my partners relationships being LDR, when he is in a visit with his other gf, we have very limited contact. I understand this to be normal but it is extremely anxiety inducing to me, even if I am busy with other activities and people. Due to logistics, he is able to spend about 2-3x the amount of time with his other partner as we get to spend together. When he is not having a visit with her, he and I are in contact around the clock. While in a visit, that reduces to a few text messages a day, including good morning and good night. As I said before, I understand this to be normal. Logically I have no issue. My body and mono brain have other reactions lol. He knows this is emotionally difficult for me. All of that to say....my partner has suggested that on my next visit that we go together to meet and spend time with his other gf. He believes this will literally physically expose me to our poly life, and he believes once I meet her that I will see her as a real person and not have so much anxiety. I have agreed but I am apprehensive. I am well aware of who his other partner is, and they have a very unique d/s dynamic. He and I are not like that at all. In addition, his other partner is quite a bit younger than we are, super duper high energy, loud and playful. She is sweet and good to him. I do worry that being around them together will be too hard for me. I don't dislike my meta personally but I also don't mesh with her at all. What do you lovely people think of the logic behind meeting my meta as a way to expose me to the reality of our poly life? My partner seems to believe this will help me. He is very smart and intuitive. I am just very nervous. We started this relationship with a don't ask don't tell policy, which did not work at all for either of us.  I transitioned to not wanting to know any details of their physical relationship nor too many details about their relationship in general. I won't have the luxury of that obliviousness after I meet her and spend time with them together. My partner intends to be affectionate and show PDA to both of us to show me that our connection is still just as valid in the presence of theirs.  Do any of you think there is value in doing this for myself? Do any of you see this as a bad idea at the stage I am in of adjusting to polyamory? I am unsure whether it will help when my issues are abandonment trauma based and not issues with my meta personally.  Some of you are definitely blunt but seem to give great advice and it would be nice to have some opinions outside of my own polycule. Thanks so much...I never post anywhere like this!so for context I’m 14M, my gf is 14F. weve been dating on and off for about a year but things only really got serious these last few months between us. We have a small friend group with a non binary friend, who I’ll refer to as B, and a quiet female friend who well call M. 

they were having a sleepover at M’s house and moved to their guest bedroom since that is where they would be sleeping (after being at the house for a few hours)
eventually the discussion centered around B and my GF, with M just kind of watching and making small comments. the conversation escalated to holding hands and talking, and then flirting/kissing cheeks/heads. at some point M got up to go to the bathroom and B and my GF nearly kissed (centimeters away from eachother according to my gf)
according to my gf, flirty stuff like this continued to happen until they went to sleep. 
She told me the story and , I’ll admit, I may have freaked out a little. I didn’t go full caps rage mode or anything, but I did ask her “did you tell me the full truth?” To which she said “yes”. she eventually told me “im polyamorous. truth me OP I love you so much but B makes me feel weird”.
i basically told her (since in one night she had went further with B than we had in multiple months) that she has to choose one of us. she said it was hurtful to her identity for telling her to choose one person. did I go too far here? is it bad that I told her to choose either me or B?I have a long-time friend turned QPP that is part of my polycule. They are also recovering from a long abusive relationship and are disabled. I knew all of this prior to our shift from friends to QPPs, and I knew that it'd affect our relationship. 

I'm also not a primary partner for them, and I tried to make it clear from the start that I didn't expect them to prioritize me in their day to day life or significantly change time spent together or in communication. It was important to me to not disrupt their already busy life.

The problem is that they seem to be triggered by my kindness, and then cancelling what time we are supposed to spend together because they think I deserve more. There's an underlying belief that I should go have fun and not be constrained by their inability to do things. I usually recommend backup plans to spend time together eating food and watching TV if going out doesn't work that day, but this hasn't ever happened. I'm very amenable in what we do together because I don't really care about doing things, just being around my people. I have a receiving love language of quality time.

This isn't my assumptions either. We've talked about it. I've tried to make it clear that they don't get to decide whether my time is better spent with them or doing something else. This is a trigger for me because I'm Autistic and have most of my life had other people make decisions for me based on what they think I need. I also have a hard time with changes in schedule, though am understanding when anything interferes whether sudden work, sickness, general low energy, etc etc.

Anyways.... It happened again this weekend. They let me know after the fact it's what they did, so I'm glad they can be honest with me. But I don't know what to do at this point. It hurts, a lot, especially when they're doing this to me but not to other partners. I know there's an inherent safety they are feeling because we have already been friends for so long, and they know I'm understanding when they can't do things. I always have been. But at this point, it's sabotaging the relationship. Pushing me away because I somehow deserve more? Even though, deserving has nothing to do with it... It's leaving me feeling our time together isn't prioritized, even if I logically know that isn't what's happening. Then I feel lonely because it's not like I can just replace time spent with them with something else and get the same connection I was expecting. I can talk about this over and over, but it's not changing anything. 

I'm hoping for strategies people may have used with their partners that go through similar depression spirals. I understand thoroughly what is happening and why it's happening, but coming up with ways to support them is hard. They feel bad after (which is why they tell me) so I know it's not something they want to do either. I'd much rather support them through this.To start off I am 25 Female my fiance is 30 male 
I have been want to and in and addition to our family
...kind of 

I want a girlfriend but I want someone don't have to share with him 

He knows this and completely respects this 
But I don't know how to go about finding someone

Or if it would even work outSome details changed for privacy.

I started dating a close friend a year ago. His wife and I were also close, and she sort of pushed us together. His wife had several boyfriends before this point, I was the first person he dated since they opened up years ago. He, I later learned, made all the NRE/new poly mistakes. He violated agreements, plowed through boundaries, and neglected her.

She blamed me for most of this. He started dating someone new and did not make these same mistakes - wife loves and adores this person, facilitates their time together and makes it easy on them. The last time he came to see me, he says she refused to speak to him.

We broke up eight weeks ago. In part, it was because my partner told me his wife cannot even hear my name without getting triggered, panicked, or angry. He has told me his wife/girlfriend are disinterested in having any contact with me, and feel that I cannot respect boundaries. (He said they would not like it if they knew he told me this, indicating who is actually the person who cannot hold a boundary. I personally am fine speaking to neither of these people and respect their boundaries.) He is fine staying friends with me. I am heartbroken because I am dealing with the consequences of all of these unforced errors.

I know, I know, his behavior was damaging, trust me, I know. I cry about it and hate losing a very close friend. We were deeply in love and cared about each for a long time. 

The problem is: we volunteer at the same very specific organization, have a lot of friends in common, and have a class together. His mother and I are very very close as well, and were close before ex and I were dating. I do not tell his mom about our relationship troubles.

I cannot experience things that bring me joy, stability, and mental wellness without seeing my ex - we are in each other's lives. 

My ex has behaved in toxic ways, even if he did not intend to, and it caused me a lot of harm. Still, I know at some point I'll forgive him. I do not trust him right now and have asked for no contact for two months. That is not going to be workable forever.

Do people have any thoughts on how to set boundaries given that we must see each other?

Edit: thank you for all the considerate words and suggestions. I want to clarify I usually stay friends after a break up (in fact, my exes are some of my best friends) and so even this idea of cutting someone off is very new and challenging for me.

Additionally, please do not assume I was perfect in this situation. I too am human and rushed into trying to fix things in ways that made things worse sometimes. I broke down sobbing in public as a response to the behavior/obfuscations of my partner (in my defense, it was the week after my father's funeral and I was also grieving, but to many people I probably just looked like a train wreck), and I understand why his new partner would assume I'm unhealthy and toxic. Grief wrecked me this year. 

Edit 2: Being cruel to the other partners in this situation is...cruel. And unhelpful.I just broke up with my boyfriend for a myriad of reasons, one of which being that I do not think that I want to be in a monogamous relationship for the rest of my life. There were a lot of other issues as well, but ultimately we loved each other very much and I think we could have worked them out had it not been for me not wanting to just be with him forever. Our relationship followed the course of many others during the pandemic, and we got very serious in a short amount of time. He was my best friend and he supported me through a lot of hardship. 

I feel guilty for breaking his heart and I also feel heartbroken myself. At the same time I’m very excited to have the freedom to start dating again but I’m struggling to reconcile this with my feelings of loss. 

Just wondering if anyone else experienced the same and how they managed to get through it and start dating again.So my partner and her other partner have been making a lot of progress in their relationship, got engaged, talking about moving in together, etc. And I love that for them but it's cause a lot of anxiety in me cause I love her and mixed with the constant reject ATM I'm scared I'm going to lose her. Is it reasonable to carefully write down my worries for her and me to go over together and talk about?  
I say write down cause I have trouble with verbal communication when I'm nervous.I just need some advise in how I'm supposed to feel  when my partner worries more about the primary the second and dose all he can to make her happy and I'm left behind has no time for me or anything am I being unfairIm in a triad and lately i haven't had much time to do much with my partners mostly do to work and they have brought it up with me.    so now im trying to plan a date for the three of us but money is a bit of an issue due to the fact that all three of us are in a small debt from helping our families to trying to make it through day to day with some bad paychecks. So im just trying to think of some good dates but im struggling with it and would like to hear some advice from everyone here.   As well as some of your memorable dates.A quick search leads to papers from sites that seem to push a narrative ( from both sides )Soooooo.

The last couple of years have been ups and downs for obvious reasons. Not a great time to acquire new partners/crushes/squishes/what have you. I broke my FMF triad this past summer back to a V due to some manipulative/toxic BS but am still partnered with him (Partner A).  Have re-evaluated said partnership and de-escalated to something a little more casual. Taking some time for myself, reaching out to strengthen friendships with others as well as work on myself with my counselor.  All good things. Figuring out how \*I\* want to Polyam.

Started seeing a casual partner (B) a little more frequently, and have had a couple of times hanging out together with one of \*their\* partners (C). Get invited to the partner C's house for various small Covid risk-aware parties. Reconnect with C's spouse (D), who I had met 5 years ago when newly dating Partner A. (Following so far? Good, I knew you could!) There was some interest from D's end, but it didn't pan out initially.

Now, reconnecting with C and D has been fun, and D and I have been chatting more often, and starting on Dec 23 have had some one on one time, and found that we click in \*all\* the right ways and have clearly stated that we love being in one another's company, and will be happy no matter which way things go.

Had a brunch date yesterday, there was 4+ hours of good conversation and no-pressure flirting, and ended with a lovely consent-oriented first kiss. 

NRE is fun, and I'm excited. Anyone else got something like that going on?i’ve been thinking so much lately about the possibility of me being polyamorous. i started talking to this girl and she said she’s poly and that’s not really the point but the point is i felt like something kind of opened to me then. i get there are many different ways of being non mono, and i think a three girl relationship would be so nice and fun and loving. i have a need of thinking out loud about this lol.

i think i would also be okay with a mono relationship, but exclusively me plus two other girls being together just seems sooooooo perfect to me <3Hi, we are just starting in on an open marriage after five years of research and discussion. I think it would be good to have a good therapist or two on board. Telehealth would be fine so nationwide recommends?? Thanks!This is mostly a vent(?), I think.
Anywho, me (F28) and my partner (M30) of 7 yrs decided to go poly and date individually. We were really excited and all that. But funny enough, I was slightly turned off by the dating process and decided to just pause alone and chill out for a bit. Online dating was so stressful, it felt like I was someone’s back up. People starting conversations that never continued just to hold you in case the other person didn’t work out or people genuinely not interested in you but forcing themselves to date. For the poly people I did meet, they were only interested in dating single people. It was a strange experience that I might continue when I have the headspace for it. Also I’d like to note that I wasn’t interested in dating men, shrinking my pool. 

Though little did I know that my partner did the same on his own terms. 

Now we’re two poly people living out our regular relationship. And I don’t mind it. We decided to just take things a day at a time. 

A part of me thinks it would be nice to have a gf, but I wish it was a more organic process to it.so i am terrible at writing bios, never been good at boasting. i want to get some feed back and i think my gf would give the best feedback cause well her personality meshes really well with mine (a hopeless romantic with a dirty edge.)  
but im worried it might seem a little rude.My boyfriend agreed to sit and talk with me about setting boundaries. I’m really trying to do my best and respect his polyamory and give him the freedom to be himself, buts it’s been tough so far. Feelings of jealousy and inadequacy and crying at night.

I just wanna know what’s reasonable to ask of him. From what we’ve discussed already he doesn’t wanna build any serious romantic relationships outside of ours.So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a couple years now and we’ve always talked about being non monogamous because she’s bi and I’m a dude. She’s started with a old girl friend she visited and we talked about it first and I had no problems. I made it clear I thought that I didn’t want her dating other ppl because I didn’t think we had enough time to eachother anyways with her figuring out working a job for the first time in a couple years and going to school. I was concerned she wasn’t gonna have enough time for me and that she’d find someone who can fuck  better and stop dating me. She’s now just hanging out with her old boyfriend, who i asked if she could like not fuck because I didn’t want her to catch feelings and she was like maybe. Now they’re going on dates and like weekend trips and she’s constantly telling me  too tired to have sex and that she doesn’t want to or when we do she’s like “are you done? Can we just stop im not into it” but she’s making a conscious effort to go on dates with her ex looking super cute and she’s clearly in a way better mood. I don’t know how to cope with dudes constantly pulling her aside and being like “hey ditch this guy and let’s go back to my house” and her friends asking her to go to parties but saying I can’t come. I’m trying to be included in her life and meet her friends but it feels like they’re trying to weed me out and I don’t know how to talk to her about it without us fighting or her just saying “we’ll go find someone else to fuck if you want to fuck because I already had sex with that other guy this week”. Every time I try to talk to her she ends up becoming further from me. I just don’t know what to do. 2-4 dudes invite her to fancy expensive things a week. Things I can’t because we share money and we’re broke and she says it’s unfair that she can’t go just because they don’t want me there…because they wanna sleep with her. She’s telling me I suck at certain things like eating her out and fingering but she doesn’t want me to practice on her because “it’s tedious” . I feel like she’s gonna break up with me anyway now and I have no idea how to stop it or fix it. I’m scared to death because I love her so dearly.  We live with her parents and I get along with them real well and we’ve been happy for so long now. We’ve been talking about marriage for a a year now. Any advice on how to deal with things would be great. I feel like every time I talk to my girlfriend she’s about to just tell me to move out. If there’s something fundamentally wrong with me or my through a behind how to be ethically non monogous. Let me know. I love this woman and will to do anything to make it work"Well yeah but this rough time is my life, things probably won't ever get better. This could be the new normal. I think a lot of things have changed and we as people have changed a lot too. The way I feel about you has changed. I definitely want you in my life. I want to be best bud's, I care about you IMMENSELY but I want to make sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that you understand I am telling you to move on romantically and sexually. I want you to be happy the fucking most. And that is genuine. I hope you're not mad. Please don't be mad. I am setting you free and that is a nice thing to do and something I should have clarified sooner. Please don't be mad. I am so very truly deeply sorry to even have to tell you this. I am sorry it is in text but I don't think we could handle a high emotional situation in person. I am not going anywhere. I am right here. Take a minute and I promise we can talk about it in person if you want later this week."Is it okay to ask my partner to wait? 

I (26M) am engaged to my partner (25F). We are long distance and will be for the foreseeable future while I finish school. She recently told me that she wants to explore ENM. We have had many really good conversations, and been open with each other about what that means for each of us. I have also had some sleepless nights and moments of extreme sadness. I currently don’t feel completely comfortable with the scenario. We have both downloaded apps and she has made some really great connections which she wants to explore with some casual coffee dates etc. I have attachment issues and trauma related to infidelity from people in my past. I am starting counselling sessions this week as well as reading all the books (PolySecure, Ethical Slut, Jealousy Workbook). I’m trying my hardest to be comfortable with what she needs but it’s all very new and different and scary. 

Is it fair for me to ask my partner to wait, and delay these dates until I feel more comfortable? I love her with all of my heart, I want her to be happy and I am interested in what this may open up for us, but I’m still contending with insecurities and jealousy. She is also so excited to meet these people and doesn’t want to drag/lead them on.We've exchanged a few messages about our interests but that's it. Should I tell them right off the bat or should I wait till they get to know me. I mentioned being poly in my bio on bumble but her bio said to contact her via instagram so she hasn't seen my bio. When should I tell her?

EDIT: thanks guys I'll tell her right away.

EDIT 2: I told her a few hours ago after the first few comments came in.Hi,

New to this way of life, which is going well. When in a polynomial relationship, do people develop different connections with their other that they may not have with their primary? Not in a bad or unhealthy way, but different connections, discovering things that you didn't know you had and then when you notice it's something you don't want to lose? Thanks.She wants me to sponsor  her lifestyle which is average and reasonable living To completely dominate her bc she says what she can get from 1 man she can get from 2-5 men and I don't like her sleeping w/ those men and idk if she's using protection but she says she is and it's only 2 other guys and one of the guys she share him w/ her GF  and she comes w/ her gf shes a more submissive I haven't met her yet. This poly relationship is my first and she's making it very transactional and she logical she believes a man w/  money, resources he can have how many women he desires and I believe it as well. I don't know how to feel moving forward bc I want a life of two woman eventual but I wouldn't want a woman who's hasn't slept w/ so many guys living a poly life she's slept w/ 20  guys for sure she told me but I'm believe it's more I want a woman who wants to have a gf and that she can be dominant or we can be dominant to  both woman can role switch being my pet for me and us. I feel I luck up bc she's wanting me to take this opportunity of being there man at het house and she has a room mate I set it up nice and I'm starting to explore  the beginning of my transitional of a high valued man and I think she sees my potential or benefits In being w/ me bc she heard my business conversation and me always taking her out to eat and  I'm curious if I don't are there other woman out there w/ less body counts bc I believe she's lost in the lifestyle and would move on w/ the next guy who has more I believe she doest know exactly what she wants bc she is contradicting herself by saying the man w/ the most resources & money can have me I believe she's doing it from a low vibrational and resisting her submissive w/ Monterey valuable things or may I say money is there. Should I dive in deeper and make it a lifestyle w/ her and structure her life I see woman following certain men bc the man manages well and she likes that I can do that w/ fruits of my labors showing and it's the begging making 60-80k this year independently own car services??⁉️⁉️So with this trend for more representation of alternate lifestyles such as a superheros son being gay I was curious to see if anyone more into comics could tell me if there are any superheros that are polyamorous. 

Asking this question made me think ofanother question: would polyamory be considered in the same category as being bi, gay, or lesbian?are you okay with hearing details about their sexual relationship? (outside of discussions concerning sexual health/STI risk mitigation, i mean!) 

what about cuddling, physical intimacy in general? in your opinion, is it unreasonable a boundary to not want to be privy to hearing much about the physical nature of their relationship?Today I'm typing this because I have one question regarding polyamory,

For context, I was talking to a guy which I met online and we were simply talking about meeting up, After a while he mentioned that he's polyamorous and he needed to clarify that before we meet up.

I replied that I'm willing to try it out but later I started to feel a little iffy about it, I want to give it a chance anyways since I'm open to new things but I'm afraid I'll lead him on simply because I wanted to experiment, Should I say something about it to him or should I talk about it later?

&#x200B;

Update: I've already talked most things through with him and he's fine with it, thanks alot for everyone's advice, I'll still gladly accept any other tips however!Alright so my boyfriend is absolutely amazing when it comes to my time with him. However, when I’m not with him and something major occurs, I feel unimportant. Like if the same happened to his wife, he’d be gone. Of course, I’d have no issue with that. 

But am I being selfish?

I’ve been the lowest of my lows for about a month and some now. He’s been very supportive over text but when I need him, he doesn’t come over. I’m currently in the hospital with some intense pain. I first told him that I’d be okay going alone, but now that I’m here, I want him. He said if I needed him, he would be here but he has a headache right now. 

Idk man. If I’m being crazy, please tell me. I might be looking to end this relationship :(I'm feeling frustrated that a few months ago I was confident, secure in myself and my relationships, and enthusiastically supportive of my partners and their relationships -- and now I'm bombarded with intrusive thoughts of "not enough" when I notice my partner texting other people. It feels like I've relapsed into early days jealousy, which is endlessly annoying given the books, podcasts, and therapy I've gone through to process that. 

 I know this is concurrent with a depressive episode that I'm working through with my therapist, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to weather insecurity (in myself, in my sanity, in my relationships) while I limp through this episode.

Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone. I'm feeling more sane than I've felt in a while, and I can't tell you all how much I appreciate the thoughtful and kind responses.My wife (30) and I (M30) talked a lot about having an open marriage for the past few years. She was always reticent until recently (November) she met someone she had a crush on.  I agreed that it was as good a time as any to try it on,  but we quickly moved decidedly out of Open territory, and she decided she wanted something long term with her crush, now, idk,  vaguely committed partner, so she decided we were going to be Poly. At the time this was a unilateral decision about how she was defining what she thought we were agreeing to, although our definitions were obviously very different. It's been a struggle for me, mostly because I wasn't really preparing for something as invested and emotional as a long-term partner, but I've been doing my best to be a supportive partner, and to take care of her when she's not sure if her beaux is feeling reciprocal, making sure things are taken care of around the house while she takes on some additional time expenditures to chase this new relationship.  

The root of the problem is this: Even before we agreed to try out anything, she was friends with the dude she's seeing. They like to go out to cocktail bars (both are bartenders) and drink, while I'm at home making sure that the dogs are fed, get a chance to pee, and then I can tuck myself into bed at midnight so I can get a good night's sleep before work. And then she started getting home, later and later, which was disrupting my sleep. Obviously as they grew more entangled, this problem continued to grow to a head, so when we decided to aim for open, I said that one of MY boundaries, an indicator that this isn't going to work, at least, was late nights. 

We agreed, 3 am is a reasonable time frame to be back home, and everything was alright for a month or so. Vut we're back, now, to this place of getting home at, 4, 5 ,7 in the morning, and it's killing me. I'm afraid that if I set my foot down, she'll resent me, they're deep in the NRE, and she's happy as she's ever been, but I feel like I'm losing it (both an impressive quantity of sleep and also my mind.) Have any of you lovely folks ever gone through something like this? I told her that I was feeling pretty last straw about it on monday, and there have been repeated 'extenuating circumstances' since then. Am I just being a huge ass? I know the conventional wisdom is to remove myself from the unfavorable relationship, but it feels like that's an overreaction to small fry stuff. Idk, I'm just feeling extremely frustrated and lost.I’ve been chatting with a man for a few days. He knows that I have a partner. He doesn’t know yet that I’m married and that I have a kid. We want to meet IRL but don’t have concrete plans yet. he isn’t experienced with ENM at all but says he is open to just having some fun. (I have very little experience). I thought about asking to have a video chat this week and telling him then.Maybe a little long. Thanks in advance! I have almost always been in open relationships in the form of me dating A, A dating B and me not dating or even ever meeting B. Well this weekend that changed. My boyfriend has a girlfriend, he and I have begun getting serious and she and I have begun talking. This weekend we are all in one house together, bf and I in one room, gf sleeping alone in her room. Weve all been hanging out, gaming, eating etc. He and I have kept down the PDA and have tried including her a lot but it still became overwhelming for his gf... I am unsure what all I can do, I have been giving them time alone together, he and I have kept the PDA down, we all talked this through for a while before this. Do I just give it time?Im not sure if this is an advice forum but I need unbiased opinion. I am currently in a polyamorous relationship with my son's father and his sons mother. They dated monogamously for years before me and him and then me and him dated monogamously for about a year before we started the polyamorous relationship. I just found out that he cheated on me basically our whole relationship with her. Now I'm conflicted because we are in this relationship now and that's how he looks at it. Like we're all in a relationship so that doesn't matter. However Im still hurt and I feel betrayed and disrespected, like everything was a lie. I'm on the verge of leaving because he was unloyal to me for so long. I just don't know what to do. Sorry if this is all over the place. Thanks in advance.


TLDR: Boyfriend cheated with 3rd before she was 3rd. Should I be mad.Hi,

I'm a man (he/they) in my late 20s and based in the UK, bisexual but most of my experience has been with women or femme NB people.

I'm autistic - this was diagnosed as a child (as Aspergers syndrome, as was the practice at the time given I was meeting most of my milestones but struggled with social interaction). I live by myself and have a full time professional job, as well as a variety of hobbies, although it's definitely a struggle to keep my head above water at times.

I think it's fairly reasonable to say that being autistic has messed with my ability to form relationships - what often happens is that I'm so surprised to go on a date or sleep with someone (which in all fairness, happens reasonably often under normal non-Covid circumstances), that I end up messing up afterwards. Often this is because I don't believe I'm desirable or that more opportunities will actually exist so will people please to try and preserve a new connection.

However, I'm aware of lots of other people of all genders who are autistic and practice varying forms of non-monogamy. This sounds like an inspiration, but it really isn't, because I feel like I must be failing in a way that I can't identify - especially because these other people don't appear to have anything in terms of personality that "outweighs" the disadvantage of being autistic. 

Whereas I could mimic the actions of a suave and confident neurotypical person, I can't just copy what other autistic people are doing right because I can make far less sense of other autistic people than NTs.

Overall I feel confused and more isolated than before, because it feels like other people with the same problem as me have worked something out and I'm sat scratching my head.My husband pitched in the idea of polygamy the initial plan was for both of us to have one extra partner. The main reason for us to arrange new partners was our jobs that kept us away during most part of the day. I work at the hospital and I take week off on a weekday and he has a regular weekend our timings don't sync-up and yeah I missed the sex.

We both talked and came up with a few rules and the rules were very clear to both of us and just to be more sure we wrote them down on a book using pen and paper. The rules were to make sure we both don't end up being in trouble and they don't affect our personal lives as well. We have jobs and a family and don't want anyone to know about it.

My husband talked to me about one of his friend who would be interested in me. It was his friend \[47M\] who was divorced with kids. I was a little uncomfortable because this guy was way older than me and I didn't like that but he was the only guy whom my husband was able to think of. I mentioned him a different guy who was in my age group but my husband was feeling insecure so I dropped him off.

We had him over our place for dinner and talked for a long time. He was being very nice to me and he was funny too. He told me that he was divorced and he showed me their pictures when they were together and he also showed me photos of his kids and they live with him after his wife left him. He also told me that my face reminds him off his wife and I don't believe that because visibly his ex was very beautiful.

After he left off I told my husband that this man was alright and I am ok with him and my husband gives me his mobile number and I messaged him and asked if he could come home tomorrow. He was excited and so was my husband.

The next day he comes to home with an expensive gift in his hand and offers it to me but I refuse to take it because it was a little too expensive but he keeps insisting and puts it on the dining table. I offer him a drink and we talk for sometime while he keeps comparing me with his ex-wife. Later after  spending a good time with him we both then walk to my bedroom and have some romantic time together.

Meanwhile my husband comes home after work and they both have dinner together. Next week he comes again with another expensive gift for me. To my surprise that was the same gift what I only told my husband about it over a month ago.

This raised the red flag I knew something was fishy. I talked to my husband about this and he told me that earlier that day he asked my husband about the things I like and he just answered his question but he wasn't expecting him to buy that for me.

Since then he still brings gifts to me and when he doesn't he brings gift cards. I honestly don't like this gesture of his and it makes me feel embarresed but my husband says that's alright with all of this. I feel very horrible taking those gifts and it is demeaning and I feel bad about that.

I have tried stopping him from giving me anything but he drops it somewhere in my house somewhere. 

Any advice should I stop meeting altogether?

I am not sure if this is the right platform to seek advice but if you know where I could post elsewhere please let me know.Hello dear redditors,

My girlfriend (27) of 6 years and I (30) live a healthy relationship. We work continuosly on ourselfes and the relationship, have a high communication standard and we try to Support one another in every way possible. Not a single thing about our relationship could be considered bad, toxic or unhealthy. We live happily together since 3 years now and organized our lifes pretty well together. We were speaking about free love and open relationships when we were together for the first months with a consense that people and we should be open for it because it is too beautiful and wholesome to have the intimacy to another person. We never lived this though and this topic kind of slept away while we had no need to let this become part of our lives. 

I love my girlfriend from my heart and wholesomely. I am very happy with her and I can not think of a future without her. She thinks the same way about me and I think is even dedicated a bit more to me. I have made clear maybe two years ago that she may have a sexual based one night stand with another guy which she did not have yet. She does not force it and was invested in work a lot lately. 

Four month ago the relationship to a platonic superficial female friend of mine (26) intensified. I enjoyed seeing her in a group of friends and we finally started meeting each other alone without others when we realised we have a deeper connection to each other. We met two times a week for a couple of weeks and got known each other pretty well. Whilst this process we integrated a close bodily connection too. We cuddle a lot, I massage her feet, she strokes/caresses my hair, we hug often and we both enjoy it.
To this part I spoke openly with my girlfriend about it. She was very happy for me on the one hand but sightly irritated on the other hand. We spoke about it and I assured her that she does not need to fear anything closer/sexual/romantic will happen with her which I assumed to that time. My girlfriend was absolutely ok with this situation and has not mentioned anything negative about it. 

Over time my sexual, romantic and intimate desire for the friend evolved more and I felt the urge to get closer to her. She obviously felt the same as a certain change in the tension between us happened. It's like a second level was opened for the relationship to her which no one could really talk about (which is pretty uncommon and new for me. I have a great urge to talk about things happening in relationships of any kind and think its the most important thing to care for the relationship by talking even about uncomfortable things). We both knew there was some deeper desire but did not let it out open. The second level broke through some times when cuddling got closer, caressing got a little more sexually but never stepped any boundary. Last week we went for a hike while drinking wine and we got to talk on a superficial level about our connection. It was very clear that we both desire more intimacy but we did not speak out open. We talked a lot about open relationships and she made clear that she would be ok with being part of an open one. 
I did not talk about this part with my girlfriend yet and I fear it because it has such an enormous all or nothing potential. 


Some days ago I had a good talk with my girlfriend about love in general, cheating, relationships general and opening relationship in particular. I opened up that I get more invested in the thoughts about an open relationship and more precisely about loving two persons at a time/polyamory. She was very understanding and also supported the thought theoreticaly very strongly. Practically she thinks she could/will have problems with it - especially with the moments lying in bed alone in the evening knowing that I am with another women right now. She leads it back to her fear of not being enough and getting replaced by another women. We talked long about this fear and I made some things clear and we had a therapeutic talk which led to lots of tears of joy and relieve. Even though her fear is still present but it is probably weakened.


Tl;dr: happy, healthy relationship with potential to be an open/polyamorous relationship. Platonic friend who turned into less platonic friend with interest in more. I want both people in my life. My girlfriend is more important without any doubt. 


I don't really know how to go on with this subject.

How can I truly open the relationship? Which way do people go to open it? Do you have any tips or thoughts on how to properly manage the situation? How do I deal best with her fears? How did you deal with your own and your partners fears and feelings?

Thank you very much for your time and your answers!The question that haunts me: Do I truly want multiple partners because one person can't meet every need, or am I just not happy with my current partner and would be happily mono with someone who is a better match? Is this transition worth the challenging emotional work, or should we just split?

I know only I can answer that, but has anyone else wrestled with this question when opening up a mono relationship\*? Why did you settle on polyamory over breaking up? Did it quiet the voice in your head that made you doubt your relationship? Would love to hear success stories, OR if necessary a reality check.

\*\*To avoid any "poly isn't the solution to an unhealthy monogamous relationship" advice, my relationship is generally happy and healthy with good communication -- I just consistently struggle with relationship anxiety, doubts, and boredom in LTRs. Also, both of us have been interested in polyamory since before we started dating, just never actualized it.Tl;dr i'm thinking of either asking my partner to be monogamous or breaking up with them because I don't think we're stable enough after 5+ yrs of me being poly.

Tw: self-harm, breakups, violence

Throwaway bc i don't know if my partner is on here or not. We're all in the UK, in our middle to late 20s, all bar one of us (partner c) are trans.

I feel like my partner (a) is unhealthily obsessed with their other partner (b) to the point their actually a danger to themselves and to our relationship.

A few nights ago I witnessed actual hatred from them that I've never seen before and they became violent toward themselves because partner b hadn't text them back in over a week, they said they feel ghosted, but they've been on quite a few dates so IDK why that'd be the case, and partner b is probably just busy with family

I've never witnessed this kind of behaviour from partner a in our relationship and it terrified me and I'm crying now just thinking about it in order to type it.

Partner a insisted that I break things off with my other partner (c) because "it's not fair that you have a partner who is interested in you when mine clearly isn't" and "I don't think your stable enough for poly" (because I text partner a about something that I felt insecure about and didn't realise partner b was in the house still, and partner a feels this is why partner b hasn't text back)

I didn't want to break off my relationship with partner c at first and now we've both calmed down about it and I don't want to bring it up again, but I think partner a is right, I don't think I'm stable enough for poly, I came out as trans recently and my insecurities are at an all time high, and I want to be at a point where I can communicate that better. But I also don't think partner a is stable enough for this either, I have never seen that kind of anger, hatred and violence in them and we've been together 3+ years... partner a has known partner b for about 3-4 months and has been on ten dates with them, and they had the worst breakdown I'd ever witnessed and self harmed in the first time over a decade, over the fact partner b hasn't text them back in one week.

I feel trumatised by that night and whilst I know they'd never hurt me I don't want to watch them hurt themselves, and I never want to see that hatred in them again I think I'd rather break up.

So I'm considering giving partner a the options of us two breaking up and freely seeing the other people, because us seeing the others whilst together is clearly very destructive, or both of us closing off our relationship until we both feel like we're stable enough as a couple... 

I don't want to do either of those. I am naturally poly and have been for 5+ yrs. I don't want to be monogamous and never have, and my insecurities being at an all time high is only a fairly recent thing (2-3 months). But I love partner a with all my heart and if that's what I'd need to do, then that's what I want to do, even if it means sacrificing something I consider my identitiy temporarily.

I know you can't necessarily tell me a one size fits all answer, but I've been up all night crying over this and I really need some advice and at this point will take anything because I don't know what to do and I'm scared.This is a new thing I’ve run into twice in the past few months. Match with guy (who doesn’t identify that he’s poly in his profile, but does within the first message), we start chatting, and we are getting to know each other with regular chitchat. What we’re looking for and current situations come up, and I mention I already have a long term significant relationship, but live alone, have lots of time for additional relationships, but he’s my primary in the sense I don’t plan on financial intertwining with anyone else. One guy was like, oh I’m only looking for a primary and unmatched me. The other guy was like “well it seems you’ve found what you’re looking for” and seemed like, kind of mad? I asked if he was open to other types of commitments and serious connections, and he said “well you’ve already got a primary.” I said cool, hope you find what you are looking for and got a thumbs up back. 

Is this a new thing? I 100% get wanting a primary partner. But not being open to other types of relationships? Is it that they think they won’t be able to find a primary if they have other partners?I don't know if anyone else has lived this, but I feel like I end up sticking to relationships more when they no longer bring me joy because I'm poly.

When a relationship gets to that point, in my mind I start going "well, if I was mono, I'd want to leave so I can find someone better, but since I'm poly, and the relationship isn't actively harmful, I guess I'll stay cos it's easier than breaking up".

Anyone else feels this? Any ideas on how to get out of this mindset? I know it's unfair both to myself and the people I'm with, and I don't like thinking like this, but it does seem ingrained in me. It's like living in a mono world has taught me that the only valid reasons to leave are if you're hurt or to search for someone better, never just because you recognize the relationship has run its courseFind yourself eating differently with one partner vs another?

Or, what about meals and cooking tips influenced by your polyamory?(English is not my first language, please excuse any grammar mistakes) 

I fell for 2 people who both have no idea that i am poly. For the past few months i've been single and in friends with benefits situations with both of them. They knew about each other and were fine with it since there was no "serious" relationship yet.

Well recently, one of them asked me out (mono relationship) and i said yes because i can see a future with him and i don't have chances to get serious with the other person anyway. 

Now, i love my partner dearly and i wouldn't want to get back out of the relationship, but now that i have to treat the other person as a "regular friend" without all the romantic and sexual aspects, it feels like something very important has been taken from me. 

I want to tell my partner about this as i want to be as sincere i can and i really want the relationship to work. Eventhough i know how understanding and accepting he is, i'm afraid of his reaction, since this could induce jealousy, misunderstandings etc...
But i really want to come out as poly and express my concerns and make this work out..

Any ideas on how to go about this?Hi all!

So I started dating a guy. We've been dating about three months. At the beginning of the relationship, we decided to keep things open and date other people. So, I started to date another guy and I was going on dates with other men. This was on top of juggling multiple part time jobs. At first, I loved the attention from the various men. It was great! But after a while it got exhausting. The different dates with new men in addition to consistently dating two men got to be a lot.

So I got ill this week and while I hate being confined to my bed, I actually enjoyed not having to go on any new dates and mostly staying away from the dating apps. Additionally, I've been thinking about my relationship with guy two and I kinda want to end it because the sex is bad and I don't feel a strong connection with him. He is nice but I just don't know if I want to continue investing the time. I'm totally ok with the other guy still dating other women. Plus, I still want to explore being with multiple men in the future. It's just that right now, I'm still in the midst of getting settled with my career. I have a couple of interviews next week and if I get one of those position, I could finally have just one full time position again. However, I wanted to get settled in the position before dating out again. What do you guys think? Have any of you gone through something similar?Hi all, I was curious about others' triad dynamics. I've been in one for about the past 6 months-ish and come a long way since my last posts, and now wonder about others' experiences.  


My set-up: NP with 'Blue' (he/him) for 6.5 years, dating 'Green' (they/he) for 7 months, Blue & Green dating each other for a little over a year. I want to continue living with Blue for... well, the foreseeable future, but I don't see that for me and Green. However Blue & Green do want to experience living together, so we'd have a... part-time them, part-time me situation I suppose? But generally living closer to each other, hopefully, in the future. I struggle sometimes with not wanting the same thing they both want, but they've never made me feel guilt for it and it's something we all know and accept and plan to work with in the future.  


Wondering if this is typical at all of other triads here, or how anyone else's situations play out? Much love <3I have a weird feeling of jealousy, I don’t know how to handle, any advice is very much appreciated! 

I’m partnered with 2 people and living with them for years. In December I started talking to a new person, we started dating and I’m feeling all this new relationship energy. 
Or to say it in an easy way: I have a fucking crush on them! 

They are poly as well, married - and that doesn’t bother me at all. 
BUT: they just started dating someone else, almost simultaneously to me. And it makes me feel bad. Should I tell them? How can I handle that nagging feeling? 

I’ve been with my primary poly partner for almost 1 year. It’s both of ours first poly relationship. We’re both 22. 

Recently, I asked my partner to be monogamous, temporarily or indefinitely. This is because of things I am going through in my own life, as well as some things going on throughout the relationship. He agreed, saying he loves me and would rather be with me temporarily monogamous, than not be with me at all. 

I guess I’m struggling to be okay with the transition, even though it’s one I wanted, and one he says he’s okay with. He definitely does not want to be monogamous, he’s expressed it. But he will do it. I can’t help but feel guilty for asking and restricting his freedom. 

I do love the ideals of polyamory - the freedom, the love, the compersion. I just feel I needed a slower transition into it than we had. (When we started dating, we both said we wanted polyamory, but I didn’t find out he was actually actively dating others until a few months in - it was a shock and I felt I was thrown into it unknowingly).

But, having been polyamorous in the past, I’m finding it hard to close the relationship and enforce monogamy, knowing I’m restricting his freedom, despite it being what I really want and need right now. 

And, there’s the pressure of “getting comfortable with opening up the relationship completely again”, because he doesn’t want monogamy in the long term. I feel the freedoms I am allowing are actually a big step for me, but compared to what we had before it still feels restrictive to him.

And, I’m struggling to trust him. He’s mentioned previously that when we agreed to be monogamous, he was unconsciously or secretly trying to find loopholes around it, and still be polyamorous. But he says he needs me to trust him, and that without trust we don’t have anything. Is it possible to trust him, knowing he does not want monogamy, and in the past he’s tried to find loopholes to get around my request for monogamy?I both me and my partner (both of us are nonbinary) are in a polyamourous relationship. I have PTSD and DID and my partner has pretty good mental health from my knowledge. Before I was in a relationship with them I was in a relationship with this girl who also labeled herself as polyamourous, although now I know she was just trying to find an excuse to find other people to replace me with. She would continuously break up with me for other people. She eventually officially broke up with me after I told her to stop sexually harassing me, which is a continuous thing that would happen, in that relationship. Recently my partner has mentioned that they are interested in this girl they go to school with. Now this would be fine, except I keep having flashbacks to everything that happened during my past relationship. I keep getting intrusive thoughts that they are just like her, and that they will eventually leave me once they find someone else. I know that they love me and won't leave me, but this fear won't go away. I'm also scared that if I talk to them about this fear they will leave. As stated before they have good mental health from what I know, and I have no idea what they thought it would be a good idea to date the person that is an emotional wreck 50% of the time. I think maybe they haven't realized how bad it can get, and if I overwhelm them they will realize I'm not worth their time.  I recognize I'm most likely overreacting, and that everything will be ok, I just thought I needed to rant about it somewhere.

Edit: My partner is now dating them. I'm not as scared as I was before, but I keep checking my phone, scared I will receive a break up text. It also doesn't help that they go to the same school, while me and my partner live 2 hours away from eachother. My partner is pushing for their girlfriend and I to be friends, which is what we agreed to if we were to date someone outside of our relationship. That part honestly is relieving. I know that because they did that they want to stay, and they really want both relationships to work out. I just also have bad anxiety. I will be fine though.Hello subreddit! So, I haven't seen my family in two years because of this stupid panini and they're now planning to visit me over spring break. However, I found myself in a lovely triad relationship this past two years and we now live together. I'm not out as lgbtq to my parents either, so it's going to be a bit of a double whammy, but I think they're going to be supportive at the end. But you never know, so I'm really nervous about it! I tried starting the conversation several times, but it's so hard from far away.

I guess I would just like to hear some experiences about how you guys came out to your folks and what they thought of it.Me and hers relationship started recently and she has told me she’s okay with me being poly and she is okay with me having other partners.

But earlier she told me that she is a bit jealous of my other partners and she feels like the least loved.

How do I reassure her that she is as loved as my other partners?

(My relationships are all long distance)TLDR: Partner is on a trip with someone else and I’m trying not to be a mess lol.

Longtime lurker, first-time poster. I (27F) am exploring poly after catching feels for my current partner (28M), who has other partners apart from me (and before you ask, yes, my relationship with him prompted the exploration initially, but I’m putting in real work to see if this works for me, including working with my therapist, reading books, listening to podcasts, spending a lot of time reflecting, etc. — it’s something that’s crossed my mind before, but I’ve never explored it seriously until now for a number of reasons). I’m actively looking for additional connections, but so far he’s my only partner. 

Here’s my issue: he just left on a vacay with one of his other partners and I’m trying to process how it makes me feel. I’m not necessarily having “I can’t/don’t want to do this”-type feels, but I’ve just never been in this position before and it’s a lot. I genuinely hope he has a lovely time, and he’s being very kind and supportive of my feelings, but looking for any advice/words of encouragement as I try really hard not to obsessively think about what he’s doing while he’s away and I’m “alone.”Hi Poly pals, I need your creativity! My nesting partner and I make queer stickers over at [**QueerHearts**](http://queerhearts.net) and we want to come out with a polyamorous set! I'm wondering if any of you have any fun poly sayings/catchphrases that are just a few words long but you'd like to see on a poly representation sticker. 

&#x200B;

Also, the design of the stickers is probably going to be using one of [these hybrid flags](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-93444e83030055891d33965adf1d6bfc) as inspiration, that combines the original poly flag with the newer infinity heart. Do people like this flag or is there a more widely accepted one?Basically im having insecurity around my primary partner having sex with others. Specifically in the realm of her doing things with others but not with me. 

Our sex life is fine, great even. But she had a threesome. And while she is open to the idea of doing that with me, she isnt right now because of the anxiety and insecurity this has brought out in me. In the mean time, there is a high likelihood that she will have another threesome without me.

Im feeling left behind, Inferior, and worst of all, like a 3rd(fourth?) Wheel.

She has been nothing but loving with me. She isnt ignoring me, or neglecting me in any way. Our relationship was unaffected until i told her how i was feeling. Then we started talking and working though it. But it feels like im spinning my wheels

Whenever the thought of her with them pops up, i basically get a panic attack. Or i start ruminating on how i feel, or how it could lead to her leaving me. All the usual demons of poly that pop up if you have self esteem issues.

But this is getting in the way of me being able to enjoy my time with her. Ill be snuggled in bed with her post sex, and thinking about her with them.

I dont know how to stop being afraid of her with them. And i dont know how to feel like i still matter. Because she is showing me i do, and i dont doubt her, but some how its not sinking in.My ex and I broke up in October, albeit on good terms - my wife and her meta had a nasty breakup that greatly affected the relationship with my other partner. Everything about it and the circumstances leading up to it really broke my heart.

Well, my wife and I started dating again, and I went on my first date on Thursday. I met her through Feeld, and she was in the area visiting from another state... but, she was a 90 minute drive away. We really hit it off well, and I have a job that requires a lot of driving, so 90 minutes doesn't bother me at all and was more than happy to drive it (plus, where I live is not conducive to ENM... damn bible belt).

We had dinner and drinks and lots of great conversation that lasted until the restaurant closed and they hinted we needed to GTFO. She had made it clear that she had no expectations prior to the date, and neither did I.

So, I hugged her at the end of the night, and then I just whisper in her ear, "Can I kiss you?" And she says "yes". And I start with a peck, not expecting much more than that, but it turned into a full-fledged passionate kiss that lasted at least thirty seconds (or at least it seemed like it).

And we break it up, and say our goodbyes again... and she grabs my chin, pulls me in, and gives me another open mouth kiss.

It felt really good. When I got home, my wife was happy for me.

We promised to see each other again when I'm in her hometown in April. Hoping it's sooner... :-)How to you stay sane and grounded when your two partners are in such conflict? 

They have both  explained to me whats going on for them.  I can get where both of them are coming from. I empatized with both of them. As of now I've thought of it as they're problem between eachother not my problem, but it's feeling like my neutrality is insulting to both of them. The sentiment being, how can i spend time with someone whose made there life to chaotic. Ive reinforced my boundaries for myself and feel okay within me but my relationships are suffering... 


Just wondering how other folks deal with there partners disliking eachother strongly? 

Do you allow them to vent to you about your other partner? 

Where do you draw the line?

Edit: Mostly looking for how other folks deal with metamors conflict as a hinge. Tips and tricks really. 

I'm solo poly we all have separate places. I did end up ending things with one of my partners late last year but looking for advice on how to handle it in the future.It’s one of those lovely Saturdays where NP/spouse and I are able to sleep in. He’s adorable snuggled up and lightly snoring, will make a happy noise without waking when I pet his head or arm.

I’m feeling lucky and happy but the tiniest bit guilty too. We’re less than a year into me being in an additional poly relationship and him testing the ENM waters. Since my other partner and I both have tight schedules we don’t get to see each other in person more than 1-2 a month. That time for me too gets the rose tinted glasses of being planned without work interference, and of course I share a different set of interests with them than with NP/spouse, so all that plus extended NRE, I find myself daydreaming about other partner *a lot.*

The guilt comes up bc I worry I take NP/spouse for granted. We’ve been together 15+ years and I’m so lucky to have him in my life. The day to day stresses and busy and just routine are better with him. I’ve been trying to be a better partner to him and set aside specific dates/bonding time. It can be hard though just with work and managing home together (we both tend to work 50+ hrs). 

Tbf I also juggle anxiety so maybe this is that. Or maybe it’s mononormative conditioning. I just feel… greedy? Neglectful?… daydreaming about the next time I get to see other partner when NP/spouse is here and lovely. Thoughts or advice from more experienced folks?

EDIT A WEEK LATER: thank you everyone for your responses. The reassurance is helpful, and the reminder to /really/ treat that time we set aside for ourselves is just as important (more so even) than the job and house responsibilities. Over self-sacrificing is something we are both actively working on, so making “down time” a priority together in fact helps us both follow through. 

Thanks again for the responses, I took the week to sit and *think* over them and listen to the little bit of guilt and see if it had anything useful to say or if it was something to let go. Externally processing it a bit here was very helpful. Wishing y’all a great week. 💙I am in a relationship with two people. Those two people are also with each other. We are wondering how marriage would work, as bigamy and marriage with more than one person is not legal in the county that I reside in. Can anyone help me?Hi!!!

I've been looking for some examples of polyamory/polyamorous themes in TV, music, art, celebrity culture. Even song lyrics or tv plotlines where polyamory is a subject. Bonus points if it's not super heavy-handed but is simply a depiction of this alternative love structure!! Thanks all! <3There have to be some out there. I know some might be Mormon but I was referring to the more traditional Baptist version. Wow there are too many different versions of Christianity, but I digress. If there are any on here please hmu. I'd like to pick your brain.My partner and I are relatively new to polyamory. Started transitioning from a monogamous dynamic about a year ago. We live together, have a child, certainly nesting partners, but we fully date separately.

Anyway, tonight was my partners first in-person date with her new partner. They haven’t called it that, but that’s what it is. I have my first in-person date with my new connection next weekend. 

I just came here to say.... all of this feels so right. My partner and I feel fulfilled as individuals, and our relationship has become stronger than either of us believed possible. We all need a few more positive outcomes to look towards. I don’t know about you, but I find affirmation in other people’s joy. 

Thanks for reading!Hey I have come here seeing advice so this is my first post and probably gonna be a long one. So buckle up.

So about me I'm 30 and have been in numerous relationships that have been monogamous. I have cheated in all of them something some sexting to full on sex (not the greatest person) but some of the people I've cheated with I have had strong romantic feelings for while having strong feeling for partner a . 

So I have been thinking lately hence why I've came here. Yes I know it was bad to do, but I'm I've been speaking to some friends that are Polly and asked a few questions like how would I feel if my partner was seeing other people ? Have I had feelings for the people Ive cheated with ect ect .

To answer those questions honestly If she was dating other people while dating me I would have no problems with that. And yes I have had feelings for other people.

So here are my questions for you folks.
How did you know your poly? 
How did you talk to your partner about it?
Is there a different between polygamous and an open relationship?okay so I’m going to try and keep this as condensed as possible, but please bear with me. 

My partner and I have been together in a monogamous relationship for almost five years now, and four months ago, I asked for an open relationship. 

I met someone at work that I had an organic, genuine connection with. I hadn’t found someone like that since I met my partner, and it really opened my eyes to see that love isn’t like pie, you don’t run out of it. Naturally, I felt really guilty for having these emotions, so I told my partner about them. He was crushed, and thought I was breaking up with him. There were a couple of hard days and lots of conversation over the next week. He told me he wished it were just lust, like a sexual desire, but I explained that it wasn’t, I liked him as a person and I felt a connection, which only hurt him more. I try to constantly reassure that this doesn’t make me love him any less, but I’m not sure that it’s landing with him. Then, the issue was that I wanted an open relationship because I had already found someone, which was wrong to him, so I agreed to not pursue anything with my crush and start our relationship with something more neutral for us, like starting from scratch.  But of course, nothing has happened yet. We’ve joined a couple poly-friendly dating apps but we haven’t agreed to anything. We’ve negotiated “rules” and I’ve read The Ethical Sl*t and The Jealousy Workbook, and I’m now in the middle of Opening Up. I’ve taken notes and given him the synopsis of each. 

Well recently we were traveling across states to visit family, and about four hours in, he starts being reserved and quiet. I asked more than once if there was something wrong, or something bothering him that he wanted to talk about. It’s normal for me to have to ask multiple times if something is on his mind, as he usually will try to keep the peace over small things, but this time he came out with, “What if I said no? That I didn’t want to try an open relationship?” Which kind of struck a chord with me, but I understand that when we started dating, neither of us had any intention of having other romantic feelings for others, despite the multiple other women that have joined us in the bedroom. So anyway, I explained that I would at least like to try an open relationship before completing trashing the idea. 

We’ve talked previously about what our goals were in trying an open relationship, if there were no consequences (some exercise in one of the books) and mine were along the lines of having more than one partner that I cared for deeply, my current partner would be my primary partner and nesting partner, and I would try and divide my time fairly between whoever else. His goals were different, but it mostly felt like he hadn’t put much though into it, like he would be okay with whatever because this isn’t something he thought he would be pursuing. 

Now, I’m not sure where to go or how to bring up that I’m ready to get the ball rolling. Can we still maintain our relationship if we want different things? 
I’m kind of lost, because I can’t stop thinking about my crush and hoping he’s thinking about me, while also being madly in love with my partner. I need some advice from someone with experience in this area. I’ll take anything I can get.So my gf and I were discussing some of her partners and we ran into an issue.  She has two partners that for different reasons are not quite ready for boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other label.  Yet they are closer both than a typical friends with benefits arrangement.

Is there an existing label or labels for this?  We both feel like this should have a proper label to give the relationship its due and to properly set expectations.I'm not asking for advice ... though I'm happy to hear some ... or to read your own stories about this.

My NP was having some troubles with her boyfriend so decided to have a conversation with him about it last night (I wrote about this in a different thread yesterday). 

She went over there at 9pm last night. She came back at 9:05pm. When she walked back in the door, my heart sank and I thought "Uh oh. That can't be good."

So she got to his place and started to address some of her concerns, but he broke off the conversation within 1 minute and said they were done and he didn't want to talk anymore. 

So she came home to me and I get to deal with the fallout... 

I'm not complaining. This is part of being poly. And while it's not "fun" I am also glad that I get to be there for her in the pain. 

I try not to give cliche advice (all of which is true, but not helpful for someone in pain):

"There's plenty of fish in the sea."
"He doesn't deserve you."
"Endings lead to great beginnings."
"He'll regret leaving you."
Etc
Etc. 

For myself, I just let her cry and yell and say whatever she wants. I try to just give the gift of presence. 

The only thing that concerns me is she keeps saying "I'm done with men! Men suck! You guys don't deserve women!" 

Probably true ... but I hope that's just the pain talking. 

Anyway... THIS is one of the downsides to being Poly, but is also where the rubber meets the road and you can know if this way is really for you or not. If you can weather dealing with the pain of someone else breaking up with your NP, you will come out stronger on the other side.I want to start this post off by saying that I am more then okay with whatever comments come my way in terms of negativity due to the situation presented as the position I've not only put myself in but what we've established we be put in, revolve around the situation that I was not only that guy but she was also the one that allowed it. Though it doesn't make sense just yet, it'll make sense down the road and even though there really is no excuse for it, perhaps the full explanation along with the concerning thoughts and feelings may show just how sincere the situation is, as well as what we mean to one another. Again, I am more then open to the negative comments on what I did considering I have taken the full responsibility and weight of it over the years.

&#x200B;

I come to this subreddit today after finding it while looking through links on google in order to help myself understand and be okay with the situation that a friend/lover has found that she is poly and I say found in the sense that she was drowning herself in a sea of worries, thoughts and delusions that she had to be something specific without letting herself be herself. A hilarious foreshadowing of the explanation that I am to give you here shortly but my major concern is how others in this community who might be in or have been in, combated these feelings and concerns, how they overcame the hurdles or what their end result was. Polyamorous relationship is something completely new to me and even though in a weird yet complicated sense of things, I am both in a relationship with her but also not, a long distance friendship where our feelings for one another are about as deep as a real relationship and the yearning for one another just as deep but again, complications that will be explained in due time. I don't imagine my post will be short or bitter sweet, quite the opposite, I expect it'll be long, full of raw emotion and power so I apologize to those who aren't huge readers but I could honestly use any and all advice/help to help me move on with my problem, whether for good or bad so I am preemptively thanking you in advance for reading.

As mentioned above, I am in what I would considering a very complicated relationship with a friend that I've known for well over 14 years, longer then her current partner and most of her friends. I am 32 and she 33 if that all matters and we are but a country apart to make things that just more interesting and complicated, never an issue on the idea of being unable to visit one another with the limitations of lack of money to see one another, more like boundaries or our own limitations that kept us from seeing one another.

Back when I was the ripe old age of 18 and she 20 (two year difference) I had met her on a online site for those with creative reading, along with many other things where she was trying to build confidence in her person and body imagery by selling sign pictures, pictures where she held up a sign with peoples names on it and to kill the curiosity, no it was nothing like todays current age of pictures like OnlyFans or Fansly, more like dress up pictures. I had become friends with her and another online and found myself talking to her everyday, understanding and learning of the current her then and there, establishing a quick and trusting friendship that for myself, had slow building feelings where on her end, she had developed deep feelings after several months of chatting with me and genuinely enjoying my presence. I had never dated or did anything through my younger teen years, avoiding such things to keep to studies and just living my life as much as I wanted (I was no book worm or nerd as some might label it, I was quite the opposite, laid back and wanting the most out of my life) so for me, I was quite inexperienced with others feelings and how to handle women but friends were a different story as I had made friends with women more then I did men and it wasn't on the level of attraction but more just that I didn't think of men or women in the sense that women had to be friended to be sought after or men to establish a broship with, I didn't look at gender as having any specific meaning other then having friends.

A months before I was to turn 19, she had approached me and asked if I wanted to enter in a relationship with her, something she had thought about long and hard on as she was never someone who was into long-distance relationships because of the previous hurt breaks she had, both close and far, swearing off the distant relationships due to these but found something different and stronger in me, building her interest off not on attraction but how well we conversed, talked to each other, made each other feel special to one another in our own way and just how at peace we were together. This is where the first wave of negative comments may come in as I was a fool, a damned fool at that as it is one of my biggest regrets that I honestly will take to the grave with me, but I had declined her feelings, telling her that she was a great friend and that even though I had the capacity to love her, I couldn't.

Why couldn't I love her? despite being a young adult and having the ability to think for myself, I fell for the stupid preconception that was brought upon me by society, by what media tried to explain and more so my own father that a man could only love a woman who was skinny or fit, that she had to be the prettiest thing out there to be with and my friend at the time was a woman who had body issues, a few extra pounds that curbed her growing heart but was the most beautiful gal you could see. I shattered her heart and looking back on it, my own years later to think that I was so naive, stupid and easily manipulated in the idea that I gave up on someone who genuinely loved me for me and not for appearance where I chose the later. I actually ended up becoming someone who hated masculinity in the sense of relationships later on, giving up on that preconception that man needed to date or do certain things in relationship merely because he held the role of male but that's a different story to tell.

With her heart shattered, my friend didn't give up on talking to me and being around me despite how strong of a heart ache and break she had, fighting those feelings while still holding genuine love for me despite not being able to reciprocate it and in time, I disappeared for a year as I finally began my adventures into relationships and quickly grew to understand that the preconception that society, my father and media gave me were false and that I indeed, did love women who had a little extra, not a staple of what I needed but more of a understanding and acceptance that I was willing to love more then what I was told to love. Hurt by my own thoughts, I had decided that I wasn't allowed to talk to her and went on to date others, hurting myself in the process until she came back to talk to me once more, reaching out to me and helping me get over an abusive relationship that mentally racked me and destroyed me.

I let it all out then, explained how I was a fool to her and how I had denied those feelings of her because of what I was lead to believe and she forgave me but with that small bit of fleeting feelings came turn for my own heart ache, she had found someone else to replace me. She explained that she tried her hardest to bury her feelings and found someone else to mend the hurt that her heart had weeped over because of me and I was too slow by a year to say what I had to but she couldn't deny my love and her own feelings.

This is where negative comments are more likely to surface from; Knowing that she was in a relationship and conflicting myself with the idea of wanting to respect it and stay away as well as try and convince her otherwise, we entered what I would call a state of affair simply by having something online, being cute and flirty online while keeping the distance in knowing that she was with another that she loved just as equally and was there for her. We kept this online relationship going for years before things began to escalate from just the cute aspects of talking to one another to more serious things, pictures/videos of one another in less and less clothing, voice chats and breaking spending time with her partner to play games with me or simply chat while maintaining a healthy relationship with her partner or so we thought.

I over stepped on their anniversary which ended up with her partner who I had become friends with, messaging me to tell me that I was a piece of shit, scum and plenty of other words which I whole heartedly agreed with, the idea that if he had the chance, he'd beat my face in which I was more then willing to accept and lost a friendship with him. I over stepped where I shouldn't and I wasn't going to try and defend myself and say that what I did was right or had proper meaning behind but the feelings that she and myself had were too strong on a sense of friendship that I ended up taking a bigger step back and stepped out of her life once more to allow them to heal and be what they wanted while understanding that I had screwed up.

Skip a few years after ending another relationship that I had been in, once again that friend of mine came back to talk to me and asked to continue on with what we had. Cautious and defensive, I explained that I didn't think it was right due to the hurt that I had made not only for her but for her partner who I respected. She explained to me in detail that after I had disappeared, there had been plenty of conflict between himself and her but ultimately they resolved it, explaining that she had only done what she did with me out of the purest sense of love that she had sought from me that he couldn't offer without the idea that he couldn't but more or less that another could give without being unfaithful to him.

They had talked and eventually he came to a understanding of her having a online relationship with another so long as it was simply that, online. We masked it and hit it under the veil of a Dominate/submissive relationship and explored life a little more through erotic literature, images and voice chatting with regulations and rules. I could only talk and game with her for X amount of hours before he came home and she'd spend time with him. Fridays, Saturday's and Sunday's were entirely his which meant Monday through Thursday, I was allowed to chat with her until he was to come home and that was the rules he instated and we followed, I didn't want to do something I shouldn't once more.

For years we kept it up, growing closer to one another as we grew to understand each other on a whole other level and having a deeper connection. Eventually, without even realizing it on both of our ends, she began to develop her inner poly understanding and through the D/s relationships and even researching into it, she released that she was missing a proper Dom in her life as her husband was submissive in the bedroom (forgot to mention that through out them being together, they had decided to marry after the incident where I stepped away from) and as much as she loved him, she was craving someone who held that ability. Having shared stories of just how I was in the bedroom without playing it up, I had become that ideal person to her and our relationship began to grow even more with talks about it and ideals.

Skip to September of last year, she had finally come out as being Polyamorous, having read some books and done some research, doing some deep soul searching, fighting through a deep depression that had her health fading and losing hair over it, she had finally realized that she was more then monogamous and I was the first real initial understanding of it. Sitting down with her husband and explaining it to him, he ultimately understood what she was saying and they've been in a trail ever sense in the idea that he is still trying to understand and be okay with it. With the new found information and ideal in her life, with the excitement behind her, she had come to me to explain it all and as I sat there listening, I felt myself becoming excited in my own way, especially when she mentioned that he would allow her to eventually go out and date another so long as she never mentioned who and what they did, merely that she was just 'going out' as I've read as one of the rules that most Poly people do with a mono partner.

I've been in the process of renewing my passport since then due to a family members wedding come April of this year so I was more then okay and excited with the idea that she had presented... that is of course until January came around and she messaged me saying that she had been stuck staying awake with thoughts and feelings of someone and didn't know what to do. Jokingly, I mentioned that I was jealous that someone other then her husband and myself were being thought of and naturally, was there for her and that's when she mentioned that she had found someone through a kink dating app that she hadn't been actively looking for but he had found her appeared. Heartbroken to think of what that meant, pretended to be okay with everything the first day as she gushed about this connection she had with this other, practically feeling like everything we had done had been just out of convenience and pushed aside.

I confided in her the next day and laid my feelings out on the table, mentioning that I had felt replaced, that the idea she had of me finally being able to see her and be something offline rather than online, had simply been a figmented idea or a lie and that's when things broke down. Our messages back and forth were lengthy and long, mine primarily of anger and casting daggers at both her and other who was in the picture and her of hurt and trying to understand that eventually escalated to her sending videos and seeing her in tears. Despite my whole idea of disliking masculinity to a degree, I felt devastated to see her in tears, to see that I really meant a whole lot to her when I felt like perhaps that wasn't the case in my hurt and torment and I began to show a bit of understanding or rather, was willing to begin to understand and adapt.

Struggling with the idea, even now which is why this thread was made, I began to sit there and try to understand things, to become accepting with things. Just as I was doing this, she decided to sit down with her husband and talk to him about everything, from us back in the day to the current understanding of her Poly relationship lifestyle she was trying to get into and even though I was ready with the idea that I'd be cast aside with the understanding that I wouldn't be allowed in her world, we were both shocked and surprised that he was okay with it. I had hurt the poor guy and damaged a lot in his mind but he was willing to forgive me, albeit it would take time. Respectfully, I was ready to be cast away without question because I was the poor excuse for a human that stepped into a relationship that I never should have but couldn't because of deep feelings but came to a understanding with all this that unfortunately, I will probably never be something offline to her.

Between finding out that he was willing to forgive me, coupled with my respect towards him and never wanting to step over those lines again, a different side of misunderstanding or better described as trying to understand, I began to question where I fit into the equation. To me, I had thought I had once again been reduced to just a friend, a friend who had added benefits of things but she continued to tell me that I was just as important to her as her husband and this new guy were, I was her first real introduction into the poly world and despite loving her husband, I was her first true love and she could never get me out of her heart, even if I walked away. To me, it seems funny to reciprocate the feelings, perhaps because of that naivety that plagued me years ago but a 32 year old feeling that love and wanting to give it back to her, even if stuck in a online relationship, feels good and fills the void that I've had for years having not been back in the game due to prior break ups.

During the whole heart break however of trying to understand and fit in with this poly situation, we would share music videos with one another with powerful lyrics that spoke true to our heart about one another, a mix of genre's and so forth but the one thought constantly the comes back that keeps me halted and questioning things involves the new guy. For years I had been okay with her husband and actually thought and teased at her with the idea of Poly relationship with him, I had steeled myself to be okay with her with him but for some reason, this new guy to me, threatens my very being of the relationship I have with her that I am constantly stuck in my head, making me lose sleep and health just thinking about it, missing out on a appetite and eventually finding myself crying over it.

I'll make mention that I am 100% understanding that I know that I'll probably never have a offline relationship despite all the talks we had and how she truly wanted to meet me and explore that romantic relationship we sought throughout all the years, both coming to the understanding that we don't want to hurt her husbands feelings and make him go through what he did before. I committed that sin once and mark it as another thing I regret, I may be human but I've marked that on me as one of the worst things I have ever done and don't count myself a good person, I don't even think I deserve the forgiveness that he is willing to try and give me but I will never deny him his wants to do so. Even though I have that understanding, my heart definitely still weeps for the idea that I'd be allowed it one day but I know it'll never really happen.

Returning to the new guy, he happens to pluck at strings with her that I use to and things like pet names that I gave her that made things special in my eyes and hers at the time, he uses all the same and makes her happy. For me, I am unable to call her those pet names anymore because no one else use to use them and made it special to use, so much so that when we were talking about it all, I told her that I couldn't use that nickname for her and that things felt like we had been reverted back to when we first met and that I would have to learn to love her all over again. Confused yet understanding, she agreed and tried to find new pet names that I could use for her but I told her that it wasn't something I could just choose like that, I'd have to figure it out and find them though I find myself troubled by almost slipping up with the same pet names.

The times that I was allowed to share with her seem less and less despite her explaining its not on purpose as she's been heavy into schooling for a career change which she's provided proof of is keeping her from doing so and now with another in her life, she needs to make time with her husband being the prominent figure who gets the most time which I agree with and now him and me. At first, I wanted be the second guy, I wanted to stand on that pedestal above the other, especially when she had mentioned that with talking with her husband, things would only be once or twice every month or other month in seeing this other because her husband is monogamous and is having issues with it all the same and is trying to be just as adaptive. Since then, I've learned to understand that I am not the second place guy and part of me hurts from it but the better part of me understands that with them being offline, she can give him that time.

What am I asking for advice? I don't expect there to be a lot of people who might share a similar experience as mine or even be stuck in a relationship that is only meant for online on a romantic, yet spiritually mental level where physical touch isn't involved in but I do seek advice as to how people got over the idea of jealousy in a Poly relationship where one partner was monogamous while the other was Poly, what kind of steps they took to grow a better understanding and just be the person there for them. I suffer from the idea that I need to start over with her despite wearing masks everyday and walking on egg shells so I'm not someone completely different with my hurt, we both know that the process of understanding and healing will take some time, she's doing the same thing with her husband and even this new guy who knows everything, from her being married with her husband who isn't 100% on the idea to even myself and he's willing to take things slow and adapt to what needs to be done so she herself is well overburdened with stress and emotions.

There have been a few times in our conversation about it all that she's blown up and then apologized afterwards because of it all, often apologizing for her coming out as poly being the reason I have these feelings and the lack of understanding but continuously telling me she doesn't want to lose me from her life but is understanding if I wanted to walk away though she'd have to prepare herself. Personally, I don't want to walk away either but growing a understanding and acceptance of it all is a rocky road that I need to learn and understand, even if online, she's been the one person I've been able to vent to and talk with without a filter and both of us having a deeper understanding to one another.

How did you get over the jealousy of your partner with another and learn to accept it all? how long did it take you before you were moderately accepting, if at all completely accepting and understanding of it all? I know it probably wont happen right away that I come to understand especially as I search through my feelings of being lead around with the idea that I'd finally be able to be something in person with her after she mentioned it and taking it back when she didn't want to hurt her husband anymore after coming clean but eventually I feel I can do it. Part of me thinks that I need to walk away for a little and come back later with a different idea or merely have some time alone but I also feel like walking away or turning my back on her like that without speaking with her and openly talking about it would damage any kind of relationship we have.

Its a very complicated situation Polyamory and I'm really hoping I can find some advice, even with any negative comments you might offer with it about the situation we went through, I 100% realize I was in the wrong for going after another's woman but the feelings we each had for one another made it hard so I am fine with living with the shame that I accepted and wear. Any advice however would be appreciated, thank youSorry if on the wrong page, maybe there's a relationship advice thread I dunno about. Help plz if so.
Also sorry for any grammar/word mistake - not native english speaker, and also slightly drunkenly summarizing the thoughts Ive had for several months.

I am in the most stable relationship Ive ever been with.
My partner is amazing. Just flat out amazing.
He handles issues like a champ and is very solution-focused, and a good person inside/outside a relationship.

I had some issues as a newbie poly that lead to me seeing a therapist previous to meeting my partner.
Ive been in a relationship with my partner for about 3.5 years.
During this time, covid might be part of it, it has changed to a level I dont know if Im comfortable with.

Im seeking perspective before talking to them, to just maybe have some of the thought work done before we have our discussion.

I miss the poly/open I used to be.
I like flirting, sex doesnt have to be love for me, I love getting a connection of sorts without having to hold back - but I do develop feeling quite easliy. Which is part of why Ive gone mono for this time - I did not want to spread out my heart as it took more energy than I had. My partner and I started poly, tho they wanted to be mono - and well here we are.
(Note that I differ between connection and feelings)

In the relationship we've kind of lost the physical thouch.
We dont cuddle, have declining sex to maybe 8times a year, and I dont feel wanted at all. Words can be sweet but there is no action following.
We dont really kiss - only a "peck". 
Which is ok, some people dont like the whole tongue-schlobber-fest - but in addition to all else it affects me. 
Its slightly better with out emotional connection - they havent changed much here - but I feel the lack them trying to understand me frustrating. 
I do like to bring things up by myself, good or bad, so we can talk about it together. But they never ask themselves about my work with poly/mono thoughts, or other things.
I can tell my/ask for their thoughts regarding our lifestyle, daily routines, hopes for the future, wants and needs - but they never do. They might be thinking about it - but they never bring it up with me unless I ask first - and the poly/mono is a thing they dont seem to want to talk about at all.

Regarding touch.
I did gain weight during the lockdowns - I still think I look "objectively ok/nice" but Im not skinny anymore, and in combo with everything else I dont think my partner is at all attracted to me at all. 
And I think they are ok with this frequency of intimacy (maybe asexual/aromantic? I need to ask again) but I do not want this for the rest of my life. 

I love them as a person, and a partner. But I dont know where to draw the line between wants/needs.
We have fun with our daily stuff (work/games/inside jokes/decisions regarding our living situation) but we dont work physically anymore.

I know he doesnt want an open relationship due to the fact he is afraid that I'll develop feelings - which is valid with my history.

We have discussed the above, how I am working with handling it but.. they do never ask follow-up questions.
Which isnt at fault - we do kind of have a "If there is a problem speak up"-attitude which is usually very effective.

Please, roast or critisize me all you want - I want more peoples opinion so it'll be welcome either way.
If you can give advice/knock sense into me it'll be worth it.What do yall personally do with unrequited love? How do you move past it? Or do you compartmentalize it? It makes me feel silly, and shamefulI just started seeing someone new for the first time since before the pandemic. Everything is going great. Great connection and chemistry. No red flags anywhere. He asked me back to his place and I totally froze and said I wasn't quite there yet.  He was of course understanding, we made out a good bit, then I went home. 

Ordinarily I would have said fuck yes, so I wasn't too sure why my instinct was to turn him down. I have a stress fracture in my leg, so I'm generally feeling vulnerable. But it might be also linked to the pandemic.

I talked to my husband when i got home.  He mentioned that he got nervous when he started dating post vaccine. He said he was so used to barriers everywhere and not going inside anyone's house that it kinda freaked him out a bit. 

Has anyone else experienced this anxiety during the pandemic? I think this might have been part of my hesitancy.She's completely neglected me for her new partner and I feel like I'm just around to pay the bills and take care of her. I've tried to ask her for more, but she seems incapable of pushing back on her other partner. If he calls she immediately leaves, even if I need her. If we're hanging out together, she only sits or cuddles with him. If we're alone she doesn't give me any attention. I've tried so many times to communicate that I need her affection and she always says the right things but the actions never last more than a week. 
  
I'm done. I've tried poly for over 2 years and haven't found anyone for myself and now I'm done feeling like I'm just a bank account for my wife's pleasure.i was in a poly relationship last year (MFF) that just never worked no matter how much we communicated. it was something new for all of us so i think that was a factor. i guess my question is what has helped your relationship thrive?  
i don't think poly is for me anymore, but i guess i just want to understand where things went wrong or what could i have implemented to make it better??Are there certain gifts that you would not be ok with your partner receiving from another partner? And is it normal to need permission from primary to accept a gift from another partner? 

For background, my (35F) husband (31M) and my boyfriend (34M) are both nesting partners to me. I've been with husband for 4 years, and boyfriend for a little over a year. There has been quite a bit of mistakes and difficulties, and I'm aware this situation was not entered into as well as it should have been. However, most of that has resolved and things have been much smoother.

Boyfriend and I work for the same company, but at different job sites. Our current schedule allows us to both be home most, if not every night (just depending on if the drive is too tiring. Boyfriend found out Thursday that the company is moving him  to a site 4 hours away for an undetermined amount of time and he will have to leave tomorrow. 

So of course this is a big change for me. I've gotten used to seeing him daily, and we're fixing to be in a LDR with very little warning. 

So, while boyfriend and I were on our date Thursday night, he decided to buy me a ring. Not a wedding ring, although it is a small silicone band similar to the one I do wear as a wedding ring (I don't really like metal rings). He bought one for me and one for himself, that we both are wearing on our right hands, which he explained his intention as a symbol for reassurance that our relationship is still important even though he will be far away. 

Back around Christmas, I had sent a picture of some rings I liked to both husband and boyfriend together in our group chat with a message like "just saying if anyone wants to buy me one, I like these." They both saved the picture, sent back something generic like "ok babe, love you" and nobody ever said anything else about it. My husband never said that that bothered him or anything. 

Now, my husband is absolutely livid. He's pissed at my boyfriend for buying it, and at me for accepting it. I've explained to him that it's not meant to be a wedding or engagement ring, but he's not having it. He called my boyfriend and screamed at him, claiming that at some point he had told my boyfriend that buying me a ring was never ok. My boyfriend says that conversation never happened and that he wouldn't have done that if he'd known it would upset my husband.

I don't want to not wear it, the gesture did feel very reassuring and made me happy. And functionally speaking, they are both nesting partners so I guess my analytical brain does not understand how a piece of jewelry changes my relationship with my boyfriend or has any bearing on my relationship with my husband. So I guess my question here is how should I have handled that differently/better? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend bought me a ring, husband is pissed. Am I supposed to ask permission for my boyfriend to buy me jewelry?So I am an ENFJ and am one of those people who likes to just break through that fourth wall and get into feelings and such. Well, I started dating an INTJ and while it hasn't been super long I can't seem to get a read on her. She doesn't seem to want to open up or anything and I wonder if this can work or if it just takes her a long time. I have expressed my feelings about her and when I ask how she feels she will answer with things like "I'm comfortable with where things are and like to take it slow." She kissed me first and most certainly seems to like me from what I can tell. I like to actually verbalize those feelings but she doesn't seem to express them at all. She will want to schedule further dates but I am wondering if we just aren't compatible or if it just takes her a long time. The attraction is there for sure. The eye contact is intense but I want to connect at an emotional level which is really important to me. Maybe we have totally different ways of expressing and receiving love. Just need a platform to think out loud and get some insight.  


\*\*EDIT\*\* take the Meyers Briggs stuff out of the equation and just simplify it to me wanting to hear how the person I'm dating feels. :) So I’m 22 and still haven’t gotten my license (driving scares me) and even though I have yet to go on any dates I’ve been talking to a few people and will most likely meet up with them. My partner and I have talked about how will I get to dates and we talked about him dropping me off. I honestly think it’s kind of funny to have my partner drop me off to dates. Hopefully future partners will understand or I’ll get my licenseDoes anyone else have relationships that are romantic, but not sexual for whatever reason? Interested to hear people's stories if they are willing to share.I'm wondering if there's a good "am I poly or not?" test online.

I think she's poly (solo poly or RA). She's been in a monogamous relationship with this guy before and they broke up, now he's professed that he's still in love with her and he's thinking of moving 1000 miles away to be with her when she moves. She's considering going along with it.

I think she doesn't really know if she's non monogamous or not. I've asked her questions about it and her answer is usually like "I just don't want any serious connections right now" or "I need to think about it". 

I was dating her but she's kind of a mess and she's moving away anyway so I'm downgrading her to "maybe we'll hookup again sometime in the future". We started off non-mono and I was really into her but I'm losing interest hard because well, for one, she's moving away and for another thing she's just messy, emotionally. From what she's told me about her past she prefers to be in FWB relationships. Unfortunately the reason she prefers that seems to be because she prefers not to have to deal with other people's expectations and emotions.

If you had a friend who seemed poly to you but was about to get into a mono relationship -- and you think that's not a great idea -- what information would you share with them to help them sort out whether they are poly or not or what sort of relationship will work best for them?

My emotional investment here is in being a good friend to her and helping her make good choices that will not hamper the life change she's about to make. It's a great opportunity for her, this move and the new job, so I want to see her succeed at it.I’ve been thinking about the lines between polyamory and other forms of ENM. The more I think, the more blurred they get.

What are your thoughts on having multiple romantic, loving relationships while also leaving room for exploring other sexual desires in a more casual way? 

I’m still sorting through it. But I see myself wanting to enjoy a wide variety of relationships. Poly partners, play partners to explore kink, alterous partners. How common is it for people to practice multiple relation styles at once with different people?I’m new to polyamory. My partner and I are newly long-distance and poly. We were dating in the same city on and off for a while and then I moved away. We rekindled and here we are now. Anyways, I’m struggling with a few things, some of it may be more LDR related than poly. Also, I’m sure most of this could be solved by just talking to them. My first question is how much do y’all disclose to your partner? Do you tell them about every date you go on? And when they do go on a date, do you abstain from texting? I dont want to talk to them because I don’t want to interrupt. Do you guys check in before or after? 
ThanksI know I have been posting a lot but I wanted to end the day with a fun conversation.My partner has been talking to this guy, who to me is giving off red flags. I brought up the concerning things he said to her, and she said she didn’t see them as red flags. She then expressed annoyance herself by his behavior, but has decided to continue to talk to him. I’m worried about my partner being mistreated, and from what I have heard I feel like they’re not a safe person to engage with. I want to support my partner’s choices, but this choice I disagree with out of fear of her safety. Is my position in this situation to step back, and let things play out? It hurts to watch this, but respecting her choices feels like the right thing to do.So I came across this term only recently, and I now understand it to be the term for a person who joins an existing couple to form a poly triad. 
I recently opened an account with Feeld as it seemed like a very inclusive and open dating app, so thought it would be good to try! 
But the more I’m on this app, the more I’m seeing “No unicorns!!!” In people’s bios, but written much more hostile than that 😬 
Can somebody clue me in to what the beef seems to be with unicorns?? Particularly on a dating app where a lot of couple are looking for threesomes, fuck buddies, thirds, etc, isn’t that essentially a unicorn? Or am I confusing my definitions here? 
Just trying to learn more about what’s okay and what’s not in the poly universe so no hate please 😇 just trying to further my understanding!So my question is this. When you're having some issues with one relationship, what level of comms should you go into with others so they know why you may be down.

I've always thought they should be separate and shouldn't be cross contaminated with issues from another.

Thoughts?Hey fam. I was wondering if any of you folks that operate as "solo-poly" (no nesting partner) have rules/boundaries/expectations around partners sharing their schedules with other partners?

I'm not a huge fan of rules in general, and there's obviously nothing wrong with a simple "I'm headed out on a date with xx tonight." But do any of you feel like this is common courtesy or expectation? If so, does it always have to happen in advance? What if someone stops by on short notice?So I found someone, (yay!) and things were going great, but I knew from the start that they would be taking a months long trip at the beginning of the year, and I encouraged them on their decision to do so as I knew it would help them discover more about themselves since right before I came into the picture their life had been upended and they were feeling a little lost. My NP has been great and very supportive throughout, caring about my mental, emotional, and physical health and even meta's mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. The problem I'm encountering is the NRE hit me like a MF truck! And now that they are on their trip (we decided not to attempt a long distance relationship, but to pick up where we left off when they get back) I'm left in this weird depressed state of being where I just feel so unmotivatedto do anything creative. Like logically I know everything is going to be fine (we even decided to keep journals that we'll swap when they get back and we talk 1x a week just to check in) and we want to keep seeing each other when they come back, it's not like we broke up after all. We just put things on hold. And again, NP has been very supportive, but I feel like it's also my job to pull myself out of this too. So why am I so down??? Has anyone else had a similar situation? If so, how did you handle it?I'm specifically using Feeld but I guess this could be relevant to anyone starting out in general. I'm single and still figuring out if I'm poly or just horny.

I got this app because it's kink- and poly-focused, so it seemed safer than Tinder, etc. But I'm confused at how pushy people are being. It's like if I don't respond within an hour, they double text me. Or they'll say "talk to you tomorrow" at the end of a night. And within just an hour of messaging, people are already asking to plan a date. It just seems insanely fast.

Is it the Feeld app specifically that's rushed, or is this normal in poly culture to move along a meeting quickly? Especially with people who are partnered, I don't understand why they're in such a rush for sex! Usually that would be a red flag for me but I'm wondering if there's a cultural difference since we're being more upfront and skipping the coy stuff.

I'd love to hear from some of y'all how you go about finding new casual partners online and why people may be pushing for in-person meetings instead of more time chatting virtually first.I was poly, but after several horrific experiences, I’m now with only one person. I am still poly in my mind and feel I have the ability and desire to be with more than one person, but I seriously doubt that I’ll ever trust enough to be with more than one person again. I believe in poly, I even told my family I’m poly, and my partner told her family we are poly, but I don’t think I could ever trust enough to have another partner. The gaslighting, manipulation, lies, disrespect, and yes…cheating, that went on in the past exposed so much, mostly about myself.

I personally feel poly demands I am the absolute best version of myself there is to be. I am not that yet. I have no problem setting boundaries, but I have massive difficulty enforcing boundaries. I’m working on me. Sometimes the anger of things that were done rises up, but I use it as fuel to work on myself. And I’ve really made so much progress. I talked to an old partner the other day and she said she could hear the change. It’s big. I’m in refuge recovery. I’m doing DBT. I have mindfulness practices I do every day. I had to remove every person from my life, but, tbh, most of them were highly toxic people. I will always have room in my heart for them, but not in my life. 

I wonder if there are other people out there who are poly but want only one partner? I am not saying I’ll be like this forever, but for now, I need this. I trusted too easily and with some really horrible human beings. I think, perhaps one day, I’ll be recovered enough from all my shit to be able to share love with someone else, but it’s way in the future. Plus my partner now is enough. I don’t even have a sexual relationship with my current partner, just love. I love her deeply, respect her and trust her completely. She’s proven worthy of my trust over and over again. With her, I have a relationship that’s great for a former addict and a person who has boundaries issues. Because she helps me learn to enforce boundaries, and she gives me tons of alone time, which I need for recovery. But I enjoy the freedom to talk to people and even flirt, which I currently DON’T do. But I could, and I like that. I love poly because there isn’t the ownership and jealousy, but there should be trust and respect. It’ll be years, maybe a lifetime, before I believe I can have that with anyone else. Yep, I’m damaged goods, but I know I’m good. I just wonder… anyway, nuff said. Interested to read thoughts from others.I could use some advice. My partner and I opened our relationship recently and I am struggling. We've been together for almost 9 years now and about 5 months ago, we decided to open up our relationship. She fell in love with another person (a while back) and wanted to explore those feelings but also didn't want to leave me. Hence, we landed at the conclusion that opening our relationship was the best option. I want my partner to be happy and live honestly. I don't want to feel like we are hiding parts of ourselves away from each other or denying ourselves who we truly feel we are.

I really thought opening could work for me (and I still hope it can). My (perhaps ignorant) hope was that this could ultimately strengthen our relationship. I really liked our relationship before we opened and we were happy together. I hoped to build on this and get stronger together by being our honest selves. Instead, I feel like our former relationship is completely altered and will never be remotely the same again. I am struggling to find new ways to make it feel good and not just get mired in shitty feelings all the time. 

Speaking of those feelings, ever since opening, I've really struggled with feeling jealous and very insecure about myself and our relationship. I never struggled with these feelings before, certainly not in our relationship, and never in a significant way in my life. I often find myself spiraling and starting to get into negative thought patterns that only worsen the situation (yes I've spoken to a therapist about this, I'm working on it). I have really struggled to get out of it and find constructive ways to rebuild our relationship together.

Am I just not cut out for polyamory? My partner and meta have their fair share of struggles, but I am waaaay more often on the struggle bus than either of them. I'm sure I'm not the first person to feel jealous, but it's really becoming destructive to my life and relationship. I really love my partner and don't want to leave the relationship, but am starting to wonder if I am just not able to make this work. What do I do?

Sorry, this got a bit longer than I expected, but if you made it through and have some words of wisdom, I'd appreciate them!Breakup? Reevaluation? Deescalation? Renegotiation? The connection/relationship wasn’t the same to them as it was to you? They made a choice that hurts like an elephant is stepping on your rib cage? Bummer. That sucks. 

What do you do to grieve or process your grief? Just crowdsourcing and seeing how people feel and act through it. Bonus points for any lovely rituals or practices.Preface: my nesting partner and I have been together 9 years and have been nesting partners for 2. 

I think like a lot of polyam people, I tend to not be overt about being poly at work for a variety of reasons. I don't hide it, but ik often not vocal about it. I also try to use gender ambiguous terms whenever possible as someone who is bi/polyam and wanting to normalize more un-gendered discussion. 

I recently started in a new role in an entirely separate organization within my company where I don't know a single person. I was having a chat with my new boss about a meeting we were stepping into (she wanted to prep me politely that two of the people don't get along and wanted to make sure I was prepared if they sniped at each other) and she paused. 

"I hope this isn't too personal....well I don't think it is. I hear you calling them your partner and saying he/*name of partner*, and I just want to make sure you're not offended in any way when I use the term husband and wanted to check in on what you prefer." She made it clear that she didn't have any assumptions and wanted to make sure I knew that whatever the reason she didn't care other than to make sure I felt comfortable and that "all love is welcome and good." I let her know that since we're both bi and polyam that it's the term we prefer to use as it's the one meaningful to us, but how much I appreciated her asking. 

Y'all. It is the first, literal first time in my life anyone has ever clarified with me why I use "partner." Most people either knew one/both of us before or just blindly said "okay whatever you want."

It just has all this nuance to it. There was at some level an understanding that 
1. We're some variety of queer couple
2. There's an implied hierarchy with straight/monogamous relationships 
3. She truly wanted to make sure that she understood so she could use the right words and didn't want to make assumptions. 

I've never had such deliberate allyship in the workplace with someone that wasn't a friend or someone I wasn't close with outside the workplace. I'm so truly happy to be with a very kind boss and open minded team.Hi, I hope this is be appropriate for this sub.

My partner is polyam and interested in other people and I'm not. Up until recently, there was nobody other than me they liked, however they have started bringing up a crush they have on one of their friends. I want to be 100% okay with all of this, and I'm trying to keep my cool when they talk about it, but I think there's a part of me that's worried they'll start liking someone else more than me and want to leave me (Note: this is a me thing, I know that they'd never actually break up over this). I've not mentioned it to them because it's new and I don't wanna come across incorrectly and discourage them from their crush or from talking to me about this stuff.

So, what made you feel more comfortable and secure with your partner dating other people? What helps you avoid jealousy/what helps you identify where your jealousy is stemming from so you can do something? And how should I approach it if/when I talk to them about it?

Thanks in advance.I’m in a happy little polycule with two NP’s, one of them is a primary romantic partner while the other is more platonic as they are aro/ace with a little romance, but everyone knows it’s still a life partnership.

but i am still very interested in finding another romantic partner. 

the thing is: i feel insanely guilty, and like i’m emotionally cheating on my primary romantic partner. we have had long talks about it and he says he is 100% fine with me finding and looking for another partner, but i still feel this twinge of shame and anxiety over looking, and the idea of finding someone is both exciting yet terrifying.

i guess i’m asking if anyone has ever get this as well? is it normal? do you have anything you recommend to help deal with these emotions? thank you in advance!> My preference is to date other solo poly people, but I’m open to almost anything under the right circumstances (with the exception of married men. Hard no for me)

Damn you other married men! Stop giving us a bad name :PMy primary and I have one  child and his partner has one child. We aren't yet public about being poly. How did you approach the conversation with your (or your partners) child(ren)?Just wondering why I’m having a problem with emotional feelings being shared. My partner and I have been mono for 6 years. I don’t mind my partner sexually seeing other people by why do I have a problem with my partner being very emotionally attached to another person ? It makes me slightly sad to think someone else can receive the same type of love and emotion my partner gives me. Why do I feel strange about my partner wanting to sleep over their house a few nights a week , or be fluid bonded , travel , and other real serious relationship stuff like that ? My partner is demisexual so I know it will be very sentimental. Being in a mono relationship for so long and my partner always telling me I’m the only one they want  I just thought feelings like those wouldn’t be shared with others. I’m not depressed or anything I’m just very curious as to why I think this way.Hello Poly Reddit,.

I have hung in the shadows tried to post... Didn't feel ready to speak... Now need help.. guidance ... Kind words I guess IDK .. knowledge... 

So I think I read a term on here once for this ... but basically long story short I'm a 33 M 12 year marriage monogamous 30 f. We just recently turned  mono-poly wife wants to adventure out.  We need emotional support that neither of us gives to each other in the regular... so we formed a V another male and my wife and eventually poly on both sides... I need to fix her trust in me that is a different storytime but for most of the 12 years on several incidents I wasn't a truthful partner and broke that on several topics I am an addict to shine some light but.... My question/concern not to deep dive

 she is spending a ton of time with new FWB/BF whatever label... Other side of the V

Is there a term for a V not bring a V but more just one sided? I get it it's all new... Exciting... Fun... She wants to be her... Get to know him learn etc ... I am ok with that  .. I get she does not always want to be  a stay at home mother or my wife (her first marriage we as abusive and  she had a child at 15 never got to be a kid or an adult solo things are good now between all parties fyi) I come along in her life at 17 yrs old, we have a son together 11 yrs and a 2 yr old foster son for this last year. My Mother in law moved in with her two daughters (wife's 13 and 17 yr old sisters) when step dad passed away ... Whole 'nother story

Enough background the poly stuff

First night she is sleeping over there not communicating well for 12+ hours didn't give me his number or address but wife and I have been GPS google map linked for years so again not a big deal just poor communication constantly...  We have ADHD and are daily heavy medicinal weed smokers ... understandable lol... Skip to next day she does come home for a few hours and we all chill hang out smoke weed and her and I discuss their relationship boundaries and too communication better etc... They have sex at our house and she wants to go back to his after dinner and spends night ...  The next day she doesn't wake up till 2 pm...no big deal wife is a night owl ...  But meanwhile I feel a bit abandoned or unloved and like I am getting zero US time while holding the fort down at home cleaning watching my kids etc on my days off... Also everyone is at home virtual learning because we have COVID 19... Just getting over it now...  I text her mention I miss her want US time but she responds she was home yesterday...  But that isn't the same ... 

Then tells me she is going to go clubbing with an old friend of ours (who canceled a week ago and they don't speak for years ever unless the other girl wants money but you gonna go clubbing) I work Sat - Monday 3 am to whatever I gotta sleep early ... Sometimes I overtime Thursday and Friday... And she wants him to spend the weekend and live here basically sleep in our bed when I go to work... We also discussed living our lives and me working like 6 days a week more OT so we can have blow money... For reference We used to make 130k a year the drop to 45k because of COVID had to switch jobs sucked.... But better for my mental health...  And no more travel I was gone 3/4 of the year working out of town... Which again... I KNOW I am cool with this new poly lifestyle... it is gonna bring me hot wife scenarios in the bedroom in the future (discussed already) and I feel true compersion at the idea of her being ultimately more happy and being kissed and fucked by another man... he is sweet I am an asshole .. I am working on me a lot ...I haven't been the best for 12 years of our marriage but neither has her Bipolar crazy ass .. but fuck it's a lot to take in this isn't about divorce people we good in our marriage forever.   and I feel like I may be missing some red flags...but I am a very emotional person bug cry baby where she is basically emotionless lots of trauma caused  her to be different....


I'm a cancer she is a Gemini...

Phew that felt good!

So hello poly world!.

I have rewrote this with so many different times with different details but I am just lost trying to deal with this and mental health issues... And life gets hard I hope people here are willing to help.. a lot of these feeling come from anxiety depression and don't represent the truth of my heart...

Thanks for reading

TLDR: my Wife and I of 12 years became Mono-poly formed a V she got a BF and is spending tons of time with him and I feel in these early days left behind and not properly reassured and I know a lot of these feelings are unjustified and stem from depression and anxiety that has gotten worse in my life and I am booked for a psychiatrist and a therapist. 

But I had to come share my story my truths for someone out there to scared to speak up and learn to grow like I want too! I don’t know where to even stand on this. I’ve always wanted to explore being poly. And my significant other is poly. We just never talked about it. I love her to death and never want to lose her. But I want to explore I guess. It’s wrapped in my head and it hurts because I don’t know how to start the conversation. Or even how to approach itIs it too personal to ask what kind of “situations” you guys are in like do you have multiple girl/boyfriends or do you have a permanent partner that you go and bring another partner that comes and goes… also your sexuality (you don’t have to go that deep I’m curious to all the situations) 
The reason it came to mind is I’m bisexual but my partners other girl doesn’t seem interested in me but will talk about girls she’s had I know not everyone will be attracted to you and I understand that it’s just I like herMy(M22) husband(23) has just told me he wants a girlfriend, I’m not exactly opposed it though. My main question is how can he find a girl that is okay with entering into a relationship with two men? I’d like to be as supportive of him as possible in this.Hello, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask?? But, I am reaching out as the title says. I'm looking for information only. Not wanting to get involved or hook up. Just would like some insight an opportunity to learn more.
Understanding no one will more than likely reply, but I'd like to ask anyway. 

I understand how an upside down pineapple is about swingers and the lifestyle. What I'd like to educate myself more about? What an apple and a grapefruit is connected too?

If you could please point me in the right direction, or even share a website or two? I would grateful appreciate it.

Thank you in advance.Is it unreasonable to ask my nesting partner to avoid letting his other partner leave marks on him tonight if they have sex? I'm feeling particularly insecure right now, and while I'm not going to ask them not to have sex, I'm not in a good head space to be confronted with the marks she's inevitably going to leave on him.

I was hoping to get advice on how to navigate my newish relationship and the feelings that are coming up that I’m struggling with. 

I’m (31 f) monogamous in my orientation as far as I’ve been able to come to identify so far. My new girlfriend (of about three months) is non monogamous. I’m her primary partner but she has another casual relationship out of state. Which has been mostly ok for me. I’ve met her other girlfriend and she’s lovely, she also has a primary partner herself too. I’ve been mostly ok with managing my jealously and feelings about their relationship. My girlfriend has also expressed to me that she sometimes doubts she’s really poly but she’s mostly been a secondary partner to others with primary partners and then had casual hookups/dates outside of that. And she’s been really happy to finally have a primary committed partner with me. 

My girlfriend has been out of town for the last two week and texted me yesterday that she slept with another woman the night before. And I felt absolutely devastated and sick. 

For more context that’s important with my feelings about non monogamy in the last year I had two really horrible traumatic experiences with dating women who were not at all ethical with their poly/ non monogamy. I was in a serious year long relationship with a woman who claimed that she and her wife (who she used to practice ENM with) were separated and that she wasn’t practicing non monogamy of any kind any longer. I found out after she dumped me that not only were she and her wife still together but she was also cheating on me with multiple much younger girls. 

After that I briefly dated a poly woman who had another girlfriend. She coerced me into going on dates and sleeping with other women even though I didn’t feel comfortable with it and her other girlfriend kept trying to make us a triad. It was all incredibly uncomfortable and upsetting. 

Also the morning my current girlfriend let me know she’d slept with someone else happened to happen right after I had an online brush with one of the girls my ex was cheating on me with and I was already feeling upset and vulnerable. 

I hate feeling like this and I know my girlfriend didn’t do anything wrong but it hurts so badly. 

I really don’t know how to manage how it feels to have this emotion.

I known it’s usually frowned upon but at least for now would it be ok for me to ask my girlfriend not to tell me when she sleeps with someone else?Hello. This is my first time posting, and I am coming here because I am trying to understand my wife a little more. Our backstory:

About a year ago, after a decade of marriage, my wife confessed to me that she was developing feelings for another man. She revealed that she was polyamorous, and always had been. She was worried about telling me because she didn’t want to hurt my feelings. I was shocked to find out. I went through the standard feelings. Not feeling good enough. Not being enough of a “man”. Anger that she would hold that big of a secret from me. All of it. We have open discussions about my feelings and her feelings. About where our relationship is.

When I agreed to let her explore her feelings, I will admit I did it out of fear for our marriage. I didn’t want it to end. I love her. I have raised a family with her. I don’t see a future without her in it.

Anyway, she started a relationship with this new man. It isn’t sexual, but more for companionship. I will admit I was relieved to find out she wasn’t interested in sexual things with him.

I’m rambling. Kind of nervous I guess. Anyway, I still struggle with all of those feelings of inadequacy. She has told me, repeatedly, that I am the love of her life. That I am enough. That I am all she wants or needs. That I am the only person she could see being with fully, or as a primary I think she said. She said she couldn’t make that work with him. 

Which brings me to my point: Why? If I am enough, as she says, why want more? This has caused me pain. It has caused me to doubt myself. So why put me through that, knowing it was going to hurt me? I don’t know what I’m trying to say even. I guess that’s why I’m here. I’m trying to understand her. She is all I want, and I’m willing to try and do anything to make her happy. But she risked her marriage for this. So I ask why?A couple weeks ago, my boyfriend suggested an open relationship - just once, barely offhand. The more I thought about it, the more I really wanted it. 

I started talking more seriously with him - figuring out what that meant to each of us, establishing some ground rules... I think we still have a lot to learn about this and each other (neither of us have tried this before) but we're both open books who are willing to read!

And when he mentioned the other guy he was talking to... I had such a powerful feeling of compersion, I was giddy!

I'm really excited to be a part of this community, and my boyfriend is too. I look forward to having so many wonderful people to support us on our journey!So for most of my (22M) dating life I’ve been pretty monogamous. I’ve had a couple relationships with women and a few more with men, and the women turned out trans so I guess I’m pretty gay for a cast-iron pan. All I really needed was one person I could be intimate with, both physically and verbally. It’s great for me, easy to balance with my life.

Since August of 2020, I’ve been training with a team in Buhurt, a full contact pain sport of medieval knights, with historically accurate armor and weapons, all made with the toughest steel and titanium (depending on how rich you are). Please give it watch, like it’s everything to me. Despite being a fighting sport, it’s filled with nothing but love and hugs amongst everyone. My team is family to me, and my opponents are all friends. Best thing to ever happen to me.

But I digress, thing is, a lot of my friends within the community are poly, including a teammate. And they post about it too, which has me questioning myself. Sure I love my friends platonically, but like why do I think about just cuddling with some of them sometimes? Maybe even more than that? Am I selfish for feeling this way? Do I want this for the relationships or is it really just for sex? I got so many questions but I’m afraid of sounding stupid and have kinda bottled it all up. I’m afraid of what could happen yet it’s all so enticing.

Anyways I just needed to vent a lil about it and maybe ask y’all what it’s like? How do y’all find each other and make it all work?Hi everyone! If you’ve read any of my previous posts that will get you up to speed, but in summation i’ve ended a really hard poly relationship and am just not sure if I’m going through that stage of a break up where you just miss the person like crazy, or that I’ve made a bad decision in leaving.

I would love someone to reach out to chat with me, I don’t get to see my therapist again for over a month but would really like support!I would write a recap but it's quite a lot and lowkey tired typing but I need a place I can vent and be heard. Soooo if you haven't already been following this you can look at my previous 2 posts to get the rest of the details..

My fiance and I are finally at a place I feel like we can grow and heal over this that has transpired. The last few days have felt like weeks... but I think we understand each other now, why both of us were hurt, why it hurt, and discussed ways to prevent something like this happening again. We both still like polyamory, it's something she has stayed consistent on why she believes it is a good thing. For me, this was a terrible experience. Lots of grief. I do feel like I learned a lot though. Obviously, things are still a bit awkward and I suppose now with all the understandings we have, time will help with the rest. But at least we got somewhere and we are firmly not giving up. Pain isn't a bad by itself, and it can be used as growth, and we are committed to that growth. Im not going to lie, as incredibly interested in poly as I am, it officially kinda scares me lol... 

That said, thank you to everyone who has commented nd shared their experiences and wisdom to help a stranger get through a tough time. This really is a great community here.I love group sex occasionally - it's super fun, kinky, exciting, whatever. I love being polyam. I have low jealousy about my main partner having sex with other women when it's not in front of me, and almost zero jealousy about his other girlfriend in general.

What makes me feel sort of out of the usual, at least among my group of polyamorous and swinger friends, is that I have little to no desire to have group sex with my fiance, who I live with. I don't get joy out of it, I just get really really jealous. 

I definitely don't enjoy watching him have sex with someone else. I usually just want to be having sex with the woman or him myself. I've tried starting to a couple times at parties cuz its a fantasy of his to have a threesome or swap with me, and I just get so distracted and anxious that I can't do it.

I've had plenty of group sex and enjoyed it with other people, but when my fiance is right in front of me with some hot woman, I just want it to stop.

He's been really understanding and fine with leaving it off the table, but it bothers me that I can't enjoy it. It would open up a lot of experiences for us. 

Is there any way to work through this? Or should I just let it go as a thing I'm not into? I don't really know how to work through it either than by sort of torturing myself and just going through with it.[She has some great videos on dating and polyamory ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6orzhPfnuvnE9PwzoCLkByCeFTiyVwup) that touche on race, gender, BDSM, the L.A. club scene and more. Any particular videos of hers that stand out to anyone? For me it's her interracial relationships during quarantine.How do I determine if what I want is actually polyamory-- or Id just been unhappy in my previous relationships? Im gonna trrryyyy to keep this short. 

I (30m) used to be married to a woman. We idealized that unicorn triad with another bi guy since the inception of our relationship. Big surprise, that plan failed spectacularly. A handful of years later, I had done enough research and soul searching to dive into true polyamory. Got myself a boyfriend that I loved. But lo and behold, my marriage fell apart....and I came out as just oh so gay. 

Now Ive been with a new partner for about 2 years. I was single when we met. 100% upfront about polyamory. He told me he wasnt sure if he himself was poly but definitely had no problem being with someone poly & has lots of poly friends. In the beginning of this relationship I was still online dating. I was completely transparent about it, we'd joke about how awful most men are on apps- not reading, just sending dick pics, ect. 

I eventually met a nice guy I liked, and we dated for about 6 months. This was very hard for my OG partner. He was wracked with insecurity. But through it all, he supported me in my other relationship. That newer relationship ultimately came to an end because I noticed the other guy had probably caught deeper feels than me- I was right, he was hurt, we ended it. 

Since then I decided I dont feel like looking for anyone new. I stand by the hypothetical "If I meet someone IRL and want to go for it- I will/can." But now Ive been re-reflecting on what polyamory really is- instances like, holidays with one partner but not others, vacations, even just date nights. And Im feeling more and more like Id just rather be mono with my man of 2 years. But I also worry its just like, covid encouraged codependancy? 

How do I actually parse it out with out getting involved with someone new and potentially hurting them if I find Im mono- or at least deeply hierarchical? 

And maybe thats the thing? Maybe I just actually want prescriptive hierarchical polyam?? I guess as long as folks are aware and consent we're good? Like, someone else who also has their "primary"? Idfk...I’m currently going through my retroactive jealousy phase due to my partner’s sexual past. I’m talking it out with him and just letting my frustrations out but in a calm, collective civilized manner. Old me would have lashed out and berated the person. But new me is different.
I don’t have that extreme reaction anymore 

So, how do you guys deal with it? Do you ignore it? Find ways to not let it creep up back into your mind? Or do you just talk it out with your partner and therapist? 


Btw, I’m allowed to feel jealousy so please don’t tell me what I’m feeling is wrong because that’s fucked up. I just want tips (harsh or sincere) that’ll help me overcome this pointless, draining jealousy

Hello everyone! My name is Rachael and I have been a part of the poly community for a little over a year now. I have learned so much from you all and am so happy to be a part of this community and to have had the support to embark on such a fulfilling journey of self-discovery. As such, I am hoping to find opportunities to give back to this community through my positions and resources afforded to me in my professional life. So, I am working on a research project for my doctoral program at West Virginia University to investigate some relational communication behaviors in our population which has been understudied and underrepresented for so long in my academic discipline.

My anonymous research study examines communication among committed partners about extradyadic sexual encounters (i.e., sex with someone other than a primary partner, life partner, nesting partner, boyfriend, girlfriend, or etc.). In order to participate, you must currently be in a self-defined committed consensually non-monogamous relationship with at least one partner (e.g., primary partner, nesting partner, life partner) and have disclosed information about an extradyadic sexual encounter in the past six months. You must also be 18 years or older to participate in this study. By participating, you will have an opportunity to enter a raffle to win one of two $50 Amazon gift cards.

West Virginia University's Institutional Review Board acknowledgment of this project is on file (Protocol #2110448607).Hi all, sharing a challenging time for me.
My np and I have had challenging times over the past week talking about lack of communication (from her) and emotional cheating (from her). It was resolved, and THEN a couple caused it to start again but being her earwig.

This happened 2 days in a row and they have interfered with our relationship to the point where I am now the bad guy, because I wanted to be more communicative with her and talk about our issues.. rather than only talking about them to someone else.

She has demanded I leave the marital house by the end of today (although did change this to give me 24 hours afterwards). I refused to accept her massive terms of the divorce, as it was totally out of the blue.. and is totally unfair.

I had said to her that I will agree to all her terms, IF she is willing to have couples therapy. If she then still feels the same way, I will sign off.. with my blessing (ish).

This was countered with... well... I still want you to leave today and your now getting nothing. Blackmail and coercion. She then sent a screenshot of the definition of abuse (after I showed her that she can't just kick me out)... just the definition..

This seems to be a way of threatening me with legal action with the police... note.. this is my wife who she wanted to have kids with me.. last time we talked about this was 4 months ago. I know I'm not the best husband and I have a lot to learn... but I need to be told sometimes!

This is truly heartbreaking for me and I love her to bits.. and don't know why she is doing any of this.

I'm trying to understand her.. but can't.
I had set up couples therapy, because that's what she had asked for... before she sent the message ending it.

I'm not even worth a call.
A long Gmail message is all I'm worth... 

I have contemplated taking my life... but its my other partners that are keeping me level here. And yes.. thats Co dependency I know...

When she wants me out.. with no money, not place to go, nothing... its gauling and feels so sudden that something else has happened. (Literally, we were fine on Wednesday... then her friend got involved... and it all went to shit...Since starting my poly journey I have had a lot of insecurity in my relationships that have since been happily resolved. If I go back and update earlier posts will the people who were kind enough to respond be notified of the update? Will an updated post resurface in people’s feeds?I have been in a ldr with a Girl for 2 yrs I am learning Poly because she doesn't want to be exclusive and I know in my heart that never goes well for me either. We have both been single for that time and spent a great deal falling in love. She always said she would eventually meet someone naturally and I envisioned the same for me. It was scary but I am brave. Recently she discovered OLD and has been on what I can only describe as a sex binge meeting and sleeping with whatever is convienient. It's too much too quick for me. The philosophy of Poly says to let her loose 100% but it's hurting too hot and I want to run away but I can't live without her. Is it fair to ask her to slow down or will it be a better outcome if I just give in and sick it up? I'm m and I can't just invite girls into my life so easily like she can men

*approach after this threads support*
First of all thank you everyone I feel much better. it's clear I have a slut complex I need to work on. Second I realise our behaviours are different and equally valid. I'm NOT going to ask her to change her behaviour in regards to slowing down, but I will explain that my ignorance has left me surprised with the sudden changes, it makes me uncomfortable but I'm working on it. I WILL ask her if she would like help me work on my discomfort in a way that doesn't harm her in the process. With the aim to heal quicker than if she just told me sorry its your brain your responsibility.  And my idea of a natural polymory behaviour was suited for me but not for her so I'm dropping that. I want to see how far I can grow before I cut and run.In your strategy to find suitable mates, do you generally pursue few who check all of the boxes, or many who check some of the boxes?

It seems I fall in the highly controversial "few who check some of the boxes" category. Anyway, what are your thoughts?Recap: I wanted to start seeing someone else but there were parameters and misunderstandings and miscommunication in which I made a mistake within and now my nesting partner is very hurt by my actions. For more details you'll have to go see my last post because there are a lot of details. 

So following the fallout we talked it over a bit after finally getting some much needed rest. She is still very hurt. She said that she feels borderline cheated on even though nothing actually happened between me and the new girl but because of my intent. It doesn't seem to matter that I misunderstood some things and took them as greenlights to go for the other girl. I can admit, I probably just wanted them to be there and probably were not actually there to begin with. So none the less my "lust" for someone else was so strong that I couldn't just wait.. at least that's how she feels. 

I tried to explain why had asked this new girl for a kiss to begin with was because I had asked several times if it was okay for me to pursue her and if she was comfortable with it and she kept saying yes. A couple months before we had discussed waiting until we got married which isn't far anyway. Regardless, for whatever reason I thought that was a greenlight. The lesson I have learned here is to make sure to ask for clarity in a much more direct way somehow. It's like the more I think about this part of it the more my head hurts. She can't let it go either. She is just hurt by this and because I did this her self-esteem is like crushed and she doesn't even trust me enough to wait if we agreed to. She told me that in order to protect herself she just doesn't even care anymore and we can just start now. She said this is how it is for her because she has already felt all the emotions and pain she wanted to avoid to begin with and that it isn't what I did, it was when I did it that hurt. 

I also, tried to explain I wasn't just lusting for the new girl sexually. For the most part I just enjoyed talking to her and cuddling. I would be happy if that's all I ever did with her. My fiance isn't good at texting or anything like that so she really only likes to talk in person anymore and she also doesn't like to be touched much. So, yeah. I mean I just enjoyed that with new girl. I tried to explain this because idk.. somehow her telling me I just acted purely out of lust and that's why I couldn't wait just made me feel dirty and disgusting. 

During this conversation she brought up all the other things I have done since we were in highschool and dated and now I just feel like an even worse person because it's like no matter the excuse, no matter the why, no matter if it was an accident... if I did something to hurt her it seems to always be present. So, idk what to do at this point. I know words hurt and actions can to... and says she always forgives me but man, does it hurt to always be reminded of everything that you've done to someone when you upset them. 

Idk how to approach the topic with her anymore. I love this woman so much... I just want her to be happy at the end of the day. I also like the premise of poly. In that moment cuddled with the new girl I felt fine, I didn't feel guilty or shameful because I thought I was in the right and believed that so Idk. It felt right. And it felt right after asking her to kiss her when I walked back to my bedroom to lie down with my fiance. I know im capable of this. That moment before chaos broke out made it really Click. But for this to be my first poly experience it really just does not feel good at all. Especially when your nesting partner has apparently been in multiple polyamorous relationships in the past. So I'm at a loss. I just sort of hurt right now too. Which apparently me hurting even though im the one that hurt her makes her feels crazy because she thinks that means she did something wrong when she believes she was the innocent one. I tried to tell her sometimes nobody is even wrong. Sometimes it's just miscommunication... but she literally told me it's just easier to blame herself because it's easier to get back to normalcy if it's her fault... 

I hate to break things off with new girl completely as well (which my fiance made it clear I didn't have to because what's been done is done but I lowkey feel like im being tested) because I just enjoyed the time I've had to talk and cuddle and I don't wanna be the jerk who hurts both of these beautiful women. This has been so challenging and i am just exhausted guys. Idk what to do or how  to feel.I am no longer in a polyamorous relationship with this person, but I have been in one for several years and have experienced quite a bit. I’m sure there are other users who have dealt with this before and I’m curious.So my fiancé and I love each other and I 100% see myself spending the rest of my life with this man. He can be a bit jealous but is incredibly understanding and respects that I am a bisexual woman that had never really been with a woman due to my family, so after moving out he has agreed I can experiment as long as he’s aware. We also often roleplay with talk of opening our relationship and he likes this a lot. He still seems not fully on board with actually doing so in practice, so this post may be all for naught. But I want to know how you knew it was right for your relationship because I do not want to ruin mine, I just really like the idea of having more people to love.I am not quite sure how to ask this better, but basically how do you know you're polyamorous or that polyamory is for you? 
On the flipside, how do you know you're not and it isn't?

There is a lot of info that seems quite contradictory and I get confused.

Like for example, some people consider it an orientation (similar to sexual orientations) but by that definition only your ability to love and be attracted to multiple people matters and it seems to me that that's not quite the case...

I've heard some say that you're not poly of you ever feel possesive or jealous but on the other hand they themselves as well as a lot of others experienced those emotions.

So what would you say are some of the telltale signs that you are/are not poly?

I would love to hear your thoughts on this :3Not sure if this is the right place for this but I can’t find anywhere else to ask. My husband of 24 yrs and I entered into a polyamory relationship last year and all was going well. My husband and I had a major argument (nothing to do with our partner) and now he has decided that our relationship is over and he is now living in a very happy relationship with her alone. How do I cope with the heartbreak of loosing my marriage but also the heartbreak of loosing her as she was a close friend before we entered into our relationship.Hello! I'm a historically mono person who is just trying to understand polyamory better. I love reading everything everyone has to say here so thanks for letting me learn from you. Based on some of what I have read, I sometimes get the impression that many people seem to see  polyamory as a category of relationships.  I have also heard people talk about coming out as poly like it's more of an orientation. 

So I am curious, how many of your see polyamorous as part of your identity where mono relationships are for the most part, not an option? How many of you chose to be in polyamorous relationships because it was the right choice for you when you made the decision?I (28F) have been with my NP (29M) for 5 years and overall we have a great relationship, he’s an amazing men, he’s hard working and responsable, we’ve been poly for almost a year, I haven’t dated much mainly because I’ve been really depressed for a while also a year ago I found out I’m autistic (this is relevant to the story) two months ago I started dating a guy (well call him Dan), he’s been really nice and we are getting along great, here’s where I messed up, my NP told me he had been feeling insecure and he didn’t feel comfortable with me sleeping at Dan’s yet, I was okay with it and next weekend I went to a party at his house, time flew by and I was having fun chatting with his friends and drinking, The party ended at 5:00 am and I went home, my NP was super mad at me, and this is we’re my autism makes it hard, I thought I wasn’t doing anything wrong because I wasn’t actually “sleeping” I was partying, but I guess it was the same thing for my NP, we got into an argument and he ended up saying he was considering breaking up with me because he was feeling neglected, I tried to explain why I didn’t understand the not sleeping boundary but he doesn’t really get that I need really specific directions, I don’t really get it either, I’m still learning to navigate my autism, anyway we came to an agreement that I was going to take things slower with Dan, today Dan invited me to hang out with his friends and I asked my NP if he was okay with it, he got really mad at me and said I wasn’t doing what I said and basically we understood different this by “taking it slow” Now don’t understand what it means, I’m confused and my NP wants to break up with me again, I know he’s tired of taking care of me and my mental health but I can’t really afford therapy and I understand I can be a burden and he’s given up a lot to help me, this hurts and I don’t know if we can fix it. 
(English isn’t my fist language, I’m sorry if my post isn’t clear enough)My NP has been dating his gf off and then back on again. We are brand new to poly and had a few hiccups that lots of communication and taking it slow has helped tremendously. As did doing the exercises for jealousy in several books.

So now that my NP is dating his gf again, I find myself super excited and happy, yet chill and relaxed. Prior I was anxious, upset, jealous and misunderstanding what I was feeling. 

My Meta has been hanging out with us when they aren't out on dates and it's just been so much fun, both at her place and ours.

She braids my hair, watching shows together and shares her knowledge of cosplay and makeup and I am loving every minute of it. I find her to be wonderful company.

She has also been recovering from covid so we would also come over to her place and help out. We didn't want her taking her trash out cause she is on the upper floor and she had been fainting from the covid-induced asthma. Stuff like that. I did dishes, she did my hair. Perfect trade\~!

Anyone else have nice compersion stories to share?I need to get this off my chest and I only know a couple of poly people in my life, none of which I can meet in person to talk to because they live in other cities.  I (35M) am dating a mono guy (29M), whom I'll call X, but our rocky history is making me doubt if it can be a healthy relationship.

I'm a fairly introvert guy, with few friends and weak family connections. I live in a somewhat conservative city and finding actual poly people here has been practically impossible.

Last year I broke up with my NP after eight years of relationship and X was involved. I had an open relationship with my NP, but we were uneducated about polyamory and never discussed how we would handle if someone fell in love with someone else, or about NRE for that matter; but we were not opposed to the idea of getting serious with someone else. Our only boundary (actually a rule), was to not have unprotected sex.

I had met X through Grindr a year before, pre-pandemic, but we didn't click and nothing happened (I was clear about me being in an open relationship). He is kind of my opposite in many ways, he has a large family, more friends, likes to party and is not as risk averse as me. About half a year later, now in lockdown, I texted him again just for sex since he lives in the same neighborhood. Sex was really, really good, so we started seeing each other more frequently at home since he still lives with his parents. I started developing feelings for him, and it was reciprocated.

My NP was getting progressively depressed because of other issues, including our almost non-existant sex life, so I downplayed my feelings for X. X, though, started showing too much affection through a lot of attention to me and constant presents (lovebombing?). He told me he had never been with someone like me, not even past partners. He said he didn't have any interest in anyone else except me, so he would like to pursue a serious relationship with me with me as a hinge partner for him and my NP. The catch was that he said he needed time to get used to the idea of me being poly (I had recently identified as such after reading about it), and asked me not to have sex with anyone else except himand my NP. He was also opposed to me sexting with other people. Since pandemic made it hard to see other people anyways, I agreed.

X and my NP were already getting along, and even starting developing a friendship. X brought up what he wanted, but my NP misunderstood the idea thinking X wanted a closed triad. There was a drunken incident where I became jealous: I was unprepared for them showing affection because of the way X had talked about me and being clear he did not want intimacy with my NP, who was starved for affection. The three of us sat down to talk, X now made it clear he did not want intimacy with my NP, but we all agreed to try to form a triad.

The drama that ensued was awful, to the point where my NP became almost suicidal, I considered commiting self harm, and X showed signs of eating disorders and reckless behavior. I had violated my NP's trust because I was having unbarriered sex with X, which X confessed to my NP.

My NP broke up with me, and a week later I broke up with X, since the stress and my depression was too much to handle. NP moved out of the house, but we all tried to stay friends, which obviously did not work. Ex NP and X hung out to try to be friends. I still wanted to be friends with ex NP, so I tried to be transparent and honest about everything, which included me and X still having sex. X hid that from from ex NP, which provoked a fight. Exx NP still hates X to this day. I felt I had to be loyal to my ex NP, so I stopped communicating with X, except for a couple of times he came over just for sex.

About three months passed. I had gone out of town for a month and he had done the same for two months after my trip, so we were not in any contact anymore; until he showed up online on Grindr with a new account (I know because I had blocked him before). He apologized for everything that happened, and we reverted to seeing each other frequently, initially just for sex.

We both had been trying to go on dates with other people, but nothing serious happened. I started feeling an intense need to be with him again. I told him I still had feelings for him, and he said he had them too. We were already back having unbarriered sex. He told me he had gone to therapy and was not the same as a year ago. He said we was ok with me having other pre-existing partners or fwb, but he asked for some time before I considered dating "new" people. I agreed.

We have been dating since the end of last year. He is very caring and loving, but I don't feel like I can trust him 100%. He eventually reverted his decision, saying he was actually NOT ok with me having sex with anyone else for the moment. He said he needed more time, but he doesn't know how much. I suggested monthly check-ups to talk about how we're feeling, but he said that would be me pressuring him. Talks about how we could handle the future end with us being very upset and him falling to ED and wanting alcohol and weed (or other drugs) to numb his feelings.

He has also stated that the moment I go out with someone else (with a possibility of sex) he would like to do the same. What bugs me about this is that he says he is not interested in forming new bonds: friendships, or relationships. He just wants sex with other people to feel validated (his exact words). I know I should not limit his sexuality in any way, but something about the way he talks about it makes it sound like revenge or keeping scores and I don't feel comfortable with that.

Last talk we had he cooled down with the random hookups idea, but he is considering the idea of having sex with friends of his, although he still says things to me that mean that he only wants to be with me. It is very confusing to the point where I don't even know if I'm actually poly if he having sex with other people upsets me that much.

I have suggested reading literature about polyamory, but he says he's not interested in that, nor is he going to therapy again anytime soon because he's got money issues and needs his extra time for his second part-time job and freelance projects.

I do enjoy the time I spend with X. I do care for him and want to help each other be better people and enjoy ourselves and have new experiences. I love the sex we have. But the drama can be exhausting. Recently I feel very anxious about bringin up unresolved things because of how they can blow up. A long distance partner I have is coming in late February and we're going on vacations for two weeks. This was planned before X and I started dating (again), but I dread what will happen...

I just started therapy again and I have read several books on polyamory (currently reading Polysecure),  but an outside perspective would be very much appreciated. Thanks to anyone who read through all that.

Edit: Wrote a bit more about me. Spelling.So me and my wife have an open relationship as long as it's just sex. We're not allowed to fall in love though (which means y'all might not be the best audience for this, but I didn't know where else to turn).

I guess this system is tricky for me sometimes. An instance is this week I slept with a woman who is drop dead gorgeous. I'm honestly surprised she even gave me a chance, but she not only did that, she brought me home, we had amazing sex, and now she's texting an awful lot. We have a lot in common, and I guess that how vulnerable she is with me makes me want to be vulnerable with her. She know's I'm married, doesn't mind. I feel like I could definitely fall for her. What safeguards can one take against this?I’m (28F) trying to brainstorm some ways to make my partner (33f) feel loved and celebrate our connection for vday this year. 

Trying to navigate gifts that wouldn’t impose on their nesting partner and their shared space. I.E. flowers in the past have been too much. 

We’re planning to go on a wine country getaway for the weekend and trying to come up with some other ways it can feel extra special. 


We’re long distance most of the year but short distance for another month so trying to seize the opportunities at hand.Hey, 

I’m looking for some advice/views/opinions. 

We’ve been together 3.5 years. My partner and his wife haven’t told their children about our relationship yet. They’re both 18+ years old. One lives at home and other visits often. They want to tell them when the time feels right. I’m happy and supportive of them doing things that feel right to them. 

I’ve been invited to their house for the first time. I think it would be great, but I do feel as though I would be being disrespectful to their children being in their house when they don’t know about our relationship. They might don’t approve of our relationship and/or not want me in their home. 

What would you think? How would you feel if you were me? What would you do?Hello! Long time reader, first time questioner. I was just curious if anyone has experienced this and has advice on how to approach the situation. 

My primary (29M) and I (28F) have been independently dating and also open to having experiences together. We’ve recently matched with someone we know in person, who is open to navigating with couples. We used to go see her at work together with our puppies and have always had pleasant interactions. 

I ended up connecting with her on Snapchat. So she was speaking with myself for quite awhile, talked about her dating experiences… she says she gets frustrated when she connects with people and it seems to be going well but then they just drop off the face of the planet and she isn’t sure why. Told her I have that happen periodically as well and it does truly suck. 
We had talked about our puppies, my partners and my relationship and that we were interested in her and she said she was as well.  
Because of this, I told my partner to connect with her, as she provided her number, but once he did, she all of a sudden completely stopped talking with me. 

I had inquired how she was doing over Snapchat but my message has been left unopened for over a week, meanwhile she’s actively messaging my partner and even when he mentions me, she acknowledges my existence, but still leaves me on read. If I was unable to see her being active on the app I would assume she deleted it 🤷‍♀️ 

This has put a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to “us” all interacting, as I feel I’m the 3rd wheel in this situation. I’ve taken the hint and understood that I’m not necessarily wanted to be a part of this inclusive relationship, which is fine, but it feels like she’s pretending to give a shit about my existence to continue talking to him. Which I’m personally not cool with. 

At this point, I’m not sure if I should try to reach out again? And ask if she’s doing alright…again? 
Or if my partner should be inquiring with her about why she hasn’t responded to me as she’s stated interest in us both?
He has no issue just stopping communication with her as he also thinks it’s strange she hasn’t attempted to upkeep conversation with me. In a way I love that, but I don’t want to be the determinator on if he should continue a connection or not. 

I’m just feeling really off because of not knowing what the heck is going on. I’d prefer her to just be straight up and say she’s only interested in him and then he can decide if he’s still interested in solo play or if he doesn’t want to continue because she has no ability to communicate her wants/needs with me, and in turn is doing to me what her other potential partners have been doing, dropping off the planet. 

*le sigh* any advice on how to handle this is superbly appreciated. 🙏Hey beautiful people,

I have my first weekend-away trip with a new partner, and I know my other 2 partners are both going to be struggling. I want to have a few nice "love notes" at-the-ready that I can send that will be genuine but also express my love and gratitude for them and make them feel special. 

I already have a running list I'm keeping for each of them that has some unique inside jokes and whatnot, but looking for inspo from others. Share your faves please!How am I so fucking stupid that I’ve been poly for 6 years, and I STILL accidentally get into relationships with people who aren’t committed to the lifestyle? I get so impulsive on dating apps… I’m so upfront with who I am. And people who aren’t poly always pursue me. I’ve gotten tried on so many times by people who are curious. And when it inevitably ends for various stupid reasons, like “this relationship looks different from any other I’ve been in before so it confused me” or “I don’t want to unnecessarily limit my dating pool [left out, “to be with you”]”. What if I find my mono soul mate, even though I say I’m happy with you? Fuck these people. I’m so angry. At myself for not being more selective. How have I gotten my heart broken THIS many times? 

They’re “open with me about being new to poly” and being “inexperienced”. They let me know very clearly that I consented. Apparently yes it is my fault for being a huge romantic dumbass. It sucks bc I totally believe everyone is new to poly at some point and I like helping people explore the identity… I have to stop. 

Vent vent vent. Thankfully I still have an actual polyamorous partner who is amazing. I’m so grateful for him. I’m so angry at the man who is currently breaking my heart and acting like shifting to friends so he can be mono is trivial. Fuck him. I fucking travelled internationally to visit him over Christmas. So glad he finally had time to think about his fukcing identity.


Update: This was me venting like almost immediately after I got a text about how he'd been thinking and came to the conclusion taht monogamy made more sense for him. It was a 3-4 month long relationship that was very close very quickly, and felt very easy when we were together. I felt frustrated that I basically forgot poly was new for him bc no issues arose over it while we were together until now. He and I talked through it and were able to be kind. I still don't understand his conclusions, and he's going to explain more later. I don't regret anything about the time I spent with him tho I had a meltdown where I felt a lot of self-anger. I'm confident we'll be able to be friends. I'm mourning the loss of the intimacy I had with him, which I've already been processing since he's been in another country the last 2 months. 

Breakups of all types suck. It hurts when someone can't imagine you into their self conceptualization as you are. But the self understanding of conceptualizing polyamory takes time. He said he could see himself being poly later in life, but right now it's not what he needs. I don't think it's a health decision for him bc he feels ungrounded / not at home, and I wish he saw me as being able to be an anchor for him regardless of our construct. I am trying very hard not to argue for his affection.My NP started seeing a guy about six weeks ago, and for various reasons, the two of them decided to "keep it casual." 

But she has come to find out that her definition of casual is different than his. 

While she doesn't need to be wined and dined or given flowers and cards, she does want him to "warm her up" a little bit with flirty texts and maybe some conversation and hanging out when they meet up. 

His idea of a casual relationship is "When I'm horny, I'll text you to come over so we can f>@k. Then you go home." 

She is feeling pretty neglected by him, and even used, but doesn't feel she has the right to say anything because "I told him it would be casual."

I am telling her that she needs to trust her own feelings and be honest with him about what SHE thought a casual relationship looked like. If he's not down for doing a bit of work to be with her, then at that point the two of them can decide what to do. 

Anyway, I am curious what YOUR definition of "casual" is? Have you ever been in a casual relationship? If so, how did it work? If not, how much "effort" and "interaction" should go into a casual relationship? 

She (and I) thank you for your responses!Hey there, I've (25ftm) been with my fiancé (29enby) for the last 3 years. Throughout our relationship I've really struggled with the desire of non-monogamy. We met shortly after I got out of an unfortunately abusive relationship and I wasn't really looking to settle down but we are /perfect/. They're my absolute best friend and I couldn't imagine coming home to a different person. That being said, I still have a strong desire to pursue physical relationships with other people. I've been trying to understand what I want out of it aside from physical pleasure. I think something that really has been on my mind is my perceived masculinity. When my fiancé and I met I was still female identifying and now, having been on hormones almost two years, look very different. The thought of being physically intimate with someone who sees me as a guy is something I want to have? 

My partner never misgenders me, we have AMAZING sex, I've never felt like they don't see me as male, but there's this lingering part of me that wants to be able to start without that "expectation". I also don't just want meaningless hookups, I would like to be able to be friends with them. I don't think I'd consider myself poly though, I know that I don't have the emotional energy to take care of myself and more than one committed partner. 

TLDR; I want friends I can have crushes on and make out / fool around with and then go home to my fiancé. Is it wrong I if I just want to have physical pleasure and be seen as attractive in my "new" body? Should I be expecting more emotional involvement? Am I just vain? ':)

Thanks in advance!Hi! New to this subreddit and got a bit of a weird situation going on at the moment, needed somewhere to vent anonymously and maybe even garner some feedback..? If this is an inappropriate use of this subreddit, please just let me know and I can delete the post! Apologies for the length, I've tried to condense it down from the absurdly long original draft but I'm bad at summarising (it's ok if nobody reads this but a big thanks to anyone who sticks it out!)

**TL;DR - I'm aromantic and have been in a platonic and open sexual relationship with my friend for 4 years. This year they have started dating/sleeping with other people, and it's made me far more anxious and insecure than I'd anticipated. I'm now unsure what to do as I don't want to constrain them to a non-romantic exclusive relationship, nor myself really, but I can't ignore how it's making me feel. I don't want to end things but am trying to figure out the root of the problem and am wondering if anyone has any advice after reading my inner workings? (have added fake names to make easier to understand)**

For context, I am 23 and have loosely identified as aromantic pansexual since I was 15. For those who don't know what aromantic means, it's similar to asexual but instead of a lack of sexual attraction, it's a lack of romantic attraction. When I was very young, I thought I was almost hyperromantic because I'd bounce from crush to crush, assuming that anyone I got along well with as friends who I found attractive was somebody I had a crush on. As I got older, I realised that crushes usually led to romantic interactions and relationships, and quickly noticed that the idea repulsed me. I was all-in for the courting process, but as soon as somebody wanted to date me, I couldn't be less into it. This is when I discovered what aromanticism was and slowly started to piece together that I didn't have to be in a romantic relationship, particularly a monogamous one (the notion of exclusivity made my skin crawl). But as somebody who is decidedly **not** aro/ace (I still experience sexual attraction), I ran into the issue of wanting sexual relationships without the baggage of a romantic relationship; friends with benefits seemed the ideal outcome.

When I turned 19, I met somebody who I will refer to as **Charlie** (not real name). I was immediately attracted to them, both platonically and sexually, and we got along like a house on fire, but I learnt that they were on the ace spectrum and assumed we wouldn't be compatible beyond just friends. However, after many months of becoming very close and spending immense amounts of time together, it became apparent that the attraction was reciprocated & this resulted in us having sex at a party. After this, we had sex again a few times before they asked me if I wanted to be in an exclusive relationship with them. I nervously explained that it wouldn't work for me and that I would struggle to be both romantic and exclusive, assuming that would be a dealbreaker, but they surprisingly agreed to go along with it.

They said they were alright with a friends with benefits situation, the caveats being that they would probably eventually want to find a romantic relationship elsewhere and that if either of us did anything with anyone else, we would declare it to each other (that way we could avoid any paranoia). I also vaguely recall some general acknowledgement that they would be upset if I slept with any of their friends, which I respected. I was very keen on this idea overall, despite a few reservations about their ability to not become romantically attached to me, and concluded it was a good plan.

Fast forward a couple of years, still sleeping together, and there had been some occasional indications that Charlie was romantically into me but not expecting reciprocation. We'd also each had one instance of sleeping with someone else (they did so first). I didn't react incredibly well to their sleeping with someone else, which I felt a bit ashamed about it as it surprised me, but I think in particular because it was a longtime friend of mine who I introduced them to AND a friend that I felt very insecure about (someone I used to compare myself to a lot). When I subsequently slept with someone else, who they didn't know, I could sense some jealousy from them which made me think the next time I slept with someone else might be the end of our arrangement, but overall Charlie reacted fairly well and we moved on pretty easily (both instances were one night stands). In my opinion, they definitely handled it better than me. At some point during all of this, they disclosed to me that they thought they might be poly (previously more mono leaning).

Fast forward again, through the pandemic, and it's been 4 years that we've been sleeping together. I've been generally avoiding pursuing the people I've been interested in because I thought it would upset Charlie (either because they were friends, or because it was somebody I could tell Charlie was particularly jealous about). I figured that, if I was going to sleep with someone else and have it potentially end my dynamic with Charlie, it may as well be with somebody I'd like to have a long term fwb relationship with (which is additionally tricky when most people are interested in romance & monogamy, and I tend to think through potential consequences a lot). Also, possibly worth noting, over the pandemic my body changed a lot and I think it brought a lot of old insecurity to the surface. Charlie too had not slept with anybody else in this time, and things were going back to normal once I was seeing them more frequently again post-lockdown.

That's until this month. They told me in december that they had kissed a very close friend of mine (who I'll call **Mary**), a friend we both knew had a crush on Charlie, who they had been spending lots of time with. I was a bit taken aback but ultimately not too bothered by it. Then come early January, right after my birthday, they told me they had slept with Mary (& kissed at new years) and wanted to know how I felt about it/how I'd feel about them pursuing anything further. I asked if they had used protection, and they had not (I've asked Charlie to get tested just to be safe, don't believe they have done so yet). I was very confused in my feelings at this point and told Charlie that I was alright with the two of them having a casual sexual relationship, but that if they were going to be together romantically then I didn't want to be involved and would withdraw from our arrangement. (I truly meant this at the time I said it).

Charlie accepted this and said they weren't sure they wanted a romantic relationship anyway, and that they would like to prioritise our dynamic over their one with Mary, but ideally would be able to be sleeping with us both. They said they'd speak to Mary about it all the following weekend, which gave me a lot of time to ruminate. I found myself possessed by jealousy and insecurity, messaging Charlie constantly for validation. I was too embarassed and confused to let on how upset I was, but I often couldn't sleep at night and was struggling to eat because of the anxiety. Initially I'd chalked the anxiety up to a deadline I was coming up against, because I suffer from a lot of anxiety and mood swings in general, but I noticed as the weekend was approaching that the idea of them together in any manner was making me miserable. It had also affected my friendship with Mary, as we were both being avoidant of each other, which made me doubly upset.

The situation resulted in the two of them deciding to remain just friends, no sex, but I can't help but feel quite guilty about it. I started to question whether I was aromantic, whether I was poly, whether I was a hypocrite, whether I wanted someone who would be exclusive with me while I wasn't exclusive with them, what I even wanted in general. I cleared things up with Mary and reckoned maybe it had just come down to Charlie being with someone else I was close with (I'd also felt jealousy about Charlie getting to spend 1:1 time with Mary too, so the jealousy went both ways).

Now it's been a few weeks and Charlie told me they had planned a few dates with people from dating apps, unsure of what they wanted to come from them. They went on their initial date (who I'll call **Zara)** and I found that it didn't bother me at all, if anything I was very happy for them and keen to hear how it'd gone. Then they went on a second date with Zara last night (tmk, Charlie has not disclosed our dynamic to this person yet, which is a slight source of worry). The date ended with them getting intimate and they told me immediately this morning via message. Initially I felt fine about it, and I appreciate that they'd told me right away, but then they mentioned that Zara had given them a lot of very visible hickeys and that made my stomach churn a bit (while also being quite funny).

Charlie has told me numerous times not to give them visible hickeys because of work, which I have obviously respected (I used to give them lots) so naturally, I felt a bit offended that they'd let this new person give them some **very** visible ones. Now I've been sitting on it, thinking, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what I want or how I'm feeling. It's nowhere near as bad as I felt after Charlie had slept with Mary, or the initial friend, which is an improvement, but I clearly have jealousy issues that I hadn't previously been aware of. I still can't figure out what I want to come from the situation or what specifically is making me jealous. They said we could chat about it all next time I see them (this weekend), as they are very good at checking in with how I feel and we try to communicate lots, but the problem is that I'm not sure what I feel! It's like I didn't mind them seeing Zara in a romantic context, but as soon as it became sexual it started to bother me. Or maybe it was because the first date wasn't threatening? Unhelpful that I am a very emotionally repressed person and often find it difficult to figure out what I'm experiencing.

I'd assumed for the previous cases that my reaction was due to them being friends of mine, who I felt insecure in comparison to, but now I'm not so sure. I still don't love the idea of a romantic relationship, even an open/poly one, but I also don't seem currently fit for an open/poly sexual relationship either- despite having previously been so sure I would be. But the idea of ending things with Charlie makes me tear up, as they are one of my closest friends and I feel incredibly at ease around them. I like that we're so close. We're also very sexually compatible and lately I haven't been much interested in sleeping with anyone else (potentially bc of the baggage that comes along with it, it's not that I haven't been attracted to anyone). I know that I obviously have to talk things through with Charlie\*\*,\*\* and I want to, but I'm torn- I really don't want to end things with them but I also feel like I'm holding them back. If they want to engage in polyamorous, romantic relationships, I don't want to get in the way of that; they're my friend and I want them to be happy. I feel like I'm being very selfish and unappreciative even though they've tried to make sure I feel okay.

I can't tell if maybe I'm feeling worse about it all because of resurfaced insecurity/deadlines/general resentment that I haven't been sleeping with other people when they have (a newbie poly classic) or whether this is just something fundamental that won't go away. Maybe I'm not aromantic and I just have self esteem issues, maybe I'm not poly and I just have commitment issues. Can one even be polyamorous **and** aromantic? I'm afraid to ask for anything exclusive because I don't want to constrain them (also I'm not sure they'd feel emotionally satisfied if I can't provide romantically), and I also am afraid of having to hold myself to that standard of exclusivity. I'm afraid of how it would come across- if I'm sexually exclusive with someone that I'm also great friends with, is that just a romantic relationship? Is it then shitty if I don't want to engage with it as a romantic relationship? (I can't hack stuff like PDA, marriage, introducing them to your family as your partner, etc.) The lines are becoming super blurred.

I just feel wracked with guilt and confusion, and this is the most uncertain I've felt in my identity since I was a teenager. Where I had been so sure I was poly and aromantic, I now feel adrift. I guess my ideal outcome is that we go back to being in a "sexually open, aromantic fwb dynamic" except where Charlie isn't actually seeing anyone else, which is an obvious indicator that something is very wrong. I don't want to be that person, and I find myself disagreeing with my feelings a lot. Maybe I would be okay in a platonic but sexually exclusive relationship and I'm just afraid because it's new? Regardless, I'm now faced with a lot of options, none of which feel great. Sigh, being a person is hard. I clearly have a lot of self reflecting to do, and will definitely do so with Charlie, but I was wondering if anyone else had any similar feelings or experiences that they could share? Feeling very alone in this bizarre scenarioI can’t believe how much it hurts. This was my first attempt at polyamory (romance and more than just multiple sex partners which I have had) and I’m still devastated. I go back and forth between crying for him and hating him. I go through my phone and see things that remind me of him like a voicemail I just found. I have not connected with anyone like this since I met my husband 11 years ago and now I feel as though what's the point? I have casual interest in others but it's not the same. 

I am so very very thankful to have my husband behind me and comforting me but I'm worried I'm dumping too much on him (though he hasn't said anything). I'm also worried about inadvertently coming between him and his new girlfriend because I am suddenly very very lonely. My depression has made me more introverted than normal and it is hard to interact with others. 

One of the worst parts are that I still don't understand what happened and I can't bear the thought of him hating me forever. I loved this person. There was also a BDSM component I am struggling to get through. I found a sub journal I thought I deleted that detailed fantasies about him which hurt to look at (I avoided reading it).  I feel like my love and enjoyment in kink is broken. He gave me life in kink and made me not hate myself for my fantasies or feel disgusted with myself. Ironically I think he is disgusted with himself for his own desires. 

To top it off my grandfather died on Christmas and he reminded me of him. My grandfather was a pioneer in the world of computer science and even has patents for programming processes. He worked on an important government project dealing heaving with coding which is so similar to the career of this guy. I just don't know what to do and am afraid of burdening my friends and loved ones and driving them away. 

Thanks for listening reddit, I guess I'm just lonely.A poly question so I hope it’s ok to post here. Just looking for some advice.

Am I the asshole / Am I an idiot? My ex (30f) and I met at work and started flirting, then started a talking stage. She then informs me she’s married and her husband (29m) would be willing to try a poly relationship. Despite the heavy unicorn red flags (I know now, please don’t lecture me), we were in a closed triad for almost a year before my ex cheated with multiple men for months and told everyone we know that she hated both me and her husband, she only invited me to move in to be childcare while she went out with other men, she wanted a divorce, and was using us both. 

We tried relationship therapy and she only came to one session to say that she was filing for divorce and moving out. I had moved out temporarily to recover and let everyone heal from the cheating and divorce, but once she said she wanted no reconciliation I moved back in shortly after she moved into her own place. She told both the husband and I to continue dating one another and that she hoped we would be happy together.  But then she found out she was pregnant by one of her dalliances and to no one’s surprise, wanted her husband and his financial security back. 

I recently found out that they’ve been texting and in those texts, he tells her he doesn’t want a divorce and only wants her and she, in those texts, says multiple times that they slept together while he and I were dating. I confronted him and he says he only spoke to her that way because otherwise she will poison their kids against him and keep them from him (both true, she does that), but that he DID NOT sleep with her and that he’s told her it’s over now. 

Everyone seems to think that I’ve done something wrong, that I broke them up, that I’m somehow a home wrecker? Someone even said “I know you want a family, but it doesn’t have to be HER family,” but she threw them away and she doesn’t actually want him, just his money and someone to take care of her baby. Am I doing something wrong by being with him? I thought that leaving until the divorce was finalized was best, but he’s begging me to stay and I don’t have the heart to leave him.Hi, so I've (19 nb) and my fiancee (18f) recently have just gotten into a poly relationship but only on my side of things. So it's sort of mon/poly if you will. I've known my now other partner (22 nb) for longer than I've known my fiancee and I've liked them since I met them where as they haven't known them for more than 5 days currently. I don't want (18f) to get hurt nor do I want (22 nb) to get hurt as I love them both with my whole heart. I know I have issues to work on and it's not their fault but I got made extremely uncomfortable and insecure when I was shut out and they were flirting after my partner (18f) admitted to thinking sexually of my other partner whilst I was on call to them. (18f) and myself have never had sex or even thought of eachother in that sense but I still have needs while they have said multiple times that they are asexual. That confuses me due to them thinking about my partner that way, which brings me to be insecure and think I'm not enough. Me and (18f) have discussed the fact I am ambiamourous multiple times and even before we got together and its great to explore it now but I just don't feel comfortable or happy in myself if they ignore me to flirt or even potentially have sex or something. I'm perfectly happy with both having another(or more) partners but I don't want them to date or sleep with eachother as it get me into a bad state of mind and so on. Am I just being really jealous and/or insecure for wanting them to be friends because they're moving way too fast for me to even process things in a healthy manner?Hi all. 
Me (29f) and my partner (38M) have been together for about a year and half, so we met during the beginning of the pandemic. Because of that, we were monogamous to start for the health and safety of everyone. We knew we wanted to be poly and strive towards relationship anarchy in the long term. 

We do not live together. He has two kids. He has them for two weeks and then they spend two weeks with their mom. 
Whenever he has his kids, our relationship is somewhat strained. A lot less sex, less communication, less quality time. I also have a really early bedtime because of my job. 

For the past two weeks, I've been feeling this strain on the relationship while we have the kids. Just not getting my needs met. 
Then on top of that, he's had three separate playdates with other people after his kids go to bed (which hurts because I can't stay awake long enough to have sex with him after his kids go to bed). 

After his playdates, I have been feeling really upset and triggered. Even if I'm horny, I just can't bring myself to have sex with him the day after he has sex with someone else, even if we have a rare few hours alone without the kids. 
Which leads me to feeling even more resentful and hurt. 

I'm in a vicious cycle of feeling hurt and emotional, and then needing space from him, (which he sometimes fills with more playdates) which means I miss him and I just feel crazy and not okay. 

Please please please, any advice would be so helpful. 
 We are going to Colorado for the weekend to visit his mom and I'm just still feeling so raw after he had hookups this week.I'll need to be a bit vague because I am unsure if anyone else involved has a reddit account. Some details will be changed because I don't want a certain person realizing who I am.

I have 2 roomates (P and H). P and I dated for around 3 years. We broke up due to things getting toxic and  we did not have the tools or maturity at the time to get past it then.  P and H started dating some time afterwards. I cut off contact with P for a few years and during covid we reconnected. I reached out to P because I heard of something that changed my perspective of what had happend between us. I mostly wanted P to know that I did not hate them.  We became friends again and eventually when the two needed a roomate I moved in. 
P and H had been dating for about 5 years and were engaged. They were taking a break from being poly to work on their relationship before involving others. This was due to what I thought was 1 cheating incident. 

I've been living with P and H for a few months now.  The last week I ended up comforting P twice who was crying because H was breaking their agreement again. The first time I calmed P down and recommended they sit down, revisit their agreement and perhaps go to couples therapy. They went over their agreement that night. P and H are okay with being Poly again. They just need to tell each other about major relationship progression, new love interests/partners and a heads up about dates.2 days later P and I walked in on H breaking that agreement. 

I dont know what P plans to do yet. I know P and H have had a talk. I'm not even sure that they are still together. 

It hurts to see P get hurt like this. I still care for them. I'd be open to dating them but I'm perfectly fine being strictly platonic. I was friends with H, they were like an older sibling to me.  Seeing proof of some of the things H has done has shaken me up. It's hard to look at them the same. 


I'm not quite sure what to do or if I should do anything at all. Their relationship is none of my business. 
P has almost walked out and packed their suitcase twice. I wouldnt want to stay in this home with H since they are not very financially responsible. Plus it's hard to ignore what I know they did. 
I hope this had enough poly relevance.What did y'all think about Jada and Willow talking about polyamory last year? They had some things to say about generational perspectives.

Quote:

Willow asked Jada how she felt when the 20-year-old singer revealed that she was polyamorous. Jada answered, "When you were like, 'Hey this is my get down,' I was like, 'I totally get it,'" "Wanting to set up your life in a way that you can have what it is that you want, I think anything goes as long as the intentions are clear."

She added that in life, "there's a lot of beauty that sits outside of the conventional boxes" and later explained that she feels "most people are practising monogamy because they feel like they have no other choice."So I’ve posted on a many apps and here in reddit, looking for a hinge partner. Many people are so unfamiliar with poly! Its so frustrating! 

I think my current issue is fishing out the real people from the what I like to call robots. Or fake accounts. Does anyone else have this issue?Just what the title says really. I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this. Can't find much reference to it, just a bunch of things about ensuring you still care for current partners during NRE.

But, I find, that during NRE with a new partner, it *improves* my other/older relationships, makes me want to reaffirm with current partners - makes me more affectionate with them, makes the sex better, makes me appreciate them more, makes me fall in love with them more. It's like I can see their beauty and why I fell in love with them all over again much clearer too. 

I really feel close with current partners while I'm experiencing NRE.

Is there a word for this that I am missing? Does anyone else experience this?Hey there! I (21F) recently decided to try out polyamory with the twist of relationship anarchy in there. Like, this year recently lol, it's a little experiment. I've always been unhappy with monogamy and thought there was no harm in trying this out, especially with the encouragement of every lovely poly person here :)

See the problem I've come across is... I'm not sure how to tell my family about all this, or if I should bother telling them at all. They're all very conservative and monogamous and conventional in their approach to life, I can't help but worry they'll judge/shun me. Then again, is it any of their business? Not really... It just hurts that I can't tell them about my boyfriend AND my girlfriend... but they definitely don't need to know about my sides bitches (metamours lol).

As long as you're here reading this, is it a better idea to keep the fact that you're poly away from the public in general? I've heard about people losing their jobs or leaving town because people found out. It's a scary thought that we can be discriminated against so easily... But um, yeah, any advice is appreciated! Keep being awesome y'all.Hi! I was in a monogamous relationship, I'll call him G for now, for almost 3 years. We broke up because he was very depressed and I couldn't carry our relationship anymore. We both found it very hard without each other and decided to try dating each other as well as other people. No official relationships at this point.
          After about a month G and I decide we want to try and resume our relationship but as poly/open since we both care about the other people we have been dating. So now I am dating a new person, C, as well as G as my boyfriend. We also have a shared person ,S. That's good for me, I like the option of having more people but it's hard maintaining more relationships.
           G has one partner other than me, (S) as well as two people he is serious about plus many hookups. I have a hard time with jealousy and feeling wanted because of this. We don't have any rules other than just giving the other some notice before talking about sex so that they can be in the right head space. And just giving each other a heads up if we are serious about a new person.
          Im not sure if I have any questions but I guess I'm just wondering other people's experience with this. I feel like G and I are slowly working through the beginning things which feels very nice. It does hit me hard sometimes when I know G is out with someone and I'm at work. I try to just remind myself that he does make time for me and he treats me the same as everyone else. 
          Part of what I feel is also feeling like I have to keep up with him and all of us people but I don't really want to when I think about it. Sorry for the long post but any advice/thoughts is welcome.My partner and I have talked about being open since the beginning of our relationship almost 2 years ago. I was drawn to polyamory and open relationships because the of the freedom and expression of love that this kind of lifestyle seems to be about. It really made me believe in found family, and gave me a lot of optimism about living in a free and true way. 
I have been reading, researching, and talking about what it would be like with my partner for months, and about a month ago we really began searching for other people together and separately. I have begun talking to 2 other people, and it was incredible and scary to get to know other people, my world and heart felt open in a way they haven’t been in awhile. However, now I’m experiencing doubts and fears, and while I want to honor all my feelings and not repress anything, I know I also have a tendency to overly control things. 
People who are just staring out like me, and especially people who have been in poly relationships for awhile, how were you and your partner able to move through the beginning period? I’m having trouble matching my ideals with my reality. Logically I know taking care of myself and filling my own cup first is the most important, but how did you let go and trust the process to get where you are today?I’m fairly new to polyamory and I’m not having any luck finding partners. I know what I want. I’m not hung up on dynamics but it’s hard as a single woman finding partners to develop a relationship with. Any advice from the more experienced people???Short but sweet post. 

My fiancee and I talked about our new dynamic last night and he still agrees that he wants to marry me even if this is a new part of our lives together. He admitted that if I was anyone else he would have left me by now, but he loves me to much and wants to spend the rest of our lives together. We are learning this together and I love him even more for being able to accept this peice of me that I hid away from him. I though something was wrong with me for so long but now I can finally accept that this is who I am.. 

I feel finally happy after all these years of hiding my true self. I finally feel like me againBurner for obvious reasons. My partner and I are newer, about 4 months together. We are planning a future together, discussing marriage, and loving our very connected and entangled life. 

She has a couple that she also dates. We both have occasional hookups, but it’s really rare. Her dates with her other couple are pretty infrequent at this point. When we met it was long weekends with her couple once a month and dates in between.  Now it’s a rare overnight and maybe a date with each of the members of the couple a month. 

The problem is that both of us really have to push ourselves to see other partners, make other plans. We prefer to be together, and our life lets us spend a LOT of time together.  Right now it just feels forced for us to go out with our other partners. 

On one hand, duh NRE. On the other hand, why force ourselves to date others if we really just want to be together all the time. At what point should we just close up and be mono?So for the past year (almost) I have been talking with this guy. He has been very honest and open about being poly and I have been open and receptive to this. We both agree that we have a mutual understanding of one another and I am constantly trying to learn about what it means to be poly and to establish the right boundaries to suit both him and I.

The main problem I have is that when we first started talking he would talk about his other relationships so openly and encouraged me to become involved with the others so we were all on the same page. We all met and got along nicely which was lovely but since this he seems to have distanced himself from us all and appears confused. 

What was previously very easy conversations about his other partners has now become awkward and tense and I can’t understand why. It’s changed dramatically since he told me he loves me which makes me question whether I’ve put pressure on him without realising? We both speak about our feelings regularly but this is one he can never quite wrap his head around as to why it’s happened. Has anyone else experienced this and do you have any advice on how we can make the conversation open again?I broke up with two very toxic partners, and I feel so free. Isn’t just being single such a gift sometimes??Hey, so this is more a relationship question than poly, but its in a poly context and I frequently find the quality of advice here much better than in reddit relationships.

I went on a second date last week and didn't feel that great about it afterwards due to some subtle misogyny and him clearly struggling with some problems that he seems to project outwards. It wasn't all bad, he's very interesting and I wouldn't be opposed to meeting again potentially to develop a distant friendship, but I would never hookup or go on a date with him again.

I sent a brief thank you text after our date to ask if he got home ok, and he only replied "yea got home safe" and that was that. I honestly thought he felt weird about the date too due to some of his body language and how he didn't reach out to say thanks or check in after we fooled around a little. Which was fine, a fade out after a 2nd date that didn't land was ok with me.

But he texted me today, not to ask me out again but to ask if I'd found a place to do a specific hobby we'd talked about where we live. I don't know how to respond - if I should answer his question and then wait for him to ask me out again to turn him down, which feels like I'm leading him into a rejection? Should I say "oh and by the way I don't want to go out with you again" before he even asks, which feels presumptive to me? What is the least jerky way to handle this? And if a 3rd date does get brought up and I say it's not a good fit and he asks if I mind letting him know what happened, should I go into the details of how he acted and how it affected me (which might get offensive for him - some of his behavior just screamed "I'm going to be an inconsiderate partner") or just keep it vague and generic? Thank youHi everyone!! I (m31) am married for almost 10 years (f29) and we feel happily married. We’ve had issues before but we haven’t had anything bad for over a year now. Until now. I suggested we start poly dating and she was on board with it. This is because of our overall thoughts of marriage. We started getting on tinder, OkCupid, etc.. she’s met a few guys, I haven’t met anyone. We started this a few months ago, about 4-5. 
She’s with a guy about 5 hr drive from us and she really likes him and I do too. I think he’s great really nice guy and he is married as well. I am absolutely happy for her. The problem is I can’t adjust to this. I’ve always had issues before with being left out with friends and it’s happened to me a lot. Friends would get together, I would get left behind, I would introduce people to each other, they would start hanging out more and I’d be excluded most of the time. 
So because of this, and probably some jealousy of not having someone of my own, I can’t get used to this. I get very anxious and upset when he is involved and I know I’m being ridiculous about it and the things I get upset about is unreasonable, but I really have a hard time feeling this way. 
Ideally I would love for us to find others and have the typical poly family. And even if I don’t end up finding someone I want to stop feeling so anxious and getting upset about the things they do. He’s come by and I’ve met him. We played cards and board games and really enjoyed his company. 
She also is working a crazy amount of hours because she’s a store manager and things are pretty chaotic so I don’t see her much now when I was seeing her almost everyday so I have a lot of missing her going on. 
I’d like to know what to do and if I can do anything to change. I know I should see a therapist but I don’t know how to address it. 
I broke down last night and told her I couldn’t do it because idk how to make this feeling stop and I feel like I’m leading her on and I feel terrible that I’m coming between them. I don’t want to actually stop I just want everything to be good and everyone happy.my partner wants to start practicing polyamory, and im still monogamous (for right now). i’ve been having a hard time internalizing the fact that my partner wanting to date other people doesn’t mean he doesn’t love me or i’m not enough for him, etc 

i told my therapist that my biggest fear is that my partner wants to be polyamorous because he’s slowly trying to explore other options because he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. my therapist told me that there is a chance that polyamory could lead to my partner breaking up with me. 

after that, i made the decision that im not going to talk another polyamory with my therapist anymore unless he does more research, because that really shook me up.

edit: i just had a session with my therapist, and i talked to him about how much what he said scared me. he said that it’s his job to look out for me, and i need to face the scary parts of the new change in my relationship. we’re going to keep talking about polyamory, but now thanks to you guys and my convo with him, and im more open to telling him when what he says is pushing me to far.I’ve been reading lots of posts and peoples personal journeys with polyamory, would not wanting a partner to be involved with a friend of mine “controlling” ? i feel like with some time i would be open to trying out polyamory but i feel like my boundary would be just not getting involved with each other’s friends. It seems like this could get tricky. Please lmk what u guys think !!! i also think my partner wouldn’t feel comfortable with that as well so is it just a healthy boundary or is it bound to be broken eventually ?So far, I’ve only been the one to see people on the side, mostly because my internet husband has mostly been asexual.  Now he has let me know he has started doing some pretty heavy flirting with another lady online and it hurts because I flirt with him all the time but he doesn’t flirt back.  I’ve told him this is something I want more of.  He compensated for one day, and it was wonderful but in three years he hasn’t been flirty like before we had a label. Help?I want to write a book with an accurate portrayal of polyamory in my main characters. Along with getting nonfiction books on the subject I wanted to sprinkle in some fiction ones to get a better understanding of what tropes and stereotypes to avoid. While many of the recommended books in this subreddit are on their way to my mailbox, I’m not really sure where to begin in my reading when it comes to fiction. Any recommendations or advice would be extremely helpful.So I’ve been dating this guy for over 2 years and when we met we made the mistake of doing DADT. He then got serious with another person and then became hierarchal which over night left me really hurt. We eventually worked it out and moved to still dating but being secondary. But since then things have changed - he’s no longer with his primary and we have escalated to being more serious though I’m very keen to remain non hierarchal. However, I find myself sometimes worry or getting jealous that it’ll de escalate or pushed aside and was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar in terms of feelings. I’ve been doing a lot of work on comparison and trying not to feel like everytime he meets a new person it means I’ll be forgotten about.so my partner (nb21) and i (nb20) have been in a 3 year relationship and within the past 2 months we decided to try out a poly relationship- specifically a triad. And we met a new person about a month ago and at first it was fine- we were just hanging out and casual sex and whatnot but for them it seemed like they hit it off nearly immediately. Within a few days they were exchanging poetry and letting one another following their private social media accounts. And at first it was all of us hanging out, but because I have work (4/7 days) they also hang out whenever I’m not home. I know it’s only been a month but they seem to have clicked faster/stronger than me and the new person (nb20) have. A week or so ago my partner asked if we could make (we’ll call them S) S our official partner. I personally thought it was quick but I thought my own insecurities/jealousies were holding me back. [we’ve had separate convos about that so i figured that was something holding me back] But now that the relationship has further progressed with them, I still feel left out. I don’t know if it’s because S and I don’t get to spend a lot of time together, or if we genuinely don’t connect? I felt a sexual connection to them in the beginning but now that our relationship aside from sex hasn’t really developed I find myself not wanting to be as intimate with them. And their connection is definitely growing because of how often they speak separately and interact on the internet. and i’m wondering if it’s just me or if they actually don’t feel me anymore? I don’t know what to do because I also don’t want to hurt my partner’s feelings nor S’s. I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing myself to like someone so my partner and I can have a triad. I don’t know
Advice?

To add when is a good time to step back? Or are there any temporary rules to put out? I didn’t want rules in the beginning because that sounds controlling to me. idk I just feel stuck and need helpI’ve had this conversation with friends, but I want to hear from y’all! Whether your new to it or have practiced for years, how did it change your life? Let’s share the pros and cons.Just wondering - does anyone have any rules or boundaries that they've found are very unique? 

Note: "no rules or boundaries" isn't what I'm looking for lol xoxo

EDIT: loving the responses! I got really busy with work and a painting I'm doing so I apologise for not engaging, I swear I will soon!Things are already very tense between me and my ex and I don't want things to get more adversarial.

I'm not sure what to do. Nobody knows the relationship was abusive except me, my ex, and possibly my ex's new partner, and it's killing me that I have to keep this to myself when I could really use the support.

edit: Thank you so much for your help, everyone. I feel less alone.

edit 2: Just wanted to say although I'm not responding to every comment, I am reading them all and I am really appreciative of everyone's insight on this. I don't necessarily agree with everything that's being said but the diversity of opinions is helping me think through how I feel about the whole situation. And, again, I feel so much less isolated because of you all, so thank you; it means a lot.Hi peeps , I (f, 29) am in an more or less open relationship for three years now and recently hooked up with my best friend (m) of ten years and everyone's cool with it, except for, well, myself.  

For a bit of context, I have been poly in my early twenties, but being in a bad depression back then I fled into a loving, but difficult mono relationship. After that I swore to not going mono again, because I felt like I couldn't do it.

At the beginning of my ongoing relationship I made that really clear and I even hooked up with a lovely woman, but ended that really quick to not strain the growing relationship between my partner (m) and I (which was okay, nobody was hurt). After some time passed I grew resentments towards the relationship and I felt alot better, after we discussed our status as open once more, although nothing happened with other people. We could talk about attractions and crushes to other people and it was great. He is the best partner ever, in every aspect. I adore him to bits and that's a massive understatement. Let's call him A.

We had a lot of talking about how he'd even be okay with me hooking up with friends of mine and we talked alot about what he needed to feel safe etc. And now it happened, that I slept with my best friend, whom I grew attracted to over the course of the last year or so. Let's call him B. My plan was to tell him (B, A already knew) exactly that and to talk about it, but instead we got drunk as fuck (usually we don't even drink) and, well, fucked. And we both loved it and wanted more, because we are horny people who love each other dearly and A handled the situation really really well. But then B and I had some conflicts about my limits and about stuff he needs to work on and I became doubtful over the situation. I grew doubt and shame and a lot of fear for two of my most important relationships over the course of the next days. We then talked it through and I set some boundaries for B and expressed my uncertainty, which is hard on him and I know that, but I can't say anything else at the moment. 

We all have great communication and A and B also talked and really grow on each other even more and I love it, but I've got so many doubts. I feel guilty for making love A isn't involved in, I feel guilty in the eyes of his friends (which is a lot of internalised bullshit, I guess) and I suddenly feel like sex is way more intimate and "special" than it used to be for me. And all I wanna do is to make A happy and be there for him and explore sex with him together, I guess? Maybe. I don't know.  I am really confused and this whole situation strains me in such a way, that I don't even know, if I am still attracted to B. And he should, under no circumstances, be the vessel for my emotional and sexual puzzles. He's going visit me tomorrow for a few days and it's not like any visit before. Maybe I really didn't, but I  feel like I ruined two perfect relationships. I guess it all went way too fast. 

I feel really dumb and immature, even toxic right now, but maybe I am too hard on myself. Do you have any thoughts on this? I know I have to give it time, but I'm hardly sleeping and waking up nervous every day. It's phrased a bit black and white, but I loved my life and now I kinda hate it.So, I’m new to poly, but very willing to try it out.  Me and my wife have agreed to try and see if it works for us, and if it doesn’t, we will go back to a monogamous relationship while we figure things out or want to try again.  

My question I guess is, how the hell should I go about finding another to connect with? Especially as a subby guy,(I don’t push my kinks on people, that shits wrong) it seems everyone is after a unicorn or a daddy dom, I am neither.  I’m on a few dating apps, I have good clear pictures, the people I message I drop a hint that I actually read theirs profile, and mine is filled out.   It I keep hitting scammers, monogamous people (nothing wrong with it) and I’m getting a little annoyed with it.  Partly because I feel a little lost, partly because of how shitty people are.Looking for some advice.

In a newly open relationship.

How do you deal with your partner becoming intimate with others? How do you get out of the cycle of useless thoughts and refocus on the gratitude for your partners needs and happiness being fulfilled?

Cheers 🤙How long does it take you guys to move in with your partners?
What is casual to you guys?
I'm okay not being the primary partner- ideally what should that look like?Hello. I (F23) recently mutually ended our relationship with my partner (29M). A few weeks ago we decided it would be best if we were no longer partners but wanted to still be friends. 

We were ENM and each other’s primary partners for 2 years. We had a great relationship but a lot of ups and downs. It was both of our first ENM relationship and had insecurities and a couple of other things that would come up during that time. 

I am wanting us to be secondary partners especially as I’m in an intense grad school program and dealing with my own personal things. We were best friends and I still want to maintain that friendship but don’t want a primary partner right now. We have talked about specifically on what this would look like. Has anyone done this before?A new partner I met was worried today about his meta and whether he's doing ok about our new relationship. 

This is the kind of caring dynamic and partnership I've always dreamed of. 

I'm so so so happy.Hiya, some background, I've been poly for around 6 months. Have a partner I live with and have been together 7 years and another partner, we've been dating for around 5 months.

I recently started talking to someone else and we are going on a date in a few days. The partner I've been with for 5 months is really struggling with this, they have feelings that they will be second best and be left behind. This is in part due to distance as he lives around 1.5 hours away. I reassure him often, but I feel like no matter what I tell him, it seems like it doesn't get through. I love this partner so much, but he's making me feel guilty (not on purpose) about trying to make new connections.

This has been exacerbated by the fact we had a misunderstanding, where he thought we weren't talking to others at the moment, whereas I took it to be we weren't looking for a connection, but if someone wanted to talk I would talk. I think he feels a bit betrayed by this even though it wasn't on purpose. 

The new guy I'm talking to at the moment is super casual, we're not getting into deep meaningful conversations, we're just chatting. Have also told my partner this, but it doesn't relieve any anxiety he has about the situation. He's a chronic overthinker and suffers with anxiety.

I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips about how they would deal with this situation? I don't want to just keep telling him how much I love him because I'm worried it will lose meaning to him. How can I reassure someone with severe anxiety, bar stop making any other connections?

Thanks.Hi, wife and I are beginning our journey into a poly lifestyle. She has/is dating someone. All good things I had thoughts on we discussed. She caught feelings and felt guilty, I told her I support her and his relationship. Is this feeling common at times or in the beginning? Thank you in advance.My partner and I have been together for about a year and a half now and are in a very serious committed relationship. She is polyamorous, while am monogamous. I knew this going into the relationship, as she was with another partner when we started dating. The idea of dating someone with other partners was foreign and new to me at the time, but wasn’t something I was opposed to. Being monogamous and new to polyamory, it took me a while to overcome the feeling that I was the “other guy” in her relationship, but over time I learned to understand that isn’t how polyamory works.

After a messy separation from her other partner,  who was not very accepting of her polyamory, she decided she wanted to try a monogamous relationship with me. Over time this led to us discussing a life together (children, owning a home together, starting a business together, etc.). There had been a few instances of her mentioning she wanted to start dating others again, and I always told her that it was perfectly okay as long as we talked first.

Recently she told me she was certain she wanted to start dating again. We talked about it and I told her that she should do what makes her feel happy and fulfilled, and that I would be honest about any issues or concerns I have should they arise. We also agreed that we still want the life goals we had planned while pursuing a monogamous relationship. 

While I know it’s not rational, I worry I’m developing feelings of jealousy. I feel like I am on the other end of where the relationship started; I am her partner and now she is looking for other partners.

Are these feelings normal? Am I handling this properly? Does anyone have advice on how to approach this situation in a respectful and loving way?I (40 F, married) have been seeing a partner, “Rex” (40 M, otherwise single) for more than a year now.  He had no previous experience with open relationships, and when I came along, he decided he would give it a try as he was frustrated with traditional, monogamous dating. 

We had some very brief conversations early in our talking about whether I intended to continue to see other men (besides my husband), in addition to him.  I was honest and said that having just him in my life might fully satisfy those needs, but I couldn’t commit to not seeing others. In practice, I have been on a few dates with other men during our time together but haven’t pursued anything, both from lack of time and no strong interest. 

On his side, while we have been dating, Rex has continuously sought connections with other women on apps. He has been open to meeting someone(s) to date in addition to me but also has been open to connecting with someone who is looking for a monogamous relationship.  

Recently, for the first time, Rex felt there might be something promising brewing with a monogamous woman. In order “to give that a chance,” he abruptly cut off having sex with me. (I believe he hoped that the rest of our relationship would go on more or less as usual while he explored the possibility of dating this mono lady). I was devastated and experienced this as a break up (it was not an unanticipated situation given what he has been open to, but still gutting).  

Around this time, I started to look on the apps to see if I felt like dating. I’ve been for coffee with one guy. When I told Rex about the coffee date, he reacted with jealousy and shock that I would go on a date so quickly. Rex repeatedly says that (assuming we resume our sexual relationship) he doesn’t understand how it can be fair for me to have him and my husband and still want to seek connections with others. 

Now, the thing with the mono woman has gone nowhere, and we are back to being sexually intimate. I don’t feel super eager to dive into dating others but also considering going out with other men to reinforce to Rex that I, too, will have this freedom. 

Anyone else encountered this sort of two penis policy? Ways to help him see that making our situations identical was never the goal?  Thanks for reading.My nesting partner(30f) Natalie and I(27nb) have been dating for 4 years and polyamorous for about one year. She’s got another partner and I did for a little while - recently she’s the only one I’d call a partner but I’ve been on a few dates and building up intimate moments with two separate friends. Carmen, who I’ve known for over a year now and getting closer to gradually, and Mel, who I similarly only see once every few weeks at the most but just recently became a little more intimate.

My experience has historically been that physical intimacy with someone new also comes with more emotional intimacy. I get very anxious once there’s been an increase in intimacy and a strong fear sets in of them losing interest or losing my connection with them. Both of my crushes have very little communication over text, and seem to me to be pretty avoidant in their attachment styles, while I am very typically anxious. This has caused several days after spending time with them of just being worried about them and if we will maintain our connection, and trying to give them space.

The thing is, I don’t necessarily want another committed partner. Natalie and I are planning to buy a house soon, and want to raise kids someday. I don’t know if it would ever be in the cards for another partner to meet extended family and things like that. Natalie is very attentive and a good caretaker for me when I’m struggling and very responsive when I’m in need of a connection. I generally feel very lucky to have her as a partner. And yet, while connecting with others feels great in the moment, I find myself pining over these other people who I’m developing feelings for and feeling like I need something more from it. I’m okay with seeing them infrequently, but I need more communication as to what expectations are, and I wish I could be someone they feel comfortable really opening up to. Maybe super casual relationships aren’t for me - but the weird thing is they don’t feel casual at all when we’re together, they feel very sweet and romantic and loving and then once we’re apart it’s just gone. 

Carmen and I had plans to see each other after us both being sick and going on separate vacations and it’s been a over a month since we’ve really been able to hang out. And then shortly after making plans they said they aren’t in a good headspace and canceled it. I keep thinking there’s gotta be something they aren’t telling me - perhaps they just don’t want to be closer - but I’d much rather know whatever they’re feeling even if it’s uncertain than just keep wondering if there’s something about me. I just don’t know how to initiate conversation when they could be just going through their own stuff and I have literally no information.

Idk what I want or need but getting it out here is nice and maybe some of y’all have some nice insight. I guess mostly I’d like to enjoy the time I do have w my crushes and accept whatever form our connection takes without agonizing over it, knowing that I have my wonderful partner who provides for me and supports me. I want to learn to be okay with the distance somehow, because even if we don’t have something more, we have good friendships and occasional good hot make outs. I feel like I rationally don’t need or even want more committed partners but something feels terribly lacking and I need to figure out how to not feel that way anymore.A few months back I spoke with my partner about being unfilled sexually. There is a disconnect between our sexual needs. I like women that are submissive sexually and something use sex as an escape. She is more vanilla sexually.

The conversation led itself to me suggesting that I have other sexual partners. She said that she'd consider it once we we more committed.

I'm not looking for another girlfriend but more of a friend with benefits. Is there a way to structure this with ground rules? What's the best way to have this conversation with my partner.How do you not be so jealous of the others . I mean I don’t know why I feel this way. I mean I do, my fear of being left behind. the jealousy of the fact that she is his fantasy girl and I’m not and I’m disabled and she’s physically abled. He does assure me every time I look sad or he could tell that I’m getting jealous but I can’t get it out of my head when they talk… I want him to be everything he can for her but I just can’t get over my feelings . So what do I do to shake thisI had made a post some time ago in which my wife brought up to me that she thinks she is polyamorous, and wanted to begin exploring the new feelings she was having. It was a big blow to me, because besides one small discussion about polyamory before that moment (which was just a casual conversation about something I heard on a podcast) she had never brought up feeling this, and polyamory was never discussed before we got married. 

I didn't outright say no, because her happiness means a lot to me. I have many friends in successful poly relationships, and figured with time that I could grow to be okay with the new setup and continue happily in my marriage. So, I asked for some time to think on things and do research. She agreed, and that was the end of it for now.

Well, not even a week later and she brings up if its okay to be poly while I'm thinking about things. I was a little confused, so I asked if she meant it was okay if she referred to herself as poly, which I was fine with since that was what she was. She said no, I mean I want to begin exploring being poly while you're thinking about things, and I was blown away by this. I was under the assumption that dating wouldn't begin until both primary partners were 100% ready. I know I asked for time and its unfair to make her wait, but it hadn't even been a week....

Am I being selfish? I feel incredibly rushed now to make a decision and I'm worried that I'll make the wrong one and lose the woman I've loved for years.Things seemed to be going well between him and I. 
I met his primary a week ago and we hit it off very well. She approved of us dating. Communication wasn't very clear and she seemed to have been up and down about the whole situation, which I felt she already was even before meeting her.
I didn't respond to a text message from her for one day and she pretty much made him end things with me.
It's a bummer and I'm a little hurt because him and I clicked so well, but I'm sure she was looking for any reason to get me out if the picture.

If couples claim to be poly and willing to dip into that lifestyle, they need communication and respect. If one person is agreeing just so their partner won't leave them for someone else, maybe it needs to be discussed some more. I don't think she was 100% and now I just feel like a guinea pig. Very let down but happy it happened now before it got more serious.

Sorry if it seems rambled, still waking up and just needed to vent.Hey I'm new to polyamory, I also grew up with abusive parents so sometimes I struggle identifying toxic attitudes.
Recently started to talk to a person that prefers group settings (I'm more about dating my own partners without  and to each their own) but they talked about specifically searching for group aspects to not be that involved + refered to people in the group as unicorns.My partner and his wife have a toddler, and it recently came up in passing that they hope to have another child in the near-ish future. I’m super excited for when that day comes as I already adore their kid and love spoiling him.

However, this conversation got me thinking a bit about how our relationship would look during a pregnancy and with a newborn. Obviously things will be a lot different, but I wanted to hear from poly people/families about how pregnancy and having a newborn has changed your other relationships. 

We were not together when they had their first child and my NP and I haven’t had a child so I would love to hear people’s experiences!Curious as to how (or if) you have supported partners through difficulties in relationship and / or breakups while maintaining healthy boundaries?i’ve (NB20) been in a newly triad relationship and my primary (NB21 of 3 yrs) has been truly enjoying themselves w our new person (NB20)- i find myself disconnected because they have spent nearly everyday w each other (we met the first time a month ago exactly) and i have work 4 days a week so i’m not able sm to spend as much time w them + time w our new person alone. recently my ordinary has wondered about sex separately w just our new person and i have felt insecure about it. i know in triads each person’s individual relation w one another is nice but something makes me feel awful about this. i’ve bright up dating separately thinking maybe that might solve the problem but i genuinely don’t know what to do,, please help if u have advice.I introduced my nesting partner to a new partner last night and we had a great time together. My connection with the new partner is still very new—we’ve been on a couple dates and hooked up. I believe we both feel similarly in that we enjoy each other as friends primarily, and physical connection is fun when the mood is right. I don’t see us progressing to a much more serious relationship beyond this, and expect it remain a casual and enjoyable connection. 

For context, I’m a bi woman. Nesting partner is a straight man. New partner is a bi woman. 

The situation I need advice on: my nesting partner REALLY liked my new partner. He could not stop talking about her last night after we said goodbye. How she’s so cute, so fun, he can’t understand why I haven’t been obsessively talking about her since I met her, etc. It’s adorable and I’d be totally supportive of him pursuing something independently with the new partner if she’s interested (and she did seem to really enjoy meeting him last night). 

Not sure the best approach going forward. Should I let her know that he’s crushing on her, and if she’s interested as well they have my blessing to pursue something? Or would it be better to continue hanging out and let him express that to her himself? They haven’t exchanged numbers or anything so if he’s going to be the one to express it, I think it’d need to come after spending some more time together—we we all agreed we wanted to do. 

I’m sensitive to not wanting to make her uncomfortable or come off as a unicorn hunting situation, and I’m not sure if she’s interested in dating new men right now. But, I obviously think they are both great, and if there’s a chance for them to add happiness to each others lives I’d like to support that! Would love to hear perspectives from anyone who’s been in a similar situation, or even if you haven’t, about how you’d prefer to be approached if you were in new partners situation.Story follows, advice welcome.  
  
My wife (F30s) and I (M30s) left our religion a few years ago, and we've been slowly exploring all the taboos we had once followed. Polyamory came up, we had both heard some experiences independently, and the conversation slowly evolved from: *interesting but not for us*, to *probably a better system even if it's not for us*, to, *that's probably for us*.  
  
We talked about it a lot, over months. Our communication is good, this wasn't an attempt to save a failing relationship. And we both felt ready to start looking for new partners. Our primary motivation, I think, was knowing that we don't fill all of each other's needs (what are the odds that one person would?). The things that I was looking for (I'm simplifying a little here) in a new partner or partners was:  
  
- someone interested in my particular brand of nerdy hobbies  
- someone to cuddle while we watch old sci-fi  
- someone to fuck  
  
My wife's list was similar in form, different in content. She's much more outgoing/extroverted than I am, so we sort of suspected she would find a partner first, and tried to prepare for the asymmetry.  
  
Sure enough, she had a guy ask her out within a week. Wasn't what she was looking for, she said no. A couple weeks later, she starts flirting with this woman, they've got vague plans to go to lunch but haven't worked out a time. In both cases, I wanted to hear everything. We talked about them a lot, what she liked about both, what she didn't like. It was exciting for both of us.  
  
I also met a woman online, and we got off to a good start with a lot of nerdiness in common. I ask if my wife wants the details, she does, so I share. Seems great for a few days.  
  
And then my wife got really sad. Sad like I've never seen her before. She insists it's not about the polyamory stuff, but she doesn't know why (spoiler: it's about the polyamory stuff). The next day we talk it out, it takes some time for both of us to understand the feelings that are happening. Specifically, I think part of the issue is that the first (potential) partner I found was centered on an intellectual/emotional bond, rather than a physical one. I think that was a surprise, and stirred up feelings of being replaced, causing the sadness.  
  
We've put our poly experiment on hold. I stopped talking to the woman online (she was gracious about it, she knew it was new and experimental for me). My wife isn't planning to pursue anything with the woman she was talking to, or anyone else.  
  
If polyamory is a thing you do, then we're not poly right now. But if polyamourous is something you are, then I think I am polyamorous, it was all positive for me. But I think my wife is not.  
  
I'm happy with her alone. But I would be happier if she was with other people, even if I were not. That's what's convinced me that I'm actually poly, is that I wasn't just excited to date other people, I was excited for my partner to date other people. I was honestly so excited when I thought she was going to date somebody, and she seemed happy too. Maybe I would feel different if one of her relationships went further, maybe I wouldn't feel the same if they had sex, or if it were a man, or if there was something I didn't like about the other person. But I don't think so, I think I'd still be excited. And of course, I think I'd be happiest if we were both open to dating polyamorously.  
  
Anyway, the last bit of this was recent. I'm giving it at least a week for both of us to process. I'm not sure what I'll do next. I don't really have any questions for the community. But I needed to get this all out and share it with *someone*. I could use some affirming words. And I would take advice, I'm sure I'm not the first person here to experience this and I won't be the last.We all have mental health issues of some sort that manifest in different ways. 

I’ve accepted that my partner has issues with feeling hopeless, overwhelmed, fearful of the world, low self confidence. This manifests in many ways from lack of helping themselves to sometimes being negative with me. 

Therapy is on the table though progress is slow. To me, one of the benefits of being poly is that I don’t have to get everything from one partner so it’s ok for this partner to be struggling for now. We own a home together and have many plans for a shared life together. 

Has anyone else been here and how have you managed all this ?Hello lovely Reddit poly friends,

My primary partner of three years abruptly broke up with me a few days ago. I am devastated, heartbroken, and confused. We had been polyamorous for about eight months prior to the breakup, though I don’t think that us seeing other people was the reason for our relationship falling apart. The cracks were already there. 

I am unsure of how to navigate my feelings of hurt and sadness while still having these other connections. In the past, when I’ve gone through heartbreak, I have relied on casual sex and outside validation to make myself feel better. However, I’ve grown a lot since my last big breakup, and don’t really feel like I need that anymore. I’m struggling with knowing how to move forward, with myself and with my other partners. Part of me thinks I should be alone for a while, as this was the person I’d imagined spending the rest of my life with. Another part of me knows that leaning into other meaningful connections could be beautiful and healing during this difficult time. 

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you navigate it? 

TLDR: My primary partner of three years broke up with me. How did you move through major heartbreak while still having connections with other people?So, first of all pretty new poly here. I'm a 23 y/o male and my fiance is 24 y/o female. Bare with me.. this is a long one.

So, my fiance and I have together for 2 years nearly and we have dated before in highschool and remained close after that. Been pretty confident she is my soul mate for quite some time now and I love this woman more than anything. At some point in our relationship she told me she has been poly for most of her adulthood, which was not a big shock to me, I was already pretty aware of this as we were close and I am pretty familiar with her dating life. She also told me I didn't have to be poly if I didn't want to and if I wasn't going to be then she wouldn't either. Also cool, I believe her when tells me I am enough for her and I feel the same about her. However, I was pretty open to poly because I trust her immensely. 

Fast forward a bit we discussed waiting until we were married before getting into that upon her request. So I agreed. Our wedding was only a couple of months away. However, this was after I had already started sort of talking with another young woman (F19). I was a little surprised about this considering how much we had discussed poly so much and defined it together and made sure we were on the same page about how we would practice ethical polyamory. Not only this, but basicly everyone we know sees us as poly because that was something we wanted known and we were open about it so no one in our circles would be confused or shocked or anything like that. But none the less this woman was to be my nesting partner and our bond and happiness was of top priority. 

Well, she and the new girl were also starting to hit it off as friends but not as partners, which was cool. We all hung out together, go out to eat together, and she comes by the house some nights. One , night she comes over and sat very close to me to show us something because my fiance and I were cuddling on the couch. When she finished showing us she said "Okay let me move im all over your fiance" and my significant other responded by telling her it was okay and she didn't mind because she herself isn't normally cuddly and it was the most touch I had gotten all week.... soooo she stayed and got comfortable and I basically had one of em on one side and one on the other. Cool. That's all that happened. 

Soooooo now, now I'm like okay. Something here has shifted. So, I started asking her if she was okay with that sort of thing with new girl and she kept saying yes. Okay cool. "Can I take this woman on dates and stuff, is that okay?" Followed by "yes". Soon our wedding gets postponed because we both had a lot of family get sick so now it's a few more months away. So, again I ask a few more times for confirmation, "you're okay with another person touching me or going all the way and you're okay with me pursuing this woman" followed by "yes, I trust you"

Okay, now I might just be a dumb idiot, but I take this as a green light none the less. New girl comes over last night.. we all start watching a movie and my fiance decided she was tired because it was pretty late and she had work the next morning so she went to bed. I went to cuddle up with new girl while we finished the movie and when I walked her out last night I asked her permission to kiss her. 

I go to bed, fiance is still awake and obviously upset. I start to ask her whats up.. she keeps telling me she is fine but was visibly not so. Soooo after about 2 hours she finally tells me that she is upset because the last time we discussed this we were going to wait until we were married to start beinf polyamorius and im just stumped because I was getting a different vibe for like months now. She tells me that she basically feels like I cheated on her despite full transparency or what I thought was full transparency and for some reason she felt like if she had not asked if new girl and I did anything I wouldn't have told her about the cuddling and the kiss. Which was definitely not true because I was excited to tell her because we been talking about this so much but I was going to tell her the next day because I knew she been trying to sleep for the last couple of hours and when I first went to bed I said her name and got no response so I thought she was asleep to begin with. Now, she feels awful because she says that she doesn't know if she feels more sick about what I had done or more sick of herself for wanting to comfort me because now I was hurt. Idk what to do... idk what to say... idk how to make it right. I just feel like a total moron...

Edit: a few grammar and spelling errors fixedI have a lot to express regarding poly, but I'll try to be brief.  I am am early 30s man who entered into poly with my wife of 5 years in the past few months. It was a strange start with me not being the proposer of poly, but I agreed it could be fun. My wife and I are very sexually open together, and have regularly practiced varying degrees of BDSM and have a good sex life.

Recently I have a new partner I have been seeing for 3 months. We really get along, are very open and communicative, and are mentally together. However, I've noticed I'm struggling sexually.  My wife and I work great together. Sex can be once every few days, once per day, or even 2 to 3 times based on energy.  With my new partner, I struggle to really get into it. Some days I have very intense guilt after, and some none at all. It seems very hard for me to get out of my head that my partner wants this for me, and that I'm not doing something wrong as she is married. 

It just feels different and getting into the mood, sexually performing, and finishing seem to be hard. I don't think there's a physical or arousal aspect from my partner, so this must be the only thing.  This has caused me a lot of mental fatigue. I'm worried I'm going to get jaded by poly, be unsuccessful with all future partners, and that this is going to affect my marriage and eventually sex with my wife.  Any ideas?About a year about I posted my warning story / confession / written therapy where I spoke to a wonderful triad I had ruined through my poor treatment of my partners. Original link here: [How Icarus flew too close to the sun](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/lc3rzd/how_icarus_flew_too_close_to_the_sun_the_moral_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)


The next day, I followed up with a response to some particular rough critics and an update after having a very raw, candid conversation with my wife. That link is here: [Icarus Continued](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/ld2cmg/icarus_continued_your_comments_responded_to_and/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Today, I just wanted to share an update on where we all stand.

Our partner has never engaged with us again. I tried to reach out a few times, each time with a longer period in between and in a more friendly manner than romantic. She clearly doesn’t want to be involved with me, or us. That still hurts a lot. A lot. I understand that we have long since gone our own ways but I really wish we could have just one more good, positive conversation. I’m really, deeply sorry about how I treated her. I wish she were happy with me, but ultimately I just want her to be happy, healthy, and safe. (Edit: since this seems not to be clear, it has been years since I have reached out to her. Please stop accusing me of continuing to do so. It’s simply not accurate.)

My wife and I have continued to see our couple’s counselor every week. She is a wonderful help, with a deep understanding of poly relationships. While I also did DBT, EMDR for a few years and still do weekly general therapy, our couple’s counselor is the most helpful. Mental health work isn’t remotely optional for me, nor is our couple’s work. It’s a core part of this new era in our lives.

I continue to work on myself, my mental health, my communication skills, and focus on the needs of my family first. It’s helped tremendously as a parent, as a husband, and even in my work. There have been conflicts, and there have been arguments. Notably, we spent several months in conflict over our daughter’s college application process - but the root of that issue wasn’t the actual process or where she should or should not go. It’s always about the same general things: shared values, respect, and effective communication. 

Now, a year later, we are still together. We are healthier in many ways than before all of this. I committed to self improvement and to stop acting selfishly and I haven’t backed away from that commitment at all. The scars of all of this will always be there, but we’re doing pretty well. This summer, we will be moving to a new state to be closer to her aging parents, buying a new home (yes, this is the worst time possible to be a buyer), she’s starting a new job, and I’m continuing to expand my non-profit while our daughter heads off to college. The skills we’ve worked on for so long are clearly evident in our house hunting. We’re able to identify what is important to each of us, we discuss points of conflict, and we balance advocating for what each of us really wants against compromising to make sure we’re both happy. 

What hasn’t happened is a return to polyamory for either of us, together or separately. We’ve made progress in terms of trust and intimacy, but it’s never returned to how it was before. And I’ve never stopped thinking about how wonderful things were for a while, and the life we could all have had together. She’s never forgotten the pain. We’re constantly vigilant. And one end, not one single day has passed where I haven’t thought of our partner, or us as a whole, and felt deep sorrow and regret. I’m looking forward to my first day of peace from that, but after several years, I’m not sure that’s ever going to happen. 

This isn’t a brag piece or a relationship flex. What I do hope is that my continuing story can serve others who aren’t getting it right. You can. You can make terrible mistakes in your past but that does not mean you will always make those same mistakes. You can learn. You can rebuild. You can improve. You can be happy with what you have, even while being sad about what you don’t. You can even figure out a way to make a mono-poly relationship work. 

But it takes work. Consistent, hard, ruthlessly honest work. You can’t give up on the people you really love if you want to make things right, or as right as they can be. And you may need to make some pretty significant compromises or sacrifices. 

For me, putting off my own desire for poly relationships is the right choice. We occasionally discuss it in therapy, but I’ve made it clear that I am prioritizing my wife and children first. We need to get right, and I need to get right, for a sustained period of time before I consider connecting with someone new again. The desire to do so has never left me. I believe some people “are” poly. It is part of who I am. But just like people make choices to engage in certain types of relationships, I’ve chosen not to until such a time when we are as healthy as we need to be. Maybe that’s another year. Maybe it’s another 5. 

For everyone out there looking for happiness and fulfillment, and meaningful, healthy connection, I truly wish you the very of luck. It’s out there, and it’s worth everything it takes to find it.Just want to get this off my chest, it's been bothering me since it happened but it's gotten better. So not that long ago about 3 weeks ago me and one of my partners broke up. I mean it hurt and I can understand why it they needed to do it. What bothers me is they are still with my other partner, I mean to be fair they where dating before and have been together. So I cant be totally irritated by it. But the thing that bothers me is since we broke up the one I'm still dating has talked to me to me less it seems. I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid or what but it's been bothering me. Sorry im just ranting and will probably delete this soon I just wanted to get it off my chest.Tl:dr new to polyamory, a welcomed change in life but still figuring out how to navigate new emotions and freedoms as well as navigating a full change in my own world view in ways.

My partner (F26) and I (m30) have had a change in our previously mainly heterosexual relationship recently to being polyamorous. At the moment she already has other people interested in being with her (some who were poly to begin with).  

I had previously to this questioned if in may be polyamorous and my partner had came out to ke as being poly at new years. We had a shared encounter with a mutual friend which confirmed for myself that yes, I am somewhere on the poly spectrum.. 

I do not know how to fully navigate the feelings that come with watching her have new encounters while I feel like I'm at the starting line having been a usually shy guy to begin with except for people who truly caught my eye or mind.I was open with my recent boyfriend from the beginning that I was exploring non-monogamy and from pretty early on that I was also seeing someone else. He told me he had been poly in the past but has over the course of our relationship shared that he hates the idea of me being with other people. We have agreed on me sharing with him when I'm with someone and nothing more. Our agreements are that I tell him as soon as I know so that he can arrange his coping mechanisms. However, he got really upset when I told him about my plans (after checking with him about when he would like to receive said info!) and I felt that he blamed me for not being more conscientious of 'timing' even though he explicitly said yes when I asked him if it was okay to share at that time. We love each other and we are trying to figure this out and I also feel like I'm being made to feel guilty about being non-monogamous when he knew that from the beginning. How do I talk to him about this and/or any tips for us to have a conversation about communication agreements? DADT is not an option for me.Hey!

I realize this might not be the exact right place to ask this but I’ve been lurking for a while and you guys seem to have good emotional intelligence, and I’m not sure where else I’d ask.

I and a person I’ve been good friends with for several years recently started sleeping together. It’s going well, and we have great communication, but we’ve both agreed that while we care about each other we don’t want to date as we’re both healing from some stuff and it wouldn’t be a great time for us right now. 

My question is, if and when feelings do crop up, how can we manage them in a kind and ethical manner while respecting the boundaries we’ve set up around romantic entanglement? We really care about each other and while this is really nice neither of us wants to date and we also don’t want to sacrifice the great friendship we had before we started having sex.

Is this just unrealistic? We communicate very well and we usually feel safe sharing where we’re at emotionally, even if things get uncomfortable for a minute. I’m just afraid one or both of us will get too invested and that jealousy will crop up when one of us meets someone else, which is likely and fine. Any tips?

Thanks in advance!My girlfriend left me today...she told me she couldnt stand the sight of me. I was told that she pretty much keeps me hostage... emotional abuse... she is a recovering addict... my therapist told me that addicts will use people to get what they want...and will even manipulate the situation to their benefit.... what do you all think?? (We are/were in a throuple)Ok so the online dating world... Currently chatting to someone and told them I am poly just so they know I currently have a partner and all is consensual and they came back saying they're not really looking for anything serious. Which I am totally fine with as well, but does saying you're poly often come on like you're looking for serious relationships? 

I am worried if this came on too strong

Also kind of think it's ok as she said she doesn't judge as long as it's all consensual... I just said wicked let's get that drink! So I think it's all good, just wondering if other have the same worriesI have been reading a lot recently and have read quite a few lesbian poly books on Wattpad. I would love to read some more, but I can’t find many that are all women. If you guys have any recommendations for sites, wattpad books, tags to search (#gxgxg, #polyamory, etc.), or anything else, they would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!I have been in an ENM relationship for the better part of the past year. It was pretty tough at first but things are getting a bit smoother now, although they are still challenging.

I tend to have very short-lived relationships with other men. they usually die down after a couple of visits. I mostly see single men who are (probably) not poly and they seem to keep a distance from me emotionally, which I understand but really dislike. I understand that if I want a real relationship with someone, I need to date a "real" poly person. 

Nevertheless, I met a guy less than a week ago and I hit it off with him. I am kind of obsessed. I believe I am experiencing NRE, I mean I don't know much about him. My nesting partner has been having a hard time with it, understandably so. 

The thing is, I don't want to scare the new guy off and I want him to stick around. At the same time, I want to be honest with my feelings. I want to tell him much I love the sound of his laugh, the way he looks at me, how his smile is the most charming one I've ever seen, and that I miss him sometimes during the day ...

I feel like I can't express vulnerability in words because then the person will probably take off, especially because they're not inherently poly and I am in a long-term relationship. 

This creates a lot of limitations for me. On ther other hand, I know I'm asking for trouble here a little bit... 

Any way, I was wondering if there is any advice out there in terms of how I can navigate this. 

I know I need to be more mindful of my obsession and go with the flow. Maybe not talk about these things with the new guy, unless the moment seems right when we're together. 

I just wish the new people I meet weren't afraid of falling for me since I'm already in a relationship. I mean, they're free to pursue other relationships where they escalate more traditionally. But all things considered, they don't have to set expectations for our relationship.

Am I asking for too much? Do you think this is a conversation to be had at some point with a new person? If so, how and at what point would I bring this up? I don't want to put pressure on people or come off as too strong. But I also don't like suppressing myself at all.How do you distinguish between feelings that are products of years of forced heteronormativity and should be challenged vs feelings of discomfort or hesitation that shouldn’t be ignored?I (f) recently posted looking for some advice about my girlfriend’s dynamic with her husband. It was made clear (thanks to y’all) that they recently put in place a one penis policy (seemingly put in place by the husband, but I plan to talk with them about it in detail in the near future). 

I would like to follow up with a question that I can’t seem to find a clear answer to: are there any inherent issues that a OPP between my GF and her husband could cause between ME and my GF? 

Like, I really don’t like the idea of an OPP, and it makes me feel pretty yucky, but in the end are there consequences that this could have solely between my GF and me that I’m not seeing? Or is it mostly just limiting her options for partners, and will not affect hers and my relationship at all?

The idea of being any part of this dynamic just makes me feel very uneasy, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. 

Thanks again for your help!My fiance (26nb) and I (31m) are both Pan and Poly. We have eachother as our primary and she is talking to a guy as a potential BF. I have been looking around for a while to see if I might be able to find a partner. Unfortunately I have been having 0 luck. I have a social media presence that garners me a lot of attention from all kinds of people. When it comes to talking to anyone, the typical response is that they just want to get in my pants and ghost me when I don't deliver, or they show interest until it comes time to try and actually meet up and then ghost me. I honestly don't know what I am doing wrong. I am honest with everyone. I don't keep anything from my partner. Yet, I am left sitting here with nothing to show for my efforts.

Is it typical for guys to have a difficult time seeking partners in the poly lifestyle?I know that “come out”
Is a bad way to word it, but honestly.... it’s been a long day and my brain hurts. I mean no offense, nor do I mean to sound ignorant. Me sleepy. 

Point of my post is this; as my partner and I have ventured further into this new relationship arrangement, I’ve felt the urge to open up to people close to me about being in a healthy, satisfying poly dynamic. Problem? I’m absolutely surrounded my mononormitivity. It’s not an urge in the sense that I NEED it to feel validated.. more so that I am proud of where I am, and want to be an advocate for non monogamy, and displace the misconceptions around it in the form of being a positive influence.

I also dread explaining it to my family and friends, who I know will be judgmental, even if they have good intentions. 

My ultimate question is this; how do you folks manage telling those close to you, and essentially pulling off the bandaid and being more in the open with your arrangement?

I should note; I have no feelings of shame or guilt in being poly. It’s amazing and it works for me. Nor do I feel any obligation to anyone else to explain anything. It’s purely that I just don’t feel like the conversations, because I feel like I know how they will go, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m keeping myself in the shadows. 

Thanks guys! Happy Wednesday. 

My boyfriend and I dated a couple for about 7 months last year. Their relationship ended up becoming pretty toxic so we decided to take a step back and eventually told them we didn’t want to continue. They were noticeably upset but didn’t argue or try to change our mind. HOWEVER. They’re an active part of our friend group. Especially mine. I have a little group of girlfriends that I see a couple times a month. I adore them, they’re wonderful ladies, but I met them through my ex girlfriend before we dated. So seeing her is unavoidable. It’s usually fine and friendly, but she gets drunk and will just openly grope me and hit on me. She’ll say ‘I know you miss me’ and I have to constantly reject her. It’s freaking exhausting. Well a couple weeks ago my boyfriend and I went to a holiday party and she was there. Her, I and all the girls are hanging out in the basement and low and behold, she starts telling everyone she is gonna f\*ck me. I politely tell her no and our friends tell her to chill and she gets defensive. She says that she’s not a creep and she only does it for male attention. That I’m beautiful and interesting and sexy, but she’s not gay. That she’s not attracted to me. She said ‘I don’t want to hurt your feelings but what we had between us didn’t mean anything to me’. One of our friends told her that was mean and to knock it off. It wasn’t really of use because she was so hammered. I didn’t say much back cause that’s mortifying and it was so public. It also seemed obvious that she felt rejected and was lashing out. It still bugs me though. 

When the four of us were dating, I really liked her. Like a lot. Her and I probably had the closest connection beyond my boyfriend and I.   It was joked about and generally accepted in the group that if our foursome dynamic didn’t work out, her and I would always be in love. She was so affectionate with me, but she was wishy washy. That was another factor is ending our relationship. She’d be all over me and then sometimes she would act like I didn’t exist. She’s tell me she was so into me and never wanted to lose me and then she’d make jabs about my personality or try to get people to laugh at my expense about how ‘gay’ I am. I knew it needed to end. I don’t deal with that kind of treatment. I didn’t hate her for it, but she obviously had demons to sort out. 

She’s crazy hot. Like it’s unreal. Probably one of the most physically attractive people I’ve ever met, so she gets a lot of attention. Never rejected. I am almost certain she said all that out of insecurity in being rejected, but Jesus. It really hurt my feelings. A lot and it still does. Just wanted to share this experience with people that don’t know her to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: My ex girlfriend told our me she was only ever with me for attention in front of all our friends after I politely asked her to stop trying to sleep with me. What do you all think about Joey's comments about polyamory recently?

Edit to add quote:

"I want two [wives]," he said before claiming to have a few girlfriends living in separate houses right now. He also said that he doesn't want his two families to intermingle-- he wants them to coexist but not live together. "They will have to be cool with each other, they'll have to be able to call each other if they wanna get down like that. But it's not a requirement," he said. He added that he could "potentially" see himself having two families in the same city but since he likes to be bicoastal, he would prefer having one in New York and the other in Los Angeles.

Second edit:

[It's obvious most of y'all don't know who he is, here is a link to the interview.](https://youtu.be/wDzou1ClQmQ)Just wanted to pick the brains of all you fine poly folks out there! 
For simplicity's sake, all choices assume that all partners are open and honest about their sexual history, and are honest about all results even if proof is not necessarily required.

Any additional input is most welcome, comment or dm me.

Thanks!!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/sd9qh8)It's one of the few roles in society where, e.g. buying a custom multi-heart necklace with multiple people's names/birthstones/etc. is 100% acceptable! There are some great "Mother's Day" ring designs that just scream polyamory to me too! Now you know the secret. ;-)I see this come up so often, I wanted to just talk about this as a problem I am *about* to have happen.


I see this *all the time* in this sub, where a partner treats a meta poorly, and then OP is posting about their *surprise* that partner is now treating them poorly. 

Metas are not our enemies. We aren't in competition with them.

My partner just canceled on his date tomorrow (!) with his meta (already agreed and planned) because he has decided "spending time with me is more important". 

Now, my selfish side of my nature wants to bathe in that approval. Mono-normativity has taught me all my life that that is the kind of shit I should seek from my partners.

But in reality, what does this mean? It means my partner isn't very good at keeping promises to people. It doesn't mean I am some special magical person. It doesn't mean that eventually he'll love me more than her or some shit?

All it means, is that my partner is happy to cancel and let people down. It means my partner is (potentially) not a good partner for me. It means I'm now re-considering our relationship.


Edit: so for those of you that need the closure - we spoke briefly on the phone. He is still going to see meta Wednesday, me Thursday. Our time will be much more limited - but if he wants to spend quality time with me, it has to be actual quality time. Not time stolen from someone else.

Enforcing boundaries is scary sometimes - what if we get rejected, are alone? But my point of this post is that *being alone is preferable to a partner treating you poorly*. And how partners treat metas is indicative of their actions - no matter what their words are saying. 

I'm sure we will rehash this issue again on Thursday, haah. 

Hopefully my way of dealing with what could be considered a "minor" issue, and some of the stories shared by others, gives some insight into how these "minor" issues can become back to bite us, and the best way we should cut them off before they begin.

If you're in my polycule, no matter your standing, we are extended family. We may not always get along, but you shouldn't be treated badly. We are on the same team after all.

Thanks everyone!Hello! New account because IRL acquaintances follow my regular one, and I'm going to discuss some more private info here \^\^ Also if any of the people involved read this -- hi, guys. I'm doing my research!!

I (F26) am friends with a polyamorous couple -- A (M30) and B (NB31). They live in another state than I do, and up until recently, the friendship was entirely online. I've known A longer, and we've had a flirtatious relationship (which everyone involved was aware of and comfortable with). I knew they were in a polyamorous marriage since the very beginning, and communication has always been very clear and considerate.

Recently, A came up to visit me in my state. We had discussed beforehand that things might happen, and happen they did. We like each other a whole, whole lot and had a wonderful time together. We had a few conversations about what our relationship was and what our 'next steps' are -- he knows I'm new to this and doesn't want to put too much expectation on me for now, but we do have plans to see each other in person again soon, including my staying with both A and B at their home for a few days.

B and I get along well and like each other, but I don't know them as well! We've had some fun conversations, and I really want to get to know them better (they have expressed a similar interest).

The part that I am not sure how to handle is -- I think B is very, very cute, and I really like their personality. A has told me that B also thinks I am cute, and may possibly be interested in me -- but has also indicated that that is between the two of us, and he is not the messenger, haha. He has said that my dating both of them would be rad and that he is totally down for it if it works out that way. 

My question is -- how do I navigate my growing friendship with B in a considerate way? I don't want to make them at all uncomfortable or make assumptions about what they're interested in. I have no game whatsoever and have no idea if it would be appropriate to be flirtatious at all.

I have up to this point only ever been in monogamous relationships.

If anyone has any advice at all on what the hell I'm doing... please fill me in!!I'm (F29) in a relationship (with M same age) that I guess I would describe for the moment as ENM, but I identify as poly. For some context, I'm quite new to the terms but not new to non monogamy and openly loving several different people in different ways/ not putting all my romantic and sexual needs on one person.
I am going on dates, mainly with women and Afab people, because I had been surrounded by cis het guys for a long phase of my life and I am interested in having meaningful (open to sexual and romantic) connections with new people. That's the emotional part.
Sexually, I am really into group sex and have hotwife fantasies, and I'm not sure how and whether I should combine my potential new connections to these sexual interests.
Any tips on how to navigate that dynamic? (NB I regularly match with couples on tinder, because that's something I am open to, but no major luck so far, and I would probably enjoy it more with people I'm close to.)Ive met this guy on tinder and ive really fallen for him. But he is straight out monogamous and I'm non monogamous.

I've told him, im not lookin for anything serious, tho I must confess it has taken a big turn. I'm very much in love with him and the only thing holding me back is the fact I can't see others. He have told me maybe someday he would be open for it, tho he can't see himself dating others than one person at a time unless it's for casual sex (only if he is single).  
Clearly I don't wanna force him in it, cuz ive experienced loss of good realtionship.  So idk at I should do at this point cuz I dont wanna hurt him or me.Hi everyone,

tl;dr:

* new poly relationship
* im a trans woman, theyre non binary
* i am scared about them having sex w men where it feels less like 'gay sex' and more like 'straight sex' and they are submissive/the sex is rough
* i worry (very irrationally) that they will leave me and will just want to be dominated by masculine men all the time and will see me as a 'failed man' or whatever
* I want to hear if anyone's felt this way or has had experiences like this

So I've only been polyam for about 6 months. And this is my first intentionally polyam relationship. I've had rly nice fwb and qpr, and tried to be open with one partner but it didn't really work. So this is really me doing poly properly, for the first time. I'd say I'm solo polyamorous, but I'm starting a relationship with someone who I really like, and who really likes me too. I'm a 27-year-old trans woman (trans commenters extra welcome!) and they are 23 and non-binary. They think I'm hot.

We've only been seeing each other for 3 months so things are early, we've both got strong feelings, and there's already been a bit of attachment-related drama. Because it's quite fast and has been a bit hectic for us both, I think I feel a little insecure, and I don't have that deep trust that you can get if you know someone for a bit longer (also I have an anxious attachment style but it doesn't show up toooo loudly). I just have this one trigger which I'm struggling with.

The issue is just a particular kind of fear, which seems like a jealousy. They are v horny, much hornier than I am, and have a lot of sex. I think this is great, it's part of why I like them a lot. Most of the sex I can imagine them having with others, I'm fine with. They're non-binary. They have told me that they like having different kinds of sex with different people, which is like, yes of course for sure, me too.

The jealousy, the fear, comes when I can imagine them taking a particular role, in a particular kind of sex. nsfw onwards: If I imagine them being quite submissive, and acting more feminine, with a bit of a gendered power imbalance, with a man, especially if there's like a bit of roughness and the vibe of the man "using" their body for pleasure, I get a horrible sinking feeling in my stomach. I feel like somehow I'm doomed. I have this terrible worry that somehow this masculine energy will feminize them and take away their agency over who they are, they will be 'owned' by this man, & maybe other men, and will hate me. It's like they'll go into the cult of cisheteropatriarchy and will never want me again. And it makes me feel awful and insecure.

I know this is a cognitive distortion. It's informed by all the horrible ideas I've got about gender & sexuality that have come from a lifetime of this weird society. I know it's really wrong, and irrational. I haven't talked to them about it in this level of detail, only that I have a bit of a trigger relating to them having sex with men who aren't queer.

When I think of them having really fun and intense sex with other people, with a dynamic that's more queer, and that I can imagine as more 'as equals', even if they're being submissive, I feel fine about it! I'm like, "Yes, get yours. Come also have sex with me sometime, but also do that and have fun!"

So this jealous fear, this distortion in my head, it kind of is a worry that somehow 'the worst' will happen. Everything that I hold close will be torn apart, I'm doomed. It's only with this one kind of sex, so it's probably not an issue with me being polyam. I think I can probably trace it to trauma about not being 'masculine enough' as a child and finding it hard to be loved, seeing myself as defective, trying to place myself in a 'male hierarchy' etc.

I'm currently in therapy and the trauma described above is something I've been trying to work on within myself. So maybe that is a path to healing this pain.

So I guess I'm asking:

1. is there anyone here who this resonates with, or has had similar feelings, especially around the whole "this person bottoms/is submissive for men so is owned by them" fear?
2. Or who has had trauma in their past which leads to particular kinds of jealousy, fear or insecurity in their relationships that seems similar to this?
3. Were you able to move past it, to worry about it less?my partner is polyam, and im monogamous (for now). im really struggling to internalize that my partner wanting to date other people doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. i’ve been feeling really insecure, especially since we’re long distance. 

anyone else in a mixed orientation relationship, do you have any advice for dealing with jealously and fear. no matter how many times my partner tells me him wanting to date others doesn’t me he doesn’t love me, i just can’t seem to internalize it. any advice on that?How do you handle (what seem to be) double standards? My partner told me that it “wasn’t their personality” to engage in super affectionate texting. (ie- one time I said they were the cutest thing I ever saw. & They said that made them uncomfortable). But with their other partner they engage in affectionate flattery (ie- effusive comments on the other partner’s social media posts).
This is an issue I’ve struggled with in other relationships and I’m curious how other people deal with double standards and avoid comparing yourself to others.Does anyone else feel like they want different sexual activities with different people? I find that what turns me on is so dependent on who I'm with. For example, how dominant or submissive I am. But also things that seem more random, like which spots on my body are more sensitive.Been best friends with a couple for years. They recently came out as bi and I realized I had feelings. We’ve been flirting more and more each time we hang out. I asked them if they would ever open their relationship without mentioning me. They said they might. Last weekend we got really handsy and danced together. They offered to kiss me but we were all drunk so I said no. This is a decision we should make sober. I am in love with them but I don’t want to mess up our friendship or their relationship. What do I do?My NP had a passionate love story while away on holidays..good for him. 
Except, she's 15 years younger than him, and psychologically seems to be the exact opposite of me. She's obviously hot AF (being 27 years old, 10 years younger than me and -guess what, she didn't bear her child), and seems to be spending the day posting photos on Instagram where her ass is dominating the scene, which is miles away from me as a behaviour. 
How do I reconcile this? We've talked about age gaps  and how in general it's not best practice to have such  a.gap, and he agrees. But what really burns is, how can he be attracted to THAT, and to me? It doesn't make sense.
My other partner is one of us. We have so much in common, and we often hang out together, we share the same values, interests, he helps us with taking care of our kid, he's part of the family basically. I don't understand..I feel sad. I don't feel ready to confront him on this right now, I would love some input from you wise people. 
Thanks in advance.I’m curious to read about how other polycules handle scheduling and informing nesting partners when their other partners will be at their house. If you have a nesting partner, how do the two of you let the other know when one of your other partners will be at the house (sleepover or just for the day/evening)? Do you let your nesting partner know in advance or not?

My current situation: This is how my NP and I handle it, but I’m curious other’s situations, as my nesting partner has recently brought up issues with what we do, but doesn’t have any suggestions for how to do things differently. My NP and I agreed to text each other when we know another partner will be coming to the house, as soon as we confirm they are coming. Then we add it to our shared calendar. I feel it’s common courtesy, when living with someone else, to let the other adult living in the household know when someone else will be at the home for courtesy purposes. Neither of us had ever said the other can’t have another partner over, so it isn’t asking permission, it’s simply the knowledge that when we get home, someone not always there will be there. My NP has voiced that they don’t understand why we need to let each other know someone else will be at the house, especially if it’s a last minute decision. My NP also voiced that if I already have plans on the calendar and I’m not planning to be home anyhow, they shouldn’t need to tell me their other partners will be at the house. I would still prefer a quick text letting me know and for it to go on the calendar so I don’t forget. Plans change sometimes and I may end up being home unexpectedly and would like to be able to check the calendar and see that my meta will be at the house when I get home. 

I’d like to hear how others handle this and thoughts and opinions on adjustments we can make.I'll start with a context so my question is on the last paragraph: this post is about me I'm 27F, my Fiancé 28M and my \*New\* Boyfriend 25F. I've been on a self discovery path for a at least 2 months (bad depression and high anxiety, realized I was on auto-pilot for the past 14 years, wasn't really myself). Long story short I'm in a long term relationship for 10 years now. We never were totally monogamous people me and my fiancé we had threesomes with a few people and often talked about polyamory and that we might be leaning more and more into this. It's been like that for like 7 years. Then we meet this guy. At first we talked to him, discovered tons of things in common with him, he's bisexual and all, my fiancé is not attracted to men but still is curious about them in a sex setting. We all are geeky, love video games etc...

Anyhow fast forward a few weeks and he comes home we have sex as a threesome it stays quite friendly we keep texting everyday I feel something is going on I talk to my fiancé about it and he's supporting me to go with me feelings sayin' he's totally fine with everything. He comes back to my house on my birthday in early January and we celebrate it. We have another threesome but the next morning my fiancé was already awake taking care of our daughter (we have a 4 years old) and me and the guy just talked and had some fun. He jokingly said that he feels like my second boyfriend, I laughed and said yeah kind of. We left it at that we got out of bed and started the day. 

I had a long talk with my fiancé about him. I never felt so in love with my fiancé but at the same time I was falling for the other guy. He was feeling really good with the situation as we conclude he was and will always be my main partner. 

Yesterday I went to his home and we had a lovely day/evening. We talked about the situation and he was really at ease with our situation and eager to see what path this will lead us all. He asked me out so technically we're dating.

&#x200B;

That's for the context. NOW. I'M A TERRIBLE LIAR, I hate lying to people, I'm very close to my parents and don't even know how much I was struggling the past years but I want to tell them about all this. I just don't know how! I'm pretty sure they know I'm not 100% straight (my brother is pan too so that's not a problem they're not homophobic). I'm just scared of their reaction with this new partner in my life. How did you guys "came out" and how did you presented a new partner to your family who doesn't know you're poly. I'm talking here ONLY about my parents. I'll eventually spread the word to my extended family but not now.going through a breakup with my (former) primary and realizing that a casual partner just wanted me for kink and sex, which honestly i should have predicted with them being 14 years older w two ex wives and a kid. 

i’ve got one remaining partner and a newly developing relationship. 

but i’m not sad or heartbroken? i loved my primary and honestly still have love for them, but i know that it was the best so we can maintain a friendship and if they want to rekindle things when they’re in a better place we can. 

mostly just kinda sad about no longer having people to just talk to and feel connected to anymore. getting back into the dating app thing might take me a minute even tho i just want those connections again.Update 1/26/22: My primary(dom) and I actually broke up last night because I came clean that I really want to give this a try and  he was like "yea in no way would I ever share a place with you" I'm not surprised by this. So that's that...

 BUT my other partner who is a bi sub said this living scenario would be very hot for him and also a dream!!! So here's hoping I got the first half figured out lolll

A BIG ty so far because I would've never even known my other partner would be interested in this if it wasn't for all the support and real talks I got on here <3

Hello all,

as I am exploring/connecting with others and myself I keep coming back to a "fantasy" I've had since I was about 12yo. I always thought it would be wonderful to live with two boyfriends. Specifically 2 bf's that are bi/heteroflexible (ideally switches or subs, I am a switch myself/domme leaning) and are into each other as well, but this wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker.  Dream the dream further... and I would want to live with both of them. And I would be 100% supportive of them seeing others as well!

I'm currently dating a sub and a dom (primary). The dom is absolutely not down with ever living with anyone else except for his primary partner and even tho I love him I have been thinking of breaking up with him due to his hard lines in the sand and other reasons...I also want to eventually adopt or foster but not for about 8 years.

ANYWHO any words of encouragement or real talks would be SO appreciated..TIAMy wife and I had been married right out of high school for about 8 years. About 6 years in, I came out as poly, and she said she was, too. We opened things up, and we each had a bf/gf, and we both realized that our marriage wasn't healthy for either of us, and we decided to get a divorce. Through the process, my gf found someone she really liked, and they decided to be monogamous. I was really happy for her, he is a great guy. But I went from having 2 partners to being single and living alone. Even worse when my love language is physical touch and I'm touch averse to most people. It's been good overall, I've been my own partner for almost 2 years now, and I've really grown as a person, but it's hard for a single male to find partners that are ok with poly, especially since I live in the Bible Belt.

Just a bit of a rant. I'm only out to a few people since most of my family is heavily conservative. Thank you for listening!You have a partner who has severe anxiety and isolates themself when they are stressed or scared. This partner loves you and makes it fairly clear but they also push you away when they're anxious. Sometimes it's on a weekly basis where they say something along the lines of "you deserve someone better" or "I'm not good enough" or "everyone would be happier if I wasn't around." They can be reassured but you know it will happen again.

What would you do with this relationship? Would you stick around or let them go the next time they try to run away?

Edit: This person has started therapy and has brought up these concerns to their therapist, however, it is still very early. They are actively trying. They've noticed cycles and patterns and are trying to make note of anything for their next session.    My husband and I have been monogamous for 15 years very happily. I have always loved the idea of having other women for him. I thought this was just a fetish but we both found it was great emotionally with all involved. Then, they went on their first date. I discovered I feel very insecure about my efforts in the relationship now that she is doing things to make him happy. It feels like jealousy and I've talked to my primary about it and asked him not to tell his secondary. It feels very weird how happy I am to see them together, sharing TikTok videos and hugging. We have all been together and I liked seeing that too. It's when they are on a date and I am not communicating with them (One of the rules is no interrupting when a primary and a secondary are on a date).
    I am looking for advice for sorting through these emotions.
    What have you and your partners established as far as what is curiosity about their relationship and what is prying?My hub went on a date — but didn’t tell the girl that he was married —or that he was poly/open relationship ! 

This feels icky and creepy to me but I don’t want to be judgmental— should I say anything or let it be ?

(For context, I have one girlfriend we are definitely in love , but she has also done threesome activities with my hub & me. — but he is looking for a girlfriend for himself so goes on random dates.  I am 100 on board with this — but I do not like his approach aka not being upfront to girls )

EDIT: my girl called him out on it and he said “not yet” meaning he plans to disclose to her —- but I feel like that is shitty to do to a single person if they are looking for monogamyOkay so I’m half using this to jot down my thoughts and half using this to seek advice on communicating my feelings to my partner. 

My partner and I are long distance right now as we’re both away on work. She has made a new friend while away that has expressed interest in her. She has decided to keep their relationship at a platonic level as her new friend “isn’t comfortable” with our relationship. This is fine and dandy with me however as of late whenever I call my partner and she’s spending time with this friend she runs into another room. At first I didn’t think anything of it but now it’s striking me as odd. She’s introduced me to all her other friends. We speak openly on the phone in front of them. She claims she does this because of her friend’s disapproval with our arrangement (ENM) but if that was really the case why is it only a problem when I’m present. I’ve tried telling my partner that I feel like I’m being hidden or excluded from her public life but she keeps dismissing me saying she’s just trying to make everyone comfortable. How do I explain to her that this situation is making me uncomfortable?  When I brought this up she said I was being rude even though I avoided “targeted language” and used “I statements.” Is my discomfort misguided? The two have been spending a lot of time together lately & I feel like she’s stopped communicating with me as much. I’d hate to assume the worst, (which I have a really bad habit of) but this feels off to me. 

TLDR: I feel my partner is hiding me from her friend who disapproves of our relationship. She says it’s for their comfort but it makes me feel uncomfortable. How do I express this concern? Is my concern unwarranted?A story I can laugh about now but honestly… it wasn’t great. 

Before we met we had a phone call. He told me A LOT and after nearly an hour I felt like I’d hosted a counselling sesh. May as well meet to be sure, I thought - maybe he was just nervous.

He opened the door to me and my mind started reconciling how different (older, unkempt) he seemed to his photos (smart, sharp). 

We started out looking at the ready meals he’d bought, and him asking me whether it’d be ok if we just ate them out of the foil boxes they cooked in. “Ohh… erm, let’s try plates!” I said. 

He complained how hard it was to transfer the food from the foil to the plates. “I’ll do it, just pass the spatula, no problem!”

He asked if I wanted him to open a bottle of wine for me, but that he doesn’t drink at all. “Oh a whole bottle for me? That’s kind but I’ll be ok thank you.”

His dinner conversation was about how many people he’d had sex with (too many to remember), the bondage dungeon behind the door to my left (jokes), what sort of things I like during sex (did I mention this was our first date?), his experineces in sex clubs (cool?), an ex who’d asked for a gang bang (because he had ‘contacts’), and how sexual compatibility was the No.1 key important thing he was looking for. Now I love sex with the right person/people and am not ashamed to discuss it, but this did not feel comfortable. “Yeah it’s important to be compatible for sure…” I said. 

We sat down in his lounge after dinner. He said it was great I was poly because he thought it’d be cool to call and say ‘hey I won’t be home tonight, I met a stranger and we’re going to hook up, k?’ I think my face betrayed my thoughts as I processed how this was not in fact what poly meant to me but how maybe that could be a facet of it to consider…

He talked about his previous marriage, and unprompted admitted he’d had an affair. He followed up by talking about how easy divorce was. “Oh…” I said. 

He talked about his business and how it was good but his clients were dickheads. But then reassured me he’d been selling used cars recently (and needed to sell his current one asap because there was something bug about to go wrong on it) and his other business interests (wheel’n’dealing) would pull in £10,000 before the end of next month if needed. He seemed proud.

He said he was ready for a child now. He wanted to be a dad because he wanted to ‘go to school plays and Christmas concerts and stuff’. He reassured me though, no woman necessary - he’d been hoping to get a one night stand pregnant and that she’d come back to tell him and just hand over the child. I’m not sure how I responded.

He closed his eyes and relaxed in his chair and I sat there twiddling my thumbs, thinking if there was anything our conversation had missed. “Best be going!” I said. 

He followed up with a text to say he LOVED my company but didn’t feel any electricity. I’m glad it didn’t work out and it was definitely a learning experience.

Edit: Totally forgot he also talked a lot about previous cocaine habit.Title pretty much says it all. I (28F) and my husband (29M) have talked about kids for a couple years now. I haven't been ready and he's really respectful of that. Recently I mentioned feeling more ready and he's really excited. But I'm also starting to question and worry about how it will effect my relationship with my other partner (M). We've been seeing each other less than a year but I could see it being long term - we recently said the L word to eachother! I don't want to lose this other partner, though he knows we're talking about kids and hasn't said anything negative about it. But I've read so many posts on how exhausting it can be to manage relationships while pregnant. And then of course I feel guilty for feeling this way, as I don't want to make my husband wait around forever just for fear of losing someone else. It's all just so confusing in my head! Any thoughts or opinions greatly appreciated 🙂Hoping to crowdsource a bit! Other than weddings and hand fasting, what are some ways to outwardly show your commitment to your partner(s)? Either ceremonies or symbols(like a ring or tattoo)This is a question for the more experienced people in the group! What style of poly is the one that you’ve found really works for you? If you’ve spent time experiencing different structures and styles, what’s the one that you have really stayed with?

Really interested to see if there’s any common threads about the type of relationship that tends to function best! While obviously acknowledging everyone is unique!Hi all! Just thought it would be a fun little prompt to see what everyone’s tentative Valentine’s Day plans are looking like for them and their respective partners/connections!

Today is me and my partners 2 year anniversary, and I believe he and his friend (potential partner) are planning on a ski trip for V-Day, and then in the evening we might meet up to cuddle and watch Will and Grace (our current obsession, such a fun, inclusive, somewhat poly sitcom)

Me and my boyfriend plan to leave work on Valentine’s Day early, and catch some good lighting for a little fun photo shoot in the park, and a picnic lunch/early dinner while watching the sunset.

What are you all planning? Do you try to see everyone on the same day so everyone feels included, or have you decided to divide and conquer and everyone has their Valentine’s partner matched up? Please share!So I (F40s) and husband (M also 40s) have been exploring the fantasy of poly (just in the contemplation stage right now). We have a strong relationship and are interested in taking it to the next level. What is your number one tip you wish you knew before you embarked on this journey?Me (nb 24) and my partner (f24) have been poly for a few years now. Until recently she has only tried to go after femme people which caused me no issue. Now she would like to pursue men. Which I have no problem with but now I am experiencing more jealousy than I have before and would like tips to process my jealousy so she can explore to her heart's content. I want to make it a smooth transition so I don't topple my own mental health from worry.Hi everyone.

I am editing this to remove my original post (and also a few of my replies to comments). The title and your replies will tell the story enough I think.

Why am I removing my original post? A few days ago I heard from my husband that a friend of his was asking him questions that made it clear they had read my post. My husband knows I've been active in this group, and we've been open with friends & family with our situation. But it felt disrespectful (my feelings -- he didn't express this) for me to publicly be sharing the inside workings of our relationship if people we know RL could discern it was about him/us.

The feedback I received from all of you was very helpful and I appreciate that all of you took the time to read, reflect back, and support. It's such a sign of the compassion and communication skills that is built into/grown (to some degree) by being poly. Truly, thank you all.  I will let this thread stand for now but might delete it entirely at some future point.

With gratitude, OPEdit: Thanks everyone for commenting! Just to clarify I do see how OPP is problematic (misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, restrictive and controlling) and don’t encourage it ever. I was thinking more of the motives we assign to people who suggest them (i was getting the sense a lot of people are demonized automatically for it). A lot of commenters outlined how a person doesn’t have to be terrible to have their insecurities influenced by isms etc, but it’s still true. Cool! I just don’t see a lot of people acknowledge that out loud, but I suppose everyone knows that implicitly even if it’s not said.

-

Let me start by saying I do not agree with OPP at all, it is definitely problematic and usually a crutch for partners who don’t want to do the work.

My issue though is why does everyone always seem to jump straight to your partner is queerphobic and doesn’t value queer relationships? I myself am a queer person in a queer relationship and I can see why someone might feel less threatened by an OPP even if the reasoning isn’t that sound.

As an AFAB person who leans more fem (not intentionally most of the time, i just look it unfortunately), I would feel much less desire to compare myself to my (trans man) partner’s other partners if they were AMAB or just a masc of center person, simply because I can then rationalize of course that’s a completely different person than me that my partner also likes. I don’t really have a coherent reason for this. My guess is the fact that I have been socialized to view other “women” as a threat to relationships, and also just the constant comparisons of myself to other fem adjacent people bc I am insecure. Similarly, my partner is much more comfortable with me dating vaginaed people rather than penis possessors bc of the insecurities that triggers for him as a trans man. We both recognize these insecurities. In fact, at first my partner said he didn’t want me to hook up with men before later retracting that statement bc he realized it wasn’t fair or appropriate.

Essentially why do we assume people disrespect same sex relationships if they want a OPP/OVP? What if they’re just insecure and wrongly believing this will alleviate that insecurity. Again, not advocating for them or practicing them. Just wondering why people ALWAYS seem to go straight to “homophobe!! misogynist!!”Me (24f) and my new partner D (28m) began dating on new years. We're in a long distance relationship with intent on meeting in person by the end of the summer. He has a partner B (26f) who he plans on marrying someday (he already refers to her as his wife), and she also has a boyfriend. I just got out of a toxic relationship less than six months ago, and was really hesitant to get into a relationship again, especially a poly one as I've mostly considered myself monogamous but open to polyamory. 

He's spent a lot of time doing what he's called "breaking down my walls" in order to help me become more comfortable and feel safe with him. It took a while but I finally agreed to be his girlfriend on new years. He's assured me on at least a dozen occasions that our relationship is just as important to him as his relationship with B, even though they've been together for years. He's also told me on multiple occasions that he'd like our relationship to be "for forever or until I don't want him anymore". I had a hard time believing this, but he's made me feel important and has done a good job communicating and creating a healthy relationship which has been a great contrast from the toxicity of my last one.

Except then things shifted yesterday. I'm best friends with my ex boyfriend (also from a long distance relationship) and he and I spend a lot of time together online, mostly playing video games. This led to a conversation where D asked if he should be worried that I'm hanging out with my ex so much, I told him no, of course not (which was strange considering he's told me he didn't mind me flirting or even sexting with other people "because we're poly"). He then asked why I and said ex broke up and I told him it was because there wasn't much hope for a real future for me and said ex (living together, white picket fence, blah, blah, blah) and his response was that there wasn't any chance I could ever live with him either because "he doesn't want his kids asking why his mistress lives in the guest room" (he then added that it's how others would see it, and that I'm his girlfriend not mistress), and that he didn't think polyamorous couples raised kids together, and that he didn't think living with his his wife and "this other girl" would be a good idea (again he said how others would see it). He went on to inform me that he doesn't expect to be together forever (even tho he's been saying forever since we met) and that B is "his person" and I need to find "My person" eventually. 

It took him literally weeks to convince me that he was in it for the long run and wanted to be committed (to the point where he'd asked me half a dozen times if I was ready to be his girlfriend before  I eventually said yes), and now it sounds like he sees this as temporary? I feel lied to. He's tried to get me to start a romantic relationship with B too (we're both bisexual and have slowly become friends) so we can be this "power throuple" (his words) but he expects me to just pack up and go when they're ready to have kids? I'm hurt and honestly don't know what to do. I want to work things out but I don't know if it's salvageable.I'm dipping my entire body back in the dating pool, and have a history of dating people with high levels of narcissistic traits. Due to this I may be hypersensitive to the usual "me me me" -ness of getting to know someone. Obviously there will be a certain amount of talking about yourself when you first meet someone, but what are some yellow flags you see as tipping points that someone is maybe just a little too self-centred? For now, I've made this list:

-Genuinely interested in me and my life, listens actively
-Isn't just waiting for me to finish talking to jump in with their story
-Remembers things I tell them and refers back to them later 

Anyone else have anything to add? I'm looking for my first poly relationship after years of being ENM only and want to make sure I'm not buying a ticket to NarcissistVille again.I (26F) have been dating M (26M) for six months and we recently had the "what are we" conversation. I knew early on that M tends towards polyamory. I tend towards monogamy, and he respected my wishes that he not see anyone or sleep with anyone else when we originally discussed this. When we had the "what are we" conversation this weekend, he brought up that he doesn't want to be monogamous forever. My initial reaction was horror, honestly, because I feel very strongly about him and I wasn't 100% sure I have the temperament to be with someone poly. Having read through this thread and some of the resources, I feel better about at least trying (once we have further conversations and strengthen our relationship). I want to discuss boundaries with him but I'm not sure where to start. Any advice?Hi guys, so I’m not poly myself but this seemed like the best place to get an honest opinion about this. My ex and I were together(monogamous) for several years, and I always got a weird feeling about the friendships he had with girls, he just would get too close with them and would say things that made it obvious he found them attractive, which made me uncomfortable. 
      He never cheated on me but he would get jealous over their boyfriends and things that made it obvious that he liked them even if he wouldn’t admit it. A close friend of ours admitted she’s poly and wants to be in a poly, and he started acting weird whenever it was mentioned. 
He behaved towards her in a way that made me jealous but didn’t stop, and eventually I ended up crying and asking him if he liked her. 
   He ended up admitting to me that he’s always wanted to be in a poly relationship, and he thinks he’d be at his happiest with two girlfriends. I asked if he could be happy in a mono relationship with just me and he admitted it was a big gamble and he wanted a poly with me and somebody else even more the more time went on. We had been together for years by that point, and I didn’t want to take that risk so we broke up. 
     I ended up dating again and he used dating apps as well. Somebody messaged him who was poly and he says he just wasn’t interested when he had the opportunity. He says that he knows now that he can be monogamous and he’d be happier with just me than being in a poly.
     My question is, can I believe that? I’m afraid that he really is poly and seeing that I was dating other people made him afraid so he thinks that way for now, but if we get back together he might revert back to wanting a poly to be “at his happiest.”
As poly people, what’s your opinion? Sorry if the formatting is weird, I’m on mobile. ThanksMy NP and I have been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 1. I just got together with my girlfriend in September. NP and GF get along great and NP really enjoys spending time with his "girlfriend in law". I'm just wondering how to approach planning a wedding without making GF feel like she is less important than NP because she gives me butterflies when I look at her and I don't want her to feel pushed away.As the title says, I am curious and looking to hear how people navigate boundaries or restrictions or preferences etc. with their other partners when there is a nesting partner.  

I know that there can be a pretty wide variety, and everyone has to find the way that works best for them, but for you.. 

How do you manage avoiding couple privilege issues in parallel when the nesting relationship does have priority because of things like house, kids, and finances?

How much do each partner realistically know about each other? 

What language do you use for boundaries, rules, limits, preferences? What's the language difference between something that doing is cheating and something that you'd rather your partner not do because it would hurt you?

What kind of rules are there about the hinge's interactions with non-nesting partners?  Specefic pregnancy/STI rules?  Limits on time or money spent?  Specefic acts reserved for them? 

What kind of reassurances help a nesting partner feel secure and comfortable, if they don't have or want other partners of their own? 

What does your parallel set up look like?I'm newly seeing someone and just found out that neither of us can host each other in our homes. I live with my sister, and he lives with his primary. Both of us are in tiny 1 bedroom NYC apartments.

I've been thinking about cute/sexy things to do outside our apartments and have been coming short. Any suggestions for what to do, other than waiting for one of our roommates to spend the night elsewhere?I (F, 30) recently began dating a couple (M 28, F 28) after chatting to them for a while on a dating app. It started as quite a sensual and fun endeavour - lots of fun dates and time spent eating beautiful food and staying at nice hotels and having a lot of wonderful fun sex. For the first month or so I really felt equally attracted to both of them and would identify as a bisexual so had no preconceived notions of being more drawn to one or the other. Occasionally I would be less attracted to one in a sexual circumstance but never felt like it was a big problem because it would ebb and flow and move into other territories where it would change again. By nature of their personalities, I am definitely more similar to the man - same taste in movies and music, similarly dressed, similar energy in terms of heart on our sleeve empath a little cosmic energy. The woman in the couple is so beautiful but more reserved and holds her cards closer but I feel like we have our own quiet yet beautiful bond where I know she loves me deeply. We began to start having dates solo and myself and the man started to do really mundane things or find excuses to when the woman was at work because we really enjoyed eachothers company - every time we hung out I felt us get closer and felt a friendship bond more than anything. One afternoon he was helping me with some errands and we came back to my house and I laid down on the couch in his arms. I felt an external force between us I’ve never felt before and I began to cry. He had tears in his eyes and we held eachother very very tightly. We didn’t name it until later on when he messaged me privately (we usually have a group chat that is the only means of communicating) and asked me if I felt it too. It felt cosmic and beyond us and I felt like incredibly excited but also incredibly afraid of what was happening. Since then we wild message eachother to talk about the feeling. Prior to this a week or so before we had all said we loved one another in a message but I didn’t feel like the love was this kind of love it was more that I felt exceptionally safe with them. But this was different, it felt like true love. The week went on and then we all attended an engagement with my family together. My brother and the man had a moment dancing to the band playing where I felt my brother understand completely what was happening. My brother approached me and asked if I was ok because he could tell something big was going on beyond us. Cut to yesterday after this happened and the last week or so of myself and the man trying to unpack and understand it. He came to visit me at my work and we looked in eachothers eyes and told one another we loved eachother. I have never felt a more true feeling. The problem is now where to go, what to do and how to lead with love. Tbis is my first polyanorous relationship although the boundaries were definitely that it was a triad rather than seperate relationships. When this started to blossom, I felt less attracted to the woman. I felt myself pulling away from her or feeling like I wished she wasn’t there and I could spend time with just him. I know these are human feelings but the advice I’m seeking is how to navigate these frankly unchartered waters in the best way that holds all of our hearts. He has spoken to her, he spoke to her as soon as he left seeing me in the flesh and telling me he loved me. I don’t feel as though there has been deceit but I feel incredibly guilty because I don’t know that I can continue as a three when I want to explore this love. It feels unfair on her. They have been a couple for 8 years and are very enmeshed and codependent. But my question is -will he be able to be brave and leave her? Is that even an option? At this pint in time I think he is very very confused, we all are. Do we speak about it together? One on one? Do I take time away from them? I feel absolutely nuts I don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice or even anecdotal anything please I would love to hear from you. Thanks so much.My situation is the following:

I have known my meta for longer than my nesting partner. NP and meta met through me and hit it off a few months back. NP is new to ethical non monogamy, meta and I are not.

NP and I talked quite a lot about expectations and the like before they decided to pursue the connection further and I feel like I communicated my desire to know how their relationship progresses. Meta and I are still talking, though a lot less than before. They had hinted that the two of them are have grown quite close, both emotionally and physically. From their messages I also strongly assumed that they were intimate with each other.

Thing is, my NP has barely mentioned anything about it. If they did, than because I have asked. All I know from my partner is that they kissed, and that they did try some manual sex. When I ask what they did after they met up it's pretty much always "Yea, we watched some netflix, had some food and cuddled."

I was feeling more and more frustrated by the fact that I asked my partner to keep me in the loop and they agreed enthusiastically, but I still know basically nothing about what's going on between them and my meta. When the frustration reached a point where it started to really affect me negatively, I talked to my partner about it.

So yesterday I asked whether they had sex and their answer was "Yes." I asked them if they planned on telling me this. And they said "I wanted to tell you about it, but I didn't know how". I asked when that was. "A while back, I don't remember when." I asked about what they were feeling and if they wanted to tell me about how the relationship is developing and the answer was "I don't reall know."

The conversation basically ended with me telling them that I kind of feel lied to by omission, even though I know I am not entitled to know about their sex life - I still felt like that would be something that I would have liked to be told based on our "keep me in the loop with what's happening between you to" talk before anything really happened. They said that it was late and they need to think about it and we went to sleep.

Over the past weeks, I have pretty much stopped talking to my meta about anything more than smalltalk, because I really don't want to hear about anything concerning them and my partner from meta first. I am sad about the loss of depth in our friendship.

My partner isn't the best communicator and I feel like they do want to do the right thing and are a little too overwhelmed don't know how.

So the question I would like to ask you here: Am I asking for unreasonable stuff? Am I just creating unneccessary drama? Any tips on how to improve the situation?

Edit 2:

After thinking about what you pointed out in the comments I figured that a lot of my discomfort came from a difference in what my expectations are and what my partner was willing to offer.

I guess that I just assumed that they would like to share things in the same way that I do (talk about this kind of stuff exitedly and openly), while they don't.

I am a curious and talkative person, so just because I like to offer up information and like to hear about it doesn't mean my partners need to communicate the same way and I should not be expecting it and feel hurt by them not doing that.

And I will talk to my partner about this, to mitigate any kind of damage I might have caused with my, frankly very nosy questions.

Thanks for putting these things into perspective for me!I see many of you struggling and complaining about trying to find a bisexual individual to join your relationship. Really, a lot of it comes down to mathematical percentages and probabilities, along with some toxic/controlling mindsets. 

Think about this: you're likely a newly polyam couple with a bisexual wife, that's a really common scenario so clearly there's a lot of bisexual women in the polyam community. But, most of those bisexual women are already in relationships with someone and they're looking for an additional bisexual woman (like you and your wife are) Now, if all these couples were willing to just simply switch bisexual members back and forth (ie your wife would be another couples girlfriend and someone else's wife would be the girlfriend of you and your wife) then it would solve a lot these issues. But, unfortunately, most couples want their bisexual girlfriend to be single and only date them, and they especially have a problem with their wife or their newly acquired girlfriend having sex with another penis, and so, even though there's an overabundance of bisexual women in the polyam community, there's not nearly enough single bisexual women to go around ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯Hey all,

So I’m going to try and keep this to the point as much as possible. Trying to get some feedback on my situation.

My boyfriend and I are a relatively new couple, though we’ve known each other for decades. When we began our relationship we discussed being open right off the bat, and how that would work for us. Now the time has come to implement things! Exciting!!!

But I’m confused/concerned/something on a point; my bf has had an open sexual relationship with his ex wife for 20 years. He’s been single for 10 years and dating but nothing serious until I came into the picture. Now I know he is serious with me, he’s even offered to be monogamous if I wanted that which I don’t. He has asked if I would like to join them sometime, which I’m open to but have reservations. I’m not attracted to her, and I don’t know her at all. She’s definitely attracted to me, and would like this to happen… but I just feel like it’s kinda scary to walk into an existing 20 year relationship. What if something bad happens and it causes issues with their children? I would hate to be the cause of that, I adore the kids :)

Anyway. Initially he was not interested in having any kind of MMF sexual encounters, but said I was clear to do my own thing. He said there were only 2 people he would ever consider MMF sex with and one is married and monogamous so really just the one guy which is a friend of both of ours. 

Fast forward to us all hanging out together which happens a lot, and we are flirting because this guy is a huge flirt… it upset my bf at first until we talked about it and he was cool after that, I guess he wanted a heads up. But this friend apparently got into some trouble with another friend for sleeping with his wife (unclear of the situation there and how it played out). Since then, my bf says he does not want to have him be a part of our relationship in any way. Which is a bummer because he’s hella cute, we already know each other, and it would have been convenient, but my options are now down to 0.

So he asked again about his ex, and I explained my concerns and he was attentive, but also adamant that it wouldn’t be an issue at all. But I know it will come up again, because I’m concerned about possibly impacting the kids. 

How do I talk to him about this and explain that I feel like I have no options for multiple partner sex because he wants to involve only his ex, who he is comfortable with but nobody else? I really like him, and I want to learn the best way to navigate and communicate about these things together and would love some tips or insight. If you’ve made it this far, thank you I know it was a long read…

TIA!my partner (m23) and i (f25) have been dating for 6 months at the beginning of us talking i had mentioned briefly that i am very interested in being in a polyamorous relationship, since it has not been brought up. it has been on my mind heavy lately as i still am very interested in that, i am curious on how to approach my partner about this without them feeling as something is wrong with them. any tips would be very appreciatedI (23f) met my boyfriend (29m) in August 2019. He was my boss at the time. I heard that he was married, but I never saw him wear a wedding ring or mention his wife. He invited me over to his client’s house (who he was dog sitting for) and told me he was poly and that his wife knew everything. We hooked up and have been dating ever since. 

The pandemic started like 6 months later, so him and his wife were stuck at their home. So whenever I wanted to hang out with him, she was there. It was good for a while- we would play games, watch movies, etc. I cuddled with them and slept in the bed one night, but the wife is straight and was never interested in me romantically. 

At this time (March 2020) he was still in love with his wife and sexually active with her. Fall 2020ish, he tells me that he’s not in love with the wife anymore and they haven’t kissed or had sex in months. He says they’re only roommates now and that him and I are “monogamous”. I talked to wife about the topic very vaguely and she is still very much in love with him and never wants to leave him. 

I moved a few states away for grad school in August. I really wanted him to come with me but he refused. He says he likes his house and job, and he doesn’t ever want to divorce wife because “it’s easier” to stay together. He says he would ideally live alone if money permitted (he makes like $70k a year and lives in the Midwest tho so I think it is possible).

ALSO, he still keeps me a secret from everyone in his life. He came to my family Christmas this year, but I’ve hung out with his family and friends MANY times and he lies to them every time. I’ve met wife’s parents and siblings (kind forced into that situation) and he lied to them. Bf and I have been on many vacations and he’s lied to everyone about what he’s doing.

Last month, wife got a bf for the first time. However, I saw her text him saying “is it okay if I stay at x’s house? if you’re not okay with it then I’ll come home”. Why would she say that if she’s only “roommates with her husband” and my bf is mono with me?

Basically, I just want a normal relationship where I can cohabitate with a partner, be open, be normal around his family, etc. I don’t care if he sleeps with other people but honestly, I want to be the primary partner.

Summary- He says we’re in a mono relationship but doesn’t want to tell his fam, separate from wife, stop living with wife, etc (apparently ever). It’s been 2.5 years. Thoughts?I'm new here.. please be kind, I'm learning. I have some experience in ENM, just want to say that. But I'm beginning to re-discover that part of my life and do it differently (better) this time. Anyway. Is there a term for meeting someone you're interested in who has never been in a poly relationship before, but is open to learning more and trying it out? Have you ever met someone like this and "successfully" (for lack of a better word) helped them into a poly relationship with you? is there a word for this? Are there any good resources, articles on how to do this? Thanks :DI am new to Poly and I met someone, that describes himself as poly. In the beginning, everything was fine, he was also meeting new people but I didn't experience any jealousy.

Now he has a new partner, whom I have already met. They are constantly posting pictures together and now I do experience jealousy. I feel unloved, unwanted, and just like...shit. 

I didn't realize until then, how bad my own self-image is. I started to distance myself from him, because why would he want to hang out with me when there is a much more beautiful, younger, and smarter girl in the picture? (I know that this is bullshit but my inner voice is telling me that).

I also deleted my social media account and basically, I just want to crawl in my bed and disappear forever.

How do I overcome this? Self-Affirmation?So my husband and I are new to this lifestyle and to where he has not found a partner, I have. My partner is also married with children. My question is for other Poly couples with children... How do you handle that? How did you introduce it? Have you found alot of issues with it with your kids? Or school? Or Social settings for them? Or Do you leave them ignorant to it? Thanks all!I've recently entered my first poly relationship with a girl who has been with her gf for 2 years as well as possible other partners. I only know about the gf so far. 

Because I'm new for her, am I the secondary priority for her? we've known each other since 2019 and previously have had FWB relationship and says she loves me. 

She barely texts me, unless I text her first and she might reply hours later. Is this normal? I can already feel elements of jealousy which I'm learning to deal with. 

Should I address this or just roll with it? 

btw she is my only current partner in my life.I need some advice or outlook on my situation from fellow poly folks. So I (21F) am dating my partner we will call M (also 21F). We are both poly and each other’s primary partners. I currently don’t have any other partners but M has 2 boyfriends and another girlfriend. While with M’s girlfriend that we will call K (20F) M just doesn’t acknowledge me at all it feels like. While they sit together and laugh and take pics together and do each other’s makeup I’m left alone and feel like I don’t even exist. This doesn’t happen when we are with the 2 male partners. Only with K. I obviously don’t mind M dating others cuz that’s how our poly dynamic works but when I am asked by M to hang out with K and her it’s almost as if it’s for nothing. I’m just there for food and gas money. Any help/tips?Hey so I had a conversation with all my partners since I last asked a question on here and just felt like giving a little update. Things have been going real good, been on a few dates with the guy and girl I’m seeing and my friend with benefits is enjoying seeing how happy I am with them. Aside from her we all send each other good morning and good night texts. Things have been really nice over all :)Firstly I’m very new to trying to understand the world of polyamory as I have friends who are poly and I’m trying to learn more to be supportive of them. I’ve only recently learned about the one penis policy and am trying to understand better. Is it possible that there could be a valid reason for a one penis policy that isn’t toxic? Like for example my two friends (M and F) who have been together for a very long time recently opened up there relationship to another F so that that she could further explore her sexuality and emotional relationship with women. My understanding was that when they did this the reason for opening there relationship and becoming poly was so she could explore her sexuality with women. One time it came up in conversation that he isn’t super keen on the idea of her seeing other men in there relationship as that wasn’t really the idea behind why they opened up(I think it might also just be other people separately but I’m unsure). Is this wrong on his part even if this was what they had agreed upon in the beginning? I believe they are only trying to see the one girl and seem quite happy with the closed triad (I believe is the right term), so I guess what I’m asking is, is this different then an OPP or would this be the same thing and accepted so long as they both agree on it? I’m curious because I’ve seen a couple posts about how  bad they are and how they can be problematic for new relationships forming if they choose to in the future?My wife (23) and I (26) are exploring our options as far as becoming a three parent family unit. We have had a very, very good relationship with a friend in the past, and it did not simply revolve around sex either. In fact, we only had sex one time and spent most of our time just being a really cohesive unit. We lived in different cities though, and my wife and I never made the move to ask if she wanted to make things a more permanent relationship. 

Now, we are starting to believe that, after having a child, horses/farm, school, and careers of our own, the three person dynamic makes the most sense romantically, practically, and economically. Our ideal situation would be to bring in a mature woman wanting kids or a single mother with one child. This allows for everyone to always have some form of childcare, whether it’s dad (me) taking care of the kids or one of the moms. There’s many things that simply require two people to accomplish. 

Additionally, we both would love another child in our lives, but my wife absolutely does not want to physically carry and deliver another. That’s why we are open to adopting, being parents to the child of a single mother, or to me fathering the child for whoever joins us. 

We travel a lot, and it’s always so much better when there are three of us. I have a huuuuuge personality, so I’m bouncing off the walls most of the time, and it’s more fun for my wife when she has someone to make fun of me with. We’ve also noticed in the past that three person dynamics help to make decisions democratically through majority rule. My wife and I are very practical people so we respect majority rule, even when it’s not in one of ours favor. 

I know most throuple relationships are toxic and ego driven. That’s simply not us nor what we want. Again, we’re very practical people who are also beaming with love. The only reason we’re not open to a male is because we tried sexually with another couple, and the mere sight of another penis physically made me flaccid and unable to continue lol. I have nothing against the idea, it’s just physically I’m not wired to be aroused around males. 

So with all that being said, we are really wanting to talk to a current, stable, healthy, and successful throuple to find out how things work for them. Preferably, we’re looking for other folks who are more economically/socially successful. Nothing against the hippie/crystals folks, it’s just that not who we are. We own and train horses, flip real estate, are involved in city politics etc. So we’re really looking for folks of like mind to seek knowledge from.Hello, so I’ve been lurking here for a while. Reading all the different posts and such has really made me question myself. But it’s hard for me to accept because I for some reason have some negative feelings towards poly. I’m not sure why but I am kinda digging in to see what I can figure out. 

So I have a few questions to hopefully see if this helps me get a better understanding of this lifestyle:

1. How are you all dealing with the jealousy? I’m a very jealous person. Is that something that can be worked through? I also experience very large emotions. How do I manage that? 
2. How are you all scheduling multiple partners on top of every day schedules(kids and such)? I don’t understand….I have 2 kids and I couldn’t imagine balancing multiple other relationships on top of that. How do you do it? Is this something I can learn? 

I hope no one reads this and thinks im being an ass. I promise, these are honest questions and I am genuinely seeking a conversation. 

Anyways, I hope your day is well!A woman who showed interest in me through OLD turned out to be a unicorn hunter for her and her man. On the one hand I don't care much for the practice for all the usual reasons.

But on the other hand it's my first time as the unicorn, so I'm a little proud? Like my poly-ness might be considered a little more authentic now that I've been hunted. Seems dumb, but as a new person I am dismissed a lot, so I guess the validation is nice.

That is all.I don't want to talk publicly about this but if anyone's up for PM'ing me so I could get some Poly advise that would be graaaand! Thank you 😘Recently there's been so much drama and I (F31) just get that tired feeling. 

I keep being left by partners for a mono relationship they want to start with another partner. For clarity, I usually find partners through OLD, where I clearly state that I'm poly, only match with other poly people, and have long-ish talks about my and their definition of it before even the first date happens.

Recently, even J (nb29) who has been poly for many years (like me), started making noise about possibly giving in to their crushes wishes for mono in the throes  of NRE. 

I try to screen potential partners carefully but honestly, after them, I just feel so hopeless and keep wondering if I should just stay single or try to compromise and go mono.

If anybody has had the same experience or maybe worked their way out of this mindset, I'd be grateful for tips.I'm really curious about the arrangements people have in place, and what they expect from the different role players, when someone has a boundary against meeting their metas and then life happens.

What will happen when the hinge dies or has a medical emergency?

Edit: Thanks to all who replied, and my apologies for not engaging sooner. Most of you described situations where  your metas would be ok with communicating in an emergency, and I got no answers from the Refuse-to-ever-meet-a-meta folk. So I guess I will keep wondering and asking questions like these. There's so much hurt that happens to exacerbate already terrible experiences because people don't plan for them....and I was so happy to re-match and flirt like we were just meeting all over again!

This was my first time running into someone I'm already in a relationship with on a dating app, and it's such a fun experience! 10/10 would recommend.Ok so I will keep it as brief as possible.

I've been talking with someone who was new to poly, we'll call them PP (potential partner). My primary and I go out to dinner with them and their primary to talk things over. Things seem to go great.

We go on 3 or 4 dates. Things still seem to go great. I'm really starting to fall for this person.

Then they break up with me. I'm sad, but I'm still okay being friends and that's what they want, too. It seemed like poly just wasn't for them. Then over the rest of the year we fall into this huge gray area where we still like each other and still want to be intimate, but we don't want to label it and we just want things to naturally unfold. Our primaries don't quite understand why we are not labeling things, but they are on board with it. Cool, right?

Then 3 things happen pretty quick, all red flags.

The first happens when I invite PP over to a sleepover with friends during a party. We discuss well ahead of time that there will be nothing more than a cuddle at the very most. Also, my primary and I had laid down a boundary of no sex over at our place, plus we are not alone so we didn't think too much pda would be appropriate. At said party, in the middle of the night, *in the middle of the group of friends sleeping on the floor,* they try to get me to fuck them. Twice. My other friend on the couch actually asked me about it the next day because she was awake and could hear. I was going to talk to PP the next time we could hang out in person, but 2 more red flags before I get a real chance.

We cancel a hang out because we both don't feel well. Then they text me they are going to the ER. I am understandably concerned. I learn later that it's not an emergency. It's for a cough and a sore throat and to get a covid test. Their excuse was that their primary doctor was full that day and all the urgent care places were full. I smell bullshit.

The last red flag is that they go to a scratcher for a sleeve tattoo, and not only that, they go the *same evening that they went to the ER.* It turns out they test positive for covid.

I confront them about these, admittedly later than I could have. The last 2 flags happened while I was sick and I just didn't put 2 and 2 together. I go back through our correspondences and ask them questions about it to get further insight, then realize what happened and I got upset.

I confronted PP about these things. I told them I was upset with their *actions* because they were impulsive, inconsiderate to others on multiple levels (the ER thing), and they were unsafe choices. PP comes back at me with "my health is my problem not yours" and "don't you dare take this moment and this situation and try to justify what kind of a person I am because I am not a bad person and I have the biggest heart for other people."

I told PP they could fuck right off. I don't have the time or patience to explain how state health insurance isn't just a free thing to abuse, how to do basic homework before getting a tattoo, how if you're about to get married and you already have kids together then yes it does matter what you do with 'your' money, and how someone's health is **absolutely** my problem if they are trying to fuck me. IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.

Yep. I feel better. Thanks for listening!

**edit:** A few people seem to think that I came here for advice. I did not. Per flair, I came here solely to bitch and let off steam. That's all. While I do appreciate the opinions given because they help me look at it from a different perspective, I did not come here to gain sympathy, empathy, or the like, or to play victim or hero. Thank you.Hey all. Looking for advice on how I \[31M\] can talk to my partner \[27F\] about what is effectively a OVP in our open relationship.

We are not technically poly, as neither one of us is interested in long-term romantic relationships with other people. But I would put us somewhere between an open marriage and full polyamory. We look for casual dating/fwb with our outside partners (and are open and honest with everyone about that), and while yes we do occasionally have one night stands, we both strongly prefer an actual friendship/personal connection with the partner first. We would both enjoy finding long-term fwb-style outside partners that would be somewhere between a full boyfriend/girlfriend, but a bit more than a casual fling. Neither one of us has found that, but we are still looking.

We're both bi and are currently dating same-sex only. She was the one who suggested it first, and we opened up the relationship about three years ago. She pursued other women. I had the same freedom to do so with men, but for various reasons chose not to until last year. That was my choice and mine alone. She's been super encouraging and respectful in helping me come to terms with my own sexuality, and it means the world to me. I wouldn't be at this point of self-acceptance without her.

But, I've expressed a few times now that I'd be interested in trying threesomes/foursomes, and pursuing casual dating with opposite-sex partners too. She always promptly shuts it down. I understand where it comes from - I feel a lot of compersion for her when she meets a new girl, but a bit of healthy jealousy as well. If I'm being honest with myself, I probably would feel a bit more jealousy if she hooked up with another dude. But, that would be my problem to deal with it, and I'm sure I could deal with it healthily. I'm willing to let her try it because:

a. I don't control her or her actions

b. Fair is fair, and if I want to date other girls she should have the right to date other guys too

c. She's been seeing women for three years now. There's been a little healthy jealousy on my part, and some minor stumbles on her part. But she hasn't lied, concealed, or cheated once and has always been open & honest with me about who she's seeing or talking to. I don't see why it would be any different with a guy.

d. I trust her. End of story.

I've made all these points expressly clear to her. However, she has precisely zero interest in dating, hooking up with, or talking to another man right now. That's been her feeling and position for years and I don't think it's likely to change. Which is fine, if she doesn't wanna pursue guys and only wants to pursue girls, that's her choice. I'm certainly not going to push or force her to date people she's not interested in. I've made it clear that she would have my consent if she ever changed her mind, as long as I had the same, and we kept being open, honest and safe about who we're seeing (as we have been). But she doesn't want to do it, and she doesn't want me to pursue other women. Even though we're *technically* both still restricted to same-sex, I'd be willing to lift the restriction as soon as she is. So it's effectively a OVP.

She hasn't given me much of a clear reason for why she's against it, other than being uncomfortable and jealous. But, she's displayed precisely ZERO jealousy with my dating other men (in fact, she shows a ton of compersion).

I'm trying to think of effective ways to talk to her about this and at least try to understand her reasoning a bit better. If it comes from a place of insecurity and jealousy, then it's something we can work on. I really struggle to believe that it comes from a place of homophobia/minimizing same-sex relationships. She had multiple long-term girlfriends before me and was even engaged to one, her brother is gay, her uncle is gay and married, her boyfriend (me) is bi, and she has tons of queer friends & is active in the lgbt scene in our area. I can't believe that's where it comes from.

At the end of the day I won't do anything to jeopardize the relationship. I always respect all rules, restrictions and boundaries. I like being open very much, but if the choice is between closing up or losing the relationship, I would choose the relationship every time (as would she, and she's told me the same). So advice that consists of breaking up is not really an option.Sorry if it sounds a bit sour, but I'm not in a good mood.

So my NP and their gf have reconciled and slept together for the first time yesterday night and he spent the night. They both were pushing for a threesome with me before that but now the first thing they told me on the phone this morning is that we should have sex all 3 together.

The problem is, their relationship is already messy. NP spent the weekend heartbroken and now he is exctatic again. It's a rollercoaster and I don't know if throwing a threesome into the mix is a good idea. Am I overthinking this? They are so enthusiastic about this, I feel like a wet blanket.

Just to be clear, me and my NP date separately, but have had one occasional threesome.I had to have the talk to break things off after 10 months with a partner who has a nested partner of 2.5 years. I was envisioning an equal partnership, but they told me they weren’t able to provide that or even be able to date me. I feel hurt because I realize I may have just been a glorified FWB with a few more emotional benefits - if we’re not just friends, and we’re not partners, then what are we? (was the question I asked). 

In the end, I didn’t care about the label or the title. I cared more that I didn’t feel worthy of their full commitment, and that I felt our relationship was closeted. I cared that I was never a priority, despite asking for more intentional and proactive consideration of my needs. I cared that I put the work into understanding polyamory and how to handle metas, but neither the partner or the meta put the same kind of effort in.  

I told them I could not continue this without significant changes, so it wasn’t a complete break, but I think i know what their answer will be. It hurts because I let myself love fully and i feel so small and hurt right now.warning can't spell and spell check don't like me much!

All knowing wise one's of r/polyamory. I seek thy guidance in a time reality shifts, soul searching and reordering.

Things are ending. Things are about to begin. In the interim I find my self back tracking and reviewing. How did I grow? what have I learned? what needs fixing?
so here I am begging an audience. And expect to be tied to the pole and lashed for my transgression if you honorable folk think it necessary to learn the err of my ways. I have been accused of bad things in the past with a few words. And then later after a 30min diction told I am not that bad but my delivery and word choices need work.

Fetishizing; One: the way I look at the world I believe is different than most. to that end the things I find physically attractive are typically the things that are less common and in first contact situations I will see these first much like someone else noticing "nice butt". so yes I try to be good and not stare, but until I can start to get to know them that's what makes me want to know them. trouble is that I have learned that these seem to be Fetishized (excessive body hair, plus size, stocking/garters)

two: I did have a 1year V with too lovelies witch broke do to them not wanting poly. at that time the sex boundary was "I need to know if you have sexual contact with someone new and that it is safe sex. I would LIKE to know (with partners consent) what you do." I will concede that this for the most is a selfish request. But I also see it as a chance to "hear about there day, and try to learn more about them". And when I start dating again if there is nothing wrong with this I would like to again. 

yes I have read some of the more popular book, lurked in on you amazing people too learn more and rethink my way as much as I can. to find my flaws and fix them before they become a problem. How can I minimize or even eliminate the objectification with these things? Or do I just need to be drawn and quartered?I really just needadvice right now. My boyfriend of 4 months had to break it off with me because of his wife. Apparently she can’t handle him being in other serious relationships but has been trying to distract herself from it. He had to make a tough choice and chose to save his marriage and family. I completely understand but it doesn’t make it easier. I grew very attached to him and we talked every day since our first date. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep or do anything since we broke up and it’s tearing me up. I do have a nesting partner that has been helping me through it but he is also having some feelings of jealousy because he sees how much this other man meant to me. I want to beg and plead with this guy because I know he still loves me but I know that the choice has been made and I can’t fix it because it’s his wife’s problem. I just don’t know how to get past this…
Any ideas how I can get past this besides time?So for backstory gf had already come out to her parents as bi, then lesbian and then bi again in high school. Her dad did not take any of it well at all and their relationship has suffered greatly. Her mom was just kind of confused, a little distant at first but eventually came around. We are a ffm triad and have been together for almost 4 yrs. We all decided we weren't going to say anything to to our parents until we were done with college/financially independent. As far as her mom was concerned gf+bf were just roommates for the really cheap rent and we were all just really good friends. 

Her mom brought over dinner and it was super awkward trying to get the conversation started. Gf eventually kind of just blurted it out and answered a few questions that her mom asked. He mom just started laughing. 

She said "You \[gf\] look at them like a kid in a candy store and this one -points to me- can't even walk by you without you blushing. She's \[me\] better at hiding it than you two but you all just seem to randomly make googly eyes at each other."

We all just started laughing. We definitely thought we were playing it much cooler than that. After dinner we all kind of just talked and then individually bf and I had to tell her our intentions with her daughter. Honestly never thought that was a conversation that I would ever have. Our answers appeared to be satisfactory and I have apparently replaced gf as the new baby of the family, lol. I am so happy for my gf! Her closeness to her mom means so much to her.I’ve wanted to speak with you for some time. In all honesty, I haven’t been able to because of what my experience has been like on this side of polyamory. What I’ve needed to tend to my emotional and mental health has not aligned with my ideals, ethics, and hopes for this situation that we all found ourselves in. I would have hoped for more dialogue between us, trust if not friendship, and heaven forbid, even joy in shared love.


One thing you may not know is that I agreed to open my relationship with P under duress. By that point, we had both been navigating some differences in our relationship (mostly due to our attachment styles, I am anxious while P is avoidant.) We were working through this together in therapy when along came your confession–the perfect distraction from the issues at hand. P and I spent several months talking through what opening up our relationship for you two to begin dating would look like. There were a great many red flags for me, though the space, time, and the unknown that this new territory would provide felt hopeful in the face of doubt. We came up with parameters, but ultimately I agreed to something that my body refused and something that my present partnership could not sustain. As I mentioned in our one and only meeting, P is my family and when it comes to it, there is very little I will not try to protect and care for my family, even despite my own distress. However, I believe that ethical polyamory can only happen when all parties can commit with full-bodied, enthusiastic consent. Without this, what transpires cannot be called ethical. Even less when masking, deceit and omission begin to take place with regards to transparency  about the secondary relationship. 


I write to you to have some voice in a situation in which I have felt unrepresented and unable to have my feelings heard or received. I believe that a person should only enter into ethical non-monogamy with full transparency and knowledge of the existing relationship dynamic and my sense is that there is much you do not know. How could things have been different? At this point, I have no idea what comes next. What is left is a terrible mess and at least a few broken hearts. My best hope now is to find healing from this experience, that each of us finds healing, from where we are.Okay, I know rules are bad, blah blah blah, I get it, and my NP "Sally" (26f) and I (29m) are steadily trying to reform any remaining rules as boundaries and generally make our setup more feasible and less littered with landmines. Sally and I have been together 6 years, doing some kind of enm for 3. We practice hierarchical poly, but date solo. 

When we were starting to open up, we made the Rule that Sally would reserve the pet-name "master" for me, on the flip side I would reserve the name "princess" for her. (Actual pet-names have been changed). The rule was Sally's idea and she enthusiastically adopted it. The rule was more of a kinky rule than a poly one, if that makes sense; you have other partners but I'm your Master (tm). 

Recently we've been reading about rules vs. boundaries and as a result, gradually trying refrom things so they are more ethical and more likely to result in our success. To that end I brought up the rule in question, "hey, just checking in, are you still only calling me Master?" Her face fell and she got quiet for a second before responding "no". Turns out she pretty much never followed the rule and used the name liberally with other partners. I asked if it was just that she'd forgotten the rule but no, she hadn't. She used it knowingly and felt bad about it and continued to use it. She knew that it was a breach but never talked to me about it or asked for renegotiation. 

Now, on the surface, I really don't care. It was a dumb rule that I wasn't tied to particularly, it was a landmine waiting to cause friction, lesson learned about rules. 

But beneath that I have some genuine hurt. When she'd call me Master in bed, it'd give me that little hit of pleasure thinking that it was an signal about how special I am. Now I feel a fool, cause it turns out that it indicates no such thing. I still know in my brain that our sex IS special, but my heart is mad that it's not on the terms I thought it was. It also brings up questions about things where rules might actually be useful, eg barrier use. Can I trust her to use condoms and tell me if she doesn't?

When we were mono, she cheated on me, so it bring me right back to those feelings too, even if all that went down 5 years ago, it just brings back all kinds of trust issues I thought were buried.

I guess my question is how much should I care? Should we just scrap the rule and move on or is there more work we need to do to come back from this? I've toyed with leaning into the kink aspect of the rule, ie treat her as a brat who needs to be punished for "naughtiness" I'm sure she'd like this idea, but I'm unsure it'd actually help with the trust stuff I'm feeling, in fact it worries me that it'd incentivize breaking rules I actually DO care about.Hi, so I (28F) have been talking to / dating my GF (24NB) for nearly 2 months and it's been going really well. We talk all the time, make each other laugh, feel really relaxed together, the sex is incredible and our dates have been super fun. We're basically enjoying that new relationship honeymoon phase, but have also talked seriously about hopes and expectations for the longer term. Basically, that I am 100% comfortable with them living with their partner (F24?) and having any other relationships but that I will never be secondary to anyone else. Meanwhile, I don't have any plan to date anyone else but I enjoy sexual freedom and my right to sleep with whomever I choose.

I've not had any issues with jealousy, but I think I am maybe feeling a bit of resentment. My GF does almost everything at home for their partner and also works full time, meanwhile her partner is on long term sick and mostly plays video games all night. I feel like this is a bit of an unfair balance, but I haven't said anything as I don't want to cause conflict in another relationship.

Then I spoke a bit to their partner and we kinda (from my side) jokingly flirted, I'm a very sexual woman so it's natural for me to show a little butt and tease about being topped etc. I heard from my GF that their partner was very keen on dating me and forming a polycule. I said this was definitely a no go for me as I'm not interested in another relationship for a variety of reasons. They also felt the same that keeping things separate was better for now. They had a talk and I thought things were set, but then when I met their partner in person last week she had the impression it was a date. I made it clear I wanted to be friends only. I think this has now been understood, but it still feels like there is pressure from her to be in a triad one day.

Then yesterday I had to cancel my date plans with my GF because their partner didn't want us going to the cinema because of COVID. This was something we had planned and agreed together, I was on my way to buy tickets. I agreed to let it go and just watch a movie together at my place, but it feels a bit shitty that my meta is able to veto activities that my GF and I want to do.

I spoke to my GF on the phone and they mentioned how much they enjoy going out and doing things with me, because they never gets to go out or on dates with their partner. They say this is because she is introverted and has issues with getting tired due to health. I know I'm a lot more extroverted and enjoying going out, talking to friends, bars and clubs etc. I'm also aware that there is quite a large financial imbalance between myself (a career professional) and my meta. Part of me worries I'm causing strain or making her look bad just by doing what comes naturally.

This is my first time in a poly relationship and I want to make sure I navigate everything honestly, fairly and with goodwill to all parties. I don't want my GF feeling caught in the middle and like they are upsetting someone either way. I also don't want to out pressure on the existing relationship, especially while my GF sees me as new, exciting and all round rose tinted (as is natural early on). 

Any advice on how to handle my feelings would be appreciated.My Gf and I tried for an open relationship last year and to make it simple I did not take it very well. At the beginning it was very hard for me and I was swinging between a good and downright horrible mental state ever since. It has been three months now and I at least see some improvement overall.  


But the thing which just recently came up was that my gf actually emotionally cheated on me and used my good will and love. I agreed to try an open relationship bcs we talked about how it would be an addition to our relationship, nothing more. No necessity, nothing we could not get from each other. Just a bit fun if we are not together at this moment.  


When the day came for her to try it, I was struggling with the choice already, but I still gave her my blessings to do what she wanted. And ofc she did it. But not bcs to just try it so we could get it over with and assess if we both can and want it. No, she did it bcs she thought if she did not at least try it once she could maybe miss something. Because she in reality was not sure if this would be just an addition to her and she wanted to see exactly that. While this might be not that big of an issue for many people, it is so much for me. She, even if not on purpose, lied to me about her intentions. She was scared that I would get back on my word so she got the next best guy to at least have done it once.   


I really want to still have her in my life, but this thought haunts me to no end and makes dealing with the thought of her sleeping with someone else much more hard to handle. If this was really just for the sake of trying and not out of necessity and fear of missing out, I would be much better now.  


If anyone has a thought on how I can overcome this feeling, please share it with me. This post does not credit in the slightest how much she still means to me and what an amzing person she is otherwise. I want to hold on to that.Not for sure how I’ll phrase this without sounding too insecure (but I’ll fail anyway) 
Not pursuing my meta seems like a good choice for me atm. She currently has three other partners and said something was brewing between her friend and her friends NP. I dunno, I felt like I’m good enough? Eh, I’ll probably talk to her about it when the time comes. But til then, I’ll just refrain from flirting with her or making innuendos. We’ll just do casual talk. 

Just a little rant to get off my shoulders . I’m not mad at her. I’m mad at myself for the insecurities.So for context, I have a polycule currently. 3 women.

And am I the only one who absolutely hates it when something super romantic happens and you're getting those good intimate connection feeling... And then I remember we aren't allowed to marry... Ever. In 0 countries can we marry.

It's depressing, it's heartbreaking, if I were able bodied I'd rage not sure directed at what but I would.

But it's just so depressing and ruins the Wonderful romantic moments.

Does anyone else feel this way?
When will we have equal rights?

Edit: I know many don't care about it and I'm not looking to debate marriage with you guys so please try and not comment things like that that isn't what I'm talking about and it's super disheartening to come to a poly group looking for support about something that is clearly inequality and be hit will 20 versions of "yeah well I don't care so it's fine"

You may not care but others do, have some empathyHey so I've posted before and everyone has been very helpful. 

I am having trouble navigating my own emotions especially when it comes to jealousy. 

The situation: 

My partner and I are both 20. They are in New Zealand and I am in Scotland. We've been in an open relationship from the get go and boundaries have always been followed and respected. We have resolved issues in the past with respect and occasionally emotional but we are both young neurodivergent adults. So I think we have done the best we can. 

The issue???

They are talking to someone else. And well I'm getting jealous. It's not the first time they or I have talked to others. However this time the possible partner doesn't want to talk to me at all yet. I know it might require me to be patient. It doesn't help that I feel they're talking to this partner more which is fair they are new and that's all exciting but I just feel a little left out. I don't want to confront them about it just yet because I might have done something wrong or it is just something I need to process. 

Thanks for any help!!!Well, our communication dynamic suddenly changed a month ago. We’d talk everyday, specially as I was helping him get ready for job interviews and such. I helped him professionally and he supported me through my life changes. I felt good and connected. 


Then suddenly the texts get shorter, less inquisitive. And then silence. For a few days, then weeks.


I bring it up twice, as compassionately and as firm as possible. What’s going on? Should we adjust our communication expectations to reflect your new schedule? I initiated such conversations. 


He kept telling me he was just busy. 
I guess I just snapped at some point. No person is truly that busy. After probing, he finally told me he met someone and that “she’s taking his time”. 


I listened to everything he had to say but decided to break up at the end of the call. I just don’t want this kind of neglect, gaslighting, etc. 


But now i feel like maybe I was too harsh. I’ve had another serious partner for 4 years so I had the time to experience NRE and settle into a way of being present and committed to my partners. Maybe he needs that time too. I just don’t feel like doing the emotional labour… 


Am I a bad poly person?**TL;DR Gay couple I'm FWB with described their ideal thruple situation, description matched me exactly. Was too shy to mention it in the moment, IDK how to follow up.**

A little background, I'm a gay man, and I've been friends with benefits with another gay couple for about 9 months. We're actually friends too, and hang out pretty often just to do board games/dnd etc. I also get along really well with both of them individually, and end up hanging out/hooking up one-on-one too. I'm not actually sure if I'm romantically poly, but I think I might be.

Recently, I went to the local renaissance fair with them, and we ended up on the topic of relationships. They started talking about having a thruple relationship, and described what their ideal guy would be in that situation. They basically described me down to a T. I was worried it'd be too presumptions to mentioned it then, so I just followed along and let the topic pass.

Was this them signaling that they want to move on to something more with me? I'd really love to, and have been thinking about it for a little while. If so, how do I follow up on this, especially if it wasn't a signal for me?

Thank you for any advice you can provide!

Edit: Thank you for all the support and advice everyone :) I'm just going to bite the bullet and talk to them about it openly.Hi 👋

I have some concerns that I think are mine alone. So I turn to the internet for strangers their opinion. Me and my partner have dabled in some poly/non-mono experiences but have mostly been hybernating due to the pandemic and some health issues.

I'm part of a friend group in which everyone has dated outside the group (mostly mono folk). I always believed this to be important to avoid drama within the group. We are running strong as a group for 10+ years and I value the group highly. 

I have read many poly people in this sub have a preference for dating friends, some going as far as only dating friends. I get that it's easier, I also need a bond with someone before opening up and experiencing romantic feelings. Friendship before a relationship grows seems logical. However, I always disliked the idea of people dating among the friend group. I cringe at any sitcom like situations and fear the drama involved. Luckily for me until recently this had never happened. 

But now it did. My partner and I became friends with someone, they had a casual fling for awhile, and we introduced them to the group. It matched, now we are all friends. Great! They started something casual with a mono person in the group, and had a threesome with another couple in the group (a mono couple). So far no drama as I'm aware of.

I have some opinions on it. But they might be invalid. When I was dabbling in poly myself I exclusively focused on non-mono and poly people. Did not date within our (mono) friendgroup. I have this feeling I like my friends as friends and prefer if the group sees that the same way. But I don't want to control others, neither can I, and don't really know what to do with this feeling. 

Any opinions? Feedback?I’d love to hear your thoughts on what hinge partners should do to make sure they’re handling their role in their relationships as well as possible, not just in the obvious ways but in the subtler ways we might not consider as much, or in ways that only begin to emerge as important over the long term. (I’ve read, listened to, and really enjoyed the Multiamory podcast episode on being a good hinge already!)I'm (37f) recently divorced. I also recently started dating a coworker (32m) that is engaged (34f). 

We started off as seemingly innocent flirtation and then progressed to him confiding they are open. His fiancée doesn't want to know what he's doing at all, but she shares her details with him. 
We have been dating for almost a year now, but he recently moved out of state to get his Masters. He plans to move back after the two or so years it takes.  

Initially when we started dating it was supposed to be purely sex (he's had a few other friends). We then began to do actual dates, and the conversations we've had have been nothing less than amazing. We click like we were meant to be. 

He's also confided in me about their relationship that makes me feel he thinks it's mediocre. They are still planning to move forward, but I can't help but feel I get mixed signals when he tells me he imagines me as his wife, etc. I get so happy, but then he  says he's been clear all along and is marrying her. 

So I've brought it up to him and told him he confuses me. I agree that I never expected anything beyond sex. When he started expressing his feelings for me (which I truly believe and feel), it made me catch the feels too. So I told him that even though the initial expectations were low, our relationship has evolved. He even calls me his gf (except we have to hide everything we do from his fiancée). 

So am I wrong now wanting more? I don't want to be just a gf. I want to be his wife. 

For the record, I'm ok with him having fwb, but I want to be his wife and get the majority of his time.I am a 35 year old married man and my wife and I date separately. There is this one single mom that our kids play sports together and She is super fiiiinnnnnneeeee. She wears an ankle bracelet which turns me on every time I see it. I am struggling with how to approach her and we are not supposed to get involved with no one in the kids circle.Just looking for some advice or suggestions to address a partner who does not safely meet new people?

The scenario is that I have a partner who will connect with people through dating apps and talk for a few weeks and then when it is time to schedule meet up they do not let anyone know when they quite frequently changes details.

For example most recently they went to a group hiking event where they and someone new were going to meet, it was public and a group of 20+ people so no biggie there. After the event though they went somewhere else with the person on the other side of town and didn't let me, their nesting partner or anyone in the social circles know of the venue change.

Am I being unreasonable in asking for them to let someone know where they will be at for safety reasons? And so it's clear we're not talking about you stopped at Starbucks on the way home from the grocery store, we're talking about first time meet ups with new connections from a dating app.I’d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone on this subreddit for your patience, and knowledge, your expertise and experience, your encouragement and bluntness. 
It’s been about 4 months since my spouse began a relationship with their other partner, and wow it’s been a ride for me. But through it all I kept seeing you all guiding people like me away from the common pitfalls that so many other people have fallen into. 
I’m grateful for you all!I'm new to the poly thing and my girlfriend and romantic interest are both long distance. I wanna do date nights and such but don't want anyone left out. Any advice? I love this sub, but lately there has been a lot of heavy topics. while i'm really glad folks have a place to share experiences and get advice, sometimes it would be nice to jump to some lighter/funnier posts!

Would this sub ever consider adding a "meme" flair, or something along those lines?This is something I do and was wondering if I'm weird. I get facts about my partners mixed up. I do this with friends and family too, I'm just dumb. I have notes kept on my phone about facts and stuff of them. This has their favourite food, colour, and general stuff.Very short background for context

My husband and I have been on/off exploring poly and swinging for seven years. The last two has been mostly off in person due to Covid. Our last experience was one where we tried to date someone together for the first time and it ended horribly. long story short, lots of feelings hurt and boundaries pushed but we've had a lot of hard conversations since then and take it as a learning experience.

One of the things that was hard in that last relationship was that my husband gets NRE very hard and very fast and moves at lightning speed while I end up twiddling my thumbs. He and our ex were saying "I love you" and having overnights right off the bat while I was left asking when it was my turn to get to know her. I think we spent one afternoon together at best while they had many nights alone. 

So when that ended we decided that I would date separately and he was happy not dating for the time being. Fast forward, he found someone he bonded well with and thought he'd introduce us because he thought we'd get along great. And we do! 

But quickly again they started having overnights, long conversation, saying I love you, etc. Even though in our very first conversations we said we all wanted casual and no romantic attachments (she said she wasn't ready because she's still living with her ex and isn't emotionally available for it). 

So here I am again... Twiddling my thumbs. Having spent a total of like four hours with her alone, hardly getting any texts and when I do they're very platonic. Meanwhile they've moved at lightning speed and are on to the next level. They both sat down with me and agreed that they're moving too fast and want to slow it down, and she agreed that she wants to spend more time getting to know me. But that was a week ago and she has had a few opportunities to come over or go out with me but hasn't. 

Am I an asshole here for being so pissed and annoyed? Obviously this is only my side of the story and I'm sure they'd have different perspectives. But I'm so frustrated. 

And before anyone says it, I've clearly laid out my boundaries and they both know where I stand with everything. It's just feeling like... Why do I keep waiting around for people who clearly don't want to connect with me? Anyway! Thanks in advance 

Edit for typos and clarification. I keep telling them that have equality is not possible, but equity is. They work together and have spent a lot more time together. I'm not looking for an equal relationship because my needs and boundaries are different from either of theirs, but some equity from both of them would feel really nice.

Edited to also add that I am feeling used as a way for her to get to him. I feel like they used our relationship as a way to get to each other without being in secret. Since a lot of what I'm saying is being misunderstood I figured I should add that as well for more clarityHello, sorry I just need to vent a bit.

As title, I’m about to give birth in two weeks.
During my late pregnancy, I specifically communicated with my partner, not only in speech, also in writing, even through a therapist, that I need more care than usual. I need him to be present and considerate, and available to me. And I hope he could reduce his frequency on other dates.

Right now, this week he’s been staying out four nights in a week, and he refused to go with me to the latest prenatal visit. I’ve specifically told him that when he stays out two nights in a roll, it feels too much for me. But he’s done specifically this twice during this week. When I expressed my feelings to him, he threatened to block me on phone. Wow! So it means that when he’s staying out, I might go into labor and cannot reach him. How great is that!

I really feel that he’s not caring enough for me.
And I also feel that the two metamours are not considerate enough to leave us some space, knowing that our due date is near.

I am really afraid that my partner can’t be a good father figure for our baby.**Background/relationship setup**: I (23M) am currently in two relationships - one of 6 years with "Sam" (23nb) and one of 1 year with "Jack" (26M). Jack is also married to "Diane" (27F) who is the meta in question here. I don't really have any preference either way towards the different 'styles' of polyam, so when Jack told me Diane prefers to keep everything totally parallel and have as little to do with her metas as possible I was completely fine with it. 

**Issue**: As stated, I was under the impression that Diane and I were totally parallel with no overlap ever and as such, I know next to nothing about the woman. I have her phone number in case of Jack-related emergencies (he has some health issues that can be touch and go) and I know what she looks like, but that's about it. We aren't even Facebook friends. 

However, recently I found out that Diane talks about me. Like, a lot. By some astronomical coincidence, a friend of mine ended up working in the same place as Diane and she talks about me at work, apparently. My name, while pretty common in Russia where I'm originally from, is pretty rarely heard here in England (for the sake of this let's say it's Igor), so when Diane started talking about her husband Jack's "good friend" Igor, it didn't take much for my pal to put together like...she's Diane, who is married to Jack, who is closely involved with Igor...clearly it was me she was discussing lol. 

Thing is, it's not like she's talking shit about me or anything. She just knows things about me that she couldn't know off of her own back. For example a song would come on the system at their work and Diane would say "my husbands friend Igor really loves this band" or someone will be eating pineapple in the lunch room and she'll say "my husband's friend Igor is super allergic to pineapple but only realised when he was 20 and someone told him it isn't supposed to be spicy" or - the one that disturbed me most - they had a client with the same name as my Mama (very beautiful traditional Russian name) and she knew that it was my mother's name. Apparently it's a running joke among the colleagues that she talks about her husband's friend Igor more than she talks about her husband. 

Am I wrong in being creeped out by this? I know she must be asking Jack these things and he must be telling her because that's the only way she *could* know. It just doesn't sit right with me that she was very insistent on wanting no relationship whatsoever about me, but is also seemingly very invested in my life. Sam agrees to an extent, but also thinks it could just be her way of taking an interest in her husband's social life. I just don't know how to feel, and don't know if I should be confronting Jack about it. 

TIA.Throwaway account because I fucked up.

Hubby and I successfully opened up our marriage about half year ago. We thought it would be more casual, although we both soon realized that (he especially) would prefer a more parallel polyamorous set up. We've both had relative luck in this time frame, but no actual sex was had until this last weekend when I slept with a poly man I'd been talking to for several weeks.

As a couple our biggest concern were STIs. In the beginning we had a strict rule that anyone we sleep with must get an STI test first and then share their results with us. We realized later this was too hardcore and isn't what most anybody does. So then the rule was that we'd ask someone if they have any known STIs and when their last test was, but not ask to see results. We wanted to generally trust people, and obviously use protection for any PIV/A sex as well.

And I had sex with this guy and I didn't ask what his status was. We'd been talking for several weeks, but I didn't want to bring it up because you literally NEVER know if someone is going to be totally cool with it and give you all the details, or if someone is going to freak out that you would even ask and get all offended. LOGICALLY, why would you ever want to sleep with the latter, ever? And logically I know this. But I'm finding through this whole process that I have some insecurities and maybe some abandonment issues ("I don't want them to leave because of something I did/said"). I did bring it up with this guy at one point a couple weeks back however. We talked about condom use and I said that I also test for STIs like once or twice a year, to which he said he didn't test that often but that of course we would be safe. And that was good enough for ME. However, it was not good enough for my husband or our marriage or the boundaries we set. It was a clear violation.

So my husband asked me about this and I was honest with him and said I did not ask specifically if he had any STIs or the last time he was tested. And of course this was extremely hard on him and clearly devastated him. He said that he's not comfortable with me dating anymore (I had a date lined up this week with a different man) and that we should close our marriage for now. Obviously I do not want to do this, but I also know that I fucked up big time and do not want anything to happen to our marriage, because it's wonderful and I wouldn't want it to end.

I know this is going to require a lot of internal work on my end. I'm impulsive. I'm really bad with rules because I just tend to do whatever the fuck I want. Even with work, I'm like this. Don't wanna work this particular day? Fuck it. I'm not well disciplined. On the flip side of that I grew up in (basically) a cult where my every move was judged by church and god and I followed all the rules, and sacrificed my being and sexuality and soul to god/church/my parents every waking moment. Now that I've deconstructed from both faith and monogamy, it's been very difficult for me to live under any rules, even if I agreed to them and think they are completely logical. If I'm in the moment, I do what I want. And my husband says because of that he doesn't trust me right now. I told him nothing sexual would happen on my upcoming date with this other guy, mainly because I haven't seen him in months and because I'll be on my period, but he says he can't trust that. And honestly? He's not wrong, because I wouldn't trust me either.

Dude, I'm fucked up. And I completely fucked this up. Right before we had sex I could have just asked this guy "Oh hey, when was the last time you were tested for STIs?" and none of this shit would have happened. But, as my husband put it, I didn't care and just wanted some dick. I don't know, I'm sorry, any advice or insight would be appreciated. I don't think either of these guys would be too hard up if I bailed, I'm not in a relationship with any of them (though things were certainly moving that direction with the poly guy I slept with) but it's whatever I guess.

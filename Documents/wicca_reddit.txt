What an absolutely beautiful altar!!
love your matchbox lol
This is super well set up, i cant stop lookingg
Goals üò©
Lovely!! I have really limited space and my partner is supportive but not super into my craft taking up space, so I‚Äôm struggling to try to make something small but still special :-/
this is so cute!!!! the broom is a nice touch :)
That is an awesome altar!
I love that your table has five points! Was that intentional? Even so, it works wonderfully.

Edited to say: waaait, upon a second glance it seems I may have missed a point and also that I may have had a few glasses of wine. But still! Wo derful altar!
Good for you!  It looks great, and best wishes to you
This is gorgeous! When I‚Äôm depressed, it always centers me to organize my altar
Thank you all for the lovely comments ü•∞
Salt, bay leafs , lavender orange oil, thyme glove leafs and jasmine . My second one I ever made
I just read this book, it‚Äôs super informative and great for beginners
This author has a podcast The fat feminist witch.
Why the vape?
I can‚Äôt find stIIIzy stuff anywhere. Oh and the book looks promising. üå±
Thanks for another suggestion.
I thought this book was extremely basic, even for beginners. The ritual and spells were lackluster and uninspired, as well as the correspondences in the ritual and spellwork often canceling each other out. I was really excited for this book, and it is beautiful,  but I was disappointed by the content.
Why the vape? Lame-o...

Hope the book is good!
This is freaking awesome! I love it!
So cute!
Thank you for pointing this out. 

Astronomical full Moon on Samhain (October 31) would occur only about once every 29 years since the lunar cycle is about 29 1/2  days between full moons.   It would always be the 2nd full of October for the same reason.

If you observe an old pagan tradition that "Full moon lasts 3 days," then Samhain would happen during those 3 days about once every 10 years. Again, since October has 31 days and the lunar cycle is only about 29 days, it would always be the 2nd full moon of October.   

Daylight savings time sucks.  Changing our bodies and our sleep cycles always causes an increase in deaths, disruption of families, and economic losses.   Noon is when the SUN is highest in the sky.  Midnight is half way between dark and dawn, when the Full Moon is highest.
Can‚Äôt wait!
For those who are looking to cleanse, or just browsing through reddit late at night, don't forget the full moon is tonight, just like I did until a post on another site mentioned it, and I was reminded. A good thing too, my altar needed a cleaning anyhow.

Blessed be, and have a good full moon!I like to do quick candle spells, but don't like to use just plain oil when one isn't specified. So I came up with one that I feel is a good jack of all trades oil, to keep on hand.
 
Carrier oil (I use extra virgin olive oil)

Bay leaves: Protection, psychic powers, healing, purification, strength

Cinnamon: spirituality, success, healing, psychic power, protection, love

Rosemary: Protection, love, mental powers, purification, healing

Sage: wisdom, protection, wishes

Thyme: healing, love, purification, courage, psychic powersI was raised in a catholic household and culture, and I am having trouble accepting the figure of the Horned God. Although I understand this is a consequence of being brainwashed into associating horns with "Satan" and demons, I still can't seem to shake it off. 

Last night, as I celebrated a Yule ritual, I substituted a phrase in an incantation from "Horned God" to just "God". Seconds later, I accidentally kicked my representation of God outside the circle. This might merely be a coincidence, but it felt like a message of God being upset. 

I need to get past this and I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to overcome this irrational fear of the "Horned God".I did my first spell today! An empowerment spell. I lit three candles, sat outside, and successfully made a circle! I felt really connected to my chakras and energy, and brought Rose Quartz for confidence and peace, and I think it worked. I've been studying for years and am super proud of myself. I know it's only one spell but still. It's my firstI would love to hear people's traditions and celebrations since I am still trying to figure out mine. I'll have to celebrate with family which it will be very Christianity based, so I really want to privately celebrate.
Thanks for all and any input.I‚Äôll preface this by saying I‚Äôm a baby witch 
I went to my mums house from dinner and she had a friend over that I hadn‚Äôt met before. We had a connection instantly, we greeted each other like we‚Äôd always know one another and as soon as we hugged I felt like I was safe. I had such a strong feeling I needed to tell her I was Wiccan so as soon as we were alone I told her and she got tears in her eyes and said ‚ÄúI knew we had a connection, I felt it as soon as I saw you‚Äù. Ahhhh it was such a wonderful experience. I never met another witch before ü§ç 
I hope that I‚Äôll be blessed enough for her to share any of the 50 years of knowledge she has with me. Unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt talk about it tonight without a Christian man telling us we‚Äôre ‚Äúplaying with evil‚Äù 

I hope you all have a blessed week ü§çü§çOk so it's 3 very odd questions two relate to each other. So anyways.
Question 1: I found this site that basically gives you pdfs of different books like a summoning spirits and a demon bible etc. Does anyone have any reading suggestions of where I should start? [PDF WEBPAGE](http://www.sacred-magick.com/PDF.php?cid=18&sort=3&page=7)

Weird question 2: I had rose water in my sacred space and usually it lasts for a long time. I had it up there for a max of 2 days and mold had gotten to it. Which has never happened before. What do yall think it is?

Also 3rd weird question: I've been hearing my name spoken even when I'm alone. Birds have been slamming into my window repeatedly since the hearing voices has came. I also see weird small figures in my garden/in the house. I have a suspicion it's the fae but have no clue. Please I need someone incite on this.

[https://discord.gg/rrXEJHA](https://discord.gg/rrXEJHA)I had a dream where a man , dark hair - dark eyes stuble in furs ( also dark ) came up to me and said ‚Äú I am a norse god find me ‚Äú and then I woke up , I see his face sometimes in my mind and was wondering if there‚Äôs a way to figure out who it is[god ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750841544264777728/824845301302820924/image0.jpg)our anniversary is coming up and over the last couple years my wife has been reading up and practicing. I'm all for it, though I will say I don't exactly understand all of it so please forgive me if I misrepresent something in my explanation here. I'm trying to surprise her so I don't want to be asking a bunch of specific questions right before our anniversary. 

From what I understand she is a Hearth Witch, though I have heard her use the terms White Witch, and Kitchen Witch in passing but I'm not sure if that was an identify motif or not.  

Honestly I feel like an ass for not knowing this stuff in the exact terms now that I am writing it out, please don't roast me right now. I'm trying to be better. 

Anyway I want to get her some supplies or useful things for her craft. She already has a really nice book for spell work so that is kind of redundant for now. I was thinking more along the lines of things she would actually need for spell work? Whatever those supplies might be? The best example I could give of what I'm getting at is when I pray I use a mix of sage and tobacco and another blend called K'Nick that was handed down to me from my grandfather. 

Google searches are flooded with tongue in cheek BS and I want to get her something that she will actually be able to use not just a novelty t-shirt.

TLDR: My wife is a witch, what should I get her for our anniversary that isn't generic as all hell.My wife is looking to get into Wicca, I‚Äôm also looking to dabble in it, but not as much interest in it just yet compared to my wife. How could o help her get started with her path into Wicca. Where do you even start because Wicca seems a little more diverse than the religions I do know. (Active atheist for now). Please help me to help her üòä ty all.Hey, so i'm not Wiccan or anything, i am though into spirituality/meditation and do some spell work of my own. And the other night i had some struggle falling asleep, because of some conflicting thoughts and feelings. And how to put this... Whenever i would focus on certainty and calmness(to help me fall asleep) this image of a large dark bodied figure with a deer skull and kind of goat'ish legs would appear in my mind. And the thing is it didn't feel creepy or scary(as such an image would make people feel) it felt ancient and 'that of nature'. So today i googled up some deer skull gods and found this Wiccan horned god(as well as Pan and Cernunnos). So do you guys think there's some meaning or anything in the horned god showing themselves in my mind like this?Hello all. I am currently 25 weeks pregnant and due in February. My previous pregnancy and labor was awful and both my son and I almost didn't survive. Because of that, I am terrified of labor again. I am wanting to make a bag/sack of herbs and crystals for relieving stress and promoting positive energy, but I don't know where to start or if there is anything to avoid for the baby. Thank you!Okay, so I am Wiccan. I have a 3 year old pitbull named Zeus that has followed me through some very hard parts of my life. I always knew he had some sort of connection. However, I just recently moved in with 3 other people who practice paganism to some degree, and we do lots of group spells, rituals, etc. kind of like a coven. Before I moved in with these people, I did notice that my dog always wanted to be very involved in my metaphysical work. And it seems now, that that‚Äôs really taken light now that I‚Äôm living in this new home. He either sits in our circle with us or sits off to the side and kind of observes. One of my roommates mentioned that he was my familiar. This is kind of a new concept to me seeing as I am still kind of a new witch. What other signs are there that my dog can be my familiar? I‚Äôm very intrigued by this, because my research dictates that a familiar is kind of like a spiritual protector or a guide and it seems like my dog has kind of served that purpose. 

I really noticed it the last time my roommates and I made a really huge crystal grid and meditated. We combined all of our crystals and went ham, and Zeus first sat off to the side and chilled and then eventually came to lay his head in my lap while I meditated. Some other really crazy metaphysical stuff happened that I won‚Äôt go into detail about. I‚Äôm just interested in hearing other people‚Äôs stories about finding their animal familiars.My name is Casopia, I am descendant of Romanian gypsies on my grandmother's side. Throughout every generation of our family, only one female ends up getting the green eye Gene. My mother was that of the last generation and I am now that of the next.
Since I can remember, I've found myself less interested in school and curriculum and more interested in getting myself happily lost in the woods searching for wildlife and rocks. I am extremely socially akward but for some reason I can read someone's emotions fairly clearly within a couple minutes of being around them. I'd much rather be around my animals than be around people in general. I lose myself in the world of Art and creation when Im forced to be in school. Wicca is practiced heavily throughout my family and it's always kind of been that family religion that I didn't have much interest in. Throughout my 18 years of life only now am I interested in what it's about. My grandmother told me that I should be connecting with other greenwich's whatever that means? I'd much rather die than try to find such type of people in person and embarrass myself so I found maybe I could reach out through platforms where I know there happened to be people that are interested in the same things without the gambling process. Lately I found myself questioning who I am and how I can know who I am or what I want to be, I was thinking maybe the family religion was the missing puzzle piece as I find myself drawn to the energy and happiness my grandmother held in her heart. So I guess here I am, hello nice to meet you.And does being a guy has a difference in practing these? TIALately at work I've been struggling with money, but that was mostly over the fact I seem to struggle financially during the summer every year. So today, under my patron deity's advice, I took my jade crystal with me to work today. My coworkers know I'm pagan, a couple ask me questions about my beliefs and I have no reason to hide it, so everyone is pretty cool with it. 

Not sure who dropped a crumpled up $10 bill but I found it on the ground by the registers, while me and my coworker were closing. Waited a while in case anyone would claim it, or ask if anyone had picked up some dropped money, but no one came forward. So... Thanking my patron and the crystal, I asked my coworker if she wanted to split it.

Now I have a $10 bill. Normally I'm just getting loose change, up to $2 a night at best. So this is nice. I really need to bring jade crystals to work with me more often üòÖI am a secret practitioner and I still live with my parents so I can't go and buy stuff, but I found some stones they aren't round or perfectly shaped but they are from nature with various rough shapes can I use them to make runes or does it have to be some proper cut stone thingy?I've been seeing people through the internet saying how you should cut sticks yourself, but would it still be acceptable if a certain stick speaks to me and I use if for my want instead?so both of us are fairly beginner witches & my friend just informed me she was gifted tarot cards. can anyone clarify what this may mean or signify? shes been seeing angel numbers recently also (5555,555&333)Cross posted for faster responses 

My daughter (11, not allowed to have a Reddit account). Is still finding her path but, identifies as a Cottage/Green witch. While out in the woods last week with a friend, they came across the skeleton of a deer and brought home the skull. Since then, my daughter has had multiple dreams, we believe to be messages asking for the return of the remains. 
We have discussed disturbing remains, done quite a bit of reading and have learned a lot from this. We would like to return the remains today. Are there any blessing or offerings of apology we can offer to help this deer find peace again? It is very important to my daughter to make the deer whole again and to do with her whole heart. She is my whole heart so it is equally important for me to be there and help the best I can. I am not Wiccan but I see and understand the connection she has to nature and googling just doesn‚Äôt seem good enough for this one. Please any advice or recommendations are welcome!!So as I said I've recently discovered Wicca and I'm genuinely interested by it. What would you all suggest I read to learn more?I was born and grew up in a modern city but my grandma was a known white witch in their province.The people in their province whos a victim of bad witches always came to her for help. She told me that my grandma blessed both of us for protection.My mother told me that she died because she suddenly sensed that time that people were trying to hurt my mom seriously and shes nervous because she cant do anything to help her since she's in the province. She slipped on the floor then hit her head. For now, I still believe my mom has her protection bcos until now, shit happens to any people with bad intentions to my mother. In my case, since I was young, I always experience these things I call "dream warnings" everytime some shit is about to go down. I tried to handle it with logic and if I didnt do anything about it, the exact same shit in my dream happens in real life. This is why I started believing on it and everytime I receive one, I'll be preparing for it and meet excellent results. My concern for now is I feel disturbing because I dont receive them anymore even extreme shits already happened and I was unprepared and helpless. Im just thinking: Does my grandma's gift(I presume) of dream warnings "expired"? Is there a way to "renew" it? Or is it even "renewable" in the first place? I want to be ahead against my problems again.I want my dream warnings back. Pls.help me guys.I was just wondering what the general consensus is on using casting resin in magical workings.  Up til now I've always tried to use all natural items in my craft but recently I've started having thoughts on crafting my own altar tools and wands using resin mixed with natural items. Just wondering if anyone uses and has had success using synthetic products like casting resin in their work? Any advice or personal knowledge and experience would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance.As a child I remember a teddy bear of mine talking to me a few times, I know that I was a child but I was a fairly sentient child and didn‚Äôt have many things like ‚Äúimaginary friends‚Äù and know I did not make this up. I‚Äôve been very into Wicca and feel like there could be an explanation but I just don‚Äôt know how to find it. This was not a dream though, the bear moved as it were a man talking, had a deep, firm, yet comforting voice. Hello friends. What are some books or items you would suggest for someone with a little background into to Wiccan origins and wanting to learn more?
I need some help purchasing birthday gifts for my daughter, 13. She has become very interested in the Wiccan practices over the past year or so. Her innate love and respect for nature is most likely the driving force behind her newfound interest and I‚Äôd really like to support her in this. 
There are so many websites and books out there, it‚Äôs hard to know what is authentic or where to even begin. 
I‚Äôd also like to apologize if any of my wording or phrasing is disrespectful or ignorant. I can honestly say that I probably know nothing about TRUE meaning of Wicca but would like to learn. So please feel free to correct me because if my daughter continues to pursue this path, I‚Äôd like her to feel respected as well!!Hello Wiccans of Reddit!

I'm a student at a Christian highschool. and I've been assigned a project to do research and present on another religion, and I am researching Wicca. It's very important to me to make sure that the information I'm reporting is completely factual, so I would love to reach out and make sure I'm getting accurate information. Please let me know if there's anyone willing to answer a few questions (listed below).

Thanks!

**In the context of your religion...**

**1. What is the nature of ultimate reality?**

**2. What is the nature of material reality?**

**3. What is a human being?**

**4. What happens to a person at death?**

**5. How can you know anything?**

**6. How do we know right and wrong?**

**7. What is the meaning of human history?**Long story short I am an atheist but she‚Äôs Wiccan and I want to get her something for her birthday coming up. She already has some crystals, and some stuff for her alter( not sure what) just need an idea of what to get her thank in advance üôÇHello all! I'm a relative newbie to (as well as a mostly solitary practitioner of) formal wicca, though I've been drawn to the ethos and principles for a very long time. My upcoming wedding is slated for the vernal equinox in 2021. Neither of us is religous in any other sense. We are planning a handfasting ceremony as opposed something more traditional and I would love some inspiration for our vows/readings at the ceremony. I've already started a few of the recommended introductory books to the craft but I'm hoping to get more specific and trusted reccomendations for any meaningful blessings, prayers, or books that wil help us to celebrate our union. Thank you in advance for your wisdom!Greetings everyone! This is my first year celebrating Beltane, and so I wanted to know, how do you all celebrate? I still live at home, so I cant do much, and I wanted to see what you all do! Blessed be, everyone!Do you think you can practice both? In my opinion, Buddhism is more of a philosophy rather than a religion. I‚Äôve always believed in crystals, cleansing and grounding rituals, along with transferring energy. I never knew that these were Wiccan practices until recently. 

I think mudras and mantras (and other Buddhist practices) can make certain spells maybe more powerful? Both seem to call upon meditation and that also being an important aspect in the religion. 

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that I‚Äôve always believed and followed a Buddhist way of life, but now starting to realize that some of the things I also believe in are Wiccan practices. Is there a possibility of meshing the two together?I‚Äôm starting out reading and diving into it, but the books I have only the the Angelic Wicca, whereas I am more drawn to the gods and goddesses and offering and help and such. Is there any link or advice you can give me?Hello lovelies, 
I'm a 19 year old Aussie female, I'm interested in Wicca, I tried doing my own research but there's just so much information I got a bit overwhelmed. I'd love to hear suggestions on any books or websites I would be extremely grateful. 
Stay safeHello everyone, I have been studying Wicca for quite some time now. I am a solitary practitioner, I haven‚Äôt really found anyone that I can talk to about my experiences and questions and share knowledge and vice versa. I have done only one money spell and it has worked. But recently I‚Äôve been wanting more knowledge before I do anything else, lately I have been feeling like I am drawn to Gaia, Mama Earth üåç ‚ú® I have just been thinking about her, I thank her everyday and talk about how I am grateful but I‚Äôm not sure what else to do. Should I call upon her, get her attention? How do I know if it‚Äôs her reaching to me.So I just had my first meeting with Artemis today and i decided to play music for her and apperantly she loves Melanie Martinez do what you want with this infoOne of the major questions I have is if witches believe in science? Do you get vaccines?I have been questioning my religion for a long time, my mother is fine with whatever I choose. I am 17, and looking to gain a better understanding on Wicca. My sister introduced me to Wicca, taught me some stuff about it. None of it latched on, it was a few years ago, but I recalled it a few months back and I‚Äôve been interested since. To no avail, looking for answers to my questions seems pointless through Google. So I decided to try here...
Any suggestions on where to go to find answers to these questions (or if you have an answer to the questions):

1. What are the different types, if that makes sense?
2. If there are different types, how can you tell what ‚Äòtype‚Äô you are?
3. Rituals‚Äî how do they work? Do all members of Wicca do it?
4. Are covens a thing, if so... do we have to join one?
5. (Finally) Are Moon cycles important to members of Wicca (I know, super random)?

I am willing to answer any questions if answering the questions can help you answer.OK I tried making the title make sense but It was hard man.

 Anyways, yesterday a great idea came into my mind and that is to create a "school" for the people of wicca and those who want to learn about it. As in, I'm creating a Googleclassroom. Those who want to join please message privately. I have made 3 classrooms so far and you can only join 1 at the moment (it will be easier to track ones work). 

The classrooms names and subjects are Herbalism, familiars, and crystals. I am planning on adding more. 

Another thing is please, please dont use you school account. Use a different account to join the Classroom of your choosing. 

If you have more classroom requests you can either comment them or message me privately. 

Please don't join them if you are already covered in homework. I do not want to add any stress. 

If you end up joining a classroom please take it seriously, please dont post or share anything from below, 

-Pornography or sexual acts

-Inappropriate laungage

-Violent acts

-Things unrelated to the classroom you have chosen. 

If you wish to change your classroom please message me and I will remove you from the one you chosen at first and add you to the one you want to be in now.

The classrooms will have different tasks which will ussualy involve research. I might ask you to write a short essay on a certain plant used in herbs, a certain crystals and other things like that. 

If you are interested please message me privately and I will add you to you chosen classroom. Thank you :DI‚Äôm a fetus witch. I quite literally am really young. I‚Äôm 12 I have no money to buy things for witchcraft and I can‚Äôt ask my parents. Can someone tell me if you need to have a deity to be Wiccan? If not how do you get one to call you and send you signs? I know I‚Äôm just a child but I really like and believe in this religion. Please help.Hi! So, disclaimer, I‚Äôve been raised in a Christian home ever since I was born (I‚Äôm 20) but I‚Äôve never really felt a strong connection with Christianity. I was sheltered so I don‚Äôt know much about the different religions and practices; however, I‚Äôve always felt a connection with Wiccan practices. Or at least a strong interest. I don‚Äôt think I can believe in different deities (or any for that matter) so I‚Äôm not really looking into some higher being to worship, but more of practices.

I apologize if I‚Äôm in the wrong place to ask this or if I have the wrong ideas about Wicca (again, sheltered) but I‚Äôve wanted to get in touch with nature and the spirits. The only thing I really know about is the importance of crystals, chakra, the basic generic stuff. 

My question is where should I start learning about these practices? Or if I‚Äôm looking in the wrong place, could someone point me in the right direction?

Edit: I want to add that I just want to have something to make me feel like I have some purpose or something to help me get in touch with myself and I just don‚Äôt feel like what I‚Äôve had all these years is doing that.I've noticed a lot of new beginners and I wanted to let others know there are Wiccan and Witchcraft Amino Apps for your phone. These are sortof how Reddit is and you can meet those that practice all over the World. Advice is easier to get and you can observe how others practice all around the spectrum. There are group chats for each one also. Hope this helps!A little about me: I am 28 & have been practicing since 2013. I have owned multiple witchcraft communities over the past 5 years on multiple platforms. I am an eclectic practitioner more in the middle path. I love research! Witchcraft is my whole life. I talk about it with community members from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed... & then I'm doing dream work while asleep LOL  


Now! As far as the sub goes I would like some feedback. I have been a member here for a hot minute but I mostly just read posts or make comments. I'm on so many subs I never know which post is from where lol

Here are some questions:   
Would you like to see changes? OR Would you like things to stay the same?  
Mostly in terms of the rules and how things run. Let me know! :)  


If any of you would like to post "introduction" posts in the comments please do! I would like to read through them! :)Hey, everyone!

I am a hedge witch, specializing in herbal, lunar, and fire magic. I am also quite adept with the Tarot, which I rely on almost daily.

I greatly enjoy giving tarot readings, and I have been giving them for free lately. Just for practice and fun. It means a lot to me. I would love to do a reading for all of you!

Send me a picture of cards you have drawn, a description of the spread you used, and your question. Include any relevant info for more thorough insight... If you don't have tarot cards, I will do a draw for you, using my own tarot cards (I cleanse them after each reading).

Hope to do your reading soon, and thanks for the opportunity!For those of you that have deities  how do you directly speak to them ?My best friend practiced witchcraft, he passed away about 2 years ago now. Me and a few other close friends of his cleaned out his apartment where we happened upon a few spells and such. Got a pretty good laugh out of finding one labled with another friend's name on it. 

Most of these items were discarded to the trash but one really stood out to me. Its this tiny Coffin covered in oil and wrapped in twine. For whatever reason I felt the need to hold on to it in order to properly discard it. Originally the plan was to burn it with a mutual close friend. I've just never gotten around to it. 

I mentioned this to someone who dated someone in the craft and warned me that it wasn't ideal. I have no idea it's contents, as I have not touched it since it's discovery. Looking inside almost feels like a betrayal to my friends privacy. 

I feel like I need to lay this thing to rest somehow. I'd like to hear someone's thoughts with some experience on the matter. I would like to know what something like this is used for, and also how to properly discard of it.

Thank you in advance.I'm still a baby witch and I've barely even started to cleanse, and I need some help or a mentor. Since I'm coming from Christianity, I'm used to be told who to worship, when and where, and the rituals that Christians do. I'm used to being guided through my spirituality since it wasn't my choice anyway. But I'm breaking away from my..trance? I guess?
Ever since I started doing more research on Wicca, it felt more familiar and homely, and I feel much more comfortable identifying as wiccan then christian. But I have an important question. I have zero knowledge of deities and researching everything myself is hard, so I've come here. 
Since I realized that I should do more research on deities, I have no idea where to start. 
Recently I have an infatuation with Hades, Persephone, Apollo, etc., and I don't know what to do. Is me calling myself wiccan a lie if I want to do more research on these Gods and possibly worship them as soon as I know what I'm doing?My cousin and I have both been studying on and off for a couple of years but havent fully dedicated ourselves to the neverending path of education and enlightenment that is practicing magick. We really want to do something "big" for the coming holidays. I know all of the frills and extras arent necessary, but we really want to have fun with it and do something that will take some effort and planning and maybe be an initiation of sorts. I'm just not sure where to start. Does anyone have a ritual they've enjoyed that might fit that criteria, or maybe just a template to help us create our own? 

So me and my friend have spent the last 2 weeks creating a wiccan community discord server for anyone with any amount of experience with wicca, it's a great place to find online resources and advice as well as finding items you could order and still be secretive. There are so many different chats for almost anything you could need to know and if there's something we've missed then there's a suggestion chat too. I hope we can see you there :D

[https://discord.gg/8ZK5xkt](https://discord.gg/8ZK5xkt)This book served me in good stead. WICCA, by Scott Cunningham.
It was given to me when I discovered the path. I can't give you the book but I can give you the title. I'm sure there are other titles that would do good service, please feel free to add.I've been getting a lot of nature-y things lately, and I want to know if the fae were leaving them! These items include an animal skull (either a cat or racoon), feathers, flowers, mushrooms, wild strawberries, and lots and lots of butterflies! Any advice how to check if it's just nature, of if I accidentally got myself into a contract with the Fae? (I don't work with them, but I was considering it)I've completed my protection spell for my family and the protesters, which also happens to be my first REAL spell work that I've ever done. I feel absolutely drained and exhausted, but completely and utterly at peace and I feel wholly in my spirit that I was successful in my casting.

I wish everyone the best of luck and all the blessings on their castings tonight under the full moon, especially if you are casting for BLM, because even though I was only casting for protection I still felt push back. Stay strong. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you to everyone who offered even a tidbit of advice or encouragement. I appreciate it all.

‚ú®Blessed be everyone‚ú®Hey! I'm v v v new to Wicca and I've really been on the fence about joining properly. Recently we have had a massive growth of mushrooms at our farm and it forms what is very clearly a huge ring of gaint toad stools, check my profile for the pictures. And a few people who are Wicca reached out to me and said that apparently this is a meeting point for something/someone called a fae queen.

From what I've been told its v rare to actually meet one and I'm still on the fence about all this. if I actually see a fae queen I will fucking dive head first into all of this and become a full witch.

apparently they appear fully like an actual person? and I'm not meant to give my real name or agree to bargains?

can anyone give any help for me? has anyone actually met a fae queen? do you know someone that has? please all information would be incredibleOk so I(35F) had a super wired dream that was odd and I haven't been able to just let it go. 

So i had a dream that me and my 2yr old son got trapped in a room with 3 huge black lion cat things( they literally popped out of the shadows)that talked to me. My son was not afraid of them( he wanted to play with them saying" kitty kitty meow meow") , they didn't harm him. When I asked what they wanted only the biggest one spoke saying "We want what is owed to us" when I asked what that was again the biggest one spoke only my son's middle name. 

Now I turned to grab my son and the biggest pounced on me, surprisingly this thing as huge as it was only had the same weight as my 20lb male cat. So I'm pinned under it, it's not heavy but I cant move? It again says it only wants my son. I told it no you cant have him. The cat said "fine but there is a price" and then all 3 lions shrank to the size of actual cats. It then told me as it just sat on me purring and licking its paws "all cats in this world are its children and my duty now is to feed/help any stray that comes to my door and to teach my son to do the same" I agreed and the cats disappeared. 

Now when I told my bf about it he was of the opinion that I just made a deal with a demon to feed it cats or I was agreeing to fatten cats up for it to eat? Now I looked it up and like 3 things pop up Bael, Baste, Nekomata (Japanese folklore, which my bfs family dose have ties to Japan as his grandfather was Japanese)

So not sure if I made a deal with a demon or a god? The kicker here is the same day I told my bf, a large black male cat showed up at our door, I've been feeding him, he occasionally let's me pet him and hold him, he was hurt but is getting better, cuz honestly I dont know who I made a deal with and shit no one wants to be the one who pissed off a god/demon by braking a promise..üò∂i just struck an interest in wicca and decided to start researching it and i‚Äôm looking for any tipsSo, all my life my grandmother called me a "natural witch", something she explained was a calling from God ( the Judeo/Christian one), because of several reasons, one being I'm a "diviner" per her because if I dream something three times, on the day I have the third dream, it or a VERY similar variant comes true, from accidents to happy things. Her second reason was the manner of my birth (breech, encaul, died and was resuscitated, born at exactly 11:59 June 20th, leaving me a cusp baby). I've always denied my "witchery" due to my ex husband's faith (Southern Baptist) and felt like I've denied a vital part of my being. I've always felt a closeness to Celtic art, religion, history, all that, but I've also always been equally drawn to Native American paths and art and folklore. I'm 44 years old and I'm finally ready to explore my spiritual side and fill this hole in my soul. I've read a lot of Wiccan related literature (Gardnerian) but it doesn't call to me like the other two do. So, any advice? Points in the right direction? Don't start this at this age because you'll never learn ebough to be a decent practioner? Any and ALL comments are welcomed, just, go easy, it's a crap shoot as far as whether I'll get angry and give up, or start crying thinking my ship has sailed. üíúüíúüòÇI am new to the world of Wicca but have already discovered so much. I was raised in the Bible belt so much of this is hard to let go or grasp.  I still hold God very high in my belief and have an understanding that Wicca is very fluid.  I have done a few circles and spoke to my spirit guides (but only seen the hand of one).  

I am starting to think I might possibly be clairvoyant and clairaudient. I would like to strengthen these but I am not sure how. I have some friends that tell me to practice but im not sure how that would work.  

What I would like is to meet some others like me or even similar that would be willing to help befriend and guide a baby along. I know it's a lot to ask so if I don't get any takers I understand. Thank you so much for reading this.

A Secret BabyI am a baby witch, and am really just now opening myself to the possibilities of the universe. Since I‚Äôve done this dragon flies have begun to seek me out. They follow me, and will even land on my nose. Does this signify anything that I have no knowledge of yet, or is it simply a coincidence? Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.&#x200B;

A very common thing that I see on witchcraft groups, especially those for beginners, is 'Do you have a spell for...?" and while often many of us are able to help out with a link or something more personal, overall, the best spells, we know, are those written ourselves.

But writing spells can be daunting especially if you've never written one.

So if spells are your thing and you're already good to go, this post is probably not for you, but for anyone wondering how to simplify the process, here's my personal method.

Think about what it is that you want to manifest. What are you trying to achieve? Love? To be more Attractive? To have more money? To Find Calm in times of Anxiousness? To quell fear? To make someone pay?

What is it you want to do? Figure it out and get clear with it. You want a single sentence so that you can focus and work off of it. So what is it?! For the purposes of this, I'm going to say we're trying to draw money. My sentence could look like "I want more financial prosperity". Just write it at the top of your page. It doesn't matter what words you use in it, because this is only the focus point for our work. Just get real with what you want, precisely.

THEN, once you've got that, begin thinking (or googling) synonyms for those words. Financial synonyms that suit our work could be "Money, Cash, Coins, Pay, Funds" etc. Look at "Prosperity" synonyms next. "Wealth, Success, Ease, Comfort, Security".

Now, look for other words for what you want to do. Googling 'want' isn't going to be helpful, so you'll need to think on this one. In my example, we want to DRAW prosperity to us. So look then for synonyms for that meaning of draw... you'll come up with things like 'Attract, Pull, Magnet, Lure, Charm, Come".

My basic spell format is "what's happening now that is wrong, what do I want to manifest instead?"

With these word banks, you'll begin to piece things together to see if they work. This is the 'spellcrafting' portion. In my case, I might start with this, "Money comes". Working from that, you can see that you could go any of a thousand ways with this...and this is why spellcrafting is best done by the individual spellcrafter :P Sometimes people like to rhyme. I use similar sounds in familiar phrases. In the charm below, you'll see "Comes and Goes" which is a very common saying. It's also what frequently happens with people with money situations. Money shows up and then boom it's gone until it shows up again some time later.

So We want the "come" part for our money but not the "go" part. At the start of the spell, I said how things are right now "Comes, Goes" and at the end I say it " Flows and Stays" because that's what I want the change to be. I want money flowing in and staying with me, instead of flowing in and disappearing!

"Money Comes,

Money Goes,

Money Stays

Money Flows to Me

So Mote it Be"

Some people attribute melodic/rhyming invocations to having 'more power'... but I like to use very short and specific iterations with rhymes or near rhymes so I can easily memorize and use during my work without lessening my visualizations while I try to remember my spell! You should make your spells as long as you feel comfortable. some practitioners really enjoy getting into that work and will write very long and detailed invocations. For those practitioners, again, you're awesome and this post probably isn't for you, but for everyone who is new to this, don't feel like you have to be operating at that same level or you're not doing 'as strong' of work as someone else. Don't compare yourself to anyone but yourself and try not worry too much about if it's right/perfect. Use the words that are best for you. You don't have to use complicated or ritualistic language to create effective spells, and the more deeply you connect with your spells, the better they will work for you!My boyfriend and I are currently in the middle of planning our elopement and we were trying to find a justice of the peace to preform our ceremony. We are both spiritual beings and don‚Äôt have a religious background. We even bought our rings to symbolize what type of energy we want to bring into our marriage. We were wondering if anyone had a spiritual justice of the peace do their ceremony and if so how did you go about finding one?! We are located in Texas and new to Texas as well. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct place to ask, and if it‚Äôs not does anyone know where I should ask?! 
Thank you!Merry meet!

Hiya, I just want to say that I am currently working on a new discord server for baby witches and more experienced ones. This will be done(hopefully) through the collective knowledge of other people within the server, helping them to be the witch they want. Or maybe your already a fully-fledged witch and want to see how other people are going, what they're doing differently compared to you.  
Here's the invite link, I hope to see you there!

Kind regards,

PokeI‚Äôm just beginning a practice and reading Wicca A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I‚Äôve done some passive looking and seen some basic information on the Feri and Minoan Brotherhood but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has a lead on some good introductory books that center on LGBT practice, or if anyone has  any general recommendations for a queer person starting out?I've had him for 7 years. I raised him, and I think of him as my baby. He was hit by a car this morning. Is there anything at all that I could do to reach out to him to be able to say goodbye and let him know that I love him?If you cremate your kitty (or other animal companion) and keep the ashes for powerful and personal spells, is that sweet, creepy but understandable, or just playing creepy and weird?

Excited to hear all the opinions. Thanks.So me and my best friend had this one friend. My best friend was closer to her but I never stayed too close since I got bad vibes from her. I never thought of it as much, just 13 year old me not taking a liking to someone. Anyways she ended up being a really bad person fat-shaming, transphobia, fetishizing abuse and sexual assault (Which she comes from a loving family and never experienced either so I don't understand why), fetishizing eating disorders, cultural appropriation, supporting pro-ana, and more. So my friend did the reasonable thing and dropped her. We moved on and we found out that our ex-friend was getting sent to a mental hospital for other issues. My best-friend ended up telling me how she actually hexed her and her ex-boyfriend out of jealousy. It honestly made sense since her ex-boyfriend randomly dumped her out of nowhere when their relationship was going smoothly, but we both just saw it as a coincidence. We later then found out about how she actually ended up liking my best friend (I always had a feeling but wasn't sure) and it made clearer sense. Jealousy, and spite. Not only that she has a past with hexing, she hexed her old friend for dropping her (which I find stupid since friendships come and go, that's life). Anyways I do practice Wicca (and I know dark magick isn't technically Wicca but I thought maybe someone here may know something since they kind of correspond). My experience with Wicca is very small, my late great grandmother did Wicca but I personally don't have much experience with it since I'm so young. And my experience with magick is just white magick. I'm unsure how to handle this issue, how do I protect me and my friend from the hexing? She gets released from the mental hospital either today or tomorrow so I want to work fast. I asked my deity for guidance but I'm honestly scared since I know hexing can be very serious. This whole thing is stupid, imagine hexing someone over a crush you have at 13 ;p anyways please let me know any advice to help! Thanks!So I had a dream last night that I'm fairly certain was a sign on the next step of my practice.

Basically, I had one of my D&D books open, but it had been marked up by the fae for some reason? Idk. I was able to wash it away with a lightly damp rag, but I turned to one of the pages that I know wasn't actually D&D, and it was talking about stones that dissolve in water. In big black letters next to the list, was written "PAY ATTENTION! THIS WILL BE NEXT!" 

I should also note that in the dream, I was a dude, apparently liked foreign gals and there was no magick involved at all. In the dream during the last bit my altar showed up, and like I knew what it was but dude me didn't practice magick so it was like okay, and when the thing with the book happened and dude me blamed it on the fae.

Long rant over, but does anyone know anything about magick like this? Water magick isn't really my thing, but crystals are.I'm still new to it but already I feel like I fit better with wicca then christianity.
My question to everyone. What got you into wicca? Were you born into it, discover it ? Or are you like me and just found that it "clicked" with you?

Like I said I'm still new to it all so I do have questions.

1. I notice incense is a big thing, is there any super mild scents someone could reccomend?

2. How long did it take you to feel like you knew what you were doing.Very recently, I have had a feeling that someone is being very shady behind my back. I have not had any reason to dislike this person up until recently when she did not care for my wellbeing, knowing that something terrible could've happened to me at the time of night. That, and the small hurtful remarks she would throw my way. My emotions are everywhere..I feel guilt, anger, sadness, and confusion..all I did was help her and am continuing to do so all the while being straightforward and setting my boundaries. I would like to protect myself against this bad energy because I do not wish to be taken advantage of. Its affecting peace of mind.During the recent full moon, I performed a candle spell. My intentions were to cast out negativity within myself, fill myself with more positivity, and to find myself. (I should have asked to express myself better because this is harder to explain than I thought it would be!)

This was my first time casting outside. I‚Äôm blessed to live in a rural area. I was in the yard for over two hours. 

As usual, my dog was uneasy with the fire. I missed my mischievous cats running amok. Of course, we‚Äôre always looking for signs that our spells are working.

My observations:
My wicks all burned in different directions, though no wind seemed present.
I heard crickets, frogs, bats, birds, coyotes, dogs.
There seemed to be more fireflies than usual.
Many insects and a spider moved across my alter, many seemed to congregate within the pentacle. 
I felt as though I was being watched, not in a threatening threatening way. More of a curiosity.
I heard a few twigs and branches snap. Could have been quite a few things, since there is plenty of wildlife in the wood.
My cats were even more interested than usual in my altar when I came back inside. 

Thoughts are welcomed!Sorry if this is the wrong sub

I am a solitary practitioner and I already have the guide to the solitary practitioner (Scott Cunningham), and Raymond buckland's a guide to witchcraftI'm a baby witch and I wanted to do my first tarot card reading. Is there anything specific I need to do to get the best results, or any advice that you can give. I don't have a wide range of knowledge about this area, so any bit of help would be highly appreciatedWill the moon still charge crystals and water even if its overcast and cloudy?Hi, I am very very very very new to being a wiccan and I've just been doing research and learning all about this. But I have a question I hope someone could answer. 

So the reason I'm starting to practice in being a wiccan ( or at least one of the reasons ) is because ever since I was about 12 years old, I've been having these images pop in my dreams of a tall man, his skin glowed as if it was golden, his hair was soft and curly and he was always in some kind of sunlight. 

In my dreams, this man and I often talk about anything and everything. I would talk about my problems, school and random things. But everytime i ask for his name, I am immediately woken up. 

As I grew up, the dreams only got more and more vivid. Now I started being able to physically touch the man ( his face feels very warm ) and yet whenever I try to get his name, I still suddenly bolt out of my dreams. Not able to go back to sleep. 

And this has happened many many times since I've started researching about how to start as a wiccan and all about pantheons. 

There have been other random reoccurrences that has happened while I was awake like I found an arrow lying around my grandmother's backyard, I found myself liking the morning the more I wake up ( and I am not a morning person at all ), and once, my white candle suddenly was lit after I left a room. 

I've heard that these could be signs of a deity calling but I'm really not sure. Like I said, I am a super beginner at this and I hope anyone can help me on this.My oldest sister always tells me about doing chants with our grandmother when we were younger. My other two sisters confirmed they remember. I don‚Äôt though and Our grandmother denies it‚Äôs and says it was our dads sister who was a witch and casted a generational curse upon my mother and us (her children) after a fight. some spirit of some sort. And she says the sprit takes turns on us  basically to leave us unhappy ? Is this something a witch could even cast? I‚Äôve never seen anything but my sisters who are more ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô than me say they‚Äôve seen the spirit.  Is it possible my refusal to acknowledge this ‚Äòcurse‚Äô has saved it from effecting me?So I am making my first wand and I was thinking about making it out of an apple tree branch. This apple tree and I have a strong connection because it's planted with the (cw) organ that was giving me nutrients when I was in my mom's stomach, is it a good idea to use this trees branches? 

Tips for making wands are also very appreciated :)
Please be nice!I was just minding my own business when I had a fucking epiphany; if there is an untapped well of energy/magic, why am i not utilizing it? I've spent a good few hours researching Wicca, Magik, & anything else useful. I'm going to wait about I month until deciding if this is something i want to do. I can't tell my family, they really only see Wicca as an offspring of Satanism, something i believed until now. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to practice, or what is even be able to do. I don't have a job & i can't just ask my Catholic raised mother to buy me books on how to be a witch. Maybe this is just fad I'm going through, maybe it isn't. For now, I'm just going to keep researching & learning more about Wicca. I still believe in God, but I want to know more about the world, more about myself. Maybe in the future when I'm doing spells i can make life better for my family & those around me. I still don't know what happens next, but i have high hopes!Hello! I‚Äôm Gem I‚Äôm 19 and have been interested in Wicca since I was 17 but have only just started to begin my path into Wicca. I am currently developing my altar and I have a few crystals I like to meditate with also writing in my book of shadows as I go however I wanted to get into spellwork I was thinking on starting off at casting a circle and protection spells however is there a certain way/ rules I have to follow or can I do it my own way? Some people are saying they write their own spells and others follow from books. If there is any books for beginners you can recommend that would be very much appreciated üñ§My daughter bought a bunch of herbs and spices for future spells and whatnot. One of the things she got was Safflower. The only thing we can find on Safflower is for gay men to attract a lover. Since she's not male I was wondering if there was anything else that she can do with it.All the teas I've tried so far have been pretty unreadable, the leaves tend to clump at the bottom of the cup even after draining, and they're usually fairly big leaves as well. Brand recommendations would be much appreciated!As a baby-Wiccan I‚Äôm curious to know ways that you practice. I figure this would be a great way to get to know one another and give you a chance to share the unique ways you navigate human existence through the different lenses of Wicca!

1. How many years have you been practicing?
2. Are you with a coven or are you more of a solitary practitioner?
3. What names do you associate with Goddess and God?
4. What is your favourite or most effective tool / ritual for communication with the divine?
5. How do you protect yourself from bad luck or dark energies?
6. What name (if any) do you accept as your title? (Wiccan, witch, warlock, crone, shaman, magician etc.)
7. What‚Äôs the biggest lesson(s) you‚Äôve learned throughout your journey?
8. What sacred days of the calendar do you celebrate and what are some of your traditions?
9. What Wiccan or other religious/occult symbols do you resonate with and why?

I am very excited to hear from all my Wiccan big sisters and brothers! Thank you for taking the time to interact with my post <3
(Mind you, there is no pressure to answer every single question, if you feel compelled only to answer one, I‚Äôm beyond grateful and I‚Äôm sure many newbies like myself will find your wisdom helpful)
~Na√ØveAm I correct in my understanding that the moon energy begins building after the new moon, reaching its pinnacle at the full moon and from there, loses energy (or actually reverses energy) until new moon? So that if you wanted, say, a favorable outcome in a housing search,  you might not want to put a bid on a house during the last quarter if you can wait a week? 

My friend says this only really applies to spells,  but I have always lived according to the calendar for all applications. I even insisted we would not close on our house if we could not do it by Samhain when the sellers dragged their feet. We do not move after Samhain.Does anyone know any free resources to learn the gods and goddesses?I'll start off with saying I am not an extremely experienced witch. I have been practicing only about a year and researching for about 3. I am however very spiritual and a believer in a higher power/powers.

Well I recently started a new job which I love, and we get multiple breaks through out the day. During these breaks I take walks through the neighborhood located close to my job. Since I have started, I have come across multiple injured animals on my path. One day it was an injured bird (not exactly sure what kind but all black). It was quite literally right on the same path that I had been walking every day, I actually didn't even notice it at first and almost stepped on him. He hobbled away and when I went back after work to try and help him he was no where to be found. 

A couple days after this I was pulling in to my parking spot and there was a squirrel just sitting in the middle of my spot. He was clearly sickly and had flies all around him. I had to get to work so I parked and when I came back out on my break I couldn't find him again. That was until I started walking my usual path and I stumbled across him. He was dead in the leaves on the shoulder of the road. He wasn't hit or anything, it just looked like he laid down and died. What makes this one even weirder is he was gone the next day. Now in my short time working there I have seen animals hit and stay in the road for much longer than a day, but some how this one squirrel who was in a pile of leaves that you wouldn't even be able to spot unless looking for him was gone within a day. 

These aren't the only occurrences but definitely the ones that stuck out the most. Now I'd like to add I am extremely passionate for all wildlife. Like I can't even look at a dead animal while driving down the road or I'll start crying. I can't explain it but I have always been this way. And now these babies are coming to me hurt and I feel like this just has to be a sign. So I am here to ask if anyone has any ideas about what this could mean. I've been trying to research but can't find much on injured animals. 

Am I crazy? Are these all just a coincidence? Or is there something or someone trying to tell me something? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!Hi, I'm Sverre and I'm from Belgium. I'm intrested in Wicca and everything about magick and the elements. I would love to learn all about it. Have a great day!!Tonight was the first night I tried to do a type of meditation to find my animal guide. An old dark gray wolf appeared to me and guided me though a dense forest before getting to a clearing with a ball of light in the center. Something told me to look into the light so I did and started having scattered visions. I tried to make sense of all the random scenes and things but finally a dark set of scenes appeared, skulls and evil spirits in my house showed up in the scenes and then it felt like something touched my foot in real life so I snapped out of the vision. I'm alone in my room. What just happened? I know I have some seer abilities I need to grow but this was intensely odd.So I've recently found out that I have a pretty serious trapping hex on myself. No clue who it was or why but I was let known by a deity im working with that a candle for hex breaking is what I need to do to remove it (I've already tried bottle work with this) does anyone know any good hex breaking herb essential oils that would be good for this?Sometimes when i watch the full moon i feel is calling me, that i should go somewhere in the nature. Purple and blue colors come to my mind. Also melancholic feelings invades me.

Sometimes i feel i should go to walk in a forest randomly without a specific place. 

Sometimes also i feel i should get naked and swimm in a lake where nobody else can see me or to be next to a fire or to just walk randomly until i find some people or something, like if i were a lost child.


Why do you think this is happening? i should just do it one day i guess, go to a forest or somewhere where is a lake during full moon. üåëüå†üå≥üååüèûÔ∏èIt makes me feel quite uneasy and I feel like I‚Äôm being watched, like there‚Äôs always something that‚Äôs just escaped my peripheral vision. a part of me thinks I‚Äôm just being paranoid for some unknown reason, while another part of me is saying to trust what I‚Äôm feeling. Maybe just through opening myself up to Wicca I‚Äôve become more in tune with the energies around me?

Like I‚Äôve said, I am very new to all this so I‚Äôm sorry if I sound ridiculous!I recently discovered the Wiccan culture/witchcraft in general and I have to say a lot of it really resonates with me. I‚Äôm wanting to expand my knowledge about the history and what it all truly means in modern terms. If you all could recommend some good books to me about the history or spells or any of that it would be greatly appreciated. If you can‚Äôt recommend a book but just have some of your own words feel free to share those as well. Thanks in advance.I am hoping someone will be able to help us.
I am an empath, supernatural power runs in my family, has for generations. But recently my son has been experiencing supernatural powers, stronger than mine. I have been trying to help him learn to deal and live with it but I'm at a loss. He can see spirits and demons, talk to them, feel others emotions, energies. He gets overwhelmed in large crowds due to this.
I have tried to teach him to meditate, to center himself, be confident in himself. But his powers are stronger than mine and I have just started learning how to deal with mine.

How do I help my son? What can he do to protect himself from the negativity out there? 

Any help is welcomed!I was raised with my mother who is a Wiccan. I loved the religion. I found peace in it. I was taken away from her because she was abusive, and my grandparents are strictly morman. They took my spell books and burned them. I still have a crystal and I cherish it. I‚Äôm want to have the freedom to cast circles again, amoung other things. Do any of you have a way for me to do this without spell books?Mine's probably https://youtu.be/6RL_mgx-3L4 . Just too damn catchy.New to witchcraft. Looking for some good YouTubers to watch to learn more about everything. Any suggestions?
Also have any tips or advice about witchcraft?So, my girlfriend has been collecting crystals for a long time. And we‚Äôve recently ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù that she is a crystal with. 

How can I help her in this journey of hers?

Preface. This is all new to me. I know a very minimal amount about Wicca, but want to help her in any way that I can. 

Any advice? Thanks!There is so much happening and we need to stay grounded in order to be that guiding light for others.

What do you do?

For me meditations and yoga helps. I like to take walks in nature. Take salt baths and eat organic.I also like to do a tarot reading for myself whenever I feel I'm shifting away from my essence.But what helps me the most is creating art or any form of self expression ! ( I make music and art videos about these kind of topics (would love your opinion on it! - its in my bio) )How do you know if you have a familiar?

Edit : i have this cat my brother found that seems to be very attached to me. Even tho he claims it to be his. The cat bypass my brother and follows me where ever I go. Sleeps on my window sill and waits for me to come home. Let‚Äôs me pick him up and carry him and actually encourages it. How do I know if he‚Äôs my familiar ? He‚Äôs a stray cat that we nurtured back to health after we found him injured.Obviously, I am not supposed to burn an actual fig tree, how would you interpret this symbolically? 

(I had this dream after working a candle spell  for guidance for an entire day)So, I don‚Äôt know if this is the right category or what... but I had the strangest dream last night and I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me understand it?

So, I don‚Äôt remember too much about it but the biggest part of it that I remember is keys? There weren‚Äôt just a small amount, it was a lot. And now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about keys. Does anyone know what this is or was this just a normal dream (lol...?)......????

I would appreciate anything help .-.Hi, my name is Alix, please inform me of any inappropriate questions.
1. What are things I should know right off the bat?
2. Heard there are different kinds of witches, what are the different kinds?I‚Äôm looking for a kind of encyclopaedia type thing for the uses of each herb. I‚Äôve bought many books but each book only lists what herbs the author uses for their specific spells and I would love some kind of encyclopaedia that lists herbs and what they‚Äôre useful for in sort of a dictionary type format so I could just look them up individually. Does this exist?Hey before casting a circle when doing a spell, should I bless my alter things as in bowls and incense?I'm quite new to the craft I guess you can say and I'm wanting to work with a few deities(I have a few in mind) to help guide me. I feel as though I've had a few 'signs' telling to look further into them but I'm not sure where to start. Any help, comments, recommendations are welcomed and appreciated.I know some basic ways to communicate with spirits, and don‚Äôt worry as I am already familiar with the spirits in question. I have been meditating and allowing them to speak with me through thoughts and feelings and sometimes words, but does anyone know of ways (from personal experience ) to make it easier for the spirits to communicate? I‚Äôm not worried about letting anything in because they are already ‚Äúin‚Äù here and we are friendly toward eachotherHello i am still relatively new to all of this but i was wondering if someone could point me to some good resources to learn more about the Goddess and the Horned God.Hullo all! My aunt (former Wiccan, current witch) was gifted a glyph by Thoth and Hathor while meditating yesterday. It looks distinctly like a moon sigil, but neither of us are familiar enough with them to gain a full understanding of it. We appreciate the insight of those more knowledgable than us! 

[Here's an image of the Glyph/Sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/rD2Q9eY)Wicca has called to me my whole life, Mother Earth draws me near her. As much as I love it, as much as I'm drawn to it, and as peaceful and content it makes me feel, I struggle to keep on my path. 

I think that the pressure to know everything right away and try to compete with many very wise witches is intimidating, no matter how much I tell myself I can take it slow, these witches were just like me once, and I don't need to conform to anyone else's standards as long as I feel like what I'm doing is right for me. I honestly think I just need a few good books to get me started because even though the internet has a vast array of knowledge, it's too much and it's intimidating. 

I think my biggest issue with staying on my path however is my mental illnesses. Depression, anxiety, and dissociation. I go through moods of being up and down, the highs are intense but short lived, and during those times I'm able to practice. But I never get far, the lows are often long lasting, even for months. I struggle to even draw every day, something I've done my whole life and very much enjoy, wicca definitely is a struggle for me. Then I can't help but to feel like I'm a faker and it isn't for me if I can't even do the simplest of things a couple times a week. 

I very much believe in the three fold law, and I feel like the negative energy I've put out into the world as well as let fester in me for years holds me back. I feel like it's grabbing me, and no cleansing ritual I've done has ever been strong enough to help lessen it significantly enough. In high school for three years I lived in a forest, but my room was a basement room with no windows. I shut Mother Earth out for too long when she was so close to me, and I feel like that time really instilled much negativity within me that I've struggled to get rid of. What more, during that time I had a cat I loved dearly, she helped me very much with finding myself and discovering my spiritual path. But I've lost her and I just feel like there's something, someone missing from my magick every single time. 

I want to follow this path so dearly, it's what I feel deep in my heart. But I struggle so much to keep up with it I don't know what to do anymore at this point.I‚Äôm trying to find people who have brewed Bella Donna into a tea and drank it. I don‚Äôt mean so much Bella Donna that you almost died. I mean just a little bit to help you relax. I can‚Äôt find any recorded experiences on Reddit that didn‚Äôt involve axiomatically dangerous amounts of the herb. 

Just a little introduction, I'm new to this group. I'm 20 years old and I haven't been a practicing witch in almost 3 years but I am a natural born witch and a 5th generation on my moms side. Growing up, I was very sensitive to spirits and energies around me and I didn't know how to communicate or help the ones that asked me. I started asking questions and after a couple years, my family finally introduced me to Wiccan and Pagan beliefs which I still follow to this day. However, about 3 years ago, I lost my way completely. I got sucked into an addiction I thought I could never escape and I lost sight of the path I was supposed to follow.

I am proud to say I finally kicked my addiction and I have no intentions of going back, but in the process I lost everything. All of my literature, my crystals, and even the things I kept for an alter were lost. I moved out of state, and I don't have the support group I used to have. I need help finding my way again, figuring out where I need to start back at so I can continue my journey, as well as find people who are willing to help with my questions and any suggestions on where I can find things cheaper so I can restart my faith. I'm not asking for hand outs or free stuff, I just need help rebuilding on my own.This is my first post, so if I do something wrong or if this is the wrong place for it, please let me know. 

I am moving into an apartment very soon where the previous tenant passed away. I never met Zack, but I know that he was troubled and stopped taking the medication that is life depended on along with heavy drinking, which lead to his death. I want to respect and honor his spirit, but I want to do a complete energy cleanse. My best friend's room is right across the hall so I spend a lot of time in the building  already, and I feel no bad energy anywhere else, but I have yet to actually enter the room he passed in. I am planning on smudging with sage, but I am eager to learn of any other forms of energy cleansing. Any and all advice is welcomeHello all.. Just like the title says I‚Äôm really just trying to find myself. Growing up, I felt I never really fit in any religion. I went to a Baptist church as a child, then more contemporary as a young adult. Neither of them lasted very long. I‚Äôve always been a little more curious about the ‚Äúother side‚Äù of the spectrum if you will. When I was 19, I met some of the nicest people I have ever met and was kinda introduced to Pagan. I was intrigued then but never really opened myself enough to really want to learn anything. Now that I am 37, I figured why not.*Wow, I posted on here a while ago and the response was amazing, thank you to all the people who've joined. I also want to say a huge thanks, now we have over 150 members!*  
Anyways I'll get to my main purpose :)  
I(with the help of my wonderful members) created a Discord server for soon to be witches of any kind to gather all the information they need to begin. This will be done(hopefully) through the collective knowledge of other people within the server, helping them to be the witch they want.

PokeHow do I start?I hope you can help me.Advice and guidance for night terrors.

Hi. So, I still consider myself a newbie and trying to find my place so I don‚Äôt fully have the knowledge I need to battle this. 
My daughter is 4 and half with ADHD and ODD. She has been suffering from EXTREME night terrors (every night most of the time more than once) since she was about 2. When this happens she screams for me or her dad and will be looking right at us but still doesn‚Äôt see us. If she gets touched she screams bloody murder. They last for anywhere between three to seven minutes and she never remembers it happening. It doesn‚Äôt matter what is said or done nothing helps comfort her through these episodes. We just have to sit there and watch and make sure she doesn‚Äôt thrash around too much and hurt herself. It is terrifying and heartbreaking. 
Now, I have tried weekly cleansing with sage (and yes I am inviting in good calm energy during the process), dream catchers with several crystals, worry dolls, crystal pouches with crystals that I cleanse every day, and any type of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù remedies for night terrors but nothing is helping my sweet girl. 
I am asking for any type of spell bags, spells, sigils, ANYTHING at all that might help my baby get the rest she deserves. I don‚Äôt have a significant amount of knowledge in one particular type (crystals, herbs, etc.) I just know a little bit about a lot if that makes sense. I am just not at the point I know what types are best for certain things. I have searched for some things but I keep coming up dry or finding spells and rituals for yourself and not for someone else. 

I don‚Äôt know if I am making any sense to anyone to be honest I am just a frazzled sleepless heartbroken momma trying to help her baby girl. So any advice is welcome and I appreciate your time.Hello! I want to cast a protection spell for a loved one who's working as a frontliner. However, I have limited tools. Can you recommend me some effective but doable protection spells for starters? I also heard that intentions are more important that tools haha but feel free to suggest some! Thank you :)I‚Äôm very new to Wicca and I think it‚Äôs a very interesting religion. I have a couple of questions.

1. Do I have to believe in Magic to call myself a Wiccan?

2. Do I have to believe in a god to call myself a Wiccan?

3. What do Wiccans think about the lgbtq+?

4. What do Wiccans think about mental illness?

5. What do Wiccans think about modern medicines?

6. Does every Wiccan believe in the threefold law?

That is all the questions I have. Thank you for reading this. :)Hi! so my friend is suffering greatly at the moment and I want to help as much as I can. This will be my 1st spell or interaction with the element whatsoever ( I think is important information).  I was hoping that a more mature witch could point me in the right direction.

And because I think this is important information I will add it in: 

Recently being around my friend has left me on edge, I've always been one to notice body language and energy that people give off. The energy that she give off is suffocating and I rush to leave her home just as quickly as I arrive, but if she leave a room that I'm in the pressure goes with her. Shes been very anxious and hateful of herself, and I've noticed this take a turn for the worst as she confided with me that shes been thinking of taking her life. At the moment, shes in the hospital but this idea is embedded deeply within her. I just need help, what do I do?So I'm a baby witch. I've only really ever done guided meditations and a few tarot readings. I've started doing research and find myself getting overwhelmed by how much there is. I'm very interested in crystals and lately I've been seeing a black dog following me, which is actually very calming. Can I meditate on this? How would I even do that? Can I do a tarot spread I've found online about this? I'm so confusedWhen using the tall, glass 7 day candles for candle Magick do you let it burn all the way til the end in one go or can you extinguish it and relight it so you dont have to leave it lit when no one is home? Just in general I guess with candle magic this question applies

I'm a baby witch and love candle magic, but I also dont want to burn down my apartment!So I am Luke and I've been an atheist for some time now but I've heard about Wicca and it has interested me so I came here to ask about the basics. Can any one help me?I'm having difficulty figuring out my dieties and I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice. I've always been drawn to Artemis, even before I learned of Wicca. However, I know one of the first things to do when starting is to do your research. When I researched Artemis today I learned that she was also known for purity: guarding hers and punishing (I think it said) her priestesses who lost their purity. I'm still drawn to Artemis in ways I cant explain. My problem lies within the fact that my purity was lost long before I was married. Will Artemis accept me given that I didn't follow that? How do you go about finding other dieties that resonate with you? I also read that if you're drawn to certain culture (like ancient Egypt) that those dieties could or would be right for you? I've always felt a pull toward Scottish history but I wasn't sure (please forgive my ignorance here) if the Celtic dieties would also be for Scotland or if it would be something else? 

Thank you!Hi I'm relatively new to wicca and I am basically entirely lost and have so many questions, like can you have more than one patron gods/goddesses, how do you know who your patron god/goddess is do you pick them or do they pick you or what im very confused and would appreciate any help.I'm new to this religion and I've been watching a bunch of videos on how I can actually start my book of Shadows but I'm still lowkey confused. I'm from a family that really religious and I'm the only wiccan so I kind of have to practice this religion on my own. I want to write down everything I have learned but I'm scared of my mom finding out and freaking out about it. Is a book of Shadows still relevant if it's on the computer/ phone?Hello, I posted here a few months ago. I am very new to magic practice, still learning more every day. I finally feel I have found the path I was always meant to walk, but fear is holding me back.  I was raised Christian in early childhood, and I think the school and church traumatized me. I want to do more spells and practice more candle magic,but I have this overwhelming fear that I will mess it up. Maybe saying the wrong thing, or using the wrong herbs. Or even throwing off the balance of power and it backfiring, and hurting or killing me or someone I love. Is it really easy for a spell to backfire? Even with something of only good intent or something neutral? I just feel so lost on what to do. I was born with several psychic gifts. And always felt I was born naturally to be a witch. I want to practice my skills so badly it hurts. But just can‚Äôt seem to get over this force inside holding me back.  And advice/reassurance would be much appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏èHello everyone, I am a Norse pagan so I  have been around multiple pagan discords where I have also met some witches. Now they were all really interesting to talk to. Sometimes we would face time in channels and it was a lot of fun. Until the topic of aura came up! Most of them told people the color of their aura and then what it might mean and some they left out guess these people had problems then. But when they looked at me they're eyes shot wide open and one of them even screeched. To clarify these happened all in different discords in different calls. But they all asked kind of the same question: "hold up! Did you just change the color?" or "did you just switch it off I can't see anything!" I always shook it off as them trolling me or smth. But after the 3rd time, I started to feel curious and decided to investigate. So after it happened again I asked the girl "do you wanna see me do it again?" I am an actor so I just thought about switching myself in a different person or a different version of myself for example a "insane psycho" one. 3/4 said that it turned to dark red after that...wierd. So are they trolling me or is this normal?i need a copy of the 13 witches runes, anyone know where i can get one? thanksHi! I left my crystals out for the full moon a few days ago and then completely forgot about them. They‚Äôve been on my windowsill for a few days now. Is this bad? Should I leave them there until the next full moon or take them off? Does it matter?I have noticed the first time I cast a spell my upper chest felt tight for some time afterwards  
the spell did work but I didn't want to correlate that with a successful spell. I Did an enchantment spell w/o the chest pain.

But I just casted a love spell and my upper chest began to hurt again.

**I basically want to ask what does light chest pain after casting a spell means**  
I use a sterling silver ring with a legitimate moonstone when casting spells  
Although my reasoning is copper is good for channeling magic and both the moonstone and silver have water properties.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of thing, but my evil eyes broke. I know that means that it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job of protecting me, and that it can‚Äôt anymore. Would it be ok for me to keep it? It‚Äôs from a girl that I really care about, and it‚Äôs the first one she‚Äôs given me. 
I don‚Äôt really want to get rid of it.I've been Wiccan for quite some time now, but I'm a solitary Witch and have never really asked this question before. How do you feel about using Ouija boards? They have an association with evil powers and there quite a few people (spiritual or not) that avoid them.

I started a Ouija board collection and have been doing some research on the boards and their history. I was curious how you all feel about the tool. Does it work? Is it capable of the things that it's gained a reputation for? Or is it just a game?

We all have different ways of practicing so I'm interested in your personal beliefs but if you know a Coven or group of Wiccans who feel a certain way, feel free to include that as well!

For me Wicca is about duality, light and dark creating all. So I don't personally believe in evil. I understand there is negative energy however you decide to interpret it, but Wiccans generally don't follow the good vs evil structure that many other religions focus on. So I am curious how other practitioners view the device! Do you personally use it in your craft or do you avoid it at all costs?

&#x200B;

Thanks for commenting and feel free to ask me any questions too!Sorry if this is a weird question! I'm a transmasc enby and I've been looking into paganism and witchcraft for a while now but I don't think I'm educated or experienced enough to answer this question on my own.

I've been compiling a list of names I like since the name I currently go by isn't working for me. Several deity names have caught my eye but I fear it may come off as disrespectful to those deities. Especially if, when my friends are talking to me, said deity's name is quickly followed up with "you dumb idiot". I know people name themselves or their children after biblical figures but I feel that's a bit different from naming yourself after an actual deity.

I‚Äôm currently a high school student looking for more information about Wicca, partially because of an assignment about religions and lifestyles but also because I‚Äôve always found it fascinating. I‚Äôm looking for someone (or multiple people) to talk to about what drew them to Wicca, what their experience is with Wicca, and just about what Wicca is. 
I‚Äôm a complete novice, and to be honest I don‚Äôt know much other than some information on the sabbats and a bit of abstract information, but I would love to learn more!hello everyone!! I am very new to witchcraft and was hoping to get some guidance as to where I can start and how to start! anything will be helpful as I know nothing lol thank you all!! <3Hello, I‚Äôm somewhat new to Wicca. My mother and my aunt both used to practice, but my mother has decided to revert back to Christianity and my aunt simply decided to close that chapter of her life. My aunt did advise me to find a mentor, to help guide me and teach me what I need to know. I know some basic knowledge, but my mother quit when I was somewhat young and tried to shelter me from any further knowledge I might gain.Hokay, so i want to start off by saying that i am not Wiccan (and have very little experience with it).  One of my closest friends however, is Wiccan, and is also in dire need for a upgrade for their altar.  This started about a month ago on a casual call when i had overheard them fussing about their current alar (setup or just specific parts of the altar, i forget).  I had asked them about it and they gave a brief explanation about what their setup was supposed to look like, and what they had.

I also want to side-note that religion was never a big topic between us.  It's not that any of our friends disapproved, rather religion just wasn't a critical aspect of our friendship.  Sometimes they would doodle little protection sigils in my sketchbook, and some of us would take turns reminding them to recharge their crystals when a full moon was coming up.  One time they even conspired with our DM during a DND one-off christmas session so their character could plot to destroy christmas and replace it with a "uber-sexy wine and paint pretty ladies" themed holiday.  So we're all very comfortable/casual about it, but they never talk about any of the specifics. i.e what type of witch they are, what rituals do they practice (i did hear them mention they use something with a pendulum and box of sand before though, and maybe something about divining) etc, etc.

So it's been pretty hard to pin down what they do specifically, and from what i can tell, wicca can widely vary based on the practicing individual.  And i cant ask them about it because it would be pretty suspicious if i suddenly took interest in that very specific part of their altar that i intend to replace.  This is because said friend is very perceptive and i want to keep this as a surprise.

The part of their altar that i want to get a replacement for, i've only seen in the background of a few videocalls, and their description of it, so here's what i've put together:  There are two items in this part of their altar, and they're each supposed to have cup/basin in them to hold water.  They should also have some sort of statue part to them.  I know they're supposed to be statues of different things for each cup/basin (representing different deities i think), but i only know that one of them should be of a goat (the other might be of a lady, but i'm not one-hundred-percent sure about that).  These statue/basins should be on each side of the altar (with a candle in the middle i think.  maybe some sage as well?)

I've tried looking on google, but with my smooth brain and the limited information i have, i can't find anything helpful.  Does anyone knows what this might be?  Also if anyone knows of any herbs/other things i could get them, it would be greatly appreciated!Hello everyone! I am doing a research project on the Wicca community to learn more about this religion. I am genuinely interested to find out more about this religion. I have attached a quick survey to learn more about this religion, it is completely anonymous so your answers will remain confidential. Any and everyone can take this survey! Thank you so much for your time! Have a great day Wiccans!

Earlier today i was readying myself for work, prrocrastination a large factor as usual. 

Standing in the kitchen bagging up all my crap, i have a double door leadingnto my back yard. I so happened to glance out my the windows of said door and swore that I'd just seen a large buck/bull/whatever you call an adult male.

This was only for about a split second. Mind you i was home alone and nothing was outside was my dog, he barely comes up to my shins, this thing was chest high. I can almost guarantee there was no wild animal in my back yard as my dog would have flipped shit.

Wondering at this point if thus was me tripping or i actually saw something.

Things ive been using to debunk what i saw:

The "little white bar blinds" (cant think of what they're called right now. The annoying ones that usually have sets of strings you have to pull) were only slightly open, enough to see the back yard.

I have a slightly irrational fear of "Wendigos". Been thinking about them alot since i picked up Fallout 76 on sale. 

My dog like to wonder around my back door just for the hell of it.

Lastly, general paranoia because i constantly feel like something watches me. Nothing evil that i habe noticed yet. But again, most likely me being paranoid.

Reaponses appreciated
-KyloI don‚Äôt have very many options in terms of shops to go too for crystals, tools and books, so online shopping is basically my best friend right now. However I‚Äôm super new and I‚Äôm not sure what online stores or websites are the best. I use Etsy, eBay and Amazon, and I‚Äôm willing to look at other websites too, any suggestions would be great please!I know magic work is primarily based on intent and strength of will, but I intend to attempt a protection spell for my family and protesters under the full moon. I genuinely don't have much as far as spell jar ingredients or materials to work with but I do have:
A variety of crystals
Cat whiskers
White sage bundle(this was purchases LOOONG ago, I have no intent to purchase more bundles, but don't want to let it go to waste) 
Pink salt
A massive amount of essential oils
tiny glass charm jars as well as old glass baby food jars
And humanely sourced turtle scoots (I have a turtle, she sheds her scoots naturally and I collect them from her tank)

I'm also going to the store after work to get a white candle and sea salt.

I don't have a cauldron or mortar and pestle for grinding.

Lastly, Im also very naturally attuned to energies, I always have been, and comfortable working with energy.

I'd like to learn the best method for sigil casting so that I can add it to my spell, and I'm curious, of the materials I have available to me, how best to infuse the biggest oomph possible to my spell to cast protection on my family and all the protesters.

Any and all tips and advice is welcome. I'm all ears. Well, eyes. LolHello, and blessed be, everyone! My name is River. I'm a 21-year-old enigma of a witch with very little practice under my belt despite my heavy reading upon theology in general (not just Wicca).

I hope we can all live long, kindly, supportive lives as followers of the Goddess and God![cross posting in a few subs]

Thoughts on digital Grimoires/Book of Shadows?

I have a leather bound parchment book I‚Äôve been using. I decided to copy it all down to my notability app on my iPad using my Apple Pencil so it‚Äôs still hand written (I prefer that over typing) and have started liking it better than the physical book. I wanted a copy saved because one time an unfortunate event happened that destroyed my BoS and I lost everything in it. 

I love that I can rearrange the digital as many times as I want. It‚Äôs also limitless in terms of number of pages and I can easily search for terms. Does anyone use a digital one? Pros and cons? Honestly at this point I think I just like the aesthetic of the physical one but that‚Äôs about it... help!I‚Äôve been practicing a mediation to connect with deities as I‚Äôve recently started trying to further my mediations last relaxing.

It was about 4:30am (not sure if that‚Äôs relevant) but I decided to try it because I really couldn‚Äôt sleep.

Anyway, so I‚Äôm practicing the mediation and I feel the presence of what I think was a goddess? She had black hair and what I think were either black wings or maybe long sleeves off her dress/robe. She was also absolutely stunning. I googled her appearance and all that came up was Nyx.

I don‚Äôt want to jump the gun and assume it‚Äôs her, but if it was what other signs should I look for?I recently traveled to england and I was exploring some very old churches and grave yards. While I was there I came across something I haven‚Äôt seen in grave yard witching before, teeth.  I saw on not all graves but many graves here and there a tooth. I know teeth don‚Äôt really decompose but I don‚Äôt think they were very old or that they had been there very long but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Some looked like whole human teeth and others seemed to be animal teeth. Does anyone know of any spells that use teeth on grave yards or any reasons these teeth might be on the graves?Hello, I was unable to post on the intoruction thread so a little about myself. 

I'm Zoe a 19 year old Athiest, wicca has been the only thing to catch my eye in the terms of religion. I'd like to learn more and find a sense of peace hopefully with it. 

If anyone could help me get into Wicca I'd appreciate it!I know Scott Cunningham is generally the best place to start, but I have a really active job and listen to my books on audible. Unfortunately, his titles are just so dry to listen to. Has anyone found any titles that are full of great information whilst also being captivating to listen to?Hi!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq\_mFcHnedMOkay so for the past couple of days I've been experiencing weird things that usually don't happen to me.  Keep in mind that I've always have had beliefs in the supernatural and I'm on a journey on how exactly to pursue that.  I've never had visions or anything, but I can't stop thinking about it.  So I am in crisis right now I just found out the the love of my life, my boyfriend Rick has been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer and you could say I'm pretty upset about it.  The day the doctor confirmed it is when I started having these visions.  I'm at my house grabbing stuff for my boyfriend and I can feel a bad panic attack come on so I sit down trying to calm with transcendental meditation which was helping, I closed my eyes and was taking deep breaths and suddenly I seen a bunch of women holding candles white candles and all the candles were pointed in circle where all the flames met in the center that's all I seen.  The second vision I seen I was in the parking lot of the hospital getting my shit together to go in and I keep seeing someone going down a dark hall with a bunch of big golden frames and all of the frames are empty except for one and it's an oil painting of this woman with short blonde hair. And that's all there was to that vision.  The 3rd one omg this one really freaked me out.  I  was in my car hysterically crying about the situation and all of the sudden I hear glass breaking as if it was right next to me like a sheet of glass had just been broken near me and there was nothing going on around me and no one to be seen.  Idk maybe I'm losing my shit but I thought I  would share maybe somebody has some insight.  Thank you.Hello all! I am new to this subreddit.
My boyfriend of 8 years and I are looking in to purchasing a home. My uncle passed away a few weeks ago and he was living in the house that my mom grew up in. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, the house is owned by my grandma and she is willing to sell it to us for a good price.
While my mom didn‚Äôt have an awful childhood, there were definitely some unpleasant things that happened in that house (alcohol abuse, domestic violence, infidelity, etc.) and I worry about the possible negative energy. 
What can I do to cleanse the home other than smudging? Thank you!I am an eclectic witch, but new-ish to practice. 
A long time hobby of mine is urban exploring. I‚Äôve been doing it for a long time and enjoy it. With the holiday, I have a week off and decided to invite some friends exploring with me (friends I‚Äôve known for several years). These friends are hoping to make contact with spirits during our trip. 
I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in the traditional idea of ghosts, but I am nervous that people I am traveling with will be reaching out to the unknown. 
I do not plan to partake in their search, but I will be in the same locations while they are seeking their truths. What can I bring with me or what spells can I use to protect myself?Do you think that blessed herbs/crystals/ect would still hold their power if encased in resin? I am thinking of creating some pendants for this purpose.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this on or not, I‚Äôm a beginner Wiccan and not much of a witch but I still do like to add a bit of ‚ú®spice‚ú® to my life if you will. Haha. 

I‚Äôm interested in glamour magkic and I want to add a bit to my daily routine to enhance my physical beauty and charm, but I‚Äôm not really sure how or where to begin. Any tips? Spells? Rituals? Or any kind of glamour magkic I can do to look more beautiful and be more charming? 

Blessed beFor context, this happened when I was 16 and I‚Äôm 21 now. My friend at the time was very spiritual and it rubbed off on me, I was into testing my intuition and used to be a Wiccan at the time. I quickly grew out of it and ever since then I‚Äôve been doubtful and only believe in science, though a small part of me wants/wishes that it were real. We watched a WWII documentary in history class and saw clips of soldiers. Immediately afterwards, I started to get a flood of information about a someone- a young blond man named James Forrester who fought in the war but died in combat. More and more details came to me over the next day or two: He was born in 1923 and died in 1943. He was American and lived on a farm in the south. His middle name was Edward. He was childhood friends with a girl named Martha who he had feelings for. He had a lot of siblings and was one of the youngest ones. He died young. I decided to research him to see if I was right somehow or if I was just crazy. The scariest thing is, I was RIGHT. If someone actually reads this and asks for it, there will be a link for an obituary of him in the comments. 
I got all of the details right except for the hair. FYI, Mountain City is in Tennessee, aka south. Then I found out I was even right about Martha and that he was the one of the youngest siblings by looking through the 1940 census: once again, leave a comment for a pic of it, I can‚Äôt post a link because it‚Äôs no longer available on Google Books. 
Martha was almost the same age as him and James was the second youngest child. Holy shit!!! All these years later and I don‚Äôt know what to think of it. By the way, if you decide to search up his name yourself you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs hard to find him, he wasn‚Äôt well known whatsoever. This shows that he wasn‚Äôt an unconscious memory coming back to me because there‚Äôs no way I would have heard of him beforehand, you could only find him if you had specific information. 6 months after this revelation, I had a dream. It was me sitting at the table with James‚Äô father and brother. We were in a small kitchen that looked like a farm. All I remember is his brother giving me a hint because I asked who he was, he simply said ‚ÄúH.‚Äù It turns out one of his brother‚Äôs name was Hobert. To be fair, this one could have been an unconscious memory since I found the info 6 months prior. Anyways, what am I supposed to make from this crazy experience?!So I've just finished Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner and started reading the second book. I know I'll finish it soon and was looking for recommendations for other good Wicca books.‚ÄúJust imagine that you are across the room, looking at your physical form. Now, will yourself to actually BE in your spirit form across the room‚Äù

WTH DOES THAT EVEN MEAN??Hey Everyone!


Looking for a house hunting spell. Our dream home got bought out from under us because the selling realtor is a Beech. So our search continues. 

Anything would be appreciated! Thanks :)I need some advice/ help. So, last night I was scrolling through tik tok and came across one where a woman was using the reality ripple effect on her altar and something with horns showed up. I read in the comments most people saying it was a diety showing herself, more specifically Lilith. I sent this to my boyfriend because I thought it was really cool and jumped in the shower. I got out of the shower to my boyfriend freaking out over the tik tok. He didn‚Äôt see the reality ripple in the video, he actually saw a figure of a woman. He got up to come tell me about it and then got the over whelming feeling to look in our room. When he did he say the same woman. He said she was absolutely beautiful, dark long hair and horns. She was sitting on my dresser with her legs crossed and one arm down and out and one arm bent out toward the side. (We rearranged our room this weekend and this is where my altar used to be). What does this all mean and what, if anything should I do about it? I‚Äôm new to this stuff so I don‚Äôt know where to begin. My boyfriend is also freaking out because he‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed to be an atheist and this stuff doesn‚Äôt happen‚Äù 
TIA.Hi all im new to this sub reddit. I have been practicing my craft for a while now and I keep a self-love poppet above my bed on the window sill. I've come home twice now to the poppet laying neatly next to my pillow on my bed. The first time it happened, the poppet was face up and the second time (Today) it was face down on the bed. The poppet was also oriented with its feet toward the foot of the bed, like how I normally lay in bed. Nothing in my home could have moved the poppet, especially not so far. I live alone and the doll is not light enough to be knocked over by a gust of wind etc. Let alone, for it to be positioned in the way it was on the bed. Does anyone have an idea of what this could mean? Any advice on how to handle this? Or if anything needs to be done about it at all. It doesn't scare me or worry me, I'm just curious.Hi there,

My name is Saber and I'm new to the craft. I've been meditating for a bit and had a few questions about some experiences. I believe I've gone into the astral plane accidentally when meditating. At one point, I decided to look at my hands and they were purple. I'm thinking this is the color of my aura.

From what I know about the color, it's based off of intuition and psychic ability. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible to utilize this information and use it in my craft?So I don't have many ways to collect rain water, so if I get the water from a puddle during a storm is it still rain water? If not what are some things I can due with it?Hi! To make a (very) long story short, I am moving away from a place that harbors a lot of negative energy, and many bad memories. I know things won‚Äôt be perfect in my new space, but I want to do my best to start clean. So far I‚Äôve only practiced Wicca in solitude and my altar is pretty bare. BUT I have an appt at my local occult store on Thursday (that‚Äôs the only way we can shop there right now) for supplies. I am eager for advice about how to both cleanse my new space but also remove any negativity that could be carried over from the possessions I‚Äôm bringing. Any and all input is greatly appreciated, and I can provide more details about my situation as needed. Thank you.I have recently started my first nursing position, and I have had a few patients passing on (a lot of covid patients) and while I typically do a ritual when I get home to help guide them I have been working extreme overtime and it‚Äôs getting difficult to do so. I‚Äôm also having a difficult time creating a shorter version of my current ritual/creating a new short ritual all together. I haven‚Äôt been drawn to anything that I‚Äôve researched and I would like to do it while I‚Äôm taking care of their body. Any suggestions? (Sorry if this is incoherent, I haven‚Äôt slept in 48 hours)So, the thing is, I have a doll. And old doll, my mom remembers my grandma used to own it, and maybe even her mother before that. From what I can tell its made out of mostly textiles and hay with movable limbs connected to the body by metal rods. It came into my life surprisingly and unexpectedly about 2 years ago and I just absolutely loved it, the hauntingly creepy look to it just really spoke to me. And I didn't think anything of it! I put it in my room and life went on.

I had a more spiritually inclined friend sleep over at my place and at first he didn't say anything about it. Not until I talked about it and how weird it was how I found it and he mentions that, oh yeah, that thing does absolutely not like him when he's over at my place. That whatever is in it, or is it, doesn't like him. The way he said it clearly indicated he thought something was attached to the doll. 
And ironically enough the same friend did end up hurting me pretty badly so I cannot blame the dolls dislike of him. 

Now while I dabble in tarot and learn wicca between life's many twists and turns, I've never been spiritually inclined. As in, I don't really experience any pull or feelings while being anywhere, even if it most likely has a rich spiritual life. And I know that, I'll probably work on it but for now I'm basically blind in that sense. So to me, I've never had any weird feeling about the doll, I just really liked it.

I should explain how I found the doll as well, as it's really really weird and basically the only paranormal thing that has happened to me. Like most people we keep our Christmas decorations in two large cardboard boxes, they have lids but they're very loosely on and easily fall off. And two years ago, at Christmas time, we brought them up from the apartment complex cellars and of course started unpacking. In one of these boxes, suddenly I find this doll. Lacking an arm and with scratches over it exposing the hay. Never have I seen this doll ever before and it certainly wasn't there last Christmas. Like I said, I love it instantly and ask mom if I can keep it, she looks at me weird but says sure. It has a horse and carriage too which we have kept but it's kept in a completely different location then the boxes. So I've never been sure how it managed to get into the boxes, while it was weird, I didn't think too much of it as I was just happy to have found this delightfully creepy doll.

AND as a final detail and why I'm writing this whole thing is, as I pulled out my tarot card deck again after ages, I also took my little doll with me since it was just sitting there anyways. And for once, when I pulled a card from the deck to do a simple one card reading, it actually felt like it had an impact as soon as I saw the face of the card. Like really weird, as if I was mentally falling "deeper" into sleep. I did another couple readings and had almost the same effect, if just a little lesser in strength.

And this could just be me having grown into a more true version of myself and therefore being more open to the cards and forming a better bond. But I just noticed the fact that I did have the doll with me and I did kind of ask it the same question I asked the cards, channeling my intentions into boht the card and the doll.

Now I'm not sure how or what to do with this doll, if I should think that there might be something more to it (and if I should look into releasing whatever it is) or if I should just chalk it up to my own personal growth. I'm absolutely new to this stuff and have only read things that warn of entities being attached to objects and people because of its negative effects so I don't exactly wanna assume whatever the doll could be is gonna help me out. Anyone got any similar stories or just an idea of what's up with this thing? Or maybe just advice me in letting go of the doll and just letting it be a charming decoration to my room.I am new to Wicca. I have only been really doing anything with it for a little under a month. I‚Äôm curious on how one goes about finding a patron God or Goddess. I was big on studying different pantheons before I discovered Wicca so I want to make sure that I am not thinking a deity is calling me and it‚Äôs really just my brain saying ‚Äúhey you liked this deity when you studied that pantheon.‚Äù Any advice would be greatly appreciatedI got this book...I‚Äôve always been interested but I‚Äôm still off work and I figured now is the best time to do it. I‚Äôm ready to really get connected with myself and my gifts. I want to gain control of my abilities. I want to be positive and confident. Overall, I want to be content with what I‚Äôve been blessed with. Where the hell do I start? Besides the book, obviously.Hello! I've been Wiccan for about two years now and I think I'm finally closing in on a certain path. I feel like I'm supposed to follow a path that connects with spirits, communicating with the dead and is almost a mixture of shamanism, hoodoo, and voodoo. I just don't know which way to turn pantheon wise. I've worshipped mainly Cernnunos, Tyr and Aphrodite in the past and now I'm sort of drawn to the Norse pantheon but it's still not quite right to me. Something's off. I was just wondering if anyone has a similar path to me and can maybe give me some advice on how you found your path and maybe how you worship specifically? I feel like it could help potentially point me in a direction that could help me better understand which pantheon or god and goddess might fit me better. Thank you for any advice or help you'd be willing to give! Blessed be. ‚ù§Hey everyone, I am a baby witch of sorts, I'm 26 and had begun my journey as an independent pagan practitioner as a teen with oodles of research, but due to life circumstances I've been out of touch with my path for years and just now making my way back and don't remember much of what I'd learned. I've always been drawn to energy work, crystals and moon magic specifically, and just got a nice set of small polished crystals/gemstones to work with. Tonight is the new moon and figured it was the perfect time to cleanse and charge my new babies so I have them set out to cleanse and charge in the new moons powerful energy. However, I live in a city where light pollution is a fairly bad problem and I'm concerned about the effectiveness of moon bathing my stones with so much artificial light cast over them as well. Many of my stones are not water safe, I don't have the materials for smoke cleansing yet, I don't feel comfortable burying them just yet, and I'd prefer to preserve their color vibrance for as long as possible so I'm avoiding sun cleansing and charging for now. And of course I'm heavily drawn to the moon so moon cleansing and charging is my most preferred method. Does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement? Anyone else in a light polluted city successfully bathe their crystals in the moon energy?

(cross posted)Hello! I have friends who are a couple, and they‚Äôve been trying to conceive for many years, but are having lots of trouble.

PS; If you also have suggestions I am all ears, thank you!me and my friend have just started getting into witchcraft and the wicca community, but we don‚Äôt really know where to start and i just want some advice on where to start with the craft and some good places to learn more about it. with school being off and my summer basically starting i feel like now is a good time to open up myself to new opportunities and want some help with this, thanks!To Elaborate my sister has been seeing what she describes as a dark purple mist in her closet doesn't want to be in her room.

Over the past few years my younger brother and I have been extremely interested in becoming apart of Wicca. I was wondering if there is any advice we should know / should follow. We have been reading books for years and I myself have always felt a strong pull to Wicca ever since I was younger. We‚Äôve always been introduced to the ways of Wicca since we were small (readings, experiences etc) and we‚Äôre finally feeling ready to fully commit. Please help us out, we would be very appreciative!Hello! First time posting! I had a dream a few nights ago that I felt meant something and have been thinking about it ever since. I was wondering if I could ask the help of you guys for any interpretation/meanings/symbolism. I‚Äôm pretty new yet, so I am still ignorant of most things.  So in my dream two white foxes appeared to me. They were beautiful, almost spirit-like, with big flowing tails. They had on them a gold chain leash with a bright essence. It was like in Disney‚Äôs Hercules where the gods are all glowing. I (in my dream) somehow knew if I held onto the chains and kept the foxes near/with me wherever I went, I would be protected/they would be my guardians. Has anyone heard of anything like this? Is this a message from a deity? If so, which one? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFdsYkCFgGI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFdsYkCFgGI&feature=youtu.be)Okay this is going to be a mildly-confusing story. It‚Äôs quite short but so much happened that I have no explanation for.

It was Christmas Day and we were going around and opening our gifts. I sat down on the couch with some gift (can‚Äôt quite remember). I looked down and the strangest vision I‚Äôve ever come across in my life occurred. It was if I was in a completely different setting.

It was dark, blue and gloomy. I was staring at a wooden floor. When I looked up, I saw a completely different setup from my home. There was furniture that was replace with a living space that looked like a wooden loft-style home.

I‚Äôm not sure what I saw, why I saw it, and if I should look further into it. That was the first time something like that has happened, and it only lasted a couple seconds. When I came to, I felt like I came back to my body.

Would love some feedback, as it‚Äôs been on my mind since it happened. Thanks!I so badly want to start my journey. I've been interested in Wicca my entire life, I'm 27. I have never been very good at routines/religion but I am really feeling a calling to get my shit together and set up an alter. I don't know where to start. I need a guide, a book, a mentor, a list - a beginning. I don't know much, mostly just some herbal remedies, unfortunately, I have no green thumb. I am drawn to healing and helping others. Some advice would be greatly appreciated.Currently my beliefs can be summed up as 'positive energy out and the universe knows the way'. In a conversation recently I was directed towards Wicca. I did a little looking/research online but now I'd like to get some good reading materials and somemore direction as to where to go next. Advise/guidance appreciated üòäSo, I‚Äôve always been interested in Wicca. It‚Äôs just something that I‚Äôve always gravitated towards. However, I am EXTREMELY IGNORANT in what this mysterious world entails and how to get started. I feel like I should start by, of course, doing my research, but I don‚Äôt know where to start. What should I be searching for? How do I know if it‚Äôs right for me? Help!!My mom made a spell of her own and her and I no longer speak of different reasons but she did teach me a lot about Wicca but unfortunately getting rid of someone else‚Äôs spell jar never came up and now I am searching for some help on how to properly get rid of it as I don‚Äôt want it to go with us when we move. I‚Äôm pretty sure she put some of her husband‚Äôs hair in it to keep him in her life and I have different beliefs on if she should be with him or not and I don‚Äôt really want him in my life as much he was in hers. Don‚Äôt get be wrong he‚Äôs not a bad person he just makes bad choices and doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing in life and I want to keep myself from that as much as possible even if he did step up and be a dad when I needed one‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm rambling anyways can someone help me with my dilemma?? Anything helpsI feel like I need to know more about them to connect with them. I'm looking for links or websites or resources to read and gain more knowledge about deities from each mythologies.. any leads would be appreciated! ‚ù§üå±I previously did a spell involving writing a name on a piece of paper. Now I want to undo this spell but I heard from someone else that burning paper with someone‚Äôs name on it is casting a hex. I  did this spell a long time ago and I need to let it go, can I burn the paper?So to start off, I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Wicca despite my interest and research. 

I am almost certain there is something not so good going on and I'd like to find out how to be for certain if its a hex or something else. 

Back story,  but shortened:

About two years ago I met a man who was absolutely wonderful and we decided to move in together after 8 months of seeing each other. Well, ex-wife despises my kids and I. Shes crashed into our vehicles purposely, jumped my daughter and I,  threatened our lives,  drugged my bf, spread rumors of horrendous things, knows when things start getting better around here and will start problems again, soon much more, too.  All in about a year and a half. 
Here's where I feel a hex or cure (terminology is probably off, I apologize) has come into mind. 
We've have 6 animals die (not all so mysteriously. But the most bonded to us ones have had very odd deaths), my hairs falling out, my bf is ill constantly, ect..and everything just seems so off. 
What can I do to figure out if its this property,  her, or is that even possible? 

Thank you so much for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated and welcomed.I have meditation apps, hypnosis apps, sleep apps which is great no then I can drown out hubby‚Äôs snoring and listen to something else. 

HOWEVER
My dad has end stage glioblastoma and is like to at least have made a brief forway into astral projection. So my question is‚Ä¶WTF does it mean when a narrator (or all of them) tells you to ‚Äúraise your vibration‚Äù. And I‚Äôm always like ‚ÄúOK sweet, walk me through it‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Welp‚Ä¶guess I won‚Äôt come spiritually guide you later on. 

Help!!
P.S. how does one transfer their subconscious to the ethereal self? Yeah I can close my eyes and imagine/remember everything but that‚Äôs just my imagination. 

CatieIs it possible?Hey there y'all! My name is Andy. I have done a lot of research on Wicca over the years. I am at a crossroads in my life where I think that I am ready to start my commitment to this. I did not know if anyone was aware of books, apps, etc that I could use to launch myself into this. And if anyone has wisdom, or guidance- I am all ears. I hope y'all are healthy, and happy. Thank you for your time! :)Hi all, I was just wondering if there‚Äôs a possible meaning or explanation behind a red peony being left at my front door. 
Thanks for any helpI'm a writer and in my current work, I am in need of a sigil to represent a wolf. I'm an amateur in the Wicca community and am not sure of how sigils work tbh. I've tried doing research but I get different answers each time and I want to make my historical and cultural aspects as authentic as I can in the plot, so my best bet is actually asking people with first-hand knowledge instead of Wikipedia. if someone could point me in the right direction or show me what a sigil for a wolf/wolves would look like that would be amazing. tia xxHello I was just wondering if anyone had any tips on how to protect myself from a negative presence in my house?

I have just moved into a new home and a certain room in my house has very bad energy. I feel I am being watched, have heard noises like banging and slamming doors in the night and have woke up with unexplained bruises on my arms and legs in the shape of thumb prints.

Would anyone be able to recommend methods to protect myself or be able to provide insight in to what it might be in the house?  I am new to the practice so any knowledge would be much appreciated.

Thank you.Tho I was obviously born to this world, I constantly experience memories and scenes from worlds near and far. This molded my belief In the infinite. Consequently I am privy to the fact that I have been several powerful beings who wielded potent magics. The trouble is that I can‚Äôt invoke significant magic here: I can still tap into other realities with vision and can even feel the inherent transfer of energies. I was wondering if witches in this world have any access to the powers I seek or is ur magic like religious magic where the belief alone is wat empowers you?What are some Litha rituals, traditions, and recipes that you guys are excited to do/make this coming week?For the longest time I assumed the god(dess) reaching out to me was Aphrodite, but after sitting with my alter and just trying to connect with her better I came to the semi-conclusion that it‚Äôs not Aphrodite but Eros. 

What should I do? I‚Äôm still a beginner and I‚Äôm still new to all this but my friend who‚Äôs been teaching me for a few years hasn‚Äôt had this happen to her and advised I research but it‚Äôs pretty vague trying to google this sort of thing.I've been interested in Wicca for a while but I've only started properly researching it recently. The sources are sort of scattered and there's a lot of conflicting information so I wanted to ask if you guys could give me some trusted sources, basic information stuff like explaining the difference between Wicca and paganism, the different paths, etc. I just need somewhere to start.hello everyone, my name is Kat and im 19. i have always been interested in Wicca as it identifies with what i believe. i have some questions..
1) what diety do you worship?
2) what drew you to being a wiccan? 
3) what is some advice you would give a new witch?hi! i‚Äôm interested in studying wicca/witchcraft(which term is correct?) but i have no idea where to start! what are the best sites/books/influencers to learn from? what staples should i have? i have an alter that belonged to my grandmother and like one or two books, but that‚Äôs it. i‚Äôm mostly  interested in protection.  where do i start?As stated I would like to look into abjuration type magic, but google only gives me DND crap. Is there at least another name it goes by that would make it easier to search for info and instructions. I guess I could search protection magic, but that feels like too wide a net. (I have also posted this on r/wicca to reach other people. I will be notified if you answer on either, so don't feel you need to answer on both.)I'm gonna post this on a few subs for optimal answers. But! I was looking mainly for books on crystals and what they all mean. Preferably with pictures. I also wanna start learning more on herbalism for wicca so those books are great too! Thank you! Really any books to help me learn. I already have a few Scott Cunningham books as he seems to be the best of the best for self teaching and I just like his style. 

*May the earth be kind to you* Different phases of Luna represent different aspects of the Goddess:

The first slice of the growing moon (waxing crescent) represents Quality.

Then luna moves to Trait.

Half-Luna represents Virtue.

Then we move to Character.

Finally there is Morals!

Full Luna is Integrity!

Black Luna is Knowledge!Hiii! Happy Beltane! So this may be a very stupid obvious question but I haven't been able to find an answer!!! When it comes to spell casting do I need to follow a specific recipe or can I wing it?
Like if I want to cast a good luck spell can I harvest things that represent luck to me or should I follow a specific recipe? Thanks in advance and I'm sorry if this sounds stupid! ü•∫üëâüèªüëàüèªSorry for my english. That person is hospital right now with blood clot on the head, is something that you should do if you read something very bad or you can't change the situation?

Advice for tarot?

I ask for future to know what to do if happendsI posted this in r/Wicca and realized this would be a much better place for it.

I'd like to attempt a very simple cleansing spell with a black candle for banishing negativity, a white candle for peace of mind, and a green  for healing? Am I on the right track with this?I know this may be a long shot but I'm looking for a way transfer someone's pain. I know I can't just turn something into nothing. At the very least I want to (in a healthy manner) take a person's pain or turmoil, using myself as a vessel. the only reason I believe this is possible is because there have been a number of times where I have calmed a person or animal by feeling calm myself and pushing outwards. I've tried the exact inverse but I haven't had any luck.. 

Thank you for any helpHi, I'm a baby witch and i don't practice very often although I like to research and involve myself within the community.

Recently I've been having a problem of what I believe a spirit has followed me home. I went through a very depressive period in January and am slowing trying to work my way out of it. I believe while I was out of my home, during my low period, a spirit attached themselves to me or followed me home. (This has never happened before until now)

A week ago I was watching a video of this Christian woman praying and the lanterns hanging in my room dropped violently out of nowhere. Ever since I have felt an unease in my room and at night. I rarely ever dream, but lately I've been having "bad dreams". I call them bad dreams because they seem like stereotypical nightmares of being chased by a killer or a spirit like in a horror movie but I feel no fear in the dream or when i wake up. 

I want to feel safe in my own home again and believe a cleansing may help I'm just not sure how to quite do it, if any witches can please give some advice on what I'd need or what to do, to please let me know! I also have a ring given to me by my partner and I'm thinking of casting a protection spell onto it as well, so hopefully that helps my situation as well! Thank you!I am not a practicing witch. But, ever since I was little I've felt very drawn to more spiritual things. I started having very religious/ancient themed and sometimes satanic dreams as a little girl. I started trying to do seances and using a ouija board when I was around young. I stopped doing all of that eventually because I was afraid of getting a dark attachment.

I'm 23 now and six months ago I had a dream that has stuck with me since. I was crossing this bridge surrounded by beautiful nature and this woman was pulling me with her hand. She kept smiling at me and it was apparent that she really wanted to me to keep following her. As we kept crossing the bridge her face started morphing to faces of beautiful woman. Eventually her face morphed into my own face and I started to feel sick and weak. I started feeling like I wasn't able to keep walking. We ended up at a clearing in woods and it was a beautiful place, it looked like a sanctuary. I laid down on the ground and she was staring at me. Her face started to change into a horrifying, and hideous and evil face. I realized that she was trying to kill me. Once I realized what was happening I screamed that I wouldn't let her take me and that I love GOD. She screamed F\*\*K YOU and I woke up scared and in a trance.

This dream has stuck with me since. Recently, I have been more interested in witchcraft and have been reading a lot about it but i'm almost scared that somehow this is all related. Is there any figures in witchcraft who are like this woman from my dream, or am I making something out of nothing? Thank you for your help!So today we got Uruz!

I have been reading and looking on my own, just looking for some personal experience. 
The spell is for a friend who is going through a nasty divorce. There are kids involved, so I would ideally like to do this within white light. One spell I found involved a bath, but it has A LOT of baking soda in it. 
Blessed be. üíóHi! I'm kinda new to the whole wiccan thing, as in I hardly know anything besides what I researched a few years ago, and I'd like to learn more before I just throw myself into it headfirst! I'd like to know of any reliable sources I could read or watch to gain a better grasp, as well as things like different types of wiccans, magic/spells, rituals, or just really anything! I'm also curious as to which terminology is okay and what isn't, as it seems to be a controversial sunject to some (such as if "witch" is appropriate or okay)I am still a little new to wicca in some areas I was wondering if there is a common language that wiccans write inHello everyone! I am on my wiccan/witch/pagan/ neopagan exploration. I've found limited information on deities. Who do you "worship"? Who do you connect with? How did you choose them? Etc. Any information is great!My nephew is interested in Wicca and, after refusing to answer the ‚Äúwhat do you want for Christmas‚Äù  question for the past month+, just told me they want a spellbook. I‚Äôd like to give them something authentic. She‚Äôs a good kid. 
Added bonus if the extremely Christian grandmother who‚Äôs raising him and his sister won‚Äôt notice that it‚Äôs a non Christian religious text.
The kid also recently came out as gender fluid, so I‚Äôm practicing all the pronouns for them.I'd like to learn more about spell jars. I've stayed away from things like spell jars and cord cutting because it's something i see on tiktok a lot and I know tiktok is full of misinformation. It bothers me that people do these things just to be trendy. 

Anyway, all I would like is some general basic information on how they work. I'd like to make a love spell jar for my boyfriend. I know the basics of how to make one, cleanse the jar, add herbs or spices or whatever you need for the specific spell, seal it with candle wax with intention.Hello! I'm fairly new to neopaganistic thought. I have some familiarity with magick practices and beliefs but I've only just recently truly began my road to deeper knowledge. Because of personal bias I'm a little skeptical about just picking up some random book on the subject and I would love for good reference suggestions on where to start my magickal furthermore!I've started doing some shadow work and am worried about self sabotage, is it possible to do a binding spell on myself from stopping myself from doing any harm to myself? I obviously wouldn't have negative intentions but would there be a 3 fold rule?I lost someone very close to me last month. And now I still feel like I haven't sent him off properly. I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me an opinion on this. Does anyone know a good ritual or anything I can do for someone who's dead?Me and my significant other are just starting to research Wiccan, witch , warlock, etc. And we are very interested but don't know where to start? Any advice would greatly help and be appreciated. Sending good energy to all :)Ideas for what to place on my alter? I've been building it up so I have a proper place to practice, but I don't really know what should go there other than candles and crystals.Hello!! I'm a baby witch just starting out and I have a question regarding moving another witches spells! My mother was (as far as i know) researching Wicca and was interested in witchcraft and things of the sort. She has since passed away but recently I discovered what appears to be a spell jar with her belongings. Inside the jar it seems to be some soil from her time visiting in Scotland (my stepdad was from there) and a pinkish looking crystal, sealed with a clear wax and a blue ribbon tied around the neck of the bottle. My question is, would taking the spell jar to my house or moving it bring any ill-will towards me? I'm very new to witchcraft and I'm not sure if moving another witches spell jar could bring negative energy onto me? Also, does anyone know of what this spell jar could possibly be for or signify? Can someone please help me out? Thanks in advance!!The last THREE days in a row I have had spiders come into my bedroom! Each spider has been diffrent in size, colour, leg length, and speed!! I've been going through a "second" spiritual awakening, and feel more connected to my craft than ever.  Are the spiders related to this?? If so what on Earth do they mean??and their descendants. Looking for information and resources. Thank-youI'm not a Wiccan at all, but I need help to understand why she may have taken my pic of me as a boy.. and I also she may have practice dark Magik. And the reason why I say that is because she simply doesn't believe there is nothing bad with dark Magik. I don't know either way, I just want to find our why if she did do this.For the past week the word obsidian keeps coming up. I know it‚Äôs said to be a protective and healing stone.I want a physical spiritual outlet that is more then praying, or meditation, so I'm searching. Are there any books or writings I can be directed to?So I live in a small suburban community and there‚Äôs some woods behind where I live. I walk my two dogs there regularly and have noticed something, every night I see, in around the same spot. A light. I never go near it, it‚Äôs a good bit off the beaten path, and whenever I go there in the day there‚Äôs nothing. 

Let me describe it, it‚Äôs near the ground, only about a foot off of it (I can‚Äôt really tell in the dark) it‚Äôs yellowish orange, sort of like fire, but there isn‚Äôt as much red to its color. 

So I originally thought i was just seeing a streetlight from a gap in the trees, but then I realized, the road in that direction is hundreds of meters away, and the streetlights in my town are fluorescent white, not at a the color of this thing. 

It‚Äôs mostly in the same spot, and I‚Äôve never gone near it. (Tbh I‚Äôm terrified of it) The first thing that pops into my head personally is a Will-o the wisp. (I‚Äôm not an expert, semi new to paganism) but as far as I understand those dwell in swamps, and though there is a swamp near my house, it‚Äôs well over five miles away.

It hasn‚Äôt done anything, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs closer or further away on some nights. It‚Äôs never come near my path though so I try to avoid it. Any advice on what to do? I don‚Äôt necessarily want to get rid of it, it hasn‚Äôt done anything to me, I just want it further away from my house. Or some reassurance of what it even is.So... Kinda baby witch here. I am clairaudient and clairsentient. I had been working with my primary God for some time, but for learning in the Astral he wanted me to learn with Thor. So, doing some research, etc, I know I've done some work there with him.

Now here's where I need advice. Thor has still hung around, even when not in the Astral, and my primary God has become a bit more passive aggressive. This morning I had to open at work (be here at 3:30 am...) And I avoided astral planing as much as I could while I slept because I knew I wouldn't have as long.

This morning my primary God asked what was going on (he knows I'm up at weird times for work sometimes) and when I told him I had the opening shift, Thor showed up. There was a brief argument about how important my training is, real life work, and why I should have been there, and it ended up with Thor starting to claim I was one of his followers, which REALLY p*ssed off my primary God.

I will admit, I got a candle for Thor as a sign of respect and in thanks for him teaching me, as well as an offering with M&Ms and a cool necklace charm (that I was told by both Gods it was okay) but that has been it. It is not on my altar for my primary God, and it's just those few items.

For anyone that has worked with Thor but does not worship him, does he usually overstep boundaries like this? I am near the point of breaking the candle, giving the M&Ms to other family members in my house, and returning the charm. I have a massive headache from their arguing, and I'm almost feeling like I'm running out of options.So, in rule 8, it says that we can ask all sorts of questions (as long as they're appropriate), and they don't have to be Wiccan related. But, if this is somehow related, please tell me in the comments. Thank you.

Today, I've been feeling really strange. I've never felt this way before. It's like, I've been living for nothing. Like I don't have a purpose. I feel hollow inside, as well as being just a little light headed. I feel like I could float away.

Thank you for reading, I appreciate that. I hope you have a good day/night.I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I need help manifesting. I'm new to wicca, and i really want to try to manifest my ex to become my friend again. I've tried to manifest it before but i don't think i did it correct. I don't want him to fall in love with me or a romantic relationship, i just want to become friends again like old times. 

So can someone explain how to manifest this, or if I even can. I know there are rules in wicca, so I don't wanna have any bad karma.Hey all- my sister and I have started this journey together to learn about Wicca and we are eager to dive into everything there is to learn. She has joined some groups on Facebook but that‚Äôs not my kind of platform so I‚Äôm reaching out here to see if there is anyone who wants to throw out some tips, books I should read, where to start or any other information you may think a beginner could use. I am open to a mentor to guide me through this as I have realized that there is an insane amount of information. 
TIAHi everyone!! So.. my father and I are both wiccan. He passed away back in May this year of lung cancer. I have a lot of his crystals and some stuff that he used on a daily. Since he has passed away, how should I keep his crystals? Should I have them out and displayed? Should I keep them together put away? I don't want to disrespect him or anything..This is somewhat long. 

I bought a wand a couple years ago that I felt in tune to. I should note that I'm not a practitioner of wicca but I am a believer.  It turned out that the wand's properties are good for creativity which is absolutely wonderful because I used to write a lot and I lost my ability for that craft some time ago and it's always bothered me. Writing has always been part of who I am and for the words to longer come to me makes me feel like a part of me is missing. So when I found out that this wand might help after I got it I was pretty happy. I've left it by my computer because I was hoping it would maybe help. 

Now to my problem. I have a friend who often uses my computer and is also a fan of Harry Potter. I find that whenever my friend is using my computer they are always picking up my wand and playing with it. Twirling it around and the like. I find this bothers me. A lot . But I don't know how to say "hey can you stop playing with that, it isn't a toy," when I'm worried they're going to get offended and not understand that I'm not trying to be controlling, it's just that it feels like she's playing with a very personal item of mine.

I noticed when I showed my wand to my Wiccan friend right after getting it that she very deliberately put her hands behind her back when she leaned in for a close look. Correct me if I'm wrong but that was so she didn't attribute her energy to it, right? I mean, if someone showed me a totem of theirs, I wouldn't touch it without permission. Same with a medicine bag. 

How do I purify my wand of my friend's energies so things don't get mixed up, if I can or should? Or is it too late? Also would it be better too leave my wand by my bed instead? It felt "right" to be near my computer but maybe that's really not the best place for it. Beside my bed feels right as well but my cats are more likely to play with it themselves, so the computer was theoretically safer.

Tl;dr my friend keeps playing with my wand, how do I purify it to retune it to me.Hey everyone! I'm coming up on a year and a day of practice next week and wanted to do a self dedication. Does anyone have any suggestions for things I might do or incorporate? I know ultimately it's up to me and my practice, but I'd love some ideas!Hi, I‚Äôm new to the practice. I‚Äôve started my spiritual journey and it‚Äôs been going rather slowly. Which I‚Äôm fine with, I‚Äôve just hit a bit of a wall with my learning. My sister‚Äôs witch friend has been rather helpful and kind with helping me start to learn my practice and find my place. 
I‚Äôve been wanting to get into aura reading. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm rather sensitive to the more unseen side of things. (I started astral projecting pretty early on without intending to. Not bragging just an example of my experience.) I‚Äôm just curious on where to go for credible sources (preferably for free since I‚Äôm still in the broom closet and it‚Äôs unsafe to out myself and my practice). Any and all help would be appreciated.Hi everyone, I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologize if anything is off. 

I redid my altar yesterday. I moved a few months ago and finally decided to actually put it together with meaning instead of things just being on the table. I got out my compass and aligned the elements to each direction (N/S/E/W). Added some new herbs/dried flowers, moved some things down to a new shelf, and added a new cloth for everything to sit on. 

I‚Äôve had the most serious case of butterfingers since. I dropped and broke a vial of blessed oil, dropped the abalone shell all my stones are in, and have pretty much dropped everything in my hands since yesterday. I also did a spirit guide meditation after the fact (I really wanted to do an ancestor tarot reading & was trying to get myself there) but it was kind of bad? I‚Äôve been relating to the frog a lot lately and the first visual I had in this meditation was a bird flying and plucking the frog out of the water. 

I politely rejected whatever spirit guide was trying to enter my mind and shut it down. 

Did I royally junk up my altar or piss off an ancestor? I‚Äôve never really followed a specific layout for my altar before, just placed things where I thought they fit. Should I go back to just feeling it out? 

Any help is appreciated! Blessings ü§ìhi everyone, hope everyone is doing well! 
since quarantine ive become much more in tune with both my spirituality and the powers i possess. since ive been researching ive stumbled on my life path number of 3. from my understanding I know this means I possess the gifts of strong manifestations (gotta be careful what i wish for) but also the powers of creation and destruction. Im trying to understand what does this mean in terms of magick use? Haven‚Äôt been able to find much information on what it means exactly but I would love to learn!!hi! i just wanted to come on here and ask about wicca. recently i‚Äôve seen a lot about ‚Äúwitches‚Äù and wiccans and i find it extremely interesting and i‚Äôve been considering practicing this. first, i want to know if it‚Äôs a good idea. tell me about your stories and your experience when first practicing. second, i need to know where to start. please educate me on this, tell me the proper way to explain or talk about this subject (is wicca a practice? vocab, etc) let me know of any books, articles, websites, videos/people that can help teach this! what is the best way to get into wicca? anything helps :) i just would like to know and am asking for helpAs it says please help. I just attempted to do astral projection and for some reason it felt like I had left my body. Like is there a proper way of coming back from astral projecting? Is there meant to be a specific place you go to? I used quabalista. I'm honestly new to this whole thing because I used to practice in my younger years but a few personal things happened where I had to hide that part of me so I'm trying to get back into the practical side again. So please help. Any help would be greatly appreciated üëâüëàü•∫ I'm basically learning from scratch again so I'm a baby witch. Blessed be.Hey all, 
Recently some nasty things have been happening to me. Now I have to say I don‚Äôt practice Wicca or witchcraft, although it is in my family and I‚Äôve been told I should consider beginning to practice. But anyways, Ive been super unlucky recently. Dropping stuff, car trouble, losing things, and recently had an incredibly scary home invasion. On top of that I had a random nose bleed this morning. Something in my gut is telling me this is a sign of something more sinister. Do any of you wonderful people have an advice for what I can do to protect myself?Id love to hear your experiences.Is there a spell,signl, ..... to help with motivation or depression. Been in a slump before Covid.I've always been drawn to the idea of magic for as long as I can remember. 
I've been drawn to certain herbs or symbols from time to time as if it means something to me. 
Most of all recently I started noticing tarot cards in general, always known they exist (my mom has one of those like "inner child" decks) but I saw some in an image recently and it was like I HAD to have them, and then I went to some like, showcase with gemstones and readers and stuff and when I went to the tarot booth thing I had to buy some and I bought a specific deck.
ANYWAY, the main point is that my friend brought up wicca as he had started reading about Pagan and Wicca stuff, and I kinda like realized that it had to be what I was missing. 
SO, I've been really interested or more so drawn in this sort of thing since then and was really hoping for help.

Some things i was hoping for is maybe, trusted websites for spells and rituals and stuff? 

I used to try some website when I was 9 or 10 called like spells of magic but I noticed that some people were putting like very obviously rude joke type "spells" which made me doubt the credibility although one or two of them I'm certain worked.

I also noticed a question about a "Wiccan Name" and I was wondering what that is as well...

I don't really trust the internet because of the troll posts and I just really want to get Into this because as I said before I felt like something was missing and learning about Wiccan stuff kinda felt like RIGHT.
Sorry for how long this is but I hope somebody takes the time to help me, I'm really interested and hope that some kind folk will help me out!!Dear Wiccan community

I'd like to introduce myself since this is my first post on Reddit: My name is Hanna, I've been a Wiccan since the beginning of this year, so it's fair to say that I'm still a baby witch. I have an interesting story and wanted to ask you guys what your opinion on it is and if you have any suggestions. Here's the story:

It all went down on 3rd March 2020. After a very rough day (my OCD and depression were in full swing) I decided to go grocery shopping. At around 7 p.m. I left my house and decided to walk down my favourite trail (it's quite nice, you pass through a small piece of forest that has a river and a bridge in it) to get to the shop. It was also pitch black and you could see the night sky very cleary. Overall, it was a really mystical and magical atmosphere and I felt at ease.

Now to the first strange thing that caught my attention:  My groceries costed exactly 55.55 (after some research I figured that it might have been an angel number).

After finishing my shopping, I took the same trail back home. I felt oddly calm but also extremely anxious at the same time - please don't ask me how that works.

Then the second and last strange thing happened: As soon as I reached the forest, the anxiety was at its peak and I felt like I was about to have a full-blown panic attack. But all of a sudden, the name "Afina" popped into my head. I've never heard this word/name before and I started to think about what it possibly could mean. Not coming to any conclusion, I decided to do some googling when I got home. Turns out that Afina is a Hebrew name for girls and means "young doe". There was also a website that said that this name is Romanian, is mainly used for girls and means blueberry (but I dismissed this information because it didn't seem relevant for some reason). Not knowing what to do with this information, I decided to write it down in my book of shadows.

A few days after, I did a guided meditation to find out what my spirit animal is. During this experience, I saw myself entering the spiritual realm as a Celtic woman. I honestly have no idea why or how I came to that conclusion, I just kind of knew (intuition, I guess).

Yesterday I had the idea to look up the symbolism of a young deer or a deer in general in Celtic mythology and ended up stumbling across Cernunnos. It was quite surprising to me that he has a strong link to Wicca (as the "horned god") and then it just clicked.

What if Cernunnos has chosen me as his "young deer"? I know this sounds crazy, but what do you think? Any opinions from older witches? Does anyone have him as his/her/their deity?

(Another side note: I haven't been trying to reach out to any deities, at this point I wasn't even aware of how many existed.)

Thanks in advance for your answers, opinions, and experiences. Have a good day wherever you are in this world.

Blessed be, your fellow Wiccan Hannahey how is everyone hope everyone is safe. I have a very weird question. so I wanted to collect some rainwater and it was raining for several days and once I finally got up to do it and put my jar outside it just stopped raining the same night and hasn't rained hard since ( little drizzle only not enough to collect anything) does this mean something or am I exaggerating?Recently I've been seeing a lot of posts, art and so about mice and rats. Last night I had a dream about mice/rats. My other deities are saying that there's another deity trying to work with me. I tried doing some research online and I haven't found anything... Can anyone help me?Merry meet, everyone! I'm a secular/kitchen witch who has met a bit of an obstacle. My husband and I have decided to end our current contract with this international school, and find a new school to work with. We have found a school that would be perfect for us, but we're feeling pessimistic because there was another school that seemed "perfect" but they turned us down. I don't use magic often, but I'm feeling helpless and dark and I would like it not to be so. My husband is also feeling quite down about it all, and I'd like to help him too. I'm trying to find spells to help us feel more positive and to help this school see what a good fit we are.

There is also one other obstacle to my spell casting: I currently live on Jeju Island, South Korea, and that makes it very hard to find most oils and herbs. They don't even have basil in the stores now that it has turned cold!

Any and all help would be greatly helpful. Thank you!So, I am new to the Wiccan world in a sense that I‚Äôve been around witches a large part of my life, but didn‚Äôt get into until this last year. I am also Christian, and I‚Äôm skeptical about all aspects of Magic even though I do have undeniable natural affinities. I can‚Äôt help it. Last year I went to a renaissance festival and one of the performers was dressed as Winifred from Hocus Pocus. I was dressed as a deer. Nothing too extra, but cute. She looked at me directly in a crowd and told me she knew what I was and that a fellow witch can always recognize one of their own. I know she was a performer and she was playing a part, but those words almost cut me to the core. It felt real. Anyone have any experiences like this or any input?Hello Community? Within the past few weeks I‚Äôve been acquiring a lot of information that has ultimately led to Wicca! I‚Äôm 28 years of age and I haven‚Äôt really had a lot of spiritual success throughout life. Im glad although cause I have a burning desire to practice and fully develop the practices of WICCA...I‚Äôm just basically starting with links please help me strive in the right direction! Any kind of help will be Greatly appreciated. ThanksI'm a beginner Wiccan. Just started making a small book of shadows, and I want to write(cast) a spell on it. I kind of want it to be a whole "if you try to use/read this, it'll be useless/cast bad karma".. is there anything for this? I'm sorry for my ignorance - I just don't want to Google any old thing.Hi! I‚Äôve been practicing witchcraft (lightly) for a long time. In the begging I didn‚Äôt even know it was magick but as I got older I found myself to have always been a witch. I recently started my Wiccan journey and have been doing it all alone. I have been identifying as an eclectic Wiccan since I do not really know where I fit. Since I don‚Äôt have any guidance I have a hodgepodge of practices ive picked up. I really would like to focus my path a bit more. So I‚Äôll tell you a bit about what really resonates with me.

I have always been very in tune with spirits. I have communicated and had experiences often. Most all positive because that‚Äôs what I open myself to. 

I‚Äôm extremely big into my divination. I love my tarot cards, runes and crystal ball. I have a pendulum but I only use it on occasion. This ties into my spirit beliefs a bit... I do not believe the spirits are altering my cards or my ball every time or maybe even completely. I believe the energies of the universe are. But I do believe the spirits can alter my pendulum as a way to communicate with me easily. So I save my pendulum for that. Which I don‚Äôt try to communicate often as I don‚Äôt want to over bother any spirits. 

I love crystals and perform a lot of crystal magick and remedies. They help me with so many things in my life. The power in crystals is unbelievable. 

I do a small amount of full on spell work. I do make and use oils a bit. And I‚Äôve made a few good luck charms. I have cast some protection spells and clarity spells on Sabbats but that‚Äôs about as far as I‚Äôve taken that. 

I‚Äôm particularly interested in Norse deities because of my Viking heritage. 

My mother is a witch without ever knowing it. But she has practiced a lot of magick. She has extremely accurate future predictions in her dreams. She is accurate with tarot. She is big in astrology and uses crystals too. 

I picked up a lot of that from her. And I inherited her premonitions. 

Sorry for the long post. Maybe y‚Äôall can connect with me :) I look forward to meeting you and learning with you. 

Blessed be.Are there any good books to help me get started? I want the legit stuff, and I'm open to learning! I know next to nothing about Wicca, so whatever you guys got would be helpful! Thanks!Ok so my boyfriend and I both had nightmares the last 3 nights. Totally different nightmares but vivid and realistic for both of us. He recently began exploring crystals and manifestation as I have been into spirituality and witchcraft for a number of years but still consider myself a novice. I still have lot to learn so I'm looking for advice. As the title mentions the nightmares began after burning Paolo santo incense for around 2 days in a row. I used the incense to cleanse the house as we moved in 2 months ago. I walked around the house, getting all corners, doors and ceilings while setting positive intentions and removing negative energies. I also have tourmaline in a spray bottle with water that I use for cleansing and also have tourmaline and clear quartz on my bedside tables and he has amethyst on his. 

Any help would be really appreciated. Blessed be.Hello, this is really important because I'm not the one affected but my mother. Today she told me again that she saw a dark figure standing in front of her when she wanted to close her window at night. She obviously got startled and punched the thing which then vanished into thin air. After that she went on the toilet and got into her bed when she suddenly felt the vibration of someone walking on her bed. She looked up and no one was there. This is nothing new she saw that figure from time to time and every time this happened I burnt sage and tried to clear the energy in there. We also have cats and her cat spends the night with here quite often. I heard they can "fight" negative spirits or something so I hoped he kind of protects her at night. I put some stones in her room and salt but it still appears. It's not that frequent, about once a month but it still appears. At night my mother has probably a negative aura because she has atherosclerosis and thus a lot of pain at night. My room is right next to hers and my door leads into her room. One night I burnt sage in my room, my mother was already asleep when there was suddenly a strong punch against my door. I opened my door but nothing was there. Now tonight when my mother finally fell asleep she dreamt for the first time of my deceased brother who died in 2015. He was terminal ill and she nursed him. It was a huge loss for her. I was wondering if the dark figure did it on purpose but then again why would it do it? I think it's something evil but I wanted to make sure since I'm just a baby witch and if it's evil how can I get rid of it once and for all? 
Thank you for taking your time to read my postHow to do positive  spells for others instead of your self any advice ?Want to try out scrying with tea leaves. When I make tea or coffee I tend to add sugar or milk to make it taste better. Does adding sugar for taste distract from the point of scrying or disrespect it somehow? Should I just stick to tea leaves and water to keep focus on the four elements in relation to the ritual?Hello everyone! I'm new to this subreddit and the Craft in general.  I decided around a month ago to let my curiosity bring me into Wiccanism and witchcraft in general. Since then, i've had thoughts of Cernunnos/Herne/Horned One, randomly, and with no explanation. Not dreams, mind you, just long and perhaps obsessive thoughts on him, how i'd worship him, and how dedicated I want to be. I have talked to spirits before (albeit from a child's game) and I was subjected to a ritual that would show my death, as well as a mishap with runes, but otherwise my knowledge on the craft is minimal and I don't know where to begin. I try living by the Rede and the Rule of Three, and I don't know what to make of the thoughts of the Horned One, but other more experienced witches say i'm definitely being called. Any help is much appreciatedI am thinking of doing a forced reflection spell, I have good intentions behind this and truly want the person to reflect on the effect of their actions. I feel that I‚Äôve waited a long time to decide on this, karma hasn‚Äôt settled things as of yet. I don‚Äôt believe in cursing, and I really want forced self confrontation out of this for said person. I understand there is discourse around whether this spell is considered a curse, and while I value everybody‚Äôs opinion I am looking for helpful feedback on this thread.

I‚Äôve seen variations of the mirror/return to sender/ forced reflection spell, and I am curious about how long I would have to keep the objects from the spell in the freezer, or in a box of mirrors? Something I have difficulty with is understanding the effects of disposing of the objects used in a spell, it seems symbolic to get rid of it. I also don‚Äôt feel it is good to hold onto for a long period of time. I am just not sure how long is standard to hold onto these things, when/how I know when it‚Äôs ok to get rid of (and what the preferred way of doing so would be). I would love any advice or clarity on this, I am always learning and listening.My sister has been in an abusive relationship for a long time. When she was trying to find a new place to live, I found a new place to live with her near me in the hopes of a fresh start. She still can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. Good or bad, the hold ups with what she lost is not letting her move on. Three months we have been here and she continues to try and she is struggling to let what she had go. She will go to see him even though she says they are broken up attached to their brief moments of happiness that she has lifted onto the highest of pedestals, and he will hurt her immediately again and no matter how I try and talk to her, to distract her, to convince her she is caught in a terrible loop as long as she won‚Äôt let him go, she just bounces right back to him, thinking about him, how if he were better, if she could make him better, how happy she would be. Is there something me and her can do to help her let go? To live on? To separate herself from a man who has broken her bones and her heart and who she still cannot stop thinking of. Can anyone help?I'm fairly new to witchcraft and wicca but I have done some spells before.

I live in the city and we don't get a lot of spiders, but I've always liked them and now I keep encountering them wherever I go! I had several of them climb onto me, habe one living above my bed and on my kitchen ceiling. They vary in size and color, sometimes extremely small, sometimes almost as big as my hand. And now I'm starting to think that this might be a sign, but I'm not sure and if it is,  which deity could be contacting me?

If it wouldn't be too much of a bother.I've been in a state of transition from working for a dark, terrible person, to leaving that position and finding a more suitable fit. Yesterday I performed a defensive spell - basically cultivating reflection of bad energy that this person puts out toward me, and having it point back toward them. It was a "keep my name out of your mouth" kind of spell. If you eject bad energy toward me, it will reflect back to you, kind of thing.

On my way to work this morning, I found a fresh pair of severed bird wings on my path to my car. I immediately felt a heavy spiritual presence.

I can't find much information. Do you know of a symbolic association with severed bird wings? 

It feels to me like Spirit is showing me that I need not worry - the "flight" of my enemy's darkness toward me is over. 

What do you think? I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything glaring or dangerous. 

Thanks for your help. üíõDoes Anyone Know A Good Grimoire For A Beginner?# Problem

As a member of the GSRM community, I often found myself at odds with the exclusive emphasis on the gender binary and heterosexuality when studying Wicca. I felt that there were not only gaps in addressing human nature, but also elements of nature itself (homosexual behavior in animals, asexual reproduction, spontaneous sex change in frogs, the existence of intersex people, etc). It failed to address the existence of gods within the numerous pantheons who did not meet a strictly cishet, reproductivity-focused criteria (Loki, Dionysus/Bacchus, Athena, Hermaphroditus, etc). There is so much focus on polarity with little to no mention of neutrality. Much like non-hydrogen atoms are not stable without the existence of neutrons, so too is a neutral element needed in nature to help stabilize environments and prevent overpopulation.

Aether is inherently a neutral element. It is neither the exclusive domain of the God nor the Goddess. Spiritual energy is neither inherently masculine nor feminine. It is required in order for the other elements to exist in perpetuity. If the sun and stars are under the domain of the God and planetary bodies and satellites are under the domain of the Goddess, then what of the vacuum of space?

# Proposal

The deities did not exist prior to our ancestors beliefs in them, but their base energies did. I believe there is a third deity that is unacknowledged within the Wiccan belief system: the shape-changing Goddex. The null domain falls under that of the Goddex. The Goddex has appeared in various pantheons in previous forms (the aforementioned Loki, Dionysus and Hermaphroditus being examples). The Goddex is not focused on reproductivity but rather harmony and balance. Elements of human and animal behavior that run counter to the idea of reproductivity align with this domain and ideology. It is a natural counterbalance and response to the excesses of unchecked reproductivity.

# Question

How would such a change to core Wiccan beliefs work? How could these beliefs be incorporated and what potential pitfalls do you foresee with such a change?

&#x200B;

Edit for the sake of clarity: Since there seems to be some general misunderstanding of my intent, this is not a proposal to overhaul the entirety of Wiccan belief systems for every tradition. I have no interest in pushing my beliefs on others. I'm merely positing an argument that could be used for a potential branch sect tradition and am looking for counter-arguments or potential contributions.Hi, so I‚Äôm Farley new to wicca and I‚Äôve been in the broom‚Äôs closet for awhile now. My family is Christian and I‚Äôm worried for what they might say. I‚Äôve felt isolated in my spirituality and I‚Äôm looking for like minded people I can share my faith, it could be a place where I can make friends with someone that is Wiccan or pagan or it could just be a place like a festival. I‚Äôm not looking for a coven, I just want a place where I can practice my faith. 
I live at home with my parents, once I‚Äôm able to move out a plan to pratice wicca on my own but until than I want somewhere I can be Wiccan freely and celebrate the sabbats. 
I live in bc. 
If y‚Äôall know of any places I can go to celebrate sabbats or be around like minded people, please let me know‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ô°‚ãÜ.‡≥É‡øî*‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

Now my anxiety seems to be waning with the moon, but it‚Äôs still present. Is there something special about this moon that might be cause of all this emotional turmoil?

Extra credit for anyone with suggestions for how to cope. I‚Äôm not present and in my head, and no amount of writing, meditating, or yoga is giving me lasting peace.

Thank you in advance and blessed be!Hello! I‚Äôve been practicing Wicca for a while and I‚Äôm pretty confident in my skills of manifesting. Buts the things which I wanna manifest is making me hesitant. Would it be okay if I manifested my partner breaking up with me? I‚Äôve heard stories of people thinking they accidentally doing it but, morally would be okay?

I‚Äôve been with this person for almost about a year. And all throughout our relationship we‚Äôve always kinda had this distance between us. They have really bad ADHA and kinda been shielded form the world till they where about 16. When I‚Äôve experienced a lot of the awfulness it has to offer  at a very young age. Cause of it I have a hard time allowing myself to pore my true thoughts and feeling to a person who gets super distracted when I try to talk with them. We don‚Äôt fight ever but it doesn‚Äôt feel like we talk enough to have something to fight about. I kinda feel as thought we‚Äôre adults stuck in a middle school relationship. Whenever we have a serious conversation it just feels like I‚Äôm talking to them when I want to talk with them. I feel super happy when we are together but whenever we say good bye I feel like I just said goodbye to a friend not a lover. They‚Äôre supper sweet and I‚Äôd never wish anything bad to ever happen to them. But I‚Äôm just not satisfied with where we are and when I voice my opinion on it I feel like am a the bad guy and nothing changes. Or it feels that we move backwards in the relationship. And I don‚Äôt feeling confident/comfortable to break with them due to painful relationships in the past. But every time I think about our relationship my brain goes straight to break up with them, they‚Äôre a better friend than partner. Which I think is very true. I feel if they where the one to break up with me, we‚Äôd have a better change at still being friends after it. I don‚Äôt know.

Thoughts? Am I awful person for wanting to do with?Okay....so my friend..lets call her amy had a party on halloween we preformed some rituals and spells with a few others great night cleansed crystals all that good stuff

NOW....Amys husband was cleaning up after the party (has no beliefs of a wiccan/pagan nature whatsoever) 

That being said amys friend lets call her britney had this witch decoration that she hss had for 3 years or so and swears it has a soul. She would move it around etc but it would go off (battery operated) without reason

Now Britney hung it in the doorway of amys hallway and at one point Amy being drunk she pulled it down and threw it in the yard because she kept running into ot etc

Sooooo....back to amys husband...he found the witch and decided to throw it in the fire ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The SAME fire which we had rituals that night and the worst part is he told her it screamed the whole time it burned and right before it stopped it growled
NEEDLESS to say this is NOT good

Amy and myself want to ask for forgiveness for his blatant stupidity and disrespect ultimately and i would really appreciate any imput on ritual, deity, supplies, best used for a situation like this

üñ§Hello lovelies, I am learning more and more about Wiccan practises, beliefs, etc, and I'm having a hard time finding reliable articles and resources to aid my studies. Would anyone have any recommendations? Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏éHi! Now I haven‚Äôt been practicing in probably about a year but recently some strange things have been happening to me. One morning when I left my house there was a big flock of crows surrounding my house. I want to sleep all day but when I do I have bad dreams. Not like nightmares but when I wake up I feel uncomfortable. And even more recently I feel like my head and body are disconnected. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense but when I move, my body physically moves but I feel like my consciousness lags behind it. Im itchy all over my body and I don‚Äôt know why. My skincare routine hasn‚Äôt changed. I haven‚Äôt changed my laundry detergent or anything like that. It all started when my gf broke up with me like 2 months ago. Now I don‚Äôt know if all of this is just because I‚Äôve been putting out bad energy because of the breakup or if I‚Äôm cursed and should be even more worried. This all could be a coincidence for all I know. If anyone can give some advice on what I should do it would be greatly appreciated.I come from a very spiritual family with a good bit of history in obeah and spiritual experiences. When I was very young I had a dream of a man watching me. He was dressed in a trenchcoat and his face was over shadowed but everytime the scene changed he stood across from me watching me. I woke screaming and I could see him at the foot of my bed until my parents rushed in and he disappeared. I never had the dream again and I pushed it to the back of my mind until recently. I feel this voice in my head which desires my anger. It feeds my rage whispering reasons why I should be angrier then I was. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I don't feel like my face is mine. I might be crazy but just in case I'm not.I'd like to know how every four out what they were good as a witch. I want to specialize in something but nothing seems to be right right. Or what did u start with?Does it matter if your full moon charged crystals see the sunlight????Hi! I‚Äôm new on here and I‚Äôm interested in practicing Wicca. I was recently spiritually awaken when I took shrooms and found myself connected to nature. I‚Äôm hoping I can find some advice on how to start!A while back I had a dream that has stuck with me vividly ever since, and I am hoping to get some information that might explain it. 

In the dream I found myself in the woods, and there was no guiding path, in fact I was walking deeper and deeper into the thick of the forest, but I was searching for something. I kept going and started pulling away branches, and stepping over small trees, pushing through the deep brush until I reached a wall with a small hole in it. I crawled inside and entered this garden with very tall perfectly groomed shrubs that seemed to lead into a maze, the weird thing though was the sky was white and so was the ground and the walls behind me. When I looked to the right, I saw this incredibly beautiful, very large (possibly pregnant), naked woman, with bright pink flowing hair that was so long it flowed across her whole body and all around the floor. She smiled warmly at me and made everything feel welcoming. Then from the maze appeared this sentaur that was almost as tall as the shrubs forming the maze. His physical appearance is so clear in my head even now. He had huge antlers coming out of his head, and huge flowing dread locks that came all the way to the ground, with leaves and sticks in them. His skin was dark tan, he had very sharp bone structure, and a beard that came down as long as his hair and was dreaded as well. He had electric eyes that seemed to actually have light coming out of them. Then we spoke, and I remember him telling me to call him father, and he said something about how I have had many father's (which is true, one biological, and two step father's over the years) but he was my one true father. I can't remember anything else about the dream or what he said to me after. But I woke up feeling like I just came back from an otherworldly experience and I felt paralyzed and the only thought in my head was "I just met God."

The strangest thing about it was that I had never done any research into wicca, or any deities. I've never known anything about the mother and father. I told a friend about the dream and they asked me if I had ever looked into wicca, and that was my first introduction to something that accurately described what I dreamed, and I got goosebumps. 

So does anyone know what this means? Have I been claimed by these deities? Should I be reaching out to them and paying tribute? I can't find anything helpful in the research over done so far and I'm just left feeling like there's something out there that's reaching out for me and I can't quite touch it. If I wanted to reach out to these deities does anyone have suggestions?I struggle w intrusive thoughts do they affect my intent?I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to best portray my query, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that I have something following me or maybe trying to get my attention? I‚Äôm sorry in advanced for any errors/general noobie-ness. But I really need guidance or advice on what is going on and appreciate any and all insight. Warning,long post ahead. 

I have a very small knowledge of proper practice which is mainly why I don‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt cast spells, practice with a cauldron, or really anything (I think) that would  draw the wrong kind of intention from spirits or otherworldly entities. I do meditate and rely very heavily on my intuition and ability to read what the world is trying to say to me at all times. I have a small altar of stones, minerals, and things that have meaning to me. I sage and have a rue plant that I keep to keep negativity away. I feel as though I am very spiritual and guided by Mother Earth. 

However, I‚Äôve been at my moms house for quarantine for the last like 2 months where I‚Äôm away from all of these items & back in my old room. This last week in particular I‚Äôve noticed more of a presence or stronger energy, maybe? I‚Äôve noticed a frequent tapping at the back door & window area of my room at night and early morning. I saged with a bundle of herbs from my friend‚Äôs garden. It was made from pineapple sage, mint, and something else idr. I did that and opened the door a crack to give whatever it was somewhere to go. 

Above the window/door area I have a handful of jars & trinkets hanging off the curtain rod that have some other little meaningful trinkets & a collection of rosaries. (Side note: I was raised catholic & went to a catholic grammar & middle school where they were always giving out rosaries. I‚Äôve kept a few of the ones I like and hung them up here.) The other night I swear I saw like a gaseous movement like little wings or fingers flickering above where the rosaries hang. 

I woke up with 2 little bruises on the inside of my right knee. Then the next night there were 3 bruises. I‚Äôm fairly klutzy but don‚Äôt remember hitting myself there on anything. 

Then yesterday, I was walking around a park that I rarely go to and an older woman (maybe 60s?) asked me to pick up this feather off the ground for her. She told me she always asks the world what to do and looks for answers through feathers. I was really weary at first bc of covid & also because I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm being tested a lot with whatever is going on. I picked the feather up for her because she mentioned she recently had surgery and couldn‚Äôt bend down. And I‚Äôm a softie.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

Am I overreacting and not reading the signs properly? I am not sure how to process this or what to make of it. This is also the week that my dad passed 5 years ago. 

Please help :-(Hey guys! I'm new to Reddit and Wicca. I would like to have some advice on simple protection spells.  However, I do have an issue I still live with Christian parents that don't know I am a Wicca. So, I need help with keeping it under the radar, as well. I really appreciate any help I can get! :)

Edit: The reason I'm asking is because I got a sign to prepare for something and it was implied that it was very, very bad.I‚Äôve been interested in wicca for a while. 

I‚Äôm unsure whether I am capable or whatever (50/50) but I‚Äôve been researching it. I‚Äôve decided to make poppers as I‚Äôve read they can bring good luck and keep the person your made a poppet of, safe. 

If it goes wrong, at the very least, it will be a good gesture. I have their go aheads to make one and just would like to know fit here are any tips or risks that may come about from making a poppet. I do not wish to cause any harm. I am mainly making it because of the pandemic and one of my sisters is joining the RAF and I wish for her to keep safe.

Thank you for any help.

Also, bonus, are there any tests to see if I am a witch or capable of doing these spells. Something that won‚Äôt require me to leave the house during this pandemic would be useful. But if I have to wait- it‚Äôs fine. Thanks :))So I have one deity so far and it is Apollo, I chose him because he is the god of music and is supposed to have blonde hair. I have blonde hair and I have a deep connection with music, what kind of alter should I set up for him? I'm extremely new at this and I would appreciate some feedback and advise on the topic. Currently I have Diana and Cernunnos.

I started my path due to a dream I had in part. I wasn't the religious type more into energies. The dream I had featured a soldier whom now that I think of it was genderless in where it had features of both male and female. It seemed we were on a battlefield and with soft but intense eyes it said, "Call the corners". I then started  my path. I wish I would get more dreams like that.

My practice or belief system focuses on the sabbats and esbats since this deals with honoring the change of seasons and elemental work. I have an affinity with the element fire given my personality, taste in color. Man, it seemed like I subconsciously surrounded myself with energies of fire which sorta shocked me during the discovery period. Back then earth seemed to have been my weakest üòÖ. 

Anyways, the deities I have chosen were somewhat of an after thought; I realize that now. Sure, Diana is a strong moon goddess but does she reflect my belief system? I am not sure anymore. What about Cernunnos? Given his maleness and sexuality is he the right match for Diana on my alter? His he too radical for the harmony I want to achieve in my work?

Any deity advice would be welcomed. Any alteration would also be welcomed. I just want harmony and balance even of it means parting with one or both of them. Thanks.I have two questions. 
How should I set up an altar? 
And
I found three feathers today and I‚Äôve been seeing feathers in my dreams. Is someone reacting out to me??Update on my current status!

Turns out it was Apollo calling me. Which is crazy because when I was just 12, all I've ever really knew was being catholic ( not by my own will, but by my family's choice ) and I have always wondered if i was doing the right thing by converting from one religion to another. But he told me in one of my dreams that whatever path I choose should come from the heart and do what I think is best for me. 

Which is why I am starting this. 

I've gotten help from my experienced witch friends and they've all helped me research possible gods or goddesses that pretains to the sun of almost every culture that could be calling to me up until one night where I had the same dream and he told me his name before i got to ask. 

As I said before, I'm just a beginner and I'm only doing more research before anything else. So I guess my question would be:

How do I deal with this? I've heard that it does take some time for someone ( if they wanted to ) to find their patron god or goddess but i don't know where to start after finding him. 

Any advice would be super helpful.My mom told me that her grandma was called a see sayer and my mom believes me and the girls in my family have gifts and I feel like this is why I'm so attracted to wicca and I'd love any info anyone can give me BC from a young age I've always seen things others could not and I think it can  have something passed down to me from family and I can't seem to find any info about it onlinewhich are your methods, techniques, tools, etc. etc. that you used the first time you approached the divine?
who did you collected and studied your experiences, and how did you discerned whether your experience were the direct connection to the divine?
I think this is a very nice topic to share! ^^Does my pendulum *have* to be a crystal of some sort or can it be a regular metal necklace? I have this necklace it difficult to explain it's shape but long story short it's pendulum shaped. I was wearing it and I was just struck with this feeling of "This should be my pendulum". Just wanted to know thank you for anyone who answers. FYI I've never had a pendulum before.I often hear that you shouldn't buy a tarot deck for yourself and that it should be gifted to you. Is there a reason? Can anyone confirm or deny this? Hello, I am a baby witch. I've been researching different types of craft for 3-4 years now. My strongest aspect in the craft is being about to have visions through dreams. 
 During the summer, we have been finding many, many bird bones in our backyard specifically. The bones are perfectly skinned and cut so it is likely not an owl. 
 Lately I have been having very vivid dreams about the Fae. They vary from pixie like entities to mermaids and sirens. I was posting on here because I was wondering what the best course of action to take would be. These dreams have been getting more intense every night, and I'm not sure if it's a sign, warning, ect.ive just started being a wiccan and i was hoping to get some adviceSo I first moved to York SC when I was seven we stayed with my grandparents (extremely toxic and abusive) for a couple months until my mom got enough money to buy house. well while we stayed there  I used to see shadows running in the woods I don‚Äôt see them anymore but I did when I was little. The weirdest occasion was when I walked outside and I seen a tall skinny black dog figure rise in the woods and runoff. It was too big to be a normal dog not to mention the dread that I felt when I seen it. I told my mom about it and she dismissed it because I was young. My mom was someone who practiced Wicca And she did believe in the supernatural but not to the extent that she would believe everything the kids said they seen. It wasn‚Äôt until my little sister went to feed the cats and we heard her scream and we all ran outside and she was pointing at the woods and crying that she had seen a tall skinny bony naked man but there was no one there. We lived on 15 acres of woods and I doubt there was someone who was human just walking around naked in the woods. Later after several bad relationships and a struggling drug addiction. My mother caught a break when my great grandmother passed away and we were left her house in the inheritance. She lived on the Same property my grandparents lived on and I hated that land. Even my friends who visited so they felt bad when they visited or sick. The first night we were packing things we left it as we left I seen someone walk past the window inside even though there was no one inside the house. My mom‚Äôs boyfriend who beat her almost to death started having nightmares and refused to take naps because he was having such scary nightmares and woke up with scratches on him. A bunch of glass bottles that were stable all came off the counter by themselves at once. Our front door slam so hard that a sign that was nailed to it came off I also suffered from the most severe depression I‚Äôve ever suffered when I lived in this house I tried to kill myself by taking a bunch of blood thinners that had previously cause my mom to have a heart attack but I was prescribed them and had never shown a negative reaction to them but I knew their potential. When my mom died of a drug overdose I kept having nightmares of Her soul stuck in the house. She would have blank white eyes and points off in the direction where nothing was as if she wanted me to help her but she couldn‚Äôt speak and she had a drained empty look in her face. These nightmares eventually went away but other weird things begin to happen. Things disappear around me.  When I went to take my drivers test my permit that I had previously seen in my purse the day before was gone and nowhere to be found. Two days later I found it in the pocket of the coat I was wearing when I was looking for it. I knew it wasnt in that coat pocket because I inverted them to make sure when I was looking. The Lights started when I met my husband. But the negative feeling of something watching over me has been gone for a while. But I feel like something is still there. The most recent thing to start taking place is technology struggling to work around me I will pass the light and as soon as I pass it it either shut off or flickers rapidly. The worst instance of this was when I first moved to my current apartment complex I went grocery shopping as soon as my foot stepped through the Walmart door all of the lights shut off in the store when I asked an employee about it they said it was because of roadwork but it was Sunday and there wasn‚Äôt any active roadwork where there usually is by the Walmart. Not to mention I live within walking distance of the Walmart and if their power was out so would mine but mine was on when I got home. I‚Äôve had other instances where I walk into my apartment and as soon as I walk in all the lights shut off or Flicker. It used to happen like once in a blue moon But has been happening 2 to 3 times a week more recently. Street lights have now started turning off as soon as I pass them it would be one thing if it happened all the time and I noticed that all the time but it just started happening as soon as I reach the light it will shut off. My phone has randomly started acting up like it has a virus but it doesn‚Äôt. My husband‚Äôs computer  sometimes turn itself on and off when I am home so I have to unplug it completely. I thought maybe it could be electrical problems with the area I live in but then I remembered when I lived in Matthews North Carolina which is over an hour away it happen there to. One weekend while my husband was gone I stepped outside to walk my dog and as soon as I shut my door the lights in the walkway turned off in the street light outside turned off but the lights in the other apartment complexes were on. I checked our energy companies outage website and we were the only ones out on the street. I also witnessed street lights turning on and off then but didn‚Äôt think much of it because it didn‚Äôt happen as often as it does recently I‚Äôm just looking for advice on what this could possibly mean. I‚Äôve been having chest pain‚Äôs and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre related to everything that‚Äôs going on. I also got sick for the first time in almost 2 years like flu sick not food poisoning or anything like that but like flu sick with a runny nose and upset stomach some thing I haven‚Äôt had since I was a kid. I just feel like something major is about to happen and I can‚Äôt explain it

#whatsgoingonOne of my coworkers and I were talking about past experiences with ghosts and she had an experience that I'm trying to pin down. She was at a relatives years ago, and one night she went outside at night and saw a red (not orange but true red) "demon dog" running laps around a large tree in the backyard.
I'm trying to find information on what this could have been, as most appearances, stories, etc are black or white dogs, or dogs with numerous heads.Just curiousMy wife and I are fairly new to the craft and were wanting to make good luck/ protection charms for ourselves and our children. We were wanting something small that can be carried or worn in some form of jewelry. Any advice? Thank you in advance.Hello friends! 

I am fairly new to Wicca but have not partaken in any covens or rituals. I‚Äôve read books about the origins and teachings of Wicca and I feel happy about connecting with all of it. However, when it comes to the Goddess/God, I don‚Äôt know if I feel a connection? It‚Äôs hard to describe it, but I pray to them, but I never know if they‚Äôre listening or if I‚Äôm doing something wrong. Should I be doing more than just praying? Is this something I need to feel within myself? 

I am very new to reddit so I am open to all comments! I hope I don‚Äôt sound stupid or ignorant. Thank you!I recently began practicing, after years of being told by one side of my family that I am a healer, and the other side that I am a witch. 

I‚Äôve never done a spell to harm another, as I do not wish harm on anyone. 

This morning I woke up to find blood on my right hand. One spot was a small dot, the other was in the shape of a 7, I have a picture but it‚Äôs only after I wiped it off. I was so freaked out, I checked myself, nothing. I checked my dog, nothing.

Is this coincidence, or should I be worried?I'm not a believer or practice Wicca, but I have a strong fascination about it and I had this really weird dream, so I wanted to know what kind of interpretation you would get from this.

I just woke up and took notes from what I felt from the dream so I wouldn't forget about it. Don't mind if it's too weird. These are the first words I could describe from it:

"I was in a haunted house.

And there was blood in that house. And guts. Of who's I don't know. 

And there was evil.

But I didn't believe in evil. Neither was afraid of it.

And a black cat appeared, carrying a knife. It hid, but I could still see the knife. And a voice told me it was the devil. 

I didn't believe in the voice. So the voice told me to go to the cat and ask him if he was the devil. And then to ask him the secrets of the world.

I think that voice was me.

And then I came after the black cat, which tried to attack me with the knife. But I could easily handle it. 

The cat ran, and I was led to a mirror.

In the mirror, I looked at myself and called for the devil. He didn't appear to me.

And I asked, "Why are there secrets to the world?" 

The face, which was mine, got possessed by the devil. The eyes turned to white and the mouth was smiling widely, reaching my ears, showing up big teeth. 

He said, "because I want to".

In another mirror, figures appeared. Religious folklore figures passed by the mirror. The history of a church. However, that history told by the mirror was in backward. From the present church to its beginnings.

And that was scary.

Later we found wounded people in the sea. A man and two women. The man had his leg broken, with an exposed bone, his head was bloody, his eyes were red, his skin was pale white and his belly was cut open and his guts were coming out of it. The women were also pale and bloody, with wounds in the ear and neck. But there was a lot of mysterious blood on their clothes from an unknown wound.¬† 

I think those wounded people and the backward gospel were both secrets of the world"Long story short, both my fianc√© and I consider ourselves to be Wiccan on one level or another, and have been for a few years. 

Last night we couldn‚Äôt even stay at our house because randomly spiders were crawling all over us and in our bed and clothes. They seemed to be appearing out of thin air because we would look and not see anything, tear apart the bed and see nothing, etc.

Eventually it got to the point where I was seeing what I‚Äôm fairly certain were venomous spiders in our bed and we had to leave the room. I killed over 30 spiders between 3 and 5 am, when in the past month I‚Äôve only seen one spider(that I killed) in the room. 

I just figured it was a random spider infestation until my fianc√© just mentioned that she was wondering if it was supernatural(we both have had more than our fair share of supernatural occurrences fucking with us), or a curse because of the time it started, and how they seemed to appear out of thin air on our bodies, and on our phones in our hands, but when we looked we couldn‚Äôt find anything.

A roommate of ours with a five month old baby stays in the room right next to us and she didn‚Äôt have any problems with spiders, and didn‚Äôt see any when she thoroughly cleaned her room and almost the entire downstairs earlier today. 

Does anyone know if this might be something supernatural or a curse? And if so, do you have any advice to stop it? I‚Äôm a little bit of an arachnophobe and no one really likes spiders in their bed anyways. 

Thanks in advance for any help!I own a Discord server known as *The Nightshade Circle* which is apart of *The Nightshade Network*. We serve and bring together people who study and talk about forms of paganism and related religions and sects. I am starting a school of sorts called *The Nightshade School of Magick*. We are looking for people who would like to volunteer there time and knowledge to educate others about there craft. The current Classes that need Educators are: Hellenic Paganism, Wicca, Druidry, Renaissance Studies, and Divination with more being thought of. If you are interested in becoming an Educator for TNSM you can message me or join the Discord for the school here [https://discord.gg/wxW2bcE](https://discord.gg/wxW2bcE) 

If you are interested in Enrolling in TNSM it is free but some classes might require you to purchase items yourself that you dont have and classes will rarely cost for enrollment. We are not accepting enrollment right now but will be soon and if you would like to keep updated and give us your opinion or help us with the overall process of the learning system and what classes to offer then join the Discord.I've been working on a project inspired by my year and a half in national forests and on BLM land. I‚Äôve been trying to ‚Äúget back to‚Äù the rhythms of nature, but I know so little about those rhythms that I don't know what's important, what to focus on. A calendar seemed to me the best way to organize the information.

I wanted to make a calendar that could help me *feel* the world around me, not just pretty pictures of it.

As I talked about it with others, it seemed like there might be wider interest. So, I made it myself, and you can [check it out here](https://www.naturetimecalendar.com)!

The calendar starts in spring, at the beginning of the natural year.

My father was never in my life until recently (we speak occasionally online) he told me that he is half Puerto Rican and when he got a blood test had some countries in Africa in his line (ie. equador from what I recall 10 years ago) my mom was adopted and all she knows of her birth parents is they are Scottish and Irish (which explains my resonance with Fae/Celtic culture)

The internet is so vast and deceiving And I can‚Äôt trust what knowledge or myth I find on the internet. While I overstand how my gut exploits the truth I hope to find some guidance here to send me in the right direction in my search of Fae witchcraft. Is there any witches out there who have experience/knowledge they are will to share to help me? 
BlessingsSo I had a session tonight and it made me notice that whenever I do practice whether it's a spell or calling down the moon I tend to feel a good almost buzzing feeling of energy in my chest and sometimes in my arms. I was just wondering if anyone else has felt this or had more clarification. It's definitely like a euphoric feeling / charged feeling.  I'm  not worried by it at all since it's never felt like it was something bad. I just had to post here to tell others and hear their responses.Hi thank you for reading, hopefully someone can help me. I'm almost at my breaking point. It has been like 2 years of horrible infestationS of little white bug so tiny they look like almost like dandruff but there are also little dot black ones they are every where and itchy, in my clothes, hair so much that you can see them but they move soslowly you almost can't see it but they get everywhere, we'll shower and then become red again in 10 mins they are in our eyelashes, our eyebrows, on my cat and she was scooting her butt on the ground today freaking out, they are in my nose I'll clean my nose and little b,a kind white things come out with blood. I need help. We cleanand shower literally constantly. Also a few months ago we had a problem with June bugs I think, big flying beetle like bugs that just bump into everything. Literally hundreds on our porch alone not on our neighbors,  we couldn't even be outside they'd constantly flying into us and then the Next morning they'd all be dead on our porch like everyday for a month that happened and then a few weeks later there we're like Literally 100 or more Flys in my kitchen and living room. Little ones and bags ones but we never found anything with maggots on it so idk how any of this keeps happening.  We're not hoarders or dirty people. Pls does anyone have any spells or herbs that can help or cleaning products (tried most ) also am I cursed and any help fixing that?Similar to heading I a, hoping to find some apps that is good source material for spellwork, herbs and crystals but don't really know what to trust so if any body know of any that can help I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.I couldn't find an answer elsewhere but my father was into alot of this stuff, and while I could understand some of them I never knew what the purpose and reason that he put rocks around a room. He apparently encircled the living room for protection or something . I know he was into Celtic wicca if that helpsHi, everyone!! I'm not a Wiccan, but I write stories and I had a young witch in mind. I'm afraid I'll accidentally be disrespectful to the Wicca religion and I'd love some advice from you! Are there any misconceptions that famous witches have and pisses you off? How can I do this respectfully? 

&#x200B;

My goal isn't to focus on the character's religion, but his actual emotional development, but I'm more than aware I still have to research about witchcraft itself. Thank you so much in advance!!Hello! 
Recently I made myself and my best friend a spray bottle of anti-bad vibes. I used half moon water. Half witchhazel and added some rose petals, lavender, and rosemary as well as some essential oils. I also included a little bit of clear quartz.   I was carrying it around with me in my purse and as I pulled my wallet out this morning it smashed üôÉ    

I don't know weather to take it as a clumsy accident or the universe telling me I didn't need it anymore. 

Thoughts and opinions are appreciated.  
Blessed be,
Ashielyso, to start off, Ive been interested in the supernatural, mythology, certain witchcraft and more since i was quite young. but, not until very recently did I make the decision to convert to paganism, specifically Wiccan. 

Im unable to do anything major as I live at home still, and my mom is very against Wiccan beliefs and practices. But, I would like to learn small spells, what to do with crystals, how to better get into meditation and things as such.

If anyone has any advice, feel free to DM.Hi so, I went out to a national park today and I kept finding large creepy bugs on me the entire day my friend spotless. Then I get home and shower and I find this huge bug on my leg. Does this mean anything. I just think it‚Äôs very weird that I keep finding bugs that keep biting me. I used to find spiders on me all the time as a kid.My mother who is extremely religious found all my craft and took my crystals and burned my tarrots and books I have my crystals back but they are dead I set them in moonlight after cleansing them but all of them are dead I can't figure out why my craft is failing and why I'm experiencing extreme "bad luck" I use witchcraft as a way of healing and mental grounding but now I just feel depressed and my tarrots are terrible and sad I need help how can I get my spark backI apologize in advance for how long this may turn out, but I deeply, deeply appreciate the time you are giving me and any guidance you might have. 

To start, I've identified as agnostic my entire life with a mainstream exposure and understanding of christianity. I've grown up devoid of any religious community, have no traditions, beliefs, and in an immediate family that had severed all connections to our extended family, ancestors, and history. I have always felt restless, unfulfilled, untethered, and lost; so much so that there is a painful lump in my throat as I try to find to words to explain this right now. But there have been moments of peace where I felt grounded, protected, and like I belonged. There are things I am inexplicably drawn to which make me feel like wicca or paganism is the right direction. But I don't know where to start or where I belong. 

When I try to find information, there's just so much out there with different focuses and individual spins, it feels like sifting through the different denominations or christianity. There's pieces to what little I know about wicca or paganism that feel "right" to me and pieces that I don't think I could believe or commit to -  am I even looking at pieces from the same puzzle? Or is wicca broken into different denominations like Presbyterian vs Catholic beliefs and rituals differ?

In a desperate attempt to find a path or direction, I hope these following things will click with someone else that might feel like they can and want to guide me. 

Areas of most importance to me / given me the strongest feelings: 

1. Water: water is the number one most magnetic, beautiful thing to me. The ocean, lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, rain, morning dew, mist, fog. I can't even begin to explain the feelings I have when I am in and around water. My parents have hundreds of stories about literally losing me as an infant, toddler, and teenager and finally finding me playing in water. No mater the temperature, time, or location, I desperately want to be in water. 

2. Nature: deciduous trees, green meadows, leafy plants, flowers, grass, herbs, gardens, house plants. I feel at peace and connected to these parts of nature. But there are areas that are polar to these things that make me feel depressed, anxious, or uncomfortable like deserts, dry plains, pine trees. 

3. Animals: I've always had a deeply emotional love and respect for all animals. My husband calls me in to catch and release the crickets, wasps, spiders, and occasional snakes that find their way into an inconvenient area of our home because I can't stand the idea of harming them. However, I don't think I have a particularly exceptional relationship with animals - though they captivate me, they seem fairly neutral towards my presence: neither drawn to, nor particularly afraid of me. 

4. The Moon: there's something peacefully intoxicating about the moon. Maybe because I suffered through poverty, family dysfunction, domestic violence, depression, and insomnia as a child and adolescent and the only time I found comfort was sneaking out and wondering the meadows and woods in the moonlight (my family lived in a trailer home on the outskirts of town at this time.) As corny as it might sound, the moon feels like an elder - gently guiding and watching over a child. 

Other things that I enjoy or am interested in, but hasn't had a big impact on my life is palm reading, Tarot readings, Astrology, crystals, Yoga, Meditation, Feng Shui, tea and coffee brewing. 

I know that was a great deal of information, (probably a great deal of useless information) but I hope there might be a path or line of study/worship that sounds like I might belong. I'm so tired of feeling like I've been abandoned in a dark and smokey room. I desperately want to find myself, want to be more, be connected, and just be... happy.I've been posting around reddit trying to gain all of the knowledge I can about Goddess Durga. I've felt very connected to her since learning about her last week. I don't have a relationship with my abusive mother and learning about Durga made my heart feel so happy. I want to learn everything I can about her.

I'm a little worried about cultural appropriation since I'm white. Any thoughts? 

Anything you can share with me would be sincerely appreciated! 

Sending love to you all!Does Anyone Know Anything About A Grimoire Of The Great Flame And A Spell Called Fire From Heaven?Hello everyone. I'm Samantha and fairly new to Wiccan and Pagen Witchcraft. I've read on Tarot and absolutely love it and I'm currently reading on the history and holidays of Wicca. Does anyone have any advice for someone new to this?  
Blessed beWhat is the best place to order crystals or other things like that from? I just want the best quality purple ones. Thank you for your responsesThis might be long. I was born with a third eye & the ability to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù certain events/disasters in my life & the lives of people I love through dreams or during encounters with diseased family members and or what I think is my guardian angle. I never really looked into  it because it always freaked me out. I even went to see a distant aunt who did rituals & asked her to shut off my third eye because all I began to see was a lot of negative energy, souls, and had dreams of my soul leaving my body watching me sleep while what I believe is the devil visited the foot of my bed. My third eye is reacting again but not in an uncontrolled negative way, the events and encounters feel light, happy and in the recent nights I‚Äôve been able to see things happen in real time while I‚Äôm asleep (example: I was asleep the other night with my door open and my light on, my nephew came in my room and we had a conversation about why my door was open and why my light was on because  it‚Äôs never on when I sleep... the next morning he told me he woke up in the middle of the night to go pee & wondered why my door was open and why my light was on) and after numerous events of these dreams and encounters I decided to look into Wicca or anything really. I‚Äôm looking for sources of what I have, if there are any others like me there & what are your experiences or if someone may point me in directions that may be helpful. Books? Websites? Crystals? History? I was raised in a Catholic family, went to private school all of that.. so it feels really wrong to be looking into this stuff but I have so many unanswered questions.How would I do this? I hear that there is a way to bring a deity to the crossroads but how do I make a sigil or square for Odin ?So within the past couple days I been researching and I‚Äôve listened to and introductory audiobook. But I still need some advice on how to start with this? 

What specifically do I need to research? And what are some good books to start with?Good day my beautiful wiccans! üñ§
I am new to the Wiccan world and teachings, and as I begin my journey and practices, I would like to create sigils according to my different intentions, and i was wondering if there are any powerful symbols for open-mindedness and perception? 

One big step for my journey is allowing myself to give 100% of my mind and energy into my practices and meditations, and I‚Äôm struggling to identify and connect with my vessel and energy during meditation and my practices. Having guided meditation helps me a lot, but how do I know when i‚Äôm ready to use the power of my mind and spirit to meditate by myself and strengthen my intentions? 

Any advice? ‚ú®üåô‚ö°Ô∏èHi guys is there any spell that will help you to get something back?

I heard it was a way to connect with your higher self/spirit guide. I tried it today with a goal to meditate for 10 minutes with a sound bath audio playing but the second I began I felt a heaviness in my chest and was immediately overwhelmed by the shadows on my reflection‚Äôs face. I only made it a minute before I had to leave the room. Did I do it wrong? Do I need to build a tolerance?About a week ago my freind made me a protection jar with what he said was black salt and today my dog who is really quit has been growling whenever I'm alone and the jar is making a sizzling sound if anybody knows what's up plz helpI think I may be cursed. Or something is going on and I am not sure how to get rid of the issue...

Tried smudging, but it didnt really do anything. I think someone has been messing with me, but how do I find out and get it to end?I just did my first honey jar spell but I‚Äôm not very Shiite on how to feed it.
Some people say to feed by placing something something sweet on top of it for a week but others say to light candles until my desire is realised.Okay so im a little bit concerned and have never in my life seen this before. What does it mean when I am cleansing my amethyst crystal? And the crystal emerges from the salt im cleansing it in? 

A little clarification, my step-father recently came into the knowledge that I have gotten into polishing my own rocks I find. He gave me a huge bucket of amethysts, rose quartz and a few other types of precious gems, So I buried one of the smaller amethysts in DRY salt last night and woke up this morning to it having emerged fully from under the salt and was now just sitting ontop of the salt. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IM DOING A CONCERN.Hi so I need help. I'm 17 and I was born with the veil, both of my parents were pagan and had gifts but they separated before I was born and neither really taught me how or what to do. I've always been able to see and talk to people on the other side but recently I haven't been able to communicate and it hurts when they try.

Why am I attracted to darkness? Not just night time but....all things dark. Where as all my friends and family are scared of the places in my town that are haunted...I embrace it. I have what my family considers an "addiction" to skulls and I always find myself looking at darker things that most people think should be left alone.
Does any one have any ideas as to why this may be? Baby witch here...

So lately I have been meditating on protection and positivity. I also ask in my daily prayers and offering ritual. 

Then 2 days ago, we were at the park taking a walk with my son around the lake. There were 100s, literally 100s, of turtles. And since then I've seen them everywhere, and think about it a lot. 

Are these related or 2 separate things I should look intoI had a dream that my wand I just made broke, I didn‚Äôt break it myself but I found it when I went to use it and it was broken in half, does this mean anything? It feels symbolicHello,

I am searching for somebody to interview for a class project in my diversity class. This would not be a super long interview, only 10 questions, and it would be  completely anonymous. I would be interviewing you about your practice's and your beliefs.

When did you start practicing and why.

How do you practice?Do you mainly focus on terror cards, cast spells or do you do a little of both.

What is a familiar? Do you have one? How did you and your familiar meet?

How do the people around you view your practice/religion? How does your family view your practice/religion?

In your opinion is there a difference between the words witch and wiccan? 

Are you a practicing pegan too? If not what do you practice religiously? 

Do you have an altar set up for them question work if you do have an altar set up for them what does it look like? What do the iteams mean you?Dear members, I'm new to Wicca and I'd like to learn more and want to start to observe the Sabbats.

My problem is, I live in a tropical country with only two seasons, dry and rainy. This makes me a little bit confused on how to decide which Sabbats should I celebrate.

Should I just follow the Northern Hemispere Sabbats? 

I've been trying to look for a group or a coven (am I using the term right?) in my country to discuss this matter, but I highly doubt that they'd be opened since I live in a deeply religious country where Witchcraft (Wicca is seen as one) is discouraged even criminalised.

Thank youive done some research online (prolly not the best place to look for answers on magic) and i cant seem to find anything, the closest i found to a ring that had this properties was the ring of solomon, which lets you speak to animals and command demons but did not mention anything about seeing them, i thought it was sort of implied, if anyone knows of a spell to put on a ring , or a ring that once put on you can see demons or spirits leave a comment, or just leave a comment on what you might know.Heya, so I am new to this. My story is long and confusing. I've been in the dark in a lot of things. I was adopted from Ukraine. I was born in 1999 and adopted when I was 3 by an American couple. My adoptive Catholic mother had a vision of adopting me. There is no record of my birth name, not my birth fathers or mothers. I'm now almost 20, a musician, a loyal partner in a relationship. I've made strides in the local music scene where I live. And have a descent job. So at face value in pretty well off. But due to my lack of knowledge on my birth. Where I came from (who I came from), why I ended up in america, why I ended up being giving up without any evidence to backtrack and find out anything about where I came from, I've been walking around for years feeling empty, alone, and fake in a sense. I was baptized twice. Once possibly when I was back in Ukraine, and then again (as catholic) in america soon arrival. I never really believed in Jesus Christ as my Lord and savoir, and don't really understand the religious  viewpoints of catholicism. I've been thinking for a while now, (looking for something to help me feel more at peace with myself. To find my porous and self worth)  since about 18, what Wicca was and what it was all about. I've read a little into it, and I really like it. Although some of it doesn't make sense, I can see the reason for the veiwpoints. I am confused about where to start and how to start. I'm not really a big solo performer and I don't have many friends due to being pretty introverted. I'm interested in learning more about witchcraft and covens. Maybe even possible joining one and developing friendships with people who have similar goals and aspirations in self betterment. Please do reply and reach out. ThanksMy boyfriend‚Äôs sister‚Äôs house has a crescent moon on the back doorbell of the house and I was wondering if it had a particular meaning within the Wicca communitySo I'm new to Wicca, I mean I've been learning about it for a while but just now starting to try to practice. 

Anyways, last night I had a dream with Anubis in it. I don't remember what happened. I don't even recall seeing what he looks like. I didn't even remember it first thing in the morning. It wasn't until I was hearing to work when I was hit with the sudden "Anubis was in my dream last night." 

Does anyone have any thoughts as to what it could be?Hi all. Long time lurker and I hope you all can offer some help to me. A friend of mine has been having issues with a spirit in her home. We have tried a few things but nothing seems to work. As long late it has been more intense and is effecting her mood and her mental well being. We would like to try and rid her home of this entity but are unsure where to turn. If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you much love.I'm in the process of assembling the physical elements of my altar for ritual use, and I was curious if there is anything wrong with performing rituals before the altar is completed.My dad is very against me being Wiccan. He won't tell me why except that he had a bad experience with it when he was younger. I have been told that I am not allowed to be Wiccan. I really just want to be able to start on my path but I'm scared to because I am scared of what my parents will do if they find out. I would move out because I am 21 but I'm disabled and not able to drive or care for myself properly.Did a show on coming out of the witch closet.  Ep 215  hillbillynerdtalk .com.  Anyone have some feedback on this topic?    I‚Äôve been interested in Wicca and witchcraft for several years now, but I haven‚Äôt had the courage to fully immerse myself into it. I‚Äôve done things like feeling the earths energy while laying down in grass and cleansing the very few crystals I have with incense, but I honestly don‚Äôt know what to start out with. What I‚Äôve been trying to do is reading everything I can about craft and writing notes down in a notebook so I have a full understanding of it. What I‚Äôm starting out with is the history of Wicca, witchcraft, etc. I‚Äôve only written down a few notes from a book I‚Äôm currently reading but I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing it right. Please if anyone has any tips or suggestions on books I can read it would be a blessing! Hey :) I'm fairly new to Wicca, and I've always been drawn to faeries. I've recently heard about the Faerie Wicca path, and I was hoping to find some resources about it and maybe talk to people about it. Thanks ‚úåÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚ôçHello all!
I‚Äôve been walking the craft path for 30 years, hunting out the ‚ÄúEaster eggs‚Äù of knowledge, exploring the meta wisdom of the world and that path has lead me here!   Looking forward to chatting in this community.  I really need any advice will help. To start I am a clairvoyant, high empath, and medium. I always have been. I struggle with some mental health issues, that make me question intuitive feelings I have.  I do not know this person well, we only met once. I am still learning about Wicca/magical practice, but very skilled with readings via, Intuitive feeling or cards. The past 3 years my life has been incredibly chaotic and strange. It is all too much to explain, but I have a list of symptoms/information about this issue. 
1: she does practice Wicca. And has talked about doing hexes and curses in the past to my current boyfriend 
2: the night I met her the vibes/feelings from her were the worst I ever felt. The emotions emitting from her nearly made me puke, the sadness was so strong I almost wanted to comfort her. She came to the party alone. 
3: I witnessed a suicide by car crash the same night on the way home. 
4: I started having repeated dreams/intrusive obsessive thoughts about her, after that night that would come and go, along with suspicion about her communicating with my boyfriend that  was never true. 
5: my job and life were successful, when I suddenly left my boyfriend for 6 months, for an abusive ex. I quickly fell  ill with a flesh eating staph infection. Starting on my face. It almost killed me causing me to lose my job. 
6: I had never been jealous or paranoid  before, only for this one person who I have no real reason to feel that way towards. 
7: our cars all broke down and stopped working and would break down again the day after they got fixed. 
8: I have repeated outbursts of rage for no reason. 
9: I always had a gut feeling but never wanted to admit it.
10: I have thoughts and feeling that aren‚Äôt my own. As well as repeated illness of myself and death in my family.
I feel like i am crazy for this, but after that night the past 3 years have been hell. It felt surreal. Possibly being cursed by a jealous ex was the last thing on my mind, but I can‚Äôt ignore this feeling any longer. Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated.
    I've been seeing a lot about Dolores Cannon & her books about the metaphysical. I'm honestly not sure what to think about her? I agree with most of what she says about life being a school for our souls, but I just can't seem to trust her books?
She reminds me of Silva Brown & her books on just about everything metaphysical. I liked her books when I first started reading a few, but then got bored at her repeating herself & really stretching the boundary between spiritual/ illusion.
What are ur thoughts on these type of spiritual leaders? Are they real or just about making money?I'm completely new to this and want to talk to people about this. Like, what do I read, where do I look for information?I got a major infestation of mice in my house, and I‚Äôve never even seen a mouse unless it was in a pet store. My hallucinations have also been strictly mice, and their shadows. Is it possible this is a sign of a deity, like Apollo, trying to contact me?Hi,

I was wondering if there's a way to send a letter to the dead. I was thinking of writing a letter in dragon's blood ink, then burning it over a campfire. Are there any more steps I should take/I'm missing?

Thank you for reading,

\- Eleanor.I‚Äôm sorta new to Wicca, I know a lot about it and I believe in everything the religion says but I‚Äôm still at the beginning of my wicca/spiritually journey. Something I‚Äôm finding really hard is figuring out what path I want to go down, there are so many that I don‚Äôt really know where to start or how to figure out which one is best for me. One of the problems is more than one of paths speaks to me. Like I‚Äôm interested in green wicca but also in fae wicca. I want to dive deeper into my journey, I want to find a detitie to worship and set up my altar but I know I have to figure out my path first. And I just feel lost. I tried googling wicca paths but it just feels overwhelming.

What do I do? how do I find the path that‚Äôs right for me? And how do if a path is right for me? Any ways that are easier to research about wicca paths? Any advice in gernal 

Blessed beBut as I'm looking at things I'm wondering does my altar have to have the God as well? I focus more towards the goddess and have more of the female energies geared towards my practice. Can't my altar be set to me specifically or is there a rule to everything? Thanks in advanceWhat are some reputable books on Wicca and the occult?Hello- I‚Äôve always been a big gardener and very interested in paganism but I‚Äôd like to learn more about becoming a garden or green witch. Are there books I can read or a good community to join? Thank you :)I am in the process of designing a ouija board. I was thinking it would probably be a good idea to add some sigils or symbols for protection on it. Maybe ones that deter negative entities. Does anyone have any suggestions?Hello fellow witches :) I made a bracelet for my boyfriend and decided to try putting a protection charm on it. I used a clean jar and put peppermint, cinnamon, and funnel herbs in it as well as a chalcopyrite, tigers eye, purple fluorite, prehnite, and a green calcite to make the effects of everything else stronger. I used a verbal protection spell as well as intention to charge the closed jar with the bracelet in it. Is there anything e¬∑se I should do to seal it in or do you think it should be protective enough?Hello : I am completly new to wicca. Before I invest in the things to set up and Altar. Id love to connect with my deity. I have been hitting up various shops and taking pictures of books trying to get a feel for what exactly I need to be looking for. The other day a man with the name that started with O. Told me that he has been reincarnated many times to protect me. That he will die before me. At first I was freightened but then he told me things about my life I don't tell other people. Mind you this is all over text and messages. Lately he wants intercourse.  fast forward Yesterday I was in a shop looking for books on dieties and the pendiulums next to me began swinging. I asked the shop owner if that was normal. She said no. I asked the pendulum 3 questions 

1. Is o my soul mate - NO 
2. Is o my protector  -This was a hard no as it swung no then pointed to no 
3. Will my soumate be on the plane (i am going on a trip) - Yes 

I am atracted to ravens and poetry. I have been passed over by death many times. I am ill I wear protective charms and spells. I need to know what to do here. How do i find my diety? How do I know O is not something dark?Hello friends,

Every single time I have gone to sleep in the last two weeks, I have had multiple nightmares. I didn't realize that was the trend until I was talking to my mother today about my dreams. Below I'll include a summary of the dream most recent that I remember the most vividly, but in summary, my dreams include looking down and seeing my hands burning, the flesh exposed; my childhood abuser acting like I hadn't left; my partner and I arguing, and them behaving in ways I could never imagine in the time we've been together. These are just the dreams I remember. I know there are more, I have a feeling of dread in my stomach, but I do not seem them in color the way I do these ones. Summary of my most vivid dream below:

So I have naturally brown hair, and I'm looking to go blonde. I have an amazing stylist who requested I come in for a test strand before we make the big jump. The night before I went to my appointment, I dreamt that I went into the salon, and a different stylist was there. She says, "Okay, we're almost ready to get started, but I need something so follow me upstairs to get it." I followed her through this huge salon of hairstylists and nail technicians, it was like a factory. Finally we got to the stairs, there were other hairstylists with us, and we just went up the stairs. The farther we went up, the older the wood got, and the darker it was. This salon was nothing like my salon, which is classy and bright, this was a complete nightmare. I remember the stylist saying, "I needed to get my socks, but now I can't find them." Which makes absolutely zero sense to me, because socks have nothing to do with hair. That's when it ended.

 It doesn't seem like much, but it was terrifying in the moment for reasons I can't explain. If anyone could provide an interpretation for any of these dreams, or advice on how to ward of this negative energy, it would be greatly appreciated. Blessed beI am at my mom's house and walk to my car and hear water. Upon investigating, I realize her neighbor's hose had sprung a leak. Turned water off. Return home and after being there 10 minutes; I hear a hissing noise. Upon investigating, I realize our water filter system has sprung a leak in the plastic housing. I went to find a new housing and when I returned it started raining and I remembered that my rain barrels are full and I need to close the gutter diverter. I step outside to close it and realize my gutter is clogged...crap. I close the diverter and move a lid so that the overflow does not run towards the house and then the gutter unclogs.  Coincidence?Hello All- I am a new explorer on the occult path and I need the knowledge and wisdom of a true practitioner as my question is very important. I have just found out that I am pregnant. Because i have a very irregular period I have no idea how far along I am, but i fear i might be at the beginning of the 2nd trimester. I can't afford an abortion, and absolutely cannot have this child as i have been using drugs regularly and have had no prenatal care. On top of that i am a professional escort and i am not certain about the paternity, even though i practice safe sex i fear a client may have taken off the condom without my knowing because i don't do it bare. My question is  there a spell or ritual or anything that could help terminate an unwanted pregnancy? I know I would need to have the help of an expert to do such a thing, and would never try it myself. Please help, i thank you all so much!

Hello everyone.. I‚Äôm new to this and am looking for help.. I was in a very long relationship that eventually turned toxic. My ex dabbled in Wicca after we broke up and started seeing someone heavily involved in it.. to make a long story short, things didn‚Äôt go well for her and this guy.. so she had someone do a ‚Äúcutting the cord‚Äù spell or ceremony? I‚Äôm not sure which but we started dating again after that and it just became very toxic.. she has always told me that if things didn‚Äôt work out with us again she would do the ‚Äúcutting the cord‚Äù thing again with me.. I‚Äôve recently approached her about this and she refuses to do it now.. I don‚Äôt understand why so I came here to ask for help .. I‚Äôve tried moving on but I can‚Äôt break this attachment to her..she‚Äôs all I think about and I just want to move on at this point‚Ä¶ can someone please point me in the right direction?

In the past my uncle had been hexed and his mental state deteriorated after that. A lot of things seem to go wrong in my life and I was wondering if something similar could have happened to me. 
And if I am how do I cleanse it or get ride of itHey Folks. Please be gentle as I am feeling a bit fragile and scared right now

TL:DR at bottom


I used to practice when I was younger and more full of hope and magic I guess. Got into an abusive realtionship. He made me stop, said he didn't get it and it was strange. 
Got Brain cancer. Survived that. Got married. ( Doh! ) Then got divorced a year later. I left him and moved four hours away and started over completely. 

Alot of things I pushed away have come pushing back full force. I'm having very VERY vivid nightmares about snakes. Like snakes eating things. Not me but like.... Other animals and stuff. The lights in my home have been flickering constantly since Christmas Eve. I came out of my bathroom at around 11:24pm on Christmas Eve and I SWEAR I saw something! Like a shadow animal of some sort. I didn't feel scared. It startled me at first but I kind of talk to whatever it is on a regular basis. I usually ask it not to flicker the lights when I need them on. Works most of the time. I'm glad it's here whatever it is.  I've always " seen " and " felt " things as a kid. Always been super sensitive to it until I shut it out. 

Now that I'm opening back up agian I just feel scared and like I'm crazy. " Is this happening? Do I really feel and see things? Or am I just crazy? " I seem to be asking myself this alot lately. 

I guess I'm asking for some help. I want to set up an altar agian and dust off my tarot deck. I just want to do so safely. Maybe a witchy friend to talk to would be nice. 


TL:DR

Shut out magic feelings due to toxic realtionship.
Left him. Left home town. Opened up agian and now getting magical push back.UK Census 2021: What is Your Religion? Wicca form guide

Most of my life I've had 'lucid' dreams. Everything is extremely real, and I have complete control of myself, however almost never have control of my surroundings in the dream. 
Everytime I fall asleep I feel like my soul is flung across space and I have to quite literally avoid nets that are scattered. If I hit a net I'm 'captured' into a dream. If I make it all the way, past all stars, I become a northern pygmy owl. So throughout my life I've had some really interesting dreams, and some very terrifying dreams.

I've recently started following some witchy ladies on IG and they are really inspiring me to start my journey. I'm not entirely sure that Wicca is what I am looking for but I figured it was a place to start. I definitely feel a connection to nature, and the moon itself. I've been listening to a podcast that talks a lot about the feminine and dark goddesses. If that is something different please let me know. I've also joined a pagen FB group in my area but it seems to be mostly men so I don't feel.... comfortable (sorry men).

[https://discord.gg/9zzVjDr](https://discord.gg/9zzVjDr)...worst major Sabbat for me ever, actually. Yesterday was absolutely wretched for me.

It started off great‚ÄîI was cheerful and being productive despite some setbacks‚Äîthen, I guess in the distraction that sometimes comes from sheer exuberance, I made a stupid and careless mistake (when usually I‚Äôm overly *cautious*)‚Äîand I broke one of my best friend/housemate‚Äôs monitors by setting I‚Äôd down in s precarious place. 

Stupid, *utterly* avoidable mistake with major consequences, and yet I did it anyway.

It messed up her day up totally (and she‚Äôs been having an absolutely horrible time lately), and I couldn‚Äôt even rush out and get her a new one, since we‚Äôre in Houston and Tropical Storm Beta had most electronics stores closed for the day. 

And it messed up my day because I have a virtual *phobia* of making mistakes. And I started to freak out and have a panic attack...and I had to bottle it up to be able to help her, I just barely managed it, but I don‚Äôt feel like it was a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù‚ÄîI feel like I broke something and it just feels dead in my chest,

I feel like a failure as a as friend because *she* deserved to be freaking out, with me comforting her, but I was barely keeping it together which just made her mad because she was the legitimate victim here and me panicking makes it all about *me*. Which is a legit complaint, because freaking out is my defense against the crippling terror I have of screwing up, but it‚Äôs not a conscious one.

The worst part is that I started out having such a *good* day...and because I felt good, I guess, I didn‚Äôt listen to my usual paranoia about screwing up, so I screwed up and it had consequences for someone else and I couldn‚Äôt fix it or even properly comfort her.

I‚Äôm a middle aged woman who‚Äôs been a witch for thirty something years, so this isn‚Äôt exactly a newbie looking for help, but me searching for meaning in this event happening yesterday, on the day about harvest.

Is this the harvest I‚Äôve earned this year? But my problem has been too much lethargy and caution, not too much energy or hastiness.

What is the lesson here? That when I‚Äôm too happy, something bad will happen? That‚Äôs a lesson I‚Äôve been trying to *unlearn* for decades.

That I need to be more cautious? I‚Äôm already (usually) so painfully cautious that I get made fun of for it. This was so out of character for me that I can hardly believe I did it. 

That freaking out so much at making mistakes is a bad thing to do? I knew that already‚ÄîI don‚Äôt seem to be able to stop it.

That I can control my actions even in the midst of panicking at one of my worst nightmares? That‚Äôs a legit lesson, yes‚Äîbut it was so hard it feels like I broke something vital doing it. 

I don‚Äôt feel accomplished‚ÄîI feel like I killed something in myself. My chest feels hollow, and even once I had the chance to react and let myself cry. I couldn‚Äôt. I still can‚Äôt. It feels like stifled grief trapped inside.

It was one of the worst experiences of my life because it wasn‚Äôt random‚ÄîI *caused* it. I was responsible for it. I screwed up badly by doing something stupid that I would never ordinarily do, and I still don‚Äôt know why I did it.

And I had to remain present and aware (in suppressed panic) for ten hours afterwards...and I *still* failed to comfort the person I hurt by it.

And why in the name of all gods did it have to happen on Mabon, and on a day when I felt so cheerful and optimistic before then?

Anybody got any wisdom that might help...?Hey everyone! I've been struggling lately to handle my empath gift. I lost a family member yesterday. I usually avoid funerals and wakes because its so hard to rid myself of the grief ive absorbed. What are your ways of dealing with your gift?  How can i help block others feelings in the situation when i am overwhelmed.  Ive recently gotten back to my Wiccan journey so any guidance is appreciated.  Blessed Be!I finally figured out how to meditate my own way and feel like it‚Äôs accomplishing something 
The people I would talk to always would say a calming lit up room and quiet . I quickly would get side tracked and start thinking about to much the case for me is a dark room with one candle and my crystals and rocks  and music on and I can focus on breathing because my mind is taken over by music ! I feel so much better that I found this out after 4 years of trying everything I was told and nothing working ! I‚Äôm so happyHi there! I‚Äôm kinda new to Wicca and don‚Äôt really know anyone else with good knowledge about it and would love any help or advice for some direction.21M

I have a book that I usually refer to for these kinds of things but I won't be home for a few days and I don't want to forget about it. So last night I had a very vivid dream and I was wondering if anyone can help me interpret it any. 
In the dream some other people and I were going to be taking a test on something (I don't remember what exactly). We had a few weeks to get prepared. We didn't have to take it but if we did and failed the consequences would be that we would have to basically be slaves for them for a thousand days (specifically a thousand). There was a guy that everyone expected to fail horribly. (I don't know this guy in real life or anyone like him, but I remember having very strong romantic feelings for him. In real life I'm not really worried about romance or even looking for it.) The day comes and I pass the test and I see others being taken away because they failed. I watch the guy as he passes extremely easily. He comes up to me saying he wants to talk to me about something after and I say okay. We all head back to a classroom but he isn't there. Everyone gossips about how he obviously failed but I ignore them because I knew he passed. He finally walks in and comes to talk to me. He has a gift for me. It's a homemade hat that has a bunch of stuff written on it (they were supposedly funny to dream me but some of it was just like happy birthday and other random things). He then took me on a walk and talks about stuff that relates to the things written on the hat and he was super sweet and funny. I very distinctly remember the way he made me feel, happy and giddy. I don't remember too many other details of this part because it was right before my alarm woke me up.

Sorry that it was so long. If anyone has any ideas on what any of this might mean that would be great. Thanks to anyone who reads this.Hello everyone!
I am new to Wicca and I would love to know of any good resources of information to learn from as well as resources to get started. 
There‚Äôs a kind of peace that I find within the community and within Wicca that I feel draws me. I want to take it a step further and dedicate myself to the craft and really surround myself with good energy. Thank you! Blessed be!Hello,

My name is Aaron, but everyone here can call me Grim if y'all like. I'm new to Wicca. I grew up in a Christian household. However after doing my own research found my self not agreeing or believing in the same things I was researching. A lot went on but I now find myself more agreeing with Wicca than anything. I fall more so under an eclectic witch who focuses on crafting items and tools for those that need it. 

Again I'm new to this. And am trying to learn all I can. I have Gods I fallow, but for the most part call on Gods as needed for guidance. It's a bit complex for me but basically I fallow Hades, Persephone, the Fates (Norns specifically) and the Seasons. Hecate is another important deity  who I respect and feel connected to. However I'm not sure if I'm called to fallow her. It wouldn't surprise me. 

I'm here to ask for guidance and help. I am already apart of a coven. One that is as close to me as family.  But I also seek knowledge. I'm the type to discuss metaphysics for fun. So please fill free to lay it all out for me. And I hope to have a wonderful time with you all.Hellooo!! I‚Äôve been really really really interested in wc since I was 14 and have never actually gotten into it and now I‚Äôm 19 and I‚Äôm still lost as to where I start? 
I see bits and pieces of information everywhere, and even witches telling me to start.. but never someone actually getting into HOW and WHERE to start. 
Soo.. can anyone help? Maybe even Give me pointers please?I know it's always best practice to ask someone before doing a spell, charm or request the Divines guidance for another person, but with the stereotypes surrounding the Craft, I'm not flaunting my practice. But there are some friends and family members who I wish to protect and bless in various parts of their lives. As a (perhaps rude) comparison example, I know many Christians pray for others without asking, purely in good will (good faith, hmm. Punny, isn't it? ü§≠).

I've made a point, when brought up in conversation, to ask permission in the past. But said friends and family will either be angered and or fearful at the mentioned of Witchcraft. I purely want good will, blessings and protection for them. Do I simply pray for such, or would casting a spell, charm or blessing for them be acceptable?

I know not everyone does, but I follow and believe in the "Golden rule/Rule of Three/Karma" so I take care to put out only what I seek in return, hence my moral dilemma.

Suggestions/thoughts?Okay so I was recently trying to scry through candles the other day, and while doing so my time was cut short by my cat who seemed all to eager to want to know what was going on. Before I stopped completely though the last thing I saw was a skull-like symbol. Could anyone let me know what thia possibly means?I recently read about poppets, having assumed they were more voodoo/hoodoo black magic related. I was interested in learning that many witches (general term I use for those who follow the Craft) use them for intense casting for themselves or others. That they can be used to enhance a spells intent and target. Even have been used in place of/ in tandem with witches protection jars. 

I know each religion has followers who twist the good into use for bad, and find myself broadening my opinion on poppets. I'm working on a spell for a friend and fellow witch, at her request, and with her permission, I'd like to craft one for the spell.

I'd like opinions, personal experiences, and even educational info/links to read more about them, if y'all don't mind. üôÇHello! I am a Wiccan, who has lost their touch. Life got in the way and I stopped prioritizing religion. My question could be coined as dumb, but what is the official title of a male witch in the wiccan community? 

I feel as though warlock and wizard sound like fantasy and have been ruined by media, where as witches it's a little different. You tell someone your a witch, they may be skeptic but they believe you. Tell someone your a wizard...immediately it's like wth bro that doesnt exist. 

Thoughts? Thanks!I was just wondering, since I haven't bought any candles (or really, anything for an altar), is there a specific type/brand of candle that's preferred by the deities? and would the color of the candle matter?

Signed, a curious baby witch :)I am very curious to hear all about your experiences.Hi I‚Äôm very knew to Wicca. I really want to find a deity. I‚Äôm really drawn to Loki. How do I reach out?so, i'm not super-duper knowledgeable in the topic of wicca (i'm just a baby, i'm still doing research and all that), but i have a question, and i came here to see if someone would be able to answer it :)

i was wondering if it's possible to have patron gods from two different mythologies/cultures, say, apollo and loki?

to anyone with patron gods from two or more different mythologies/cultures, do they interact? if so, do they get along at all?Hi I'm Sara I'm new here and to wicca and need help ASAP please i would have great appreciationhi

im not wiccan cuz i have very limited knowledge but ive always wanted to be friends with one! im 16Hey guys I'm new here and I have a question, so yesterday night at the full moon my third eye area felt such a pressure I've never had this before. Could someone explain to me what that could mean? I also can never sleep during the full moon NEVER. Btw I am 16 and I found not so long ago out that I might be a witch. And now I am lowly educating myself and all that. It'll be very nice if someone could tell me what that was supposed to mean. :)))) thank you.Why do I feel so sad and low I'm an aquarius and I know its gonna be a new moon tomoz 
I feel overwhelmed and tbh tired 
I feel like iv wasted my lifeHi loves,

I‚Äôve been struggling on tapping into and trusting my intuition with spells, tarot readings, and even my validity on my Wiccan path. Does anyone have any good resources for helping with this? Be it books, podcasts (I am listening to tarot for the wild soul; Lindsay has a few episodes on this topic), blog posts, whatever. I know it stems from my incredibly low self-esteem and I think strengthening my intuition and just believing in myself and my inner voice would help tremendously with that.I‚Äôm actually looking into Wicca and might need to convert to it so can anyone link me to some helpful pages and stuffI can‚Äôt locate a definitive answer but I believe that what is needed will be provided. When gathering altar items, I came upon 2 nearly identical pillar candles. Both are silver. The only other identical candles that I have are white tea lights and white votives.Hi I‚Äôm a particularly new witch in training. (Preferably sea witch) and I have been feeling like working with Poseidon. Is there any info I should know about him in terms of incantations and blessings. I understand offerings however the rest of how to honor him is incredibly hard to findMy whole life, I have always had these unexplainable visions. They only happen if something triggers them. I‚Äôm going to try to explain this with words, but bear with me, it‚Äôs difficult to describe. 

For example, I‚Äôll be driving through a neighborhood that I‚Äôm unfamiliar with. I‚Äôll look over and see a house I‚Äôve never seen. Immediately, I‚Äôm in a weird trance. Random memories or dreams I‚Äôve had a long time ago appear in my brain. It‚Äôs extremely vivid. As I‚Äôm typing this, three have come to mind that I‚Äôve had multiple times. One of ‚Äúme‚Äù (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my own memory) on a very old computer, around the late 90s, surrounded by toys. Another is one of ‚Äúme‚Äù (not me) looking out a kitchen window of a 70s style home and looking at a mansion on a hill with all their lights on, and another of me as a child (but again, not me) climbing under a piano while an old man is playing it. 

I‚Äôve considered that these are past life memories, but the time frames that I feel they belong in don‚Äôt necessarily add up. I would have had to have died at age 6-12 in all of them. 

There have even been moments where I look at a picture of someone famous or a video of them before fame and get weird visions/daydreams of their life from their perspective and it‚Äôs bizarre. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is something anyone has experienced before? Is this all in my head? Like I said, they all have triggers. They‚Äôre pointless random memories, no message behind them or anything. But they‚Äôre so odd. Each one gives me a specific feeling and emotion that I can‚Äôt describe and I feel is unique to the person whom it belongs to. These memories are not mine for sure. 

What could this be?Hey. Im new to wicca and i would like to learn more about itHello,

I'm a 23 year old man. I've been feeling for the past few weeks a draw to wicca, crystals and such like. I've never thought about it before but I love just around the corner from a little shop that sells trinkets, crystals and books. I need something spiritual in my life and really feel this is calling me.   Please can someone advise me where I should start? It seems so overwhelming, I don't know where I should start. Can anyone point my in the right direction? Appreciate any answers. XMy friend has been having a tough time with a lot of issues and is becoming depressed because of it. Also he is living with his boss who is intentionally making his life difficult both in and out of the workspace and and at home. He doesn't believe in this stuff so I would have no way to get him to cast a protection spell on him self. Any help  advice or ideas?Mobile user, pardon the format

TLDR: is it possible to have two patron gods/goddesses from different cultures?

I‚Äôve always had a weird relationship with religion. Christianity definitely not my thing, spiritualism is more my parents thing, and nothing ever felt right, but I know there‚Äôs SOMEONE out there looking out for me.

My friend who‚Äôs sorta helping me navigate this all is a Celtic Druid, so idk if this applies to any other parts of Wicca but they have a patron god and goddess.

Im almost positive that my patron god (if I have one) is Kokopelli, as he‚Äôs been a big part of my life since I was tiny and I always felt so happy to see him and symbols of his. I also remember having very vivid dreams heavy with his symbols and what he represents. Well, some of them I‚Äôm pretty sure are dreams but I‚Äôm honestly not sure which are real and which aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never had a dream of him specifically, but he‚Äôs featured in a lot of them, and again, he keeps popping up in my life a lot. So long story short I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs my patron god.

My actual question is if it‚Äôs possible to have a patron god/s or goddess/es from different cultures? Kokopelli is specifically Native American, and comes from the southwest. Would it be possible per say that another would be someone from something like Slavic paganism? I‚Äôm not actively looking for another patron god if I even have one, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm still super new to this but I was just curious if it‚Äôs happened/is common or even possible.I'm new to practicing. I've just decided on Persephone as my patron goddess. I've been looking for some symbols or sigils to represent her, and haven't had much luck finding anything with a real sense of reason behind it. I'm also leaning towards Hades as a representation f the god. He doesn't have a ton of consistent representation either since he wasnt super popular among annciebt Greeks. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places? Does anyone know of any good sources for something like this?I just got into the community and don't know much but I do know some basic stuff like sage is used to cleanse. I was wondering if there was a substitute for sage since my mom is basically allergic so I can't burn it and have it around me/my home
Thanks :3Hello my name is Henna and I am new to Wicca. I‚Äôm looking for some good books for beginners to Wicca, Wiccan, Witch Craft, and Paganism. 

A little bit about me: I was raised atheist, but my parents are what you would call ‚ÄúHippies‚Äù, but they are just generally earthy people. I love nature and animals and I would like to be more connected them spiritually. I like to consider myself intuitive or empathetic, but by habit I am extremely analytical and logical (I‚Äôm an Accountant).

If anyone has advice or guidance I would appreciate it. I am also looking for some mentoring, but I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask.

Thank you for your time!Firstly, happy full moon everyone! I cannot find my tarot deck anywhere. I recently moved and didn‚Äôt see it when I was unpacking all of my belongings. Maybe I‚Äôm too superstitious but does this mean something? Or does this mean I‚Äôm going to receive bad karma for obviously not treating my deck with the respect I should‚Äôve? If I‚Äôm overreacting please let me know!Have honestly been a bit curious about Wicca for a long time now, probably around 7th grade, I'm 19 now. Last night I had a conversation with a friend of mine who claimed to have religious beliefs set in Wiccan traditions, and this sparked my curiosity even more. I didnt know she was until last night, as I havent been able to talk to her much until recently. I guess what I'm asking is, can anyone provide me with a bit of information on the topic?

Thanks in advance,
 -Rap.I've started making a homemade pentacle necklace, and was wondering if there was a way to make it into a talisman or charm. Not sure what purpose I want to give it yet, but suggestions are welcome.Im new to wicca and have been using tarot cards and such. I believe i have tapped in to my foresight and other abilities. In my history class we've been talking about world war 1 and 2 and ive been getting what i believe to be memories of a war. Is it possible that i could be seeing what ibe done in past lives? Also im being dead serious please dont call me crazy. Thank youI am a diagnosed schizophrenic. I take my prescribed medication. My visual hallucinations are getting worse. I can see/hear/and feel my demons. Is there, please tell me, any way that I can banish these demons??? I have never practiced black magic and I was never cursed. The reason that these demons are here is purely because of my illness, which leads me to believe the majority of them are not real, except for one.Hello, I am Lisa. I am new to Wicca but I'm seeking more knowledge. I have two Wiccan friends who are trying to help me. One is always busy and the other usually says she can't tell me or that she has no clue. I am what I heard was called a seer. I get strong feelings of danger when it is approaching. It is like a clench in my heart almost unbearable. I get fragments of sentences mainly just words coming to me such as the person in danger, the name of who is doing the deed, or like hair color of that person. I had a premonition dream for the first time a week ago. Even with my sleeping medication I have strong vivid dreams which typically you don't dream with sleeping medication. I fear of no one believing me, but I crave more information to help me decide a path I wish to take. I was speaking to Apollo and he told me that Daphne wished to speak to me. I agreed she said "Danger and death approaches." I spoke to my friend about it. She turned to me and said "How did you find out about her?" Because she hadn't told me about Daphne yet. I also did scrying and i kept seeing a swirl, compass, heart, and a clock. I had in the water a penny (for some reason I felt I needed to use a shiny a penny) that shined vibrant green. I don't know what this means.Hi, I hope someone here can give me some insight.

For the last month I have been seeing an eye watching me. Normally it's in my peripheral vision, but occasionally right front of me. It even turned up in a dream a couple of nights ago.

I first saw it a couple of hours after my dad passed away. Now, I can see people jumping to the conclusion that it's my dad watching over me. The thing is, the eye is a dark brown, my dad's eyes were blue. All my family for at least 2 generations on both sides have had blue eyes, we are very white, a lot of blondes and gingers, not a lot of melanin. 

If it makes a difference, I suspect it might, it is always a right eye. The skin I can see around the eye is definitely caucasian, though again, not as milk bottle white as my family's generally is. The eye never seems to blink, at least if it does it is in perfect synchronisation with my own blinks so I don't notice. 

My anxiety is getting worse because this eye is beginning to freak me out. I hope someone can give me a direction to look in or a suggestion of why it might be appearing.

Thanks in advance.i need to make my citizenship process faster.

people wait for 5 years and I simply do not have that time. there are some material things that would help me but not as much.

it is simply draining me. its a very specific issue but any help will be much appreciated.

if you help me I can give you tarot readings in exchange.

thank you.So I‚Äôm interested in practicing Wiccan/witchcraft (yes I know there are differences) and am interested in working with Hecate as practicing witchcraft is intriguing to me. Also good spiritual methods to help with stress would be appreciated. Thanks!I'm relatively new and read only a little bit but I started because I had a lot of experiences with paranormal activities, feeling death and mood changes. I'm an empathetic person, even though I don't try to be one I immediately feel the mood change of a person. Now I happened to get to know an experienced witch and her first impression on me was that my aura is freely flying around like a bee on speed without any protection. She wasn't surprised when I told her I'm always tired and loose energy quickly and she told me it's okay to be empathetic but I need to protect myself to stop taking in the "bad vibes" especially because it seems like spirits are attracted to me. Sadly we couldn't talk further so I only know that I'm a walking disco ball but don't know how to stop it. Can somebody help me?What do you put into your Samhain bonfires?

Herbs? Oil?Hello all! 

I have been interested in Wicca for years and I‚Äôve bought many books and supplies. I feel like there‚Äôs so much info that I don‚Äôt really know where to start. Any tips or recommendations from you would be helpful. I just always feel overwhelmed when looking for books/crystals/herbs and I‚Äôm not sure where I even need to begin. Thank you!Can I charge my tiger eye in moon water or is it bad for the crystal?For a long time, I've felt very religiously lost. I've always had a love for science and to an extent a love of god, though no religion has felt fulfilling, like it gave the answers I seek about the universe, about our world. I believe that there are things we don't understand, forces that affect us in ways both small and big. I was wondering if there is anyone else who has had a similar experience with religion and found Wicca (Wiccan? I guess I don't exactly know what it's called) and would maybe be willing to help me out a bit, at least give me some direction to learn moreSo, i had a dream last night, I was in the UK's and it was night all the time.

At some point, I was walking alone on the unknown streets(I am not from UK), and different persons tried to talk to me, not attack me(I felt like something that's much stronger then me wants to contact me)and I was afraid that they'd hurt me so I fought with them, and then, it was a time-loop, where I had to kill the future me.  
Idk, I still feel something in me that someone or smth tried to contact meI Saw Deities In My Dreams And I Don't Know What It Means Can Anyone Help Me Out:Hades,Skadi,And Athena
I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with ego death, and if there are spells/ceremonies/actions you guys perform? If someone is having a hard time letting go of an aspect of their ego that no longer serves them, I think something like this could be very helpful, but I can‚Äôt find any resources online about this. Does anyone have any advice/suggestions? Thanks!Hello guys.This experience happened 3 years ago. Me and my friends love to go on a trip on  rural areas every summer. And my friend suggested that we go to her clan's village because she promised us there are nice views there for our instagram. To make the story short, we went there, hiked some mountains, took some pictures then we went to her relative's home to rest. After two days of our stay, something happened to their neighbor. They said he got possessed because he chopped woods from a prohibited area(bcos of superstitions).I was scared and curious from what I saw. The guy was extremely angry and started murmuring stuff we didnt understand.We thought it was just some Muslim language but the people said the dont understand what the guy was saying either.Then, they sought then "expert" in their village in terms of possessions. Btw, I forgot to mention that it is a Muslim community so I was confused if they have a priest that will exorcise the spirit. The "expert" looks like in his 60's and his assistants started to lay their percussion instruments made from bronze I believe. The sound from the gongs and other instruments made me feel calm and intense at the same time. Then the old man pulled a REAL sword and I was like "WTH HE'S GONNA DO?!". Then the old man started dancing with the beat. His steps were like those Wushu or Kung Fu Sword performances but in slow motion. Unlike to those movies where the person becomes more violent when the priest starts to exorcise, this was different.The posessed guy suddenly calmed and became quiet. The "sword dance" lasted for maybe 20mins then the posessed guy slept then woke up ok. I was impressed on what I witnessed then I asked my friend about it. She  said that ever since she's a kid those guys were always called every time something unnatural happens and they dont seem to have shared their method to anybody else. Until now, if Im bored Im still trying to find their method in the internet but always find nada. I searched for "Muslim exorcism" "Muslim Sword dance exorcism", reshuffling the keywords but still find nothing. So im just curious if any of you might have an idea to the method Ive witnessed? That incident was my first and last time to witness a unique method of exorcism(if you believe).Bby witch here! I‚Äôm looking for divine messages in my dreams. Are there any rituals/spells you could recommend that might be able to help enhance or clarify dreams?Hey guys so I have this incense holder in my husbands game room but the thing is that no matter what kind of incense brand or whatever it always turns off I‚Äôve tried leaving it with the flame but the flame dies quickly, even when I had incense in our room I used to put it by him and it would turn off as well unless I was putting it between us like on the window or next to me it would stay on normal, does this mean anything??okay I can‚Äôt find much about but does anyone know any spells or anything like herbal lotions or essential oil mixes (or crystals literallt anything haha) I could make to help my sister. she‚Äôs pregnant and my two questions are: 1) she‚Äôs having a lot of aches and pains (as u do in pregnancy) especially in her back and ankles. she‚Äôs 7 months so is there anything that‚Äôs safe for her that I could do to help and 2) is there anything I can do to encourage an easy labour process when it gets to it? thanks! idk where to ask so I hope this is okay!I do a lot of energy work. Do anyone know any good spells to protect your home and self? I would like something I could practice and strengthen everyday. 

I want to start focusing mainly my practices in protection. Also if you know a mind protection magick I'd love that. Honestly need it.Hello guys. Ive been studying magick for 3 years and lets say Ive been successful doing some simple wishing spells,protection and luck. Im thinking of exploring more fields and variations of magick. While Im reading, I suddenly bumped into articles about summoning demons. It caught my curiousity but Im also afraid to try due to my Christian faith(Yeah  I know i sound like a hypocrite bcos of studying magic while following a religion.lol). This is why Im asking if there are members here who are WELL-EXPERIENCED in this field. Can u please share ur opinion to these questions so I can think if Ill choose to continue on pursuing this new path or not.
1.Fiction vs Reality of demon summoning
2.Can u share a TANGIBLE result from ur "negotiation"? As a proof u can really do it and not just some fake and tryhard nerds.
3.Lets say someone can be a top and extremely good in demon summoning, what is the highest and realest demand u can ask and achieve?
4.Tips? Basics? Who is the easiest to summon?beginner friendly? I read that noobs trying to summong some top dogs could backfire so bad.

Blessed be!Ok so I am not exactly a new witch but I am when it comes to doing things correctly and not having the spell blow up in my face. I want to make sure that I am casting a good circle and not letting anything in that could harm me or my loved ones in the house. I went and bought somethings to get started such as candles, sage, incents and salt (does it have to be a certain salt?). I would just really like some input on how to do a simple yet protective circle when casting. I have quite a few questions if anyone isn't really doing anything and would like to indulge.Hello all. So I've been seeing butterflies just about everywhere I go, outside, online, on TV, etc. I looked into it and found that it could be a sign from Psyche. I tried doing more research on her, but I can't find a lot of information. The only thing that really comes up is the story of her and Eros. If anyone has any information or websites where I could find information I would really appreciate it. I've had two dreams of dying that were extremely vivid, the first one was of me hanging out with a friend. The room was dark and we were playing a video game, i said "wheres my manners" and turned on some lights and as i was doing so i fall backwards onto the floor. I didn't feel the impact, all i heard was "oh shit are you okay?" and then i heard a vague but loud ringing in my ears, i felt like i was sinking into the ground and then there was nothing, like a deep sleep without any dreams. My second dream is a lot more straightforward as i don't remember much. My apartment was flooding and the ground was totally wet. Apperently there was a live wire touching the ground, i was standing on the wet floor and could hardly move. My right hand started buzzing and i i thought to myself "am i being electrocuted? is this how i die?" I collapsed to the floor falling on my side, with that same. Vague ringing in my ear and a feeling of sinking into nothingness.. I'd like some feedback or stories on simular dreams.Hey guys newbie here. Can I try some candle maquik with out purifying everything? I was thinking of doing a circle of salt and perform it in there. Sorry if I sound dumb.I took part in a seance w some friends who used one once before. I recently got my own pendelum, I felt drawn to it n a connection n everything, just wanted tips on how to use it. One question I have is, is it better I use it the first time in my home or in a comfortable and safe part of a nearby forest ?I have a heavy fascination with ghosts and spirits. It started out from a young kid and realizing that there is more to the world. My only problem is that I seem to lack the ability to see such things. 

My question is: is there a way to better see such entities. A symbol a crystal a chant anything. To allow me such ability. I tried to look to my religion first but it was just met with nothing. 

Thank you to all for your helpHi, I'm in need of some serious self healing as well as I've always been curious in looking more into wiccan and paganism and need some new books to read. I'm looking for anything and everything!Am I allowed to have the word lady in my wiccan name or is that just preserved for a goddess or high leader in a covenI've been having issues sleeping recently due to additional stress at work (today marks 23 days in a row and long hours). I may not sleep for a few hours after going to bed which is unheard for me (moment head hits pillow sort of sleeper). 
Sunday morning, I woke up to I think it was knocking. It was in a certain order with I think 4 insistent beats close together then two or three trailing with space between. I heard the first rep coming out of sleep, then another when I crossed to fully awake and a third after I was awake. 
The sounds came from a shared wall I have with a neighbor, however the space that shares is not a space they would have access to, nor were they awake and doing things in the downstairs. 
I panicked a bit and started searching our place, making sure everything was locked and no one was inside. My cat ran around the place with me and seemed to be looking for something too which is not like him.
When I hit the kitchen, the clocks were 3am exact. I went back to bed and the rest of the night went by fine.
My husband remembers me waking up but didn't hear the knocks.
After I thought about it all, I remembered waking up to feeling the number 1634 or 1637, one of the two, when I heard the knocks.
If anyone has any insight to this (besides the 3am witching hour info) that would be lovely.Hello! This is mainly for writing purposes, but perhaps you guys can help me.

I have a character who is wiccan. However, I feel overwhelmed by how many possible gods and goddesses there are, and as research-loving as I am, it's a little hard for me to get a proper grasp on them all and such.

I've seen stuff where Wiccans have their god(s) call out to them in some way or another (by symbolism usually and all), and that those gods guide them and such. My character is rather quiet and emotionally hurt, and I was thinking the gods he'd follow would likely be gods of confidence, healing and/or inner strength. Are there any gods/godesses who are known for those things? If so, could you describe what they're like, if possible?

If this isn't how Wicca works, however, please, feel free the enlighten me! I have such an interest and curiosity in Wicca and would love to learn more about it.So I'm new to alternative religions and beliefs, while I always had an interest in it, I never managed to invest any time to acquire any significant amount of knowledge about these topics. So I wondered if it would be possible to travel back in time to fix one mistake I made. 

As far as I'm aware (maybe I'm wrong, but I'm here to learn) spells aren't an integral part of Wiccan culture but rather an addition to enhance spirituality. So I don't even know if this is the right place to ask this question but maybe one of you could help me out and put me onto the right tracks, so I can find a way to answer my question.

I am truly sorry if I wrote something offensive of inappropriate, or if I did not refer to something in the right way. Like I said I'm new to this and I'm really interested to not only learn about my question but also this cultureI‚Äôve been trying to find my patron deity(s) and I‚Äôve noticed a massive crow in front of me out of a dumpster a lot of my things are going missing and I can‚Äôt find it for weeks and I‚Äôve also noticed that I have a lot of shells but all of those signs I haven‚Äôt been able to find a common greek God or Goddess that have all those signs does anyone know of any deity with those signsI've been diagnosed with endometriosis and me and my husband really want a child of our own but with my condition it is very difficult so just looking for some suggestionsI've recently started slowly getting into wicca through tarot cards and Crystals which was all going well. The first day after I did my first reading I was having really good luck and felt amazing! However I've put my practice to the side in order to focus on my studies and my luck has taken a turn for the worst. First none of my multiple alarms go off in the morning so I miss a class, then my perfect sturdy bag rips without me noticing and then I can't find my really expensive calculator the night before my exam all on the same day! ... am I just over reacting ? What can I do to stop this bad luck ?I'm a baby witch who has just started out with wicca and decided to try a diety identification spread. For the spread I got 1) 10 of wands/rods 2) the hermit  3) the high priestess 4) the emperor 5)the hanged man. Can anyone help me figure out what they might mean? I was thinking persephone but I could be biased and wanted a second opinion.I am what you would call a Christian deist, but I am super interested in the craft. I have read up on wicca but not sure full wicca is the path I want to take. I believe in god and the teachings of Jesus but not all that about god controls our every move and determines what we do and our choices. I refuse to believe he doesn't love people people that are gay or people that dont conform to a structured religion. 

 I am very curious of witchcraft and have been since I was in my preteens to early teens. Just scared to know more as I was raised a catholic. 
I looked into Christian wicca but not sure if it's the right path since I dont fully believe in Christianity.
I cant find anything about deism and witchcraft and I'm not sure if I would even be able to find anything about my beliefs and witchcraft.

Is there any advice someone could give me or could someone point me in the right direction of how to go about learning about witchcraft within my personal beliefs?Any books or things I need to know to become Wiccan. I really feel like this is something that I connect very strongly with and that I‚Äôve finally found my religion but I‚Äôm not at all sure how to get started. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. (Books, best types of candles/crystals I should get for a beginner etc.)Hey everyone, I'm a newbie and just getting started into wicca. I'm still not sure about what deities to worship but I've had some odd things happen.

1. Heard a 2 knocks wake me out of my sleep and no one is at the door. 

2. Aircon dripped water on my pillow (has never done that since living here)

Any help would be appreciated

Blessed beWell I‚Äôm a direct descendant of John and Elizabeth proctor and I want to figure out info about my family and what they were intoWhat's up with that? I'm extremely curious about them cause I just want to know why do they exist and what's the purpose of some of them. And can any of them go wrong? Please explain them.Hello, Im not going to say Im new to being wiccan but that I am most doing some search into it to see if it.. resonates with me. 

Ive mostly been agnostic despite my mildly religious christian up bringing. This has been since I was a kid, as young as I could remembered. Everything I do is simply by how I feel or how something makes me feel. Basically, gut instinc I suppose. I feel like Ive always held a strong connection towards nature, easily connected to animals and comfortable in most natural settings. As of lately ive lost some connection to animals after I lost my cat Penguin, my closest animal. Since losing him I havent connected to things like I used too, and im tired of not having it. 

Over this past month, ive had multiple seperate occations where my mind immediately went to Wicca. Ive always had the interest in learning about wicca but this past month its been stronger than normal and catching my hyper focus. 

So ive been collecting books over it, just finished my first one and plan to move on too another because my search is not satisfied. I also wish to reach out to the community, or solo practitioners because I believe their experiences are just as valuable while i do this research. 

A part of me wants to immerse my self in this and practice this myself, but as Ive said Ive been agnostic for a while and I dont want to commite my self to something like this because I hold religions and faith with high respect. I also believe that if im to become apart of something that i need to want my entirety in it, which is why I am doing this research. 

To make sure this this is a commitment that i feel strongly about and wont feel burdened with.Yesterday (the 5th) I saw some crows or ravens (I couldn‚Äôt tell but they looked mostly like crows) I‚Äôm a baby witch and still looking for my patron and was wondering if these birds were some form of sign. Any advice to start looking into gods/goddesses relating to these two birds? Thank you!
Candles 

Crystals 

Herbs

history, types (magickal names along with scientific), uses with reason behind it, etc.

Looking for books on specifics, not ones that contain a little bit about each. In depth is best. 

I would appreciate recommendations. 

Thank you very muchHi guys, 
I'm looking for a study group/ coven in cold lake(Alberta - Canada) ( or some city close by).

I don't really know how search for, so you guys can help me?Hi everyone! You can call me your average wiccan noob (for now). 
During my studies I haven‚Äôt entirely investigated using the magic of death or dead animals/creatures. However, i have come across some interesting instances where death may come into the wiccan play. 
For example; One night I was out with my boyfriend and we decided to sit in a gated field (under the pristine moonlight). I decided to bring my white candle last minute for mood and protection. When we were ready to pack up and leave I realized there was a dead ladybug in the wax of my white candle. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to consider the possible rare magical usage this could bring. 
Next, I was walking out in my backyard one day and found a dead grasshopper (Or green cricket?) on my patio. I couldn‚Äôt help but to stare at it for awhile and consider bringing it in.. (Jiminy Cricket popped into my head) so I grabbed a baggy and placed it along with the rest of my magical tings.
Lastly, this morning I was doing some yoga and stretching while listening to the birds.. 
afterwards I went into the bathroom to do my hair. The product wasn‚Äôt coming out of the bottle so I banged it on my countertop a few times to shake it out. Next thing you know I hear my mom yell: ‚Äú(Myname) Did you hear someone knocking on the door?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúNo i was banging on the counter!‚Äù 
Mom: ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs really weird because I thought someone knocked on our door and now theres a dead bird on our porch.‚Äù 
So of course it peaked my interest, and i went to investigate. My mom said that she‚Äôd let me handle it and walked away.

What‚Äôs running through my mind is all the Witchy Wiccan things you can do with a bird! Weither its preserving the beak, the claws, the feathers and so on. I even thought about the process of just freezing and saving the whole bird. But i‚Äôm a deep animal lover and I‚Äôm not really sure if that even was a process if i‚Äôd be ready to do. Especially without having enough knowledge on the practice. 
The bird was an adult, i‚Äôm thinking raven but maybe not. 
Anyways, so I investigated the bird, talking aloud to it and asking questions for energy receiving sake, i picked it up with gloves and inspected the bird first. If i was going to get anything out of this opportunity it would be investigation at least. 
Turns out the bird was bleeding out of the nose of its beak so I ran inside and grabbed a little bottle and took the blood that was running out. There was also a small feather sticking out of place, i considered grabbing some scissors to take it out but I asked aloud ‚ÄúCan I have this?‚Äù &amp; instead of ripping it from the body I was able to easily slip it off. 
So i got some bird blood and a mini feather out of this. YES!! Maybe i can use that later. 

I buried the bird and sprinkled a circle of sea salt around the burial. Just for spiritual protection sake, benefits of dying on my porch i guess.
Anyway, maybe someone found this interesting.. if you read this far.  
SOME FEEDBACK WOULD BE GREAT! &amp; I love articles so If you have any wiccan facts for what i could use this stuff for or just wanna spit something at me feel free! Im here to learn and share!!! 
#peaceMy cousin-in-law found and purchased a chrystal box with Crystal's amulets, and an owl claw in it thrift  store). There is not negative energy coming from the box. She was advised to cleans the crystals and amulets.... but the owl claw is my concern.  I tried researching on my own what it is for and several things came up... does she have to destroy it or can it be kept.Hello everyone! I‚Äôve recently been looking into the craft and Wicca and originally wanted to practice secular craft but I felt a pull to devotional though I haven‚Äôt believed in god (in the Christian sense) in a long time. I took this as a sign and started looking into different goddesses and such and everything I‚Äôve seen says you‚Äôll get signs, but I don‚Äôt know what to look for? When reading about devotional I feel a connection but I‚Äôm unsure how to even begin down that path. Does anybody who is Wiccan and practices devotional with a specific god/goddess have any advice? Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Blessed Be!I was away for vacation a few weeks ago, and a strange thing kept happening on my stay. In the hotel, we had the right to a breakfast and lunch everyday. And every single day I went to grab a fork, and it was bent. Every day without fail the fork was faulty. It might seem silly, but I wonder if it wasn't just bad luck. I'm a begginner Wiccan, so it's possible that I've been naive in my early craft, but I don't recall doing any sort of experimantal spellwork or anything of the sort. Your opinion is appreciated.Hi my friend has had this guy practically stalk her for months now he's claimed she's strung him along (not true) this started when she was with her ex and got dramatically worse when they broke up. 
She's tried everything to get rid of him (including cleansing herself of his negativity) . The problem is she works with him so she's trying not to make the work place awkward as well even though she's been completely honest has no interest etc. 
Basically I'm hoping someone can help me with a sort of banishment spell or herb pouch so that he backs off from her . It's now getting to a point where comments he's saying are scaring her a little.  
Thanks for you help !how did you all find your matron and patron god and goddess. is it even necessary? i‚Äôm just learning and there aren‚Äôt much in the way of resources where i live.I lost my kitty, my familiar, in September. I am still reeling from her loss. She was perfect in every way. What does Wicca have to say about this loss? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. I also apologize if this is a basic question, I'm fairly new, trying to get used to Wicca, transitioning from Catholicism.Ever since I started practicing tarot three years ago, I have never once received a reading that was incorrect? If I was say... given a sign... by the cards, for an example... one that I didn‚Äôt want to hear. Would it be immature of me to ignore that sign and make my own decision?I'm really new to this and I want to research more but I have no idea were to start... I have a friend who does some Wiccan (sorry if this isn't a word...) practices and she did help me a little but I wanted more opinions/advices. Can anybody tell me where to start? What should I research more right now? I would be very thankful if anyone could help me :).Hi im new to practicing wicca and was wondering if there are any good youtube channels on the practice . Thank you in advance! So there is a full moon tommorow, and since I'm away from my home due to family Thanksgiving matters, I'm looking for any simple rituals I could do in light of this, without incense or resources. I'm still pretty new to all of this, but I feel a calling to reach out to connect with the Goddess during the full moon. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Hi I asking questions about wards, I was wondering how do they work? How do you create them? Is there multiple ways to make them? Just all around how is it all done? I'm asking cause I'm very sensitive to spiritual energy I'm also like a magnet, and the only place I feel really at peace is near a ward. So if anyone can answer my questions thank you. Im looking for a wicca discord server so i may learn more about wicca and maybe make a friend or two on there

I first heard of wicca from the youtuber chaos55t and became interested enough to well make this post Hey everyone!
My name is Keith. I have been studying Wicca for about 15 years now. 

I have tons of knowledge and I am looking to teach and just hanging out with like minded people. 

So hi!Hello!

We recently created a discord server, The M√Ωta ienoarm Coven. It strives to be an inclusive and friendly family with a structured hierarchy for a simplistic understanding of how things function. This is a newly formed Coven, and we hope to experience this fresh start with you all!

First things first, every member needs to fill out a short application. But wait! Why do you have to go through that hassle?! Well, this is because the leaders take safety very seriously, and YOUR safety is our top priority and concern. There are a lot of people out there that will try to mislead you or take your information for their own benefit. We, as the representatives, need to make sure that the scary scenarios may never happen.

Our discord server consists of 5 categories: Text Channels, Practices, Topics, Misc, and Voice Channels. We believe that each individual is free to whatever they‚Äôd like to study or talk about. This Coven is for people who may practice or believe in more than one religion/deity. We currently have 17 Practices channels, 33 Topic channels, 8 Misc channels, and 4 Voice channels. If you‚Äôre interested, please click the link provided.

We hope you decide to join our family!

P.S. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if there are only a few members. We are trying to promote and expand our horizons each day.I am fairly new to witchcraft and would love to find a teacher to guide me. I live in Georgia! Not sure if this group is still active but I‚Äôve recently taking a huge interest in Wicca. I come from a Christian family (tho I‚Äôm not Christian myself) I try to read and learn more about it without all the ‚Äúwitchcraft is evil‚Äù nonsense. Can anyone help?I‚Äôm looking to get into hydromancy. What size is recommended?

Thanks!I‚Äôm new and would like tips  Hi my name is crystal and I want to get into this. ( I‚Äôm really bad at explaining so I‚Äôm sorry if something doesn‚Äôt sound right. Just ask if it doesn‚Äôt) I‚Äôve wanted to get into Wiccan for a while now because I was raised with my mom being Wiccan so I always had this stuff around me. I have crystals, tarot cards, runes and even a book call the dictionary of Wicca or something along those lines but I was wondering if anyone had tips on where to really start. Anything helps! Thank youHello! I am not new to the practice but I have been praticing alone and I was wondering if some of you have advises on being active on my practice and diving deeper into wicca. 
I practice alone since there are not people that practice near me, so there are not covens or people that guide me and teach me. I am very confused as if I'm practicing the right way and being respectful to my deities. 
Also I need to keep them to myself because my whole family are Catholics or don't believe in anything at all, so sharing and talking about it gets very difficult :(So I make protection jars and want to do more rituals where does everyone order your herbs from ? 




Thank youMy mother is very narcissistic and was emotionally abusive and neglectful through my childhood, even as an adult I'm still struggling with her condescending comments and disapproval. Is there anything I can do to help with the anxiety I feel being around her, and how she is constantly putting me down?I've Been Very Interested In Wicca/Witchcraft for a few months and Kind of Considering Becoming a Wiccan, I've Looked around On the internet But Couldn't find anything too helpful. Can Someone who Knows Inform me The beliefs and Practices of Wiccans?One of my friends (a wiccan) asked me to make them a catch-all tray. I thought it would be nice touch to engrave a symbol or something in the tray so it's not plain and more them, but the symbols I googled don't feel right  on the tray. They didn't ask for anything engraved, I just want to make it more personal, so it's a bit of a surprise for them.

I thought about maybe combining a couple of symbols, but I realized I know next to nothing about them other than to most basic info that Google provides.  I don't even know if combining symbols is okay. I've seen a few combinations on image searches but my knowledge is basically non-existent in this area.

I ask so I don't offend my friend with some mangled mess of symbols and to learn something about the symbolism of this faith.I am a witch a 7 years and I'm starting to feel stagnant in my craft. I am a and always have been a solitary eclectic witch and I'm searching for a mother witch to help guide me on my path. Any help would be appreciated!I am newly joined, but to all... Blessed Be! Thank you for allowing me.So I am new to all this. A lot going on honestly. I light a paper with names of everyone in the last year that has ill will towards me or my family and asked to show me if I was right. I doused it in lighter fluid and continued my meditation while it burned. But it didn't burn all the names. What does that mean? What are the names that didn't burn? I did not wish an ill will. No black magic. I just was mediating and letting go of people that have been toxic to myself and family.Merry Meet all, 

I was wondering if anyone had subscription boxes (preferably Australian) that they enjoy getting?   

I have been getting the monthly boxes from Antipodean Witch but the boxes are currently well over a month late and have been not really worth the money.   

Blessed BeHey everyone, I'm new here, I've just last month started reading up on wicca and was wondering whether any of you could give me some insight. 
This morning we(myself and my 3yr old daughter) found a dead baby bird in our garden. She loves birds, but thankfully wasn't toooo sad, so she was just looking at it while I tried to read up what to do with it. She goes "look mummy that's a mean one!" I'm still looking at my phone and ask why its a mean one, and she pulls her scary face and goes cos its all black! So i look up and see this crow or raven and my full body gets those electric dead signals running up and down it so I'm like yikes, bit frozen but scare it away and get inside and now I'm tryna google whether it was a crow/raven/if its a bad omen, still feeling a bit tingly and weird. 
Just wanna know if I'm being hypersensitive or if this means something?!
Any input is appreciated, thank you!I'm new to this and want to make my BOS unique. What advice, spells, info etc. is recommended for a typical BOS. Also, is it acceptable to use a 3 ring binder as my book? I want to be able to keep it organized. TiaIdk if this post would go in here but, long story short is I am big on manifestation and I saw someone talk about moldavite on Tik Tok. So I ordered one on Etsy (I think it‚Äôs fake), so I found one at a crystal store in my town. 

Anyway I been trying to use it to manifest a relationship or to find my soul mate. Well it‚Äôs not working. Any advice? I found some texts that recommend using the symbols of the Kabbalah for magical awakening. After following the instructions for two weeks, I had an intense dream that something very bad wanted to invade me. Has someone had a similar experience?Does anyone have a good remedy for sleepiness. I have been overly tired lately to the point of near depression and was wondering what you guys would do in this caseWith tonight being the full moon I'll be taking the opportunity to make moon water for the first time.  However, my family doesn't know I am practicing. Does anyone have any tips as to how I could make powerful moon water without rasing any alarms??Hi baby witch here! So all afternoon I have been doing some much needed research on the history of wicca/the craft and I came across, from what I've gathered, to be the main god and goddess, the horned one and the triple goddess. I've got it narrowed down to Cernunnos as the god but I'm finding many different names (and religions) for the goddess. The most popular three that I've found have been Brigid (of Ireland), Diana (of Rome), and Hecate (of Greece). Now while I'm sure I'm not using the best sources (e.i. wikipedia, britannica, and history.com) these three have been the one to constantly pop up as The triple Goddess. My question, is there a right or wrong goddess to follow in partnership with Cernunnos??Hi all I'm 24 (m) and just recently got into this. I read a book written by my doctor on his first steps to becoming Wiccan and I think I may have found my path. I've ordered a book on the subject from a local small bookshop but it hasn't arrived. I'm eager to learn and practice but I'm in need of guidance. Do you have any tips on how to get started, how to find a local community, books I should be reading, online groups (apart from this one ofcourse) I should be looking into. Any and all help is welcome.I‚Äôve recently got more money and I‚Äôve been browsing through all the Wiccan books on Amazon. Are there any really good ones? I‚Äôve bought some in the past that were very poorly written and barely explained much about the topic. So what are some good books about Wicca?So Skylar and I, who is my significant other have been having terrible nightmares sometimes about one of us leaving one another. Sometimes other things.

Am I ON the right path????Does anybody have any ideas of rituals to help get rid of negative emotions and being a sad bitch all the timeI started my spiritual journey, drawn to the Moon Goddess, a few years ago, but over the last year have become more focused on my path that now includes the Horned God.  As I am learning, I was wondering if you anoint a candle you are using to represent a person with that person's astrological oil blend, is that appropriate and/or effective?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  Blessed Be!I know I posted this on 2 other subreddits, but I need help I am new to Wicca.

Thank you!hello! i posted earlier- i apologize if this is too much posting for a baby learning the ways. i struggle with a difficult mental illness. as i start to get more proficient, would a self protection type of spell be applicable in this area? like helping to protect myself from my own mental illness?Hi all! I'm looking for some nice crystal pillars for protection for my altar. What do you all recommend, and what places do you get yours from? Most of my local places are still closed. Thanks!I am 23 years old and for as long as I can remember there‚Äôs been something drawing me here. It seems there‚Äôs always been things that happen and they seem to be very connected to my emotions and my thought patterns. Example, if I‚Äôm thinking heavily about a person, they‚Äôll stop by the house, or call unexpectedly other than my preconceived notion of them calling or showing up. I remember being obsessed with drawing one character, the characters I later found out to be the character for Neptune. I put this character on everything. My mother suffered from heavy drug use and my siblings and myself always had the run and she never cared what we did, until she saw the symbol for Neptune that I had drawn on everything, she was very very perturbed by it. She said it was bad and that it was not to be in the house, this woman was a drug addict, and showed to me multiple times she has no faith. Why was this symbol so bad. Come to find out, she used to dabble in Wicca, Spirit boards, Tarot Cards and things of the like. 
My mother‚Äôs Father, was the best man I ever knew. A very very interesting man, from a young age, he taught me many many things. The first gift I recall him giving me was a hunk of what looked like a purple quarts. He told me it was my worry Stone. Anytime I was sad, mad, anxious etc, take it out and rub your right thumb to it until you feel better. He made it adamantly clear that the stone need kept in a small leather pouch with different herbs. I never knew what the herbs were, but I remember the smell. It was wonderful. A light lavendery tea leaf type smell. As I got older and interested in different things I lost touch with the stone and herbs, and all of the things my grandfather had shown me. I‚Äôm here now because I‚Äôm looking for some answers. I‚Äôm looking for a path that was maybe hidden from me. I‚Äôm looking for myself. I hope I didn‚Äôt inadvertently disrespect anyone, or anything. I am of Light and Love, an intend, no matter the path I take, to be only of Light and Love. Thank you. 

I don‚Äôt know if this helps. I was born on March 19th. 
My grandfather was born on the 14th of March. 
My son is a Cancer. My wife is a Scorpio.Hello. I‚Äôm new to reddit and Wicca so I‚Äôm putting my post here and hoping this is the right place. 
Hi I‚Äôm Kellie. I‚Äôm 31 and and new to Wicca. I‚Äôve been on a spiritual journey for a very long time and have looked in and dabbled in many religions trying to find something that ‚Äòfits‚Äô them I stumbled across Wicca through my love of nature I had no idea what it was if I‚Äôm honest and all the things I didn‚Äôt like about other religions were inherently not there in the Wiccan belief system and I just felt very relaxed and like ah so this is what I‚Äôve been searching for. Still extremely new and am looking forward to learning and implementing the Wiccan waysHi! I‚Äôm really knew in this ‚Äúreligious world‚Äù. Recently, I have been interested (more like attracted in a religious way) in the Helenism out of nowhere, and even though my favourite god has always been Hades, somehow, out of nowhere too, I‚Äôve had an ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùattraction‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù to Apollo.
So, I started investigating about the matter, reading about Helenism and pagan religions that summon to Apollo, and I wanted to know what‚Äôs the feeling when you finally get to summon him.
Today I had some kind of inexplicable happiness that lingers until now after praying (is that the word for this?) to him. Is it something you feel with him or was I under suggestion?Hi, I'm fairly new to the Wiccan community and don't really know where to begin. Therefore my question: What tips do you have for beginners ?so i'm still very much a baby witch but i've been noticing something a lot and i was wondering if anyone had any advice for it.

I've always gotten nosebleeds quite frequently and i really don't mind them, i actually usually find i feel more relaxed after them and since i have high iron levels my doctor thinks its probably a good thing because it stops my iron level getting too high. I also used to be able to make my nose bleed on purpose when i wanted to get out of things.

I've been practicing witchcraft for about a year but very low level stuff mostly just meditating, cleansing, setting intentions as i do things etc. recently i've gotten more into spell work, divination, communicating with higher powers etc and i've noticed that any time i do anything my nose immediately starts bleeding.

should i take this a sign and if so, of what?i'm getting my "blood moon" again and my cramps are the absolute worse and i want a break from using pain killers. so what plants/herbs can i use to ease the pain. preferably in tea form. and thank you so muchHello there!

https://discord.gg/8HDGBurpEmHi, like the title says i need help. Well more like advice really. I've always been researching into wicca and the different deities. I haven't really been able to jump in with both feet as you will. Or even get anywhere really because my family are severely Christian and are one of those people who believe having a different faith or religion or even being part of the lgbtq+ community will summon satan and all that kind of stuff. But since I've turned 18 I'm starting to get away from their toxicity and have started trying to get back into what i love. 

But anyways any advice? I still need to keep things on the down low as i still live with them.

Today my grandmother gave me this big nacre seashell who‚Äôs been underground for long time and now I‚Äôm trying to clean it with some soda and water scrubbing it but I don‚Äôt see so much results, I hope someone can help me xI‚Äôm not a witch, but It was 11:11 and I heard you could make wishes so I did but I worded it badly and now I‚Äôm worried. I wished for ‚Äúeverything to go away‚Äù when I really meant my problems with anxiety. I corrected myself but idk what to do. I‚Äôm probably overthinking but is this bad? Can I fix it?Which hands are joined together during a handfasting?
I know most people would use both hands of the man and woman,  but if they chose to bind only 1 hand of each person, which would it be? Right hand and right hand or left and left?

ThanksHellooo so I made a Twitter as a fun little thing to document my journey in witchcraft,. But I want some suggestions on witches I could follow and get tips and just look at for motivation if that makes sense??Hello everyone! 
I just started an Etsy shop (TheLittleMagickShop) where I am selling small hand made besoms for cleansing and purifying. You can add and choose your own string colour, essential oil, spell, and crystal to be on it ‚ù£Ô∏è please check out my shop![The Little Magick Shop](https://etsy.me/2XbjyVI)Hey everyone I‚Äôm VERY new to all of this. My grandmother was Wiccan but she died when I was young so I never learned from her. My interest has been peaked many times to learn and be a part of Wicca but recently I got this deep intent and urge to really do it. My issue is I honestly do not know where to start.... I keep getting frustrated trying to know what I must have or must do firstly. What Deity‚Äôs there are or who I should choose? Or do I get chosen? Please send help! 

I have an alter set up already, most things I already had because I was drawn to those items. I have Scott Cunningham‚Äôs guide got the solitary practitioner as well as the green witch. (Just started on the first book)Hi everyone! I grew up Christian(ish) and I have a daily Christian devotional that I got into when I started questioning that faith and really just having a complete spiritual crisis. I like having a short one-page reading that I could easily do with my coffee every morning and loved journaling about the day‚Äôs theme/lesson/affirmation. 

I am wondering if there is anything similar for Wicca? A daily devotional of sorts? OR is there anyway to use the Christian one I have an apply Wiccan/Pagan beliefs to it? I have the year and a day study book but I‚Äôm looking for more of a daily reading as my schedule doesn‚Äôt always allow for me to sit down and do a for a ritual. 

Thank you!My family and I just moved into a new apartment right as Covid 19 was beginning to effect our area (businesses shut down, lay offs, quarantine) and as I was unpacking I found that the sage I had been broken into smaller pieces and not able to be bundled together.(I tried and failed) Is there a way that I can still use it to cleanse the apartment? It would be my first time doing so (I'm still learning) and my wife suggested burning on a plate or something. I think that might work I was just looking for someone to either confirm that it would or give me another option.I have started reading a year and a day and am in need of some items for the rituals and spells in the book. I am having trouble though finding a place to order them from or finding them in general. Right now I am in need or myrrh resin or powdered orris root, a mix of meadowsweet and powdered oak bark, and a compass.. any suggestions?Hey guys, 

So I've been having nearly repetitive dreams for some time now, and I feel like it is a deity trying to reach out to me. I can't seem to figure out whom, however. Each dream I'm found in a library with more books than I can see. I'm facing an individual (male) who sits in a velvet seat. He wears a navy blue suit that has been tailored perfectly to him. I cannot see his face, but I am aware that he wears an assortment of rings on either hand. The one that stands out most to me is a single band (maybe hematite) around his left forefinger. The other that stands out to me is a jeweled ring with a blue stone that he wears on his right ring finger. 

I don't remember much about the content of the dreams when I wake up, except that we have mostly casual conversation. Sometimes we are drinking tea in the dreams. Other times, we light a fire in a fireplace and just talk. 

I've asked before who he is, and he always says that it's uo to me to figure that out, but I'm at a loss. Any ideas of who it is?I was out side praying for guidance and asking for blessings over a couple of items and I asked for a sign that the goddess heard me I opened my eyes and there was a complete black cat I've never seen before just staring at me I feel so blessed and excited for things to beOk so the other day I first learned about wicca and wiccans and after researching a lot I feel asleep and I had a dream about doing a test about who has magic?? and someone who i don't know apparently has earth magic or something about earth elements???? I'm very confused and idk if it means anythingI mediated twice before bed to try and seek my deity which I got a brunette goddness but not a lot of info anyways after that Ive tried to sleep and I feel super dizzy and keeps getting that falling sensation everytime I drift off which I wouldn‚Äôt mention but it has happened three times which is weird rather than onceHey yall! I'm about to move into a home on a military base, and am wondering what tips yall have to keep negative energy at bay, as many of these homes have reports of ghosts in/around the property. I used to practice, but have since fallen out, so all my books etc are missing. Thanks!Can you do one without the other, and still be considered Wiccan?Hello! So I am looking into witchcraft and have run into it being heavily intertwined (not always, but a lot of the time)  now with wicca. I figured I'd read into wicca to see the overlap/ if I find it appealing. Anyway I went to a local store and picked up a few books. One of the man's recomendations was The Meaning of Witchcraft by Gerald Gardner and  I've been struggling to get through it because I hate Gardner's tone in writing. Do you have any suggestions for wiccan/ pagan books, or do I just struggle through Gardner because ( for lack of a better term) he is the guy who "founded" wicca ?Hello everyone, 
I have very recently gotten into witchcraft and become more or less ‚Äúawakened‚Äù to the spirit world. I have realized that in the past year or so I have seen many signs and had spiritual experiences pertaining to a particular relationship. These signs are still appearing and I am very confused by them, and I am frustrated that I‚Äôm not getting a solid answer or guidance from the universe. I thought I would explain what has happened and maybe some of you who are familiar with these sorts of things could help me get on the right path to figure out what is going on. 

The relationship I‚Äôm speaking of is my first love. I met him about two years ago and fell in love with him, but things have never really worked out between us. We went out on a date when we first met, but he decided that it wasn‚Äôt the right time for him to be in a relationship and I wasn‚Äôt the one he wanted to be with. He was a mutual friend so I saw him at parties and things, and my feelings for him deepened despite the situation. I ended up confessing to him by sending him a song I wrote for him. I never planned on sharing this song with him, but people reacted so strongly to it, to the point where people cried, and so I felt I needed him to hear it. He was very civil about it, but we lost touch shortly after.

I tried to get on with my life and move on, but my feelings only grew stronger. The first sign appeared after a year of no contact with him. I had bought a rose quartz pendant at a festival a few months before and it had become a very personal object to me. One night I dropped it and it broke in half. I was distressed by this and what it could mean, so I brought it to a metaphysical store to ask the cashier. The cashier was a psychic, and she looked at me and the pendant and told me that I was in love. She went into depth about me and my relationship with my first love, which I was quite taken aback by. She told me the universe brought us apart for a reason, because we both needed to grow, and if it was meant to be someday we will find each other again. The pendant breaking however, didn‚Äôt mean anything. As I was leaving the store she told me to remember that ‚ÄúI was the only one I needed to be in love.‚Äù 

Later that month I decided I needed closure from this relationship so I could finally move on. I sent him a text asking if we could meet for coffee, which he was very open to, and I ended up meeting him later that day. Meeting with him I was very surprised by how strong our connection was. I talked to him about my feelings for him as openly and casually as if we were talking about the weather. This was when another sign arose. A few months before, I was on the bus when I got a strange feeling that he was thinking of me. I had a vision that he was in the place where we went on a date and listening to the song I wrote for him. I brushed it off as a stupid fantasy. But that day, he told me he had done exactly that. My vision came true. On that same day I took him to my favorite cathedral. I am not religious, but this place is very spiritual to me. I go there occasionally and light prayer candles for my loved ones and meditate. The look on his face when we walked through the doors spoke a thousand words. That was when I realized that there was no way that falling in love with this person could be a coincidence. 

We stayed friends after our meeting and developed a deep, awkward bond. I was open about my feelings for him but they couldn‚Äôt be returned as he had a girlfriend. Still, we had a very sweet relationship. I trusted him fully and told him things I never told anyone else. We wrote each other letters. We both felt a sense of safety and comfort around each other that could not be explained through words. It was the first time I ever felt seen by someone else. He cared about me a lot and was always so compassionate and patient with me despite our complicated situation. But our relationship was also eating me alive and I was heartbroken that I could not be with him the way I wanted. We seemed so right for each other but the relationship could not bloom. Eventually we broke things off. We‚Äôre on good terms still, and he says he‚Äôd like to grab coffee with me every now and then. It‚Äôs been 8 months since I‚Äôve last seen him and I finally feel like I have my life back, but the signs keep appearing.

Starting at the beginning of this month, I started to see his favorite artist everywhere. In Instagram posts. I‚Äôd be watching a movie and a character would mention this artist. My friends became obsessed with his work. I thought it was just a coincidence at first, because the artist died recently, or maybe I never noticed the reference. But then a song I had never heard before randomly started playing out of my phone. It was the artist. On a playlist I never clicked on, three songs in. I was so freaked out that I looked up at the sky and asked the universe what the hell was going on. I haven‚Äôt gotten an answer yet. But my first love appears in dreams, I‚Äôm still seeing references to this artist. It seems as soon as I forget he exists a sign pointing to him pops up again. I feel a deep, spiritual connection either way, and I am constantly aware of his presence, more so at times than others. I want to move on, but the universe won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôm starting to question whether he is a soulmate or a twin flame or someone I met in a past life. I‚Äôm begging the universe for some sort of answer so I know what to do, but I‚Äôm not getting anything. 

I‚Äôm sorry for such a long, obscure post. As you can see this is really nagging on me, and I thought it wouldn‚Äôt do any harm to reach out and see what others think. Thank you so much for reading this and taking it into consideration!my friend woke up with what looked like a number 7 with a line in the middle scratched on his forehead horizontally, does anyone know if that means anything??

I have always Been attracted to wild life and plants and the likes and things like that also seem to have an attraction to me as well. Sort of obnoxiously so why do you think this is.

P.s. if this isn‚Äôt the right place for this could you point me somewhere better for me thank you.A few years ago, I spent the night at my friends house, When I went to bed, nothing was out of the normal. When I woke up, my pajama pants were torn to shreds, and my shoes, which were right beside me the entire night, looked as though they had bleach poured on them.   I had a restless sleep, so I know if anyone one in the house with me had done it, I would have woken up to the noises and feelings. Does anyone know what type of being could have done this? I feel as though it‚Äôs important to the path I‚Äôm supposed to go down, as the memory of it keeps popping into my head. Thank you to anyone who reads this.hi i am so new to this but i have always been spiritual and have felt closely connected with the universe. I know it sounds weird but I always talk about how the universe gives what you put in it even before putting a label on my spirituality. 

anywaysss I used to dream all the time and have these crazy intense dreams and about 2 years i‚Äôve stopped dreaming. i‚Äôve had a couple dreams but only a fraction of what they used to be.  I miss my dreams and trying to decipher them. anybody know what may be causing this??

my mother is the same way about her dreams almost prophetic but she is still dreaming away and i‚Äôm not.  so frustrating.So I‚Äôm new to this whole Wicca/witch thing I‚Äôm still unsure on some things but my journey is well on its way. I bought two crystal necklaces the other week ones a tigers eye and from what I‚Äôve seen they are supposed to give you good luck etc however ever since I‚Äôve worn it cause the charm is beautiful it‚Äôs given me nothing but bad luck I‚Äôve worn it two days with a day apart from them to test it out and the days I‚Äôve worn the necklace bad shit has happened like today I lost a really important part of my college kit and I have no clue what to do. I cleansed the crystal from previous energy but could it be hexed or somthing? Any ideas on how to get rid of this bad fortune it‚Äôs to pretty to chuck away x thanksHas anyone gotten scaired of their powers or felt at odds with their magic to the point of wanting to seal them?I just joined this community, and I have many questions.. I‚Äôve been dealing with entities and I believe one was a deity named ‚ÄúNova‚Äù/‚ÄúAivion‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know how to go about it, he‚Äôs been showing me loops for almost a year now.. When I finally broke free from a loop a couple months ago time had stopped for me and I was spoken to in a very anonymous voice telling me to not ‚Äúfight against the grain‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if it was him or not, but I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I have a friend in wicca and he claimed I was a demi-god or something like that.. But I‚Äôve never practiced wicca or even thought about it until unexplainable events started happening. If anyone can give me anything it‚Äôd be greatly appreciated.. thank you.Hello, are there any good ways I can protect myself besides sage? 

Candles- herbs-crystals? 

Also, what‚Äôs anyone take on scrying mirrors?I've been interested in magick/the occult from a very young age. I've dabbled in  "witchy" things for a long time, learning a lot about crystals and stones, plants, dreams, spirits, energy and chakras, auras, law of attraction, aromatherapy, essential oils, meditation, etc. I like to study nature and astronomy and I've always felt there was more than meets the eye to the world, ya know?

Recently I've begun to research more about witchcraft and paganism/Wicca. I feel like, in a sense, I'm finally being called home. I'm ready to learn more and find my path and place in this lifestyle, and find out whether or not it's right for me. 

 But with how interested and drawn to it I am... I was raised a skeptic. All I've ever believed in is science, and concrete proof. Where is the line between superstition, and magick? How do you know what's real and what's made up by edgy fanatics? How does one find proof and reassurance in the mystical when all your life you've been told it's nonsense? What's magick, and what's coincidence? Correlation isn't necessarily causation. I feel like I'm holding myself back from something greater, always looking for a logical, mundane explanation. I want to believe and go farther on this journey... but without any experience I don't know how to. I feel like I've hit a wall, on the outside looking in.

Is there a spell or something, ANYTHING, I could do that would help me feel... Idk, less crazy? I really struggle to get behind the "belief and intent are ALL you need" thought process. What happened for you that made you really commit to Wicca?Hi! I'm Lizzy, I'm 20 years old and I've been practicing solitary for about 3 years now, but I'm interesting in joining other practitioners and learning about coven work! Is there anyone in the New York area who is willing to let me join their group? Let me know, and thanks for reading!Hello all who read this, I am new to being a Wicca and if I am honest the only thing I can do is use tarot cards, I would like to be able to find a practitioner who is willing to teach me more about being a Wicca and what would be good for a beginner to start with. If interested please msg me on here, Thank you for reading.I'm fairly new to both the craft and AA. I am on my third step of AA where I have to turn my will over to the care of God as I understand god. Has anyone gone through the steps while practicing the craft that can help me firgure out how to do this?Hi guys. Hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as nuts. I‚Äôm having problems with one of my key crystals, it‚Äôs cracked in a couple places without having ever moved or fallen. I really want to take care of it, but not sure if it‚Äôs an energy issue, or a physical one (ie bad energy vs keeping it in dry corner in the sun). I know some stones need to be kept oiled but this is an agate slice, should be fine right? I‚Äôm also nervous to cleanse it with ocean water in case that causes the cracking to increase. Any and all advice appreciated, and thanks for your timeClinical depression. I may.. seem.. nuts but. I never had a religion and this belief system is the closest I've felt to some sort of a belief system. I've always been different. I can feel others energy and thoughts and it eats me alive. Every. Single. Day. Not to mention my own demons haunting me in the daylight everyday as well. Google's search called me clairsentient.  I'm hunting for answers that i cant find on a googles search or through any therapy. Im hunting for a real response. Im hunting for strength and a.. just.. a push in the right direction. For myself.. not.. in a other worldly kind of thing. For my well being because I don't think i have much more left in me.

Not going into detail. I lost myself a long time ago and I feel I'm at a standstill of giving up and dying or fighting until I pass out and cant do it amymore. I'd like to find myself again somewhere and.. just wish for all who read this. Who has felt the same one way or day or another to send me the most undiluted purest energy you can. I won't abuse it or misuse it. I.. just.. would like a good spell to keep me calm. A recommended crystal or carry or.. or just some good tea and a good word. Please. I'm close to losing everything my heart and soul ever cared about. I have no blood family on my side. No friends. All I have is.. barely me.  I don't want to lose myself becasue it's all I got left even if it's just a shredI rented a few books about wicca years ago and if I was to chose a religion or something to follow I am certain this is the path I would take and I want to take. I'm very confused and don't know where to start. I feel a bit overwhelmed because I don't know where to start. Most of the time when I feel overwhelmed I quit something or I don't put my full energy into it, even though it's something I would love to do or be a part of. If anyone knows where to start or have any suggestions for me, I would love to hear what anyone has to say.I am very new to Wicca and magic in any shape or form. I recently got my energy cleansed and healed and the woman performing the cleanse told me I had dragon energy. I was wondering if anyone could tell me what that means? I've looked online and mostly found memes about Kanye west and Donald trump....not exactly encouraging. :/ Thank you!!!!Hello I‚Äôve never really posted anything on here but something came up and I was wondering if I could get some advice. So about a year ago my friend got a camera from a sale that kinda looks like it‚Äôs from the 60‚Äôs. After she got it though weird things have been happening and we have been suspecting something is in the camera. Some experiences with it are hearing voices outside plus knocking, footsteps in the backyard leading to her bedroom window and just stopping, dogs getting let out of the cages that are hard to close and open, things turning on randomly, and stuff disappearing but then coming back after a few days. It all happens in the nighttime as well. A personal experience is when I picked up the camera and looked through it I started shaking and thinking something was randomly gonna pop up and another of my friends when she did it started like rushing to leave the house and talking so fast. The one who owns it though doesn‚Äôt feel anything bad with the camera and is kinda acting like Gollum. We took it outside tonight to see if something will happen but we would like some advice if there‚Äôs something we can do to deal with it thank you.So I had heard/learned that shamans are seers that can absorb magic to use it. Well I'm a seer who can do that. Is this true? If so any others who can help educate me on this?I have been praying and doing Tarot division to find out if I should leave my boyfriend. I had his T-shirt downstairs in the kitchen where its been sitting for a couple weeks. then the other night I was up in my bedroom working on a paper and I decided I was going to go to bed. when I went over to my bed his shirt was sitting by my pillow. I know I didn't take it upstairs. Because I hadn't been downstairs except for once to get food today. So I'm wondering if there's a spirit or deity trying to communicate with me about him?I have a question, is it weird if everytime a specific friend gets touched by you or touched you they automatically have a reaction? Reactions being uncontrolled arm/hand movement like a twitch or hand/arm numbness etc. I'm asking cause I have a friend who whenever I touch them or they touch me they twitch or feel weird in anyway in that area that's touched by my bare hands or feet I find it so weird that I wanted to ask.I started practicing again after a few years. Blessed be!

iG: thewitcheshavenI always wondered if theres other ways to cleanse a place or space. I know that if you need to cleanse a area you use sage or other smudging herbs. My question is could it be possible to cleanse a place or space with your own energy? Is it possible and how would it be done? and if not oh well it was only a thought.I would like some medition tips how to use intution and spirtual experiences to learn more about Wicca thank youI've had a rough couple of weeks and I'm feeling very drained/Not myself lately. I really want things to get back on track and would love if you could suggest something that usually helps you recharge/cleanse. I usually do my own thing but when I'm doing something new I always try to get some suggestions from anyone more experienced. Hello friends! I am here today looking for some basic beginner information to bring myself into Wicca. Something like some books to pick up or references to other sources. Also if anyone is close to Danville Va and wants to meet up, that would be cool. Thank you much! I‚Äôve been using tarot cards successfully for about 7 years now, but would like to learn more about other divination methods, particularly runes. If anyone has any suggestions for good books on divination or would like to tell their personal experiences with different methods, sharing would be greatly appreciated!Hello, I'm new to wicca but I've been trying to practice divination and Idk what is safer for a beginner if tarot cards or rune stones also I couldn't really find much information about comparation between the two or pros and cons for each one This question makes more sense if i explain it. I‚Äôm still new in the Wiccan faith, and i just moved to a new apartment. Im setting up a permanent altar and i like the idea of putting physical representations of the elements on it. I will be using feathers for air, some leftover wax to make a new candle for fire, and water for, well, water! Id like to use some dirt/earth for the earth element, and i got to thinking about what properties sand, gravel, soil, etc would hold. As i type this post, i am also getting to wonder about seawater, river water, tap water, etc. i know that taking these things from a source that is important to me would be a good idea, but i am very curious. Google only wants to show me revenge rites with graveyard dirt???? (No thanks lol)

Thanks to anyone for their time!Hello all! As you might gleen from my title, I have a stutter, and I'm looking for more information on spells. I have a decent stutter, it isn't dehabilitating or too pervasive, but does affect my speech quite a bit. I have been interested in Wicca for a very long time and reading tarot, but am only recently getting into spells and more divination techniques. My concern is that my stutter will affect my spells. Has anyone had any experience or any ideas on this? Anything helps, thank you! Hello Im Jammer
I have never been here before im glad I have found this though. Im a grown man of 46 and I am learning about myself late, I was a verry loving empathetic creature loving child. I got lost in a divorce by parents who were both victims of there own upbringing. I have been both bad and good light and dark throughout my life, always more to the good and light. Shit happened to me that should never happen to any child and like it or not I have been afected by this among other things that let me see the evil and dark side of people myself included. I have been healing myself by self discovery, I believe im on the right path and have been guided here by some benevolent higher power. I was raised Christian but no longer believe it is the truth and so for the past 22 years I have been on this journey not realy knowing i was on a journey. I was a binge alcoholic from an early age ( pree teen) I stopped drinking 9 years ago only cause I was sick inside and felt terrible about blacking out and doing stupid shit I had to apologize for the next day. It was a revelation being sober, it was hard to do but after awhile I had a chance to actually see how life was so much better without alcohol. From that time I have been mostly at peace but still unsure about my spirtuallity. I no longer believe Jesus was the son of God, I have always thought organized religion was faulty and I believe now it is all lies and brought to life by people wanting to controll lots of other people easily. Jesus, Vishnu, Horus all born of a virgin
all claimed to be the son of God, it turns out it depends on what time you were born as to wich story you were taught to believe. I am looking for light I am looking for love and am growing empathy and understanding, I am not lost anymore but im looking for home. I live in Oregon and if you read this and think you can help me I would like to learn about wiccan and meet with someone who can be a teacher and or mentor to me. 
Thanks 
JammerI‚Äôm a practicing witch but I‚Äôm new at this. I‚Äôd like to expand my knowledge, so if you recommend any books please write them down. I also want to know where and how to find other white witches. Thank you! Wicca has always been a method of worship/religion that has always fascinated and interested me. But coming from a mostly Christian family, and only finding research that seems to only say ‚ÄúWicca is bad‚Äù; I haven‚Äôt had much luck learning about ALL aspects of Wicca. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to convert, but I would love to know more about this seemingly misunderstood religion. 

Are there any recommendations for books, websites or any other resources that I could use to learn the most that I can about Wicca? This is a free verse poem I am writing.
You can never spread to much knowledge nor shall a scholar be out of line unless it reaches a time where only hate and disgrace is born from the works they spent of there lives on. Whether or not knowledge survives the ever turning sands of time is up to us. All humankind needs to fight to end this terrible blight of knowledge slipping away falling into the void never to be seen again. The Gods will always be on our side and giving us the power of remember all that has fallen. It is neither society nor humanities fault knowledge is not preserved rather it is the individual who fills their head will garbage. If you listen closely you can almost hear the Gods Tears falling to Mother Earth showering her in sadness. If you listen even closer you can hear a voice that pleads and screams in pain and sadness and misery. The individual who seeks  to help and support the voice will finish off in an enlightened place. When you reach an enlightened place whether it be the Grove of Nyx or the Garden of Gia. Ask her for me ,With all the knowledge that dies on a daily basis is it a wonder the Gods are crying, Mother Earth is dying, and Humanity is declining. So I am starting a new video series on my channel and I hope you guys will give it a watch. The topic is Pentacles vs Pentagrams and yes I know it sucks. I will try to make better quality videos as I make more of them.
https://youtu.be/DasHcwFRl4kI just had the conversation with my girlfriend about a spiritual/magical connection. She wanted to know if spells such as protection spells work better when the connection is opened by here consciously. I told her it was possible but I was unsure because I've never had such a connection before. 
Was I correct or was I mistaken?Do u have a familiar animal & how did u know they were?
Do u know ur totem animal that represents ur soul & how did u find out?
I have a familiar & I know my totem animal, but would love to hear about other's stories ")Hey, so I know there is alot of secrecy with witch's, which makes it incredibly difficult for someone like me to learn. 
So how can I find resources that aren't just like basically fake Wiccan books? I've purchased a few different books and they all are like completely opposite of what I need!! 
Like I dont want to collect blood from a pig to put a curse on someone... thats a little much for me!!
And I dont know anyone already well versed in this to guide me, and it's near impossible to find anyone. 

I just feel very isolated in my beliefs right now. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!!
I live in Toronto btw, are there any stores or groups you would suggest looking into?she will not talk to me and the like spiritual space that i have always envisioned her in is fading to black every time i try to visit what should i do?Have any of these rituals obviously or discreetly worked? 
Are certain spells trapped or connected to certain deities?
What‚Äôs up with the whole magic thing in general.
And finally do you really believe?Why would someone that practices wicca keep someones clothing?Good evening. I have decided to take a walk with Paganism for a year. For many years I have maintained that I am a spiritual person, not a religious one. But now I am looking for a bit more solidarity than that mantra. 

I dabbled in Wicca when I was in my early 20s. I didn‚Äôt reject it, I just didn‚Äôt embrace it either. That was 20 years ago. I am a male. I was a Boy Scout and remain very outdoor oriented. Wicca may be a good fit for me, but so would the Path of the Jedi. Maybe even a bit of Heathen or Druid.

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going, or where I should go.

In the past I have physically been assaulted by demons. My parents had what you could call an exorcism performed on my room. It worked, but I couldn‚Äôt stay with the church. Ironically, I still love Christ as a philosopher, but don‚Äôt care for most churches or know it all Christians.

I know I‚Äôm in a complicated place. Any advice is appreciated.Hi.  I just found out that my wife of 12 years has spent the last 7 feinting our relationship.  Her exact words to me "I am not in love with you anymore, and I stay because you asked me to".   


How do you deal with 7 years of loss?  7 years of trying?  Chopping yourself up into tiny bits to serve on the alter of love to a beast who doesn't care?  


if anyone knows of any ritual, or spell, or practice that could help mend this emptiness I feel.   I would greatly appreciate it.UPDATE: Doubt anyone is going to see this post anymore. Just wanted to leave a little note saying that we met up (twice already in fact) and I'm pleased to report that i didn't end up as a blood sacrifice to fertilize the lands! Thank you for the great advice and my apologies for not responding sooner/directly.  


I'll be meeting up with someone this Sunday, we've been talking for a while and I'm fairly convinced she's at least somewhat versed in witchcraft, however of a completely different nature to my own! We all know that each culture holds their own secrets but i've always been a staunch believer that if something can't be said in a common tongue, it's not a universally applicable spell.

&#x200B;

Recently though, our perspectives has begun to shift. She occasionally "slips" into German, seemingly unable to help herself... but it almost always has some kind of emotional/spiritual effect on me. Part of me is optimistic in that perhaps it's a shared cultural bond, but Side of me suspects her of trying to curse/enchant me in her native tongue. Some context: she's from Germany and I'm from the Netherlands so our languages aren't that far removed, at this point We have almost exactly one week to prepare ourselves for the encounter. What can be done to specifically identify and if needed counteract her Germanic influences?? And perhaps more importantly what aspects would be worthwhile for me to pay attention to in our interactions?

i'd be happy to provide more information down in the comments if needed, thanks in advance for reading my post!I had done a freeze jar on someone that has worked wonderfully up until recently and they are back with a vengeance. The jar is still intact and Not disturbed in my freezer, do I unthaw and refreeze or start over? Best way to refresh the spell.I hope someone can give me some insight on this memory I have of when I was three.

I remember this vividly. I was in bed and across the side on the wall I had a dresser with a large mirror. I remember seeing a face and a man trying to get me to come over to the mirror. I was afraid and stayed quiet. The man got angrier and more aggressive and started to yell. Then he disappeared. After that I remember my foot shaking and I felt something going through me but once it hit my stomach all of a sudden i felt a force, it was expelled and I threw up all over myself. 

I talked to a girl at a store that specializes in spirituality and stones. I have an image of a women that pops in my head all the time and when growing up. She said it‚Äôs Freya.

I‚Äôm new to all this and I‚Äôm trying to learn but also confused about that memory. She said there were a lot of presences around me. I often when doing tarot (I‚Äôm still learning) I get exhausted quickly and the answers seem chaotic and inconsistent.

I at least consciously have never called a spirit or deity, in fact I just learned about them. 

Can they chose people? If so, is there a way to see who is around me? I want to learn more about Wiccan but I‚Äôm pretty lost at the moment.I'm new to any sort of magick and I did my first "spell" [candle magick] the other day. Thankfully the universe seems to have acknowledged  my wishes and I'm getting small results in turn :) - The issue is I don't know much about candle magick in general... like how to discard the candle/what to do when the candle goes out - can I put out the flame, if so how or when? ,, any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated :)I am brand new, fresh out the oven to all of this. I am timid but intrigued and want to learn more. 

I strongly believe in symbolism in every day life but do not know how to interpret anything in the Wicca way. 

Last week I finally acted on my interest in Wicca and asked my hair stylist about smudging. She showed me how and did a cleansing with selenite all right there at the salon. I loved it and she gave me one of her palo santos. I‚Äôve used it in my home and want to try more so I just went to a local store that specializes in crystals and things like that. 

On my way in to the store there was this sign posted on the building that says ‚Äúif you are looking for a sign, this is it‚Äù.  I thought it was cute!  I found some crystals that spoke to me and got some selenite and a lavender smudge stick.  At checkout the lights inexplicably started flickering, at first right above me then throughout the store. Myself nor the employees could figure out what was up.  Then as I left a dragonfly almost flew right at me and ended up flying directly in front of me to the parking lot near my car. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel that this means something important. Something I need to be paying attention to but WHAT???the new moon will be in leo, but what are good rituals or practices that you do on the new moon?Hello,

I've heard of poppets being made out of fabric or clay, but would it be possible to make a paper doll poppet? Usually you'd put herbs, essential oils or a name/birth date in the poppet. How do you think a paper poppet would work, if possible?

Thank you for reading,

- Eleanor.I've always been drawn to the occult and magic, I follow no certain beliefs or path but I want to get into wicca. The problem is that there are so many books and sources by so many different people its hard to know where to look for the best materials! Any advice on what authors are the best or most knowledgable? Thank you!I think most of the time it's not possible to get the answers from other people, there is a point that vision, dreams etc comes to you personally.
You have to solve your puzzle yourself, it's a very personal puzzle, other people can't tell really tell you the meaning if they don't know you in every aspect like you know yourself. 

And i say most of time because I don't know if certain symbolic really have an universal set meaning(who decided on the meaning and how can you know it's really that?) , tell me if I'm wrong.Hey guys, is it a sign from universe or what but these numbers are all around me from past one month; it is to that extent that I went completely insane with that. 
Can anyone tell me the significance of these three numbers?I am doing research for a story I am wanting to write. I am primarily looking for information on history, popular or famous figures and/or  leaders. I mostly  need background information not necessarily application (that is how to perform). I am hoping to find a book that will give a good enough foundation to educate myself, but I am open to various media. I mostly need enough information on Wicca to create a good character with a Wiccan background.I am not rlly sure on what types there are. I‚Äôve heard some you wear like to sleep and all day basically and I want to know more for the type of bottles ,how to make them , and also which I wear and which are stay at homeIdeally with more than one person involved in the spell, but any general one will be helpful too! TIA <3I had a dream last night and during that dream I drove my car to a random house parked it. Got out of it and walked over to what seemed to be a park with like a baseball field and a really big open field no true fencing except for a short fencing on the outside then I walked into the woods where there was this path and I continued to walk for awhile but my dream skipped some of the walk. I passed some open fields with high tall grass looked like weedy grass if anything that was blocking from the actual field itself like a fence then on my left side there was an abandoned house once I reached the abandoned and broke down house I turned back around and I walked straight but when I walked straight I made my way to a fire cuz it was pitched black outside once I started fully walking but I started a fire in the blackness of the forest and I fell asleep not wanting too but out of being exhausted and then I woke up the next day still in front of a fire but it was daylight time the fire was strong still I got up and then I ran out of the forest knowing how to get back through the field but the field was gone and it was just a road now and I saw the house I parked my car at because I was using my keys to find it once I finally got to the house there was a family coming out to start their days. I apologize to the family it was a big family probably about four people that owned multiple cars outside they had like an SUV a van they had not mistaken possibly a truck and it looks like it was blocking my car but they somehow moved my car out of the spot I parked it in I apologized a bunch of time saying it was just another crazy crazy night made up a story about things I did and then they nodded their head said it all right and why did choose to park there? Why did you use our parking spot? I said I honestly don't know why I told him a friend brought me there and I wasn't the one driving so I couldn't get blamed cuz he was supposed to bring me home for some reason I wanted him to park there so I then got on my car and then I woke up.


The dream was super vivid and I could draw a full map of the locations. I can draw some of the abandoned house. I can even draw the streets and how they were set up along with the entire outside (front side) of the house. It was all in color.

Anyone know what this means?I just started my spiritual journey and I'm really excited but coming to find there is a shit ton of info on the subject it's hard to know where to start!!! I'm looking for beginners tools, books, anything to help me get started and make learning a little easier!! Thanks in advance!!
I had a dream of going into a bookstore and saw many books. I walked to a corner of the room and found a brown book with cover of pentacle on it saying witchcraft and another book a kitchen witchcraft book. There where lots of the books but the one that stuck out to me was brown old book. Its weird cause I've thought I've might have left the path of this sorta thing buts it's been on my mind
I cant find any answers looking it up and its puzzling me figuring out what it means. 
Please help and thank youI apologize for my lack of knowledge but can males be a witch? If so where would I start?Hey everyone! I am a beginner and I love scented candles, I have many of them tbh (because of the time before I knew wicca) but I cant find anything about having scented candles in practicing wicca things, just the colour. Does it matter if they are scented? If yes, do they have different meaning like the colours? Or should I avoid scented ones?I'm kind of new to this and I have read books about wicca but I'm still kind of confused and want to know more and I was thinking joining a coven does anyone know any near the south jersey areaHey guys, gals and nonbinary pals I'm doing paid readings! Message me for more information current decks of tarot cards I have is the fairy deck and the angel deck from Radleigh valentineHello I‚Äôm Elle and i‚Äôm 17 and i‚Äôm new to Wicca and I‚Äôm also closeted because my family don‚Äôt approve of Wicca or anything to do with it and I need help with building up my knowledge so if you have any links to good places to learn I will be forever grateful thank you.Hey guys! I‚Äôm new here and I‚Äôm not sure if this is the place to post this but yesterday i went shopping for some goods at my local spiritual shop and my total came to $26.66 and the time on my receipt was 2:06. I‚Äôm not sure if this means anythinf or if the 666 in my price is something but any thoughts are welcomed!I‚Äôve heard that it doesn‚Äôt matter what you use in a spell as long as you make your intentions clear and known. is that true???Do people HAVE to have a Right of Passage(Context for some of the terminology: I‚Äôm a Draconic Wiccan)This was months ago, but, I had gone out into the woods wearing a cow tooth on a necklace chain and lost it in the ferns. I tried to find it but I could not and I gave up on it, for a week or two. Then, I decided to go back into the woods to talk with my mont√©, since it‚Äôs easier for my to focus on their energy when I‚Äôm in that place, and it was bothering me that I still hadn‚Äôt found it. So I tried something I had never thought about before and I stood up and held my hands out, asking Mont√© to assist my magick with their own to locate the object. I slowly rotated toward the pull of a hot buzzing sensation in my palms (my energy usually feels like that now), and I walked toward the ferns, and then spread the leaves apart and THERE IT WAS! The tooth was exactly where I had been lead to! This experience was so important to me because it taught me that my mont√© really is here to help me and I should trust my intuition and abilities to assist me in my craft. I was almost crying while thanking them for showing me that, and now I have the tooth on my altar. Then, last week, I was talking with my mont√© about familiars. I believe one of mine is an opossum, either one that I have yet to meet or a specific one that I have met (you‚Äôll see). I had also been asking Mont√© to help me find animal bones in the woods. Two days after asking for that assistance and after talking about familiars, my girlfriend and I found an opossum skeleton on the edge of the woods near her house. I was so excited and again I thanked my mont√© and (after asking) I took some of the bones which called to me and cleaned them, and they‚Äôre now also on my altar. The top half of the skull is the piece I keep out all the time. This goes a little further, as I was again talking about familiars, casting a verbal spell asking the dragon deities to bestow a familiar connection with an animal to me, a few days later I was also talking about and contacting spirits, and suddenly I was able to feel a presence with the bones of the opossum. And it leads me to think that the spirit of the opossum might be a familiar. I felt so connected and warmed. I might go back to the skeleton to gather the rest of the bones because I have been using them for my tools. Last night I handmade a wand from scratch and used one of the opossum humorous bones as the handle.I lit a white candle just to ask questions (not trying to cast a spell) The flame started off still until I asked about the guy im talking to... It now looks like a heart and its dancing. Also the wick looks like someone giving birth. Any feedback?hey everyone! im a baby witch but im looking for any helpful advice on lucid dreaming! any herbs, crystals, spells or genuine advice that would help me take control on these dreams! i feel as though my dreams are extremely powerful and are an outsource for my but im struggling to get full control on them.I am at the point in my Wicca journey where I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. I read Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham and loved it, but I would love to know what other books you would recommend for baby witches? 

I am mostly looking for general Wicca books, encyclopedia/reference books for crystal healing and herb magick, and maybe a good beginner book for pendulum magick -- but anything that helped you as a beginner or that you wish you had read sooner is a welcome resource! 

Thank you kindly, and blessed be! )O(hi, im a baby witch and im still discovering my path and it has been very overwhelming. I've been practicing meditation and tarot reading and a little bit of herb work. Since I have just started I've been looking for advice and tips. If there are any books or websites or subreddits anyone would recommend I would really appreciate it!I felt the pull towards Wicca as a child and have always studied and sometimes practiced since.  One thing that I have always wondered but never really came across a direct answer for was in symbolism. Is it acceptable to use a symbol (like a tribal pendant) that you don't know the original meaning for as something else. I guess is it possible to give it your own meaning? Or would it's original meaning over power my personal one? Anchor: https://anchor.fm/fisher-morris-mcewan8So I was in my science class today and we were doing a prac that required us to roll a die to decide on variables (it was the colour of lizards for a biology study on natural selection, each side of the die represented a different breeding pair. We were using a 6 sided die to keep the results free of bias) and I started rolling it and it was normal, then it kept landing on the number two. All in a row. After about three in a row I began to get suspicious, and made sure to really shake it. I watched again as it rolled another two. And again. And again. I even changed to rolling it on a different table. Still two. It eventually stopped, but I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it happened AT LEAST twelve times in a row. The colour combo that the number two gave me the colour combo yellowxyellow for the task, which yellow is the colour that eventually becomes dominant through natural selection etc. I‚Äôm not sure if that is important but I thought I‚Äôd mention it anyway. Does anyone have any idea what this might mean??? I have no doubt this means something. But what?Hello y‚Äôall I just recently got into meditation and I felt a presence my first time meditating. The second time, I asked for a sign that anyone was actually hearing me and I opened my eyes. Right in front of me, there was a lizard on the wall. I‚Äôve never seen one in this room before. Fast forward a couple days, I‚Äôm again internally doubting my meditation as I hadn‚Äôt felt much spiritually the previous day, and boom, another lizard right where my charger is. Who is trying to speak to me? I‚Äôve tried to look it up but I‚Äôve got nothing so far about lizards.I really want to celebrate the Wiccan holidays this year now that I‚Äôm in my own home with a supportive partner, where did you find the best help in celebrating the holidays? Or what‚Äôs your favorite thing to do for the holidays? I‚Äôm all ears!My entire life I have had experiences with paranormal entities. I used to be able to control the movement of very light objects as a kid such as spinning a paper cup balanced on a pin. I can feel the energy leaking off people and object and can often immediatly recognized objects with demonic/spiritual possession. I can sometimes see others imaginationor thought and pick up on many "vibes". I can see many people's aura and can feel the energy of life and the world. 

I have always been drawn to witchcraft, paganism, and all things magick but have never met someone who I truly believe to have the true ability to manipulate our reality who was willing to teach me. In fact im not sure I have met anyone who is truly capeable of real magick at all. 

I am looking to gain more control over these connections to the energies of the world. Manipulating them in a way to bring positive benefits to my life and the lives of those I love is my goal.

If you or someone you know is actually capeable of strong magick or know of a place where real knowledge on the subject of energy manipulation is taught I would greatly appreciate any tips or offers.

I live in Clearwater FL. Considering a trip to Cassadaga but don't want to waste my time with palm/card readers. I FEEL the energies, I know there is untapped power for me to manipulate, I just need guidance on how to effectively channel and use it without damaging myself and achieving successfull results.

I am over 50% scottish, 1/26th native american, the rest is a mix of French and Welsh.

Cordially,
RobHello! I‚Äôm feeling a really strong calling into this world I didn‚Äôt know about it but when I saw something about it a few months ago it keeps appearing in my life and I think is time for me to try it out, is there any books and stuff for beginners that you guys recommend?I would like to work with crystals and I would like to put some on my sun porch (also for aesthetic reasons). But I am not sure which ones would be the best for relaxation and growth. Also I dont know if certain crystals might start a fire since I do get a lot of sun.Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is allowed but I didn't see anything against it in the rules (if it isn't, please let me know so I can remove it). 

My friends and I have created a witchcraft related discord server called "Aligning Stars", in which people from all paths and backgrounds are welcome. 

The server itself has general and witchcraft related channels to talk and share your craft, but it is predominantly centred around alerts telling you about lunar events, "witchy awareness" (in which we tell you about important world events or things such as planetary retrogrades), monthly (optional) rituals based around a theme for the month, weekly topics, sabbat alerts, and when we enter a new zodiac season. 

It's a fairly small space right now, but we hope to grow and follow the suggestions of members to make the server a positive community. 

If anyone would like to join, the link is:

Thank you so much for reading this, and I hope you all have a lovely day! ‚ô•Ô∏èüòäSo in the last year I‚Äôve done more and more research into Wicca. At this point I consider myself to be a baby Wiccan. My best friend is pagan and told me I shouldn‚Äôt take books sold at places like earthbound seriously. My mom (trying to be so supportive) purchased a book for me from Attic salt. Practical Magic by Nikki Van De Car. 

Is... is it bad? Like I want to educate myself properly....Hello! I‚Äôm very new to Wicca but I‚Äôve always felt a deep draw to it. I‚Äôve had many times in my life where I felt like something was reaching out or trying to help/protect me. Things like a Deer showing up to me when I was younger, to a spirit (I think) over my bed when I was around 13. 

I recently just got out of a very abusive relationship and have been struggling. So I prayed to whoever would listen and cut the cord of a necklace my ex gave to me and asked for help. And placed the heart charm next to my candles. Asking for help reclaiming my heart and breaking the chains that held it down. I then burned a picture of my ex. 

Then the fire on my ex‚Äôs photos stopped burning, and my candle flames started burning really bright. I felt a wash of calm wash over me and felt like I had gotten a sudden burst of energy. 

I‚Äôve never done spells really, just prayed and asked for guidance every once in a while. I‚Äôm very clueless but is this a sign from someone? What‚Äôs going on? Any advice is appreciated, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èDo someone knows some great books about jar spells? I‚Äôve just started and I‚Äôm very interested in knowing more about themhello! i've been practicing witchcraft for about 6/7 months now (i'm wiccan btw) and i wanted to know if anyone had any advice for getting a deity to work with you. i've been really interested in working with an earth, moon, or nature goddess in particular and i've been researching but i don't know how to get a deity to present itself. anyone have any tips? thanks! Hi guys, i just discoverd wicca some days ago and did a little research. Even though i researched, there are some stuff that i wanted to ask :

1‚Ä¢ If i wanna join wicca, i have to praise a god or i can be an atheist for example?

2‚Ä¢ What are the most used words and terms in the comunity?

3‚Ä¢ Im a person that learns by topics, starting with the most basic and then going to the most difficult ones. Witch topic i can study first, since i just discoverd wicca?

4‚Ä¢ Most of my family members are some type of christian. My mom is a very open minded person, but i dont know how she and the rest of the family would react if i told them that i never really believed in gods and started witchcraft. How should i deal with this?

 Sorry if something is wrong, english is not my first lenguage. I would be really happy If you guys answered some of my questions (If you dont know how to answer some of them, its ok! Tell what you know). Any aswers will be very welcomed since im thinking about studying wicca and maybe joining as well. Thank you for your atention üíû.I've started learning more about Magick and Wiccan and I want to further my practice and make moon water. The day after the Pink Supermoon it was raining and I collected that rainwater. I want to bless the rainwater in the Flower moon with the intention of growth, but would it be a mistake since it's rainwater collected so close to the last supermoon? I don't want to scramble intentions or potency. I will be using the water as the main focus of my first alter, which will also have money anointed with the moonwater. I also want to use some to use for protection and possibly banishing because I plan to manifest an entity after I do some more research. Can i mix salt in the moon rainwater for more protection? 

TL;DR Can I rebless rainwater from the last supermoon with this supermoon, and can i mix with salt for extra protectionMoving into my first home in two weeks and I‚Äôm a little concerned about burning sage in the apartment, any rituals other than burning anyone has done when moving into a new place?water has called out to me my entire life, in every way possible. The ocean, lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, puddles, even droplets of water. The rain. Every time I feel a negative energy or get into a bad situation I immediately get in the shower or bath. 
I stand with my hands in the faucet at work for too long, let it take its time. 

I always dip my toes in. 

What does this mean? 
xoxoBasically the dream started off as some sort of video game, ironically. With a goddess searching for her brother and spreading light everywhere she searched, because the land was shrouded in darkness. And then me and a band of adventurers see her and follow her for a bit, until she stops by a cliffside near the sea, and tells us she's searching for her brother. Then we offer to help her. And then the scene jumps to us following her through a passage in a cliffside, and all of a sudden we see a modern science institute in the distance. At this point, the scene jumps to me being in a bus and squished in between an ex and one of my friends, and I'm sitting there playing something on my 3ds. Then we arrive at the science institute, I get off the bus. Then the scene jumps to me and the band of adventurers inside the institute. We all split up, trying to find the goddess because she got trapped by scientists so they could siphon her energy away. One guy(the stereotypical science/tech nerd) and I manage to find the control panel, and we sit there for a minute, disabling quite a few things with me keeping an eye out for any trouble, and then we find the control where we could release the goddess, and siphon her energy back into her. It needed a passcode, and all of a sudden I whip out my rose quartz pendulum and literally use my intuition to help guide us to the right numbers. And on the first try, I got it right. And then as I put it away and say "Always trust in your intuition", a huge but lanky guy shows up. My companion is not entirely sure what to do because he cant fight. And since I'm small as fuck, the guy basically calls me the baby of the group. And then I suddenly get dark and threatening, saying to him "Do you truely think I'm the baby? I'll show you what this baby can do" And then he proceeds to try and lunge at me, trying to catch me. But considering I'm small, I quickly ducked and dodged him. Then the scene jumped a bit to where I tried keeping up with him, and I slammed my side into a desk. After a moment of recovering, I grab ahold of a chair(like a desk chair at a school), and I proceed to leap onto him, shoving the legs of the chair onto his neck and practically squeezing his neck to death with my thighs, trying to hang on. He of course flails around, trying to throw me off and gain an advantage. But I hang on, and try snapping his neck with the chair. But that fails, and I start steering him towards an empty room that requires a passcode to unlock. I manage to get him into the room, and leap off of his neck, and shove him inside as hard as I could with the chair, knocking him over and quickly shutting the door and automatically it locks, and cant be unlocked from the inside. I then run back to my companion, panting a little bit and he then proceeds to glitch out and fry the entire computer system, rendering it useless. And then the goddess practically shakes the entire building with her booming voice, as my other companions free her from her bonds. And then unfortunately I woke up üòÇI typically don't remember many of my dreams. However when I do, I find they have important dream symbolism or I end up experiencing something similar in real life. Recently I decided to master lucid dreaming but I have had minimal results. Any tips?It started a few days ago. I haven‚Äôt had any experience with anything Wiccan before. My sister is Wiccan but I‚Äôve never really asked her about it. I can‚Äôt control what is happening and it‚Äôs too the point where I‚Äôm planting false memories. Can someone help me control it and learn about my gift?Hello! I‚Äôm knew to this world and I‚Äôm so ready to learn all I can. With everything that‚Äôs going on in the world right now I feel a need to try a protection spell for my good friends and have no idea where to begin. If anyone is willing to help me I would greatly appreciate it, I‚Äôll talk all of the help/knowledge I can get. Thank you in advance! Any list of supplies I would need would also be handy haha.Hi everyone! I've been practising witchcraft for a few years now and decided this year to follow the Wiccan path as the duality of the God and Goddess feels right and makes the most sense to me personally. However, during a meditation session to reach out to my deities when I asked who was with me, I very clearly received "Hecate". Could this be the triple goddess reaching out using a sort of pseudonym or was this Hecate herself reaching out to me?I'm not entirely new to wicca, but I'm also not old. I know a couple spells and do them on a daily basis. I am an eclectic solitaire who has too much free time and I'd love to learn any new spells. I am not yet sure what God/goddess I should follow. My mother has helped teach me a lot and she is a very powerful scryr. I have gotten down the basics of meditation and energy gathering. Any help or suggestions at all helps. Preferably books/sites to study, spell suggestions, and anything that will help enhance my spiritual self.Hello all! This may be an odd question and I‚Äôm a baby witch, but recently when I‚Äôve tried meditating all I see is darkness, am I not giving enough intention? Maybe I‚Äôm just a noobüòÖüòÖI need some advice. My girlfriend and I just finished a hike at blood mountain in Georgia.

We were about halfway up the mountain when she recognized an old spot where she took a picture of the moon. Right after that we hit the detour, the trail continued in front of us but we went to the right instead somehow we thought that the trail stopped and went right instead.

We went up some steep trails that looked like they hadn't been used in a long time there were leaves not stepped on or broken. We stopped to rest at a big rock and then continued up the mountain. We came to a glade of short trees that didnt really let you see the sky. 

We were so happy, the glade was beautiful and we both wanted to just sit down and enjoy it. We found what looked like a old fire place and I was angry about it. 

I saw what looked like a clear exit you could hear people near by and see the sky. My girlfriend wanted to go to the right were you could only see more trees and not much else I tired to tell her about the exit I saw but she said she heard people and I told I did too. She eventually followed me and we saw the other people and took pictures. We had food and walked back down the trail the right way. 

On the way down we started to feel really weird and questioned why we went that weird way. We both felt dizzy when we looked behind us. 

Then I though it might be fae. 

I played around with the thought of magik when I was a teen. I know a small amount about the fae, on the way down I told my girlfriend to not look back anymore and to stop touching the trees. 

She said thank you to no one, and that makes me really worried. Before she normally only say ty, the letters, but she said the whole phrase. Someone had put a stone in a mud puddle and she used it to get to the other side. We used it as a marker to see how far we had left to go. 

The pictures we took had time stamps that showed we didnt lose time but we both felt like we lost a decent amount of time. 

I don't really know what else to say I left cookies in our parking space before we left hoping to distract the fae from following us. 

If anyone could give some feedback or explain that would be awesome. We both still feel so different I dont know how to describe it.[Crossposting in several groups because one cannot have too many answers to this.]

Do you have any particular ceremonies/rituals for cleaning and purifying, either yourselves or spaces you live/work in?I'm not new to spells but I am new to making candles as a whole. I've been practicing for about 2 years now but I want to venture into making my own spell candles and I would just like some guidance! Such as what is the best type of wax to use (soy vs beeswax), what to use to color the candles (colored crayons vs candle specific dyes), how to scent the candles (essential oils vs any other method I can't think of right now), how to attach the candle to someone if the spell candle is for someone else, what tools I should invest into getting? Really just any tips, tricks, personal experiences would be great and helpful.

Thank you in advance!So I just started Wiccan. I did my first spell casting last night and forgot a step in it so I started over and did it again. Is that bad? And can I redo the same spell again tomorrow because I feel like I wasn‚Äôt concentrating enough and would like to redo it. Should I wash my crystal before redoing it?I'm very interested in crystals and their meanings and uses and I'm looking for some good books to get me started. I've already purchased "Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem, and Metal Magic". What are some other suggestions?So I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm reading too into this or not, however, ever since I was a kid I would ‚Äúplay‚Äù witches and was very spiritual from a young age (9/10ish) is there such a thing as being karmically blessed? Every wrong doing sent my way works out amazingly for me and ends up really fucking over who ever sent it my way. And I receive little blessings from the universe ALL the time. I‚Äôm constantly told I‚Äôm extremely lucky, but I don‚Äôt think this is just luck. This isn‚Äôt a brag post I‚Äôm genuinely curious If this could be from anything and how to harness this so it‚Äôs not just random happenings? Or if this happens to anyone else?Hey all, I just got into Wicca recently but ive been interested in the practice for many years. I havent tried any magicks yet mainly because i want to learn more about Wicca before hand, ive tried finding more information online but most things ive found were very vague. Anyone willing to help me start? Thanks :)I‚Äôm struggling a bit with finding the deity I am drawn to most. If there are any books with a large section on how to find yours, videos, meditations, etc. that anyone recommends, I‚Äôd be really grateful! I‚Äôve always felt a bit of a connection to Nyx and Hekate since I was a child, and I know we are all drawn to the moon, but the moon has been important, guiding, and comforting to me since I was young. I imagine a deity like these or one heavily connected to the moon is who I will find my connection with, but how can one ever be completely *sure*? I‚Äôd love to start honoring my deity as I can feel her, I just can‚Äôt quite pinpoint her.Along with a jumble of my usual dreams (natural disasters, family not liking me, worst case scenarios) I dreamt of a deer skulled creature. At first, I was in a dense forest during the night in winter. I felt fear, then extreme fear when a bipedal deer skulled creature (similar to some depictions of wendigos) chased me with intent to harm. At some point in the dream, I was home again, but a black cloaked deer skulled creature was waiting for me outside. This time I wasn't afraid, and I wanted to go with him, even had romantic feelings? Does this mean anything? Am I just reading too much into this? Is this someone else? Am I watching too much anime? I don't have a patron deity yet and haven't been practicing Wicca for long. I think I also have a connection to Hekate? I've always been drawn to wolves, dogs, snakes, deer. I have a pet snake, dog and cat.I had begun to get interested in Wicca and I began researching a bit, not much though. I began getting lots of injuries on my hands but when I began researching egyptian gods they began to dissapear, like magic. I was more confident to swim in water today after researching Wicca a bit. I have also always felt drawn to candles and crystals. I wanted to know if these could be signs?I‚Äôm ready to start my journey into witch craft, but I don‚Äôt know where to start. I‚Äôve always felt and attraction towards the craft like something is calling me to it. I have so many questions and I guess I‚Äôm looking for a mentor üòÖ but I‚Äôm also willing to put in the work to further my knowledge.I‚Äôm pretty sure I can but before I do anything that‚Äôll get me hurt I wanted to be sure. I get loose leaf tea from DavidsTea (Canadian company) and they put things like cinnamon bark and cardemom and other whole herbs and sometimes even flowers into their teas, and I was wondering if it was alright to use the spices I pick out of my teaSo can you hex or put a spell on someone who doesn't like you ??üôÑ because I'm about this close to trying üëåThe local shop is closed today, so I can‚Äôt go by and get some! I‚Äôm doing a health spell on myself, the other things going into the spell is peppermint oil, coriander seed, thyme, lavender, all spice, a blue candle. I‚Äôm just running blank in what to use as a sub! 

Thank you all for the help and blessed be!I need some guidance help or someone who can help me understand.
I feel lost. Im 31 male. I have some ratger weird things happen to me. I tend to see. Or feel people who are at that moment just before the body goes but the spirit has already left i see the spirit just as its going to the vail.
I dream of a women just floating above a pool of water but the water acts like murcury and is of that color. The back drop is like a charcole color as if a concrete. The women her toes point to the water her head points up her arms strecthed out to the side with her palms up as if in reciving praise from above. Her dress is like a roman revival dress from the 30s or 20s swooped over on shoulder and onder the other.
The dress drapes to the water just enoug to touch the water beneath her. The dress is like silk but platnum colored. She wheres a petit crown on her head and necklace her skin is pale like powderd white.
There is very little light in the dream its as if a small window to my right is shinning bright white light just on her but to far to my upper right for me to see.

Im not only scared and terrified but i am in awe and wounder about her when i am in the presence.
I see her in many dreams many different ways.
But this is the most common dream i have of her.

Im not sure what this all means. Im hoping someone knows more or can assist me..Why can I smell rosemary lavender and sage all the time?

Every time I leave my room I smell it but no one else can (I'm the only witch in my house)So I'm new to pretty much everything accept the general basics (like crystals and psychic abilities. I know about vibrational beings as well). However i like many others came from a strict Christian background and because of this i still have lingering doubts. I believe in God but not in the regular sense (i believe in all deities). With that being said, i guess im more afraid of the potential punishments preached about in church for participating in witchcraft even though i firmly believe nothing's wrong with it. Is there any way i can stop feeling this way? I feel like it's holding me back, i haven't created an alter yet, and I'm scared of what might happen if a try a spell (also because doubting your spell makes it not work, right? ). Can anyone give me tips on how to overcome this?  (I should also mention i have anxiety so that's another factor in my doubtfullness)I‚Äôm currently in a position that I‚Äôm not fond of but seems to be the case in my young life, I don‚Äôt have a stable home nor the means to get one, we tried staying with her and her fianc√© once before and she couldn‚Äôt stop being a crazy bitch the whole time and wondered why I didn‚Äôt want to open up as a person, then kicked us out due to the fact that she didn‚Äôt want me around anymore. See I didn‚Äôt want to come here this time either but it was that or move far away and she wouldn‚Äôt let us move far away and of course my bf doesn‚Äôt want to make his mom upset and so we moved in with them again. Now we are here I was bitching to my boyfriend about them eating the last of curtain things that they didn‚Äôt buy, of course I was unhappy about it but I wasn‚Äôt going to make her all mad because of food, so days go on, and apparently he said something last night about me being upset and caused her to go act like a crazy person and come and yell at me so I can‚Äôt tell her anything about how I feel or what really is going on and when I try to tell her I can‚Äôt tell her anything if she won‚Äôt let me say anything she continues to scream and shut the door in my face, and told me now I only have a week to get out of my attitude doesn‚Äôt change, even tho I‚Äôve done nothing. Please please tell me something that might help I would appreciate it more than you‚Äôll ever know!I‚Äôm new to this subreddit so please forgive me if this is not the place to post this. Long story short I‚Äôm searching to know if it is possible to rid someone else of another‚Äôs energy. I have a dear friend who‚Äôs fallen into a bad crowd. One of their new friends is a very toxic influence on them, manipulating them, whispering things in their ear, turning them against me and our other friends. Recently a psychic told me they could help me clear their negative energy so I could reunite with my friend in a new clean space and that their hold on them could go away. Is that something that can be done? Is it possible to rid my friend of another‚Äôs hold? If so I would like to do it myself and not rely on this psychic. I care so much for my friend and I miss them more than anything. I‚Äôm willing to do whatever I have to to reunite and make sure they‚Äôre alright (of course without negative karma I‚Äôm not looking to control them or anyone).I have been researching more and more over the past month or so (I know, it's not much time) and keep finding fascinating new information. Especially after a rough couple of months, i think I need to join a religion. And Wicca drew me in, I feel as though it's how I'm meant to be. 
Anyways, I'm a teen so I'm bringing my mom with me. She's Catholic, but very open minded. I'm hoping she'll gain more insight there and can support me further in my path. I'm also hoping I'll find guidance in my new-found faith. I'm excited! 

Is there anything I should know going in? Thanks!Hi everybody! I am like really really new to Wicca and to be honest I dont know a lot, just basic stuff. I have only practice a little of witchcraft but I do watch some youtuber that are wiccan and I think I can find myself in this religion the most; I mean, it interests me and fulfils me the most when I even think about it. My question is where do I start? Should I write something first in my book of shadows or have some ritual? Pleas help!I didn't know where else to post or ask, so uh.. yeah.
A few years ago, a ring came into me and my friends life. It was silver, and had a silver spider on it. The thing is, I never actually saw it, except in a dream, and a hallution of a giant spider crawling out of my vent.
As of recent, spiders have become more prominent as me and my friend Maddison explore what we think is real magic. Two nights ago we were experimenting, and some weird stuff happened (odd sounds, my cat being oddly clingy, candle doing stuff). The next night, there's three spiders outside my window with a new web and everything. Two of the spiders were smaller, and the third was larger. 
I uh.. hope someone can help out, because I don't know what's going on.Hi! Does anyone have any suggestions or links to good sites and blogs for information on wicca?üñ§

https://preview.redd.it/pyxk1550vqh21.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76dd0d60143dd25c8e0d524fdb981d5ca7427bd9Does anyone think it's odd to have random spells (complete with lists of ingredients) just pop into your head?Hello, I am not too sure how to go about explaining this but I'll try to keep it simple. I am currently studying witchcraft, mainly herbalism. I was interested in getting a few supplies to start setting up an altar of sorts and all of a sudden my stomach started to turn. I got dizzy all of a sudden as well. To note, yes I've been keeping hydrated so it's not anything related to that before that gets asked. I'm not too sure as to why I got sudden sick as I generally am fine when looking at witch related items. Any explanation?I astral projected three nights ago. I looked at my door and saw grey smoke. Anyone else experience this? Could this mean something? If so what?I recently had many changes in my life. New marriage, new house in a new state, new business. 

However, the changes happened so fast, I neglected to care for the spiritual end of my life. Big no-no!

So, now that things slowed a little, I decided to begin my return with a blessing on said business in a small solitary ritual. (Well, of course we smudged the house first!)

However, I made a terrible mistake and I can't even blame it on lack of experience!

I  cast the quarters and ran the entire ritual from the wrong direction! I noticed the energy seemed off right away, but chalked it up to either being out of practice or new medications I'm taking  (I'm not a fan of modern medicine but sometimes it's necessary.) 

Then, just as I was opening the circle, it struck me. I feel terrible! Not about the effect of what should've been a blessing being ineffective, but about the careless nature of my error when I'm usually mindful. 

My question is, should I blow out the candles and start afresh or just let it go and repeat the ritual later from the correct position? I've already sent my apologies to the universe, immediately, as soon as I realized the mistake. 

I would take this to my circle if I had one, I haven't found one here yet and couldn't give one sufficient participation in the past and thus only attended open rituals in my old city. 

I'm too ashamed to ask my beloved teacher as its a mistake I've never made and should've known better than to make now.  Hi, looking for a good cleansing spell to do to start the new year, any ideas?Places like Wikipedia are difficult to read the raw facts, and I would like to find a place to learn about them in more laymans terms. Particularly, i have found that i especially want to learn more about the goddesses behind Lady Justice. Where is a good place to look? Edit: Preferably online because my lifestyle makes it difficult to make it to the libraryI'll be cross-posting this, but I'm curious if anyone has any ritual ideas for Samhain that are specific to honoring a loved one who has recently passed on due to suicide. I lost my friend in May, someone who was more like a mother to me, and I'm still very heavily grieving the loss. With Samhain coming up, it will be the first time I've celebrated it while actively in mourning, and I feel overwhelmed to even know where to start. Thank you in advance.My name is Sharon and have started on "The Path" later in life. I am reading when I can and am now gathering not only info but spells, that are easy for relaxing, calm, studying etc. Am wanting to learn and belong but am looking for a teacher as well.  I work in a call cry and going to college online.Hey everyone. My name is Grayson and I was wondering if anyone could give me any insight.

I am writing a book about a young mage who gains a familiar, things happen, etc etc. But what I can't decide is why a potential familiar would decide to join any person on their journey.

For the mage it's obvious, hes searching for a companion that can help him in his magical endeavors. But what is the benefit for the familiar?  Why would it choose to ally itself with someone?

I appreciate any and all thoughts on this. So thank you for helping if you can :)I felt a call to follow Mother Earth last year and I had a spirit guide who was often praising me with kindness. Mother Earth would sometimes tell me to take care of myself. 

Well I started having bad feelings and paranoia. I started talking to the wind asking for power and that wasn‚Äôt the best idea because I felt like I was in trouble after that. I woke up from a dream and felt I needed to build an altar or else something bad was going to happen. My sister got sick and I felt like it was my fault, I threw out my altar and renounced my beliefs in Mother Earth. Every so often I try and go back but I‚Äôm struggling between being a Christian and following God or not. I‚Äôm afraid to start following this faith again and I‚Äôm afraid of the consequences but I still feel that draw towards it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I recently went snooping through my parents room, (bad, i know.) Upon finding sexual things, I found something very interesting, yet pretty terrifying. I found numerous, weird candles in my stepfathers top drawer, as well as some VERY strange writing. I have added the photo of the writing. I need help- I think my mom might be doing something weird to my step dad. He used to be not willing to help, and be kind of a jerk, but he's changed suddenly and my mom controls him.I am looking for rune symbols for darkness, portal and heaven for a spell I am trying to preform

Or
Fire , godess and prayer 

Hot any question ask away I won't answer if u straight up ask what the first set of runes are for the second set is to invoke a goddess to hear me outJust a quick question because I'm new to Wicca and I am preparing my first offering. I've felt a strong connecition to The goddess Artemis and the god  Hermes lately, when I am putting up offerings for them is it best to keep their offerings separate in two different offering dishes? Or can I put them together? I don't want either to be upset if I mix the offerings in the same dish. Also, what are some good offerings for each of them? And any suggestions or tips for my first prayer and offering ritual? And help would be great, I'm still studying a lot of Wicca and I am very new to this!

Please be constructive and any advise and knowledge you can give me would be amazing! Thanks so much! I'm excited to be a part of this community~So I randomly opened our little subreddit is here and saw an advertisement that actually caught my eye at the top of the screen. The advertisement literally just said Wiccan T-Shirts. I am a huge fan of graphic T-shirts so I clicked the link and saw some pretty amazing shirts that I am actually going to buy. I am going to buy the one that says "Do no harm Take no shit" so check the link out let me know if you like what you see. https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_pg_1?srs=14203050011&rh=i%3Aspecialty-aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1465280466This video is all about the Rede.

Plz no get mad at me. 
https://youtu.be/LJP9IShFEk4I live in a big city where there is street parking.  After going out or running an errand when I get home I have to find a spot,  sometimes a block or 2 away.  Without fail I'll drive down my street and see no spots,  then drive around and look somewhere else,  and take what I can get because it  likely will be taken if you don't.  The kicker is I get out and walk home only to find a spot right in front or on my street.  If I go back and get my car both spots will be gone.  I am sure I'm doing this somehow, with my mental energy.  That's all...  What do you think?Our goal is a simple one. We want knowledge to be shared. Whatever you want to talk about make a post.

[https://discord.gg/wpNRXAE](https://discord.gg/wpNRXAE) ‚ù§üî•Hello guys. This may not be directly relevant to this page but I would appreciate your help guys. My wife is 5 months pregnant with a  boy. May I ask your suggestion for a name for my boy? I would love your suggested names based on the following criteria:

1.I want it to sound quite uncommon or unique but translates "GOD-ish" like you know, the sound of it is oozing with conqueror's presence,being a King, supremacy, extreme badassery u know what I mean.üòÖ I would love to name him after greek or egyptian gods but it just seems common nowadays. I told my wife Ill name him Genghis Khan and just imagine the annoyance in my wife's face. ü§£ü§£. I have no cultural bias guys so you can suggest anything.

2. This is optional. My wife is a grandfather's daughter since he took care of her during her worst times during her childhood. So for the memories of his grandpa, she kept on insisting that I put "Gene" in the wordplay. Just  imagine her anger when I told her: " How bout Devil GENE?" (TEKKEN REFERENCE) üòéüòéüòé

3. As I said, option #2 isnt a priority especially if it will mess up the wordplays of the name. üòÖ 

4. Pls put the meaning of your suggestion so I can have a proper explanation to my wife so she can accept a suggestion already. ü§£
Thanks guys!does anyone have any good & potent love spell recipes?  preferably one i can just carry around (not a self love one).Hey! I'm new to the Craft, and am in dire need of REAL information, but don't have a ton of money for books. I don't even know where to begin. What is Wicca to Norse Paganism? What is Norse Paganism to Norse Mythology? How do I know what kind of witch I may be? How do I practice? It's all a big jumble to me, but I'd love to learn. If anyone wants to help out a "baby witch", I'd be so grateful. Thanks!In this story names will be far and few between. Bits and pieces sent whenever. But one thing must be clear, not at all will care, not all will believe. But i assure all who do read this, it is the truth. One passed to me and through my family of Alexandrian witches. 

There was a woman who lived a painful and degrading life with only moments of piece only to be ripped away the next. This woman became pregnant at the age of 18 by an awful man. He had desired the death of their child. The womans mother of initial Alexandrian affiliation had become dark and corrupted in her time as a witch. By the time the child was born the grandmother of the child had prepared a ritual to implant a completely new soul within the child. As all souls have lived at least once this would be the very first time this one lived as well as existed. But to do so she had to have help from the red beast. In doing so they as well took power from the new god and goddess. This child was intended to be the end of the human realm and rip the barrier between hell and the human world. But the old goddess with her knowledge slipped herself within the child lying dormant for years.  This childs name Is selexus.(From mobile, sorry) is there any coven or individuals who put science first? 

So, I've hand friends and family who practice wicca. As a result of this connection in very comfortable and at home with it and would like to explore future. I personally see it as an experiment. Not saying others are not valid at all, after all my view of witch craft is that it is very personalized and independent and all walks are valid. 

I like to think of myself as a "mind witch". Energy is real and has a real effect on people and things. Meditation is proven to help and stones are tool that can help one focus. Even Tarot is a thought experiment that simply helps one consider different points of view. 

I don't know if my question is making sense, so i would simply word it as "Magick is science and science is Magick" can anyone point me in a direction to others like me?Does anyone have any knowledge or information on Espiritu brand oils? I see they have ones that seem like basic essential oils like Cinnamon, Patchouli, etc. but they also have oils such as Witch's Spell Oil, Uncrossing Oil, Tranquility Oil, etc. I was wondering if anyone has any experience using these oils or has any idea what the ingredients might be like for the ones that have names instead of the base ingredient on the label.What is the bowl of salt and bowl of water symbolize or is used for on a Wiccan Altar?Hi, so I‚Äôve been doing some self reflection, I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt know much about Wicca or anything but I‚Äôm looking at getting back in touch with myself better. It‚Äôs been a strange couple years for me but I want to grow from it and rediscover my passions in life and hopefully start down the career path I‚Äôve always wanted. I don‚Äôt know from what I‚Äôve heard Wicca is about balance and peace and feel like I could use some of that. 

Thanks for any advice or reading material that you  may have for me ‚ù§Ô∏èeveryone keeps saying baby witches need knowledge but how do i know i‚Äôm ready for the work, what do i study and such and when is too soon for spell jars, i simply wana use this stuff to improve my self love and life, helpHey lovelies,  I'm hoping someone can recommend a good spell or ritual to help improve my mood.
I've been struggling with being really down and feeling stuck in a negative mind set for the past week, I would love to get rid of it.
And help will be appreciated.Hello,  I am relatively new to Wicca, been learning as much as possible and practicing the last 6 months. I am really wanting to find a group around me. I would like to find a coven because the structure is something I thrive on, but I am really just needing to find others to learn from and talk with. I am in central Illinois, does anyone have any leads or advice for how to start finding where I fit in? I kind of feel like I am at a stand still currently.Hey everyone, I hope you may be able to help me out. I dont practice a lot at all really but have tried to with a best friend and then it seemed to fizzle out, but given time I start to feel a pull back to it. A little bit about myself and why I started practicing was growing up, I used to have dreams predicting the future but wouldn't remember them until they came to be. As I grew up and my depression became more prevalent it went to having feelings a few days before something would happen, normally a fight, this was followed by what seemed to be poltergeist activity that centered around another friend and I both experiencing a dark time in our lives. Sorry that this is long but I want to get it all out to help make sense! Bare with me lol. Back to my friend at the beginning he ended up moving and I met another friend through my bf who she also was into practicing magic. By this time we started to form a coven and I was given the element of air, I having gotten the idea of the coven going found her element and then found another friend who also wanted to participate, his was water. We both talked about what we would like to achieve and started doing a tarot reading together to see if this was the correct path. The reading was so intense. As he drew the cards I told him how cool it would be if they ended up being in numerical order and they came out that way! It was as if things were telling us to push more. The goal was to summon the four corners and I randomly chose a day that we all could meet and come to find out it actually was a very significant day with a full moon for power. Unfortunately no one came and it kinda broke me a little so I stopped practicing again. The past few months idk if this pertains to magic but every now and then im being able to control my dreams and have recently given up alcohol to become healthier. The draw is starting to come back as strong as ever. I feel like I'm being pulled to something very important that will have answers I've wanted for a long time. Im sorry for the long post but I would love someone's help to better understand this!Hi all! 

I want to know if there‚Äôs any way to learn Wicca when there‚Äôs no current gatherings, and no (known) community where I currently reside. Any tips welcome üòä

Also very open to recommendations for any books on individual practice if this isn‚Äôt a thing!I've had some weird things happen to me regarding flames within the last couple of months. I'll be lighting candles and once the candle stick has burned out I'll notice that it'll randomly reignite. This has happened a couple of times and once it happened with a tea-light and once the flame went completely out, I noticed it reignite except this time the flame was massive and surrounding the entirety of the tea-light. When I tried to blow the flame out it only grew to get much bigger, I put water on it to try and extinguish it and once I did that the flame roared again and then went out. Is this all in my head or is this not a bit strange? Any explanations?I've recently done a love spell, it's the first real one that I've done and this time I used the male & female figure candle. I definitely noticed some burning patterns but I'm not sure if its anything to overthink? Does anyone have insight on this?Iam.new to all this and the idea of working with elements and gid or godess is very nerve racking. I also not 100% sure yet if this type.of craft is for me. Once i start this is it something i can just leave or do i have to do something specific to leaveDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions for protection spellsnot too long ago i accidentally had some crystals/stones get flushed down the toilet. they had fallen out of one of my pockets and down they went... what does this mean? is something bad going to happen?Let me start this by saying that I do not believe in any religion of any kind. Not wicca, not paganism not anything. I was lead to believe in this possibility by an acquaintance who recently got into wicca things (pardon if my terms are not proper or sensitive enough), and since I read something about writing of dreams here, I believed this would be the right sub, if not, I'd appreciate any help or lead as I am very curious now.

Onto the dreams and details:

> I've had a fair share of dreams with snakes. Several colors and sizes, the most noticeable are green, orange, moted in white and black and lastly a black one (this last one being a huge one). Is worth mentioning that all these snakes were passive towards me, following me around and looking at me attentively, and just me, despite other people being in the scenarios.

> If it's worth mentioning in 2016 a large snake snuck into our house, it once again stared at me and I stared back. I was lucky enough as to get out of the room safely before the snake moved.

> In January 29th I dream of the leviathan. We were both in the deep area of the sea, the one where is so far down that everything that can be seen is blackness. The leviathan was peeking out of a weird cave place, and it was (you guessed it) staring at me and my movements. As I just floated away, I also was holding something in my hand that I subconsciously knew it was a property of the leviathan.

> Lastly, on August 5th I had a weird dream that involved a organisation that worked amongst the shadows. These organisations (there were several across the world) wanted to free humanity from the toxic-worship kind of religions, in this case, christianism. In this dream I was there, but not in my own body, or with my own identity. I also happened to be lucky enough as to be called by the leader, who was called the devil by all. No one had seen him personally, but I remember him being very human-looking, once I got there he praised me for doing my job, reminding me that even if the middle was not the best, the end justified it. As a last point, during this dream (which in that weird state took like three days) there was a major election for a new pope in Rome, this one where there is smoke to signal the choosing.Hello there! I made a post yesterday about making free online classrooms on Google classroom. Thank you to all the people who have messaged me and joined a classroom. Sadly, it turns out that the code for the Herbalism classroom doesent seem to work. If you want to join it I'll provide you with a link, if that doesent work please give me your email and I'll add you myself.

Now onto the other news, I've added more classrooms you can choose from! A user messaged me and requested more classrooms to be made and I realised that those are really needed! I also added a beginners classroom for beginners who want to learn about all the topics, now you can choose between,


Familiars

Crystals

Herbalism

Tarot

Beginner

Numerology

Astrology


If you would like to join a classroom please message me privately and I'll provide you with the information you need to join one.

Another thing is I've had some people reach out to me and ask to help out with the teaching. Unfortunately I won't be accepting any teaching offers untill next year when everyone already on the track off the classrooms, and I am unable to pay anyone at the moment and I don't want to get into a situations where I owe people money.

If you finish a course of your classroom you can join another one (after you've left the first one you've joined) or you can level up and join the more advanced version of you class. This process will last half a year. 

I will post PowerPoints and other things like a real teacher would and I would like the submissions to be either written on paper and having a picture me sent to me or digitialy on PowerPoint on Microsoft Word. 

If you have any more questions please comment them down below or message me privately. Again thank you to all the poeple who have already joined the classrooms. 

The lessons will start in Monday 21/09/20I‚Äôm a Draconic Wiccan which is one of the less common to find new information on so if anyone has good resources aside from books (I‚Äôm saving up for those) that would be so helpful (Book suggestions are still welcome though). I‚Äôve been writing my own book of shadows ever since I started researching Wicca, and I have a second book that I want to fill with information about the additional things I believe in and practice alongside my main path.
-Sanguimancy/blood magick (I already know and practice a little bit of this but it‚Äôs hard to find information that isn‚Äôt with a negative connotation
-Astral projection 
-Shapeshifting 
-Dragon runes
-Celtic dragons/Celtic magick 
-FamiliarsWould Halloween‚Äôs witching hour be on Halloween morning or Halloween evening, but the next day?
I‚Äôm an artist, I‚Äôve never considered myself to be a practitioner of Wicca but I do commune with energies when I work. I can feel them manifest physically in the space around me and sometimes within me when I am working. My work process is somewhat ritualistic, I often put the same music on repeat and go into a semi trancelike state before beginning my work. Sometimes I feel as if my hands are being guided and it‚Äôs usually an entirely positive experience. I was told by a Wiccan woman I met in 2004 that I had the natural gift for this and I‚Äôve never fully embraced it. Recently I‚Äôve been visited more by these energies and I‚Äôm trying to understand what I‚Äôm experiencing. Often the need to work comes on rapidly and is insistent. The most recent experience I felt two with me and was about to dive in to working when I felt physical stomping behind me in the studio. This has happened before and has thrown me a bit. It doesn‚Äôt feel negative necessarily but it is jarring. I‚Äôve never cast but I have worked with objects that I believe hold some energy in the room with me. I have also recently been gifted the art supplies of one of my former art teachers who died a few years back along with some of my grandfather‚Äôs art supplies. I‚Äôve been working with these in a studio space that also has multiple other objects from family that has passed on. Any ideas or advice on what to make of this stomping energy?I have been having this dream for the last few weeks. Always the same man. Only I have never met this man in real life before. I don't even know if he is a real person. The dreams are very sexual in nature. Im having a hard time figuring out why he keeps visiting me and what he wants with me particularly. I am new to wicca and these dreams started just after I began my journey. Could it be one of the gods introducing himself to me, so to speak? If so, how do I know which one it is?Hello,

I am VERY new and I have limited research under my belt so please excuse any thing I say or do that might offend, my desire is purely for information.  Respect is my main focus so please feel free to let me know where I should search or if you have the knowledge I would greatly appreciate it. 

I recently had a dream about a women that felt more than just a human female.  The few items I remember about this entity was that she had long very black hair that was in someway braided, curly or twisted. Her skin was pale and she was was touching me very lightly and it felt comforting is a strange way.  She was weeping and her tears were hitting my head and seemed to be healing my thoughts in some way.  

Unfortunately that is all I can remember, but would desperately like to find out who this being might have been.  I am not sure if I feel called to her as a guide or protector, or if it is a warning or just a passing dream. 

Again I hope that I do not offend anyone, I am truly seeking truth.  As far as my journey I am just starting to read and obtain knowledge and receive a confirmation that the Wicca/Wiccan/Witch is my true path. I do not want to jump into this lightly as I know that it requires dedication, which I am willing to do if it is my true calling.

Thank you so much for your help and knowledge,

RooSo... I've tried doing research on the subject of familiars, but not having a whole lot of luck... 

For background info, my cat, who had been at my Grandma's up until recently, had gotten very sick to the point he was near death. My landlord, though there was worry about her dogs (I was taking care of them since they didn't have a fence yet, and I got cheaper rent for it) and how they would interact with cats, told me that if I wanted, I could bring my cat down to the house since she thought he wouldn't live much longer, and might be happier in his final days with me. 

Brought him down, and he started getting better. Once he was back to doing normal cat things, I brought him in front of my altar and stones, which he was more than careful of as he navigated around. After he had to be brought back to his cage to continue to recover, all I heard from my stones for a half hour or so of them asking if he was my familiar. 

Research hasn't gotten me much anywhere, but this is a question that's been on my mind. Other than a general guide to magick, what qualities would a familiar have that my stones might have picked up on, where they didn't say anything about the dogs beforehand?In my book, it talks about witchcraft in the 13th century. I would like to know more about witchcraft. For the females people call them witches but what do people call males who practice witchcraft?Good evening ladies and gentlemen and all in between. I am looking at procuring a Dracaena Draco specifically to be able to harvest its sap down the road for incense. My question is do I need to pressure cook the sap into pellets to burn them? And if so can I get away with a normal pressure cooker? 
Forgive my ignorance as to the workings of this sub-reddit as I am primarily a LHP sorcerer and rarely foray into Wicca and botanical practices.Okay so due to all the "baby witch/witchtok" bs that pops up when I Google right now, I would much rather check here than there. 

But anyways, I'm currently trying to set up an altar to rain goddesses/gods. I originally chose Hyades since my pantheon is mostly Hellenistic. But, I know very little about them as far as what they would want. 

So does anything here know anything about them? Or know how to help me piece together what I should use? 
It's possible I'm thinking too hard and should just stick with a generic call for rain spell but for some reason my brain has decided to empty any and all related information. 
My fall back here is Hecate and Persphone since I have altars and such for them. But I would prefer to not use them for something like this. 

I'm open to pretty much all suggestions and advice. 
Blessed be.I'm still new to Wiccan magick itself, and it's helped me tremendously when it comes to doing better in day to day life. Recently, though, my cat, a sweet as sugar floof boy who had been staying at my Grandma's because Mom is allergic, got deathly sick. Mom moved in with her bf, so I had the run of the house, and it was like pulling teeth trying to get her to let my cat come down.

Once the decision was final, though, he started improving. Brought him down anyways because he would still need to heal.

When he was feeling well enough to start doing normal cat things again, albeit with some help, I brought him over to my altar because he was curious about my room and didn't want him hiding in the bedframe again. Ended up being most of my stones more or less all asking at once if he was my familiar, before it felt like they were all just cheering about him being my familiar before I could confirm or deny. 

So I guess he's my familiar, though he's been my baby for nearly ten years now. 

Google hasn't been much help in telling much about familiars other than they were believed to be fae disguised as animals to be guides for witches, so I was wondering if anyone had any better answers or something else to help explain?Any celtic wiccans our there wanna chat about practices and what notHello everyone my name is Ryan. I am from Whittier, California and I have just began my journey of learning the art of Wicca. A little backstory here: I started my seeking of my true power when I was very little. I started studying and going to different martial arts classes in the 1st grade and after years and years I have studied about 12 or 13 different martial arts. I am only a purple belt in one of them and the rest I have barely went to real classes with teachers for. I have maybe 5 or 6 years worth of hands on training with real teachers but I have spent quite some time practicing and perfecting the arts I have learned to the best of my ability. I have gotten to the point where I feel it would be a good idea that I also learn the art of Wicca. I want to be a good Wiccan so I can protect the ones I truly care about. I think my grandpas sister is also a Wiccan. She and her now passed husband would hold Native American ceremony‚Äôs with their group of people and they seem really into it. My mom told me she has skitzophrenia but personally I don‚Äôt believe that because she just seems too grounded and knowledgeable to me. Almost like she knows more then the rest of us ignorant people. Anyways please introduce yourself to me and give me some books and other things I should read so I can start my journey and make new friends and/or allies. Peace ‚úåüèº‚ô•Ô∏èI have something that crawls across my roof at night. You can hear it running and you can hear it take off. It's big and it actually tears up shingles on the roof. Others hear it as well, but it only appears when magic is being done. Any ideas?Hi guys, 

I am new to wicca, but I wanted to study it for years. 
I have been very afraid of what the people around me would say and think but now there was just a feeling that I had to do it. 

I bought my books, started to study and decided to make a book of shadows. 
I was busy for a couple of hours when my rabbit started to act up like he was scared of 

My boyfriend decided to look and got scared because he saw something move, so there was a worm and he killed it out of reflex. After that he had 3 little accidents (something fell, he kicked something else over and something broke) in a very short time period. 

My candles began to go crazy and right after that my rabbit got so scared that he jumped away and began to make crazy noises and jumps, he went to our bedroom and still there he was scared. After that I felt like a warm breeze or something a flow of air. 

My boyfriend got spooked so he asked me to stop working on my book for tonight. Is this a sign or are we going nuts lol. I don‚Äôt know if my need for a sign is going on deep inside my head but I still wonder if it is. 

Can anybody give advice?

I‚Äôve always felt really drawn to snakes. I dream about them often and the dreams always stand out to me. In the dream I had that really stood out to me two enormous (to be honest they were much bigger than I was...) iridescent snakes were wrapped around my waist and around my arms and were staring straight into my eyes in a non-threatening manner that felt really calming. I am interested to learn more what this means because a currently do not worship any deities and am wondering if one could be reaching out to me? Thanks.Alrighty so I am a bit new to candle-work communication with altars but I have done quite a bit of research so I felt I was ready, now I need some advice on the subject. I decided for my first altar I'd create a candle using herbs around the house that I felt should be in the candle. I chose dried rosemary and dried orange peel. I chose herbs that I "felt" because I was hoping it would help me discern which deities might be calling me. 

I made the candle all fine and dandy. Set up the altar with a small branch of japanese maple leaves and two pansies, and then an orange to the side. 

Found out after lighting the candle that there was some entity in the room & used my pendulum to figure out that it was not a negative entity and it did not mean me harm so I approached the entity through the candle-work. 

I asked it a few questions so that I could understand a bit of who this entity might be and found they liked the rosemary, and pansies, along with the soft animal crossing music that was playing in the background (bc im a nerd). Then we ended the session because my cat intervened. 

So I looked these interests up on several databases to try and figure out who this might be and I came upon the Goddess of Rhiannon. Now this wouldn't scare me so much that she fits every answer the entity gave me if it weren't for the fact that the Goddess of Rhiannon's other name is the Divine Queen of Faeries.

Anybody have any advice for how I should approach this further?Hi fellow witch's I am new to all of this(witchs and dietys) I would like to become a witch and also work with a diety how do i go about this I've been watching loads of witchs or people that have dietys on tiktok and it has really peaked my interest (also I love animals üòädon't know why I thought this piece of information would be helpful) anyway can anyone help me out or give me some advice thank you also I hope I haven't offended anyone that is not my intentionSo, I grew up raised Lutheran. Went to church and Sunday school, Vacation Bible School, the whole nine. I had fun and enjoyed it as a child, but as I got older, I started seeing a lot of hypocrisy and ‚Äúbad‚Äù things in organized religion in general. I started questioning my beliefs and if I believed anything in general. I became very detached from religion and wanted nothing to do with it for a long time. I considered myself somewhere between agnostic and atheist for a long time and felt I didn‚Äôt need any religion. However, as I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve felt a need to go back to my roots and explore/get in touch with my spiritual side. I now know traditional religion just wasn‚Äôt for me, and there may be something else I believe in and want to follow. My boyfriend‚Äôs mom started talking to me about Wicca (knowing my love of plants and connection with nature) and gave me a book to read. I‚Äôve gotten really into it over the last year or so and she‚Äôs gifted me many things for when I start practicing more and doing spells/rituals. I‚Äôve even built an alter in my bedroom. She‚Äôs been very supportive and encouraging and I feel like I finally have someone who understands and can help guide me, which I‚Äôm so grateful for. Do you have any more advice for continuing my journey? How to start connecting to the gods or finding my deity? I‚Äôve done a lot of thinking and soul searching to unmask myself and open my mind to religion again, but I feel like I still have work to do in order to reach my full potential and connections in this sense. I still have to shake those bits of doubt, questioning, and build up my confidence, you know?Hey there witches of reddit! I have a weird question for you üòÖ.

So I am fairly new to the Wicca lifestyle and attempted my first spell of my own creation (To Influence concentration) I have a non-traditional alter in which to do said spell on. I‚Äôve done a few spells before, but nothing self-made. I figured this particular one would take more energy than the few simple spells in the past. But when I went to draw energy from my assortment of crystals, precious gems and candles, I got very light headed and blood rushed to my face within a few seconds as well as an increased heart rate.

And decided to use a ouija board to try an contact my deceased brother whom my grandma says has been looking over me since I joined the army, instead we made contact with a spirit who identified itself as "J" and then wouldn't say anything. We tried again and made contact with a spirit who identified itself as her deceased grandmother. It knew information I didnt, but my wife kept complaining of a panic feeling, and it asked me to call it "mamaw" I did some light research, and found that "zozo" like to identify itself as a mother figure, and specifically likes to target females with mental illness (my wife has depression, anxiety, and bipolar) my question is, did we actually contact her grandmother, or zozoHi, i am Jenni from iowa and normally use dystopia for reddit to post as it is easier to work with with voiceover on my iphone on my computer i use the old reddit and jaws.

I find there doctorine hard to uphold. I believe knowledge is power and right now would love some insight to my love life but cannot read my tarot deck. Something about blind i don't know. yes, i crack jokes about my disabilities. I also want to gain gifts and develope the ones i think i have. I use guided meditation on a daily basis but find it difficult to meditate any other way my mind wanders too much. some say i have autism some say bipolar disorder some say i am extremely gifted and some say all three. I am in the all three camp though i have not been tested for autism. I come here to give the best i can and seek knowledge of all forms. I have tried to read several books but when you are blind getting your hands on books is tough especially in an accessible format however bookshare.org is good about having wiccan resources. not all but a lot i want the book holistic energy magic but they don't have it and i can't afford it on amazon and the library of congress has some pagan resources but there resources are smaller than bookshare. bookshare takes vollenteers to scan books in case you are wondering just an fyi if you want to get your book collections on book share so people like me can read them. I would love more books on wicca and the like to read. not advertizing pointing out a resource to spread the love of pagan literature. did i mention i cannot spell? i was on witchschool before i got involved with the lds church and have been thinking of leaving the church but not had the heart too just yet.l I have no idea why maybe its the physical support they give and the psychological affect they have on you. I have no idea like i said I have nothing against anyone but dang they can sure get ya in but its hard to get out so I practice both faiths. and others I incorporate moltiple religions into my path.i was looking through some plants in an outside-ish area of home depot and when my mother was speaking i regrettably noticed a rodent looking thing speed from under a stand to another. after looking under the stand it went to i found that nothing was there.

Thankyou to those that manage to reach out.hi, i figured this would be a good place to start. i was raised in a household that was half christian and half agnostic and was recently baptized in august. since then i‚Äôve found the wiccan religion and i really like some of the concepts, but i‚Äôm scared by doing these things it could be sinful. my church is amazing and i love my god, and we already do things like burning sage to get rid of negative presences but so far i‚Äôve stuck to burning incense and palo santo wood. is there other things i can do that i can work into my views of christianity without crossing a line into witchcraft or spells that may cause me to feel as though i‚Äôm sinning? if i‚Äôve got the wrong idea please let me know, as i know wicca is a religion and i don‚Äôt want to offend anyone‚Äôs beliefs. thanks!Hi, this is a question that I‚Äôve wondered about but not had anybody to ask.

This year it took a whole new turn! My mother and father have been married 33 years, I turn 22 years old, my mother is 55 years old and my gran which is my mothers, mother is 77 years old. 

Is there any Wiccan history around things like this?

Thank youSo I'm somewhat of an independent contractor and I had 3 shifts set up for today. Last night I had a dream that I specifically only missed my second shift (set for 930am.) In the dream I looked at the clock and it was 10am. I also remember feeling a level of guilt, like I had slept through my shift. 

This morning at work I got a call that my second shift today is feeling sick and had to reschedule putting me back at home by 10am. 

My witchy friend said that was me working with the medium or am I sending out negitive vibes so I can catch a break? Any input is appreciated. 

Tldr: Had a dream about getting out if work and it came true the next day. Why?Does anybody know any good dark web spell books?Ive been recently been getting pack into paganism/wicca and was wondering if anybody has any good books/audio books i could listen to to learn more? Id really appreciate any suggestions! Thanks :)So I tried making holy water for the first time and I kinda rushed it and also skimmed how to I feel kinda stupid for rushing and skimming I think I shouldn't of done it until I read it all but for some reason I had the urge to do it so what do you all think should I have just waited to do it and read it all the way Ok so I‚Äôm new to Wicca and I Consecrated this stone I have and now I want to undo this is there any way I can un Consecrate it?Random white guy here. 40 and married with kids. I‚Äôll keep it brief. Since Election Day 2016, I have had a fire lit within that I cannot ignore.  I‚Äôm on a very spiritual quest for truth. I‚Äôve had quite a spiritual ascent throughout my years, and here I am. 

I believe US POTUS is a manifestation of everything wrong with society, amplified into a single powerful leader.  I have come to understand the patriarchal insecure stupidity-laced leadership is toxic. The suppression of women and the sacred feminine is, in my belief, the greatest tragedy to ever befall humanity.

Ok I‚Äôll just stop there before I ramble not-so-briefly. 

I‚Äôm ready for all recommendations! I know it's not popular belief that a devil exists but for those who do I need to know the name of a demon that takes for of a wild dog mange and gruesome a great sense of fear surrounds it if someone can supply me of a name or a least a connected name to it that would be helpful
Hi I'm raymanfanguy and i've seen some terrible god awful things as I've been to every lower plane of existence but not of my own volition so my question is why would some thing like this happen to someone as kind and as loving as myself? though this hasn't made me insane or angry or anything like that i'm just looking for answers... any knowledge of my current situation i can get would put my mind at ease... thank youOver the course of 4 years I've been studying up on Wicca and gathering tools (crystals, books, candles, etc.). I'm interested in the Ecletic branch of Wicca, but where do I go from here. How do I devote myself to Wicca? Or get into the habit of regular practicing? Should I wait to officially announce myself to the Goddess and God on a Sabbat? I'm so ready I'm just not sure where to start!This is going to be long but I feel the need to be descriptive to maybe get a more precise answer. 
When I was a teenager I had a mild infatuation with witches and whatnot. Following a heartbreak, a friend told me about a book she had (but never would let me see) and told me about/basically instructed me on a love spell. One day I found myself home alone and had the urge to try it out. 
I grabbed a few different colored candles from around the house and formed a circle. It all just came to mind rapidly; I started imagining certain features and qualities in a man, such as physical features, colorblindness specifically. I remember after a while I started gearing toward undesired qualities and focusing on things that I did not want in a partner. The information just invaded my brain. I would have two girls, one with medical conditions, the age I would conceive  each of them, ect. When it was finished, something told me to write down a name so I grabbed a notepad and without even paying much attention I wrote two different first and last names. For the sake of privacy, I'll say one was JJ and the other BCT. The whole experience kind of disappeared from my mind for years, until I met my first real love, JJ. I spontaneously remembered what I had done and that he matched part of the description, but not all of the information pertained to him. Fast forward about 2 years after our breakup, I get a message on fb from a stranger, BCT. I will honestly say, if the circumstances of our meeting were at all different, I don't think we'd be together. After 2 kids and 5 years, I'm realizing he is the exact description of what I didn't want. Now I'm obsessing over whether I was given all of this information about my future from another being or did I unwittingly create this reality for my own life? During the experience, I saw that I would be miserable in my relationship with BCT for years and when I got the courage to leave, he would end his life. How do I live knowing this will happen? Do I sacrifice my happiness for his life? Is there anything I can do? I hope someone can offer some insight to my situation.

This is the official permanent discord link. https://discord.gg/013Lx61sG3XA2RPDrSo if anyone is a follower of my Aether's Daily Topics series over on /r/Wicca you will see I just posted that I am taking a brake and refining it alot. Most daily topics will be posted on here meanwhile I will also be making videos and weekly topics for /r/Wicca. So the daily topics can cover anything I want them to from Magick to video games to tarrot etc. While the weekly topic will be posted to r/wicca/ and I will be doing tons of research on it.

Also let me know what kind of channels you guys would like to see. I was doing this general witchcraft/wicca quiz, one of the questions asked " pinterest is a reliable place to research on", the answer was "false".

I've used pinterest for some things, like spell jars and page ideas for my book of shadows, but not anything major. It seems reliable, but I obviously do lots of research before I just pick something and do/make it.I had a bad altercation with someone who I know is Wiccan. This altercation happened 2 days ago. Last night I started to have night terrors. Specifically, I felt like someone was in my bed grabbing me. They then got out of my bed and told me to put the covers over my head in a terrifying voice. I‚Äôve also received notice that I have an unexplainable medical condition and I was on the break of s*icide today. ( I am no longer feeling that way) Could this be a dark spell? If so, how do I get rid of it?Recently discovered that I am an Empath and while I‚Äôve always been interested in magic and energy and the spiritual world, I‚Äôve had quite a few scary experiences when I‚Äôve leaned into my gifts. I recently have been noticing strange occurrences in my home starting up again including my cat having strange behavior and interactions with thin air . When attempting to cleanse my space none of my sage would light and any incense with sage in it goes out. What do I do and what does it mean????tl;dr : I'm a gender abolitionist and revolutionary and have trouble reconciling these values with the use of gender in Wicca as well as the total Do No Harm rule. Thoughts, knowledge, advice?

Hello! After bouts of bad mental health and a growing despair on the state of the world, I've decided I need more spirituality in my life to give myself hope and guidance. I've really connected with Wicca on a lot of levels and really feel like it aligns with a lot of my personal values. I do, however, have some issues or questions I'm hoping to discuss.

1. Off the bat, I've been quite weary of the separation of gender in wicca. I understand the concept of creating a separation of the energies in the world in order to better understand them, but I have trouble accepting "masculine" or "feminine" energies. I have generally found these concepts to be mainly societal, rather than natural. Scott Cunnigham saying something along the lines of nature always being gendered really struck wrong with me, as that is quite frankly not the case. I'm concerned about the hetero- and cisnormativity of these themes overall, as tools alligned with the God are often "phallic", and there is a large emphasis on birth when it comes to the Goddess, which just doesn't represent all women. In general, I believe the concept of gender as a whole is harmful to society, and would much rather a world without preconceived notions of masculinity and femininity. Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I have a lot of trouble reconciling these two ideas. If anyone has any wisdom, thoughts or knowledge on this topic I would love to hear them.

2. I am fairly involved/informed politically. I have always strongly believed in compassion, equality, freedom, environmentalism, etc. A lot of my values fit really well with Wicca from what I've seen. However, revolution seems to me to be the only option to get the world to a place where it would embody those values best. And with revolution will sadly have to come a certain amount of violence and harm to some. I do not like this, and I would like to minimize it as much as possible, but I realize that from short term harm to some will most likely come the biggest benefits for all. I find this hard to reconciliate with the Do No Harm rule. The way I see it, a better world can't come without a certain expense due to where we are right now. I just simply can't see a better way. Is there a way to reconcile both valuing doing as little harm as you can with the fact that there simply doesn't seem to be a completely harmless way to a better world given the current state of global affairs?

If you've read this far, thank you for taking some kind of interest in my thoughts. I would greatly appreciate any and all feedback and ideas. I wish you all the absolute best and hope you are all well.So a couple weeks ago my best friend stole my girl and it really messed me up because I lost the closest people to me, but right afterwards  i started having conversations with a entity while I slept, Id fall asleep and Id start having a dream and get pulled out of it into a black void. Then me and wise entity "it gives off a vibe of being almost all knowing and powerful it's unique"and it offers me advice and it tries to persuade me in to doing things I normally wouldn't do like walking away from my house for a couple miles down one of the reserves to like a a big crazy looking tree or a clearing in the woods that leads to a lake.
The entity can also show me things like it's showed me events like fights or bloody battles some times from the past and some from the present and its always seen through the Victor's view.
I can go into more detail if y'all want 
Does anyone know what this entity might be?Everyday discounts on our spells and readings. We have 3 Psychics we have teamed up with and a Voodoo high priest. One stop shopping if you will. Come check us out and all the spells and crystals we have to offer.

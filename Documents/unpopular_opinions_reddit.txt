Maybe they didn't find answers or maybe it was too difficult of a search to be able to put into a simple Google search. Get off your high horse and just move on.I've been misgendered before, it's not a big deal. I honestly think people just want to get upset about something. Why are they giving a stranger the power to take away their identity? If someone calls you the wrong gender, it doesn't change reality. Its okay to be upset about it, but making it a big deal shows your vulnerabilities to the world and lets people know you are NOT a chill person.I saw a post about a girl who struggles with intimacy. She doesn’t feel sexual desire and doesn’t wish to have sex. Many comments gave her a label which she seemed to agree with.

But, all the comments were also ‘I could never be with someone like you’ and ‘break up with him’. She was repeating over and over about how much she loves him. Loves being intimidate in cuddling etc. She just doesn’t want sex.

If you are willing to breakup with your partner due to them not wanting sex, then you are valuing something more than them. You are saying they aren’t worth the feeling of something.

If my boyfriend said he never wanted sex again, that’s cool. I love him. And as long as I still get hugs, cuddles, dates and movies, flirty texts and continuous love, then the sex part should not matter.

Sex should never be a staple of a relationship. It is so dehumanising to me to know that someone would rather a sensation than a sex-less relationship. You don’t love me if you would rather stick your dick in me than have me in your arms.

**disclaimer:** sex is great. you can connect with someone and it feels awesome. i love it, and i personally wouldn’t be the first to say ‘hey, let’s not do this anymore’, but if my partner started that conversation, i’d choose them over sex any day. it’s not that i hate sex, i would just never value it over someone i love.

**EDIT:** there was a comment someone wrote and they summed up how I felt perfectly: If you wish to leave the relationship because I no longer want sex, then that makes me feel like you’re only with me because I give you sex. the times we did have sex, I was just a human fleshlight. that’s the dehumanising part. you’re with me for my body/vagina, rather than who I am as a person.Privileged instagram thots doing it out of personal choice, is not the same as poor exploited women being trafficked and kept in slavery in as high up as central [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrXYXvL8TM)

&#x200B;

Btw some genius made a point that the situation in London is bad because it's illegal, and it's way better in the Netherlands where it's legal. Which is an absurdly idiotic argument, and it shows how little someone knows about what he's talking about. Trafficking in Netherlands, and Germany is nowhere near better, the prostitutes there are the same poor women being trafficked to London, and being forced to be there by their boyfriends aka pimps. Legalizing prostitution there only made it worse, since it didn't help prostitutes be independent, it helped the pimps (traffickers from poor countries) be in the open. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nutaq-EGf2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nutaq-EGf2c)  


Oh and also many people are saying no one makes this point which is also absurdly untrue. It's very common especially among those who buy the service.

And btw my account was suspended reddit-wide for 7 days, with an automated bot message, without a reference to any of my posts, or comments. Harassment of what exactly?

&#x200B;Bare with me, I have logic behind this. Have you ever been told by a parent “you need to respect me because I’m your parent” without them doing anything to necessarily earn that respect outside of parental duties? I.e., clothing you, feeding you, putting a roof over your head, etc. They don’t speak to you with respect. They don’t keep promises worth keeping and can’t control their temper. They don’t help others unless it benefits them somehow, they don’t seem to understand the basic fundamentals of respecting someone outside of fearing them. That’s not respect. Parents should command respect rather than demand it. Being kind, sticking to their word, helping others, talks to you like a person rather than property meant to bow to them just for existing.

Edit: jeez, you parents get really triggered by child free young people!

Edit 2: I’ll say this once and I won’t be replying about it anymore. My parents are wonderful people that will have my respect until the end of my days because they EARNED it for not being bare minimum people. They’re kind and taught me what is was to command and give respect to those who worked for it.Little sex preference for y’all today. I almost never like it when my partner moans my name while we’re doin it. Throws me off my rhythm, and it feels really egocentric and also compels me to do the same for my partner, which I don’t like doing. I guess I get it, some people like feelin special or like worshipped bumpin’ uglies. Not for me at all tho.I just don't get it. I know that it's often well deserved, but if you are going to deprive someone of their life, it's not so far from killing them. An argument could be made that one can live up to it, but after 40 years of prison you're basically just the shell of a man.It’s just not that gross. Disliking the “moist” isn’t the quirky personality trait you think it is, and there’s certainly no need for a histrionic recoil like a damn anime reaction gif.My friend once got me super interested in American sweets, at some point he ordered a bunch for us to try and it was such a scary experience realizing just how sugary and utterly disgusting they are. 

Now I don’t want to offend anyone that enjoys them, but growing up with European sweets they’re just so much different. 

Some things I’ve tried are: 

Skittles, Pop Tarts, Reese’s, Twizzlers, Lucky Charms, Twinkies, and a few more that don’t come to mind. 

Absolute worse of all was the pop tarts, they don’t taste like food to me.For one thing, the studio versions of songs sound way better. Sure you get to see your favorite artist in person at a concert, but is it worth all the trouble? Figuring out when they’re in your city, getting the tickets (Overpriced), planning your activities during/around that day, being in that huge crowd of people, risking someone targeting you if you’re a woman, and likely getting a really bad hangover. No thank you, I’ll stay home.A couple of days ago I finally crumbled and installed an ad blocker to prevent YouTube ads from bombarding me non-stop.

Ever since I keep hearing the same thing, "Oh no, you're hurting content creators."

Really? Is it me hurting content creators? Or is it YouTube's greed? How long will people lick the boots of these charlatans?

YouTube started off with no ads, then slowly over the years they have conditioned everyone to believe that it's normal to see invasive ad banners, double unskippable ads, ads at the end of videos, ads in the middle of videos, ads for 10 second clips, ads if you switch apps and then switch back, ads if you accidentally click out of a video and click back into it, and now to make matters worse now they're even monetizing channels from creators who don't get a cut. That's right, they will now place ads on other people's content, take the revenue for themselves, and share none. "You don't qualify for partnership, but you qualify for us making money off of your work."

Enough is enough. I held out for as long as I could, but it's gotten absolutely absurd. This is what YouTube has created.

Should I have just bought YouTube Red and been done with it? No, I'm not falling for that and neither should anyone else. It's a classic case of "create a problem and sell the solution".

YouTube gained its popularity because it was free, open, and it was all about the user. They should change the name to ThemTube because it's not about you anymore, it's about them. About every way they can monetize every aspect of every corner of their app and website to squeeze out every last little penny they can from every person who comes into contact with them. It's completely unrecognizable from what it used to be.

I was literally jumping up and down, cheering in my house because I was so happy to have an ad free experience on YouTube (on my tv) for the first time in years. I didn't realize to what extent my experience had been diminished. 

Side Note: I whitelist small YouTubers I want to support or donate/join patreon, but millionaire YouTubers will be fine without my pennies of revenue.By hiding downvoted comments, it’s basically censoring people with an “unpopular opinion.” I understand some posts are plain stupid, offensive, or just spreading disinformation, but a lot of these comments mights just be people a different opinion.I've only tried a few types of things but I just lump it all together and avoid it all. I've seen people say similar things but still dabble in it here and there. I can't do that. It's all gross to me.

Edit: I'm so sorry that I stirred this particular pot. I can understand why so many people feel the need to comment on this "useless" "pointless" "not actually an opinion" post, but what I regret most is feeling this way. I apologize for not liking this sweet ambrosia and I will have my pallet amended at my earliest convenience.Last night I commented in a thread damning someone for espousing the old stereotype that “Mexicans are lazy”. Someone chimed in and said “Mexicans are some of the most hardworking people on the planet” which was massively upvoted. I responded by saying “careful with this, stereotypes are stereotypes whether they be positive or negative”. My comment was downvoted.

Here’s the thing: if you’re willing to accept any sort of blanket statement about a large group of people, you’re buying into a stereotype. Whether that stereotype makes the intended group of people look good or bad, it doesn’t matter. If you can say “all (x group)” or “most (x group)” are “good”, it stands to reason you could also make an assessment that most or all of x group are bad.

“Each and every man should be judged by his own merit” -Tony Soprano.Seriously, Metaverse sounds like it's just a virtual chatroom. Which is already a free game you can play.. it's called VR Chat. Like they have clubs and open mics in VR Chat.I’m not sure if it’s genuine or not, or newly genuine due to porn leading to societal norms, etc.. honestly I don’t care.


Point is “oh do me oh god omggggggod oh do me (daddy/dogg/mega-tentacle/stepsister/god, I dunno) is not attractive. It’s instead distracting and frustrating and even annoying if you have neighbors and live in a densely packed city.Before I go further I want to state I was a child when the books were still coming out before the series was complete and even went to the theaters to watch the movies since the first one. 

My main critique here comes from the films and the fans I’ve come across. 

Many fans of Harry Potter I’ve come across(not all) are very much like the extreme fans of Steven Universe. If anybody said anything even slightly negative or just not gushing praise for the series they were attacked or lectured why their opinions are wrong. That doesn’t even include the amount of fighting over couple pairings. I lost count of how many times I would see Potter fans lose it when another fan didn’t agree on their preferred couple. 

Harry Potter honestly doesn’t even feel like the main character in a series named after him. It should just be called Hermione and her cursed friend, guest starring Ron. Harry feels very much like a kid in class who doesn’t wanna be there and dumps all the work on Hermione. 

The usual line I hear in every film is “Hogwarts is not safe anymore”. Really? You mean the school with the dangerous Forrest that tries to kill anybody, along with the dangerous man eating monsters surrounding and inside the school, and filled with forbidden books where you can learn a million different ways to kill and torture people that students can easily read, isn’t safe now? Hell even the tree at the school is trying to kill the students. Voldemort feels very much like a Saturday kind of encounter.

All the wizard duels/fights are just different colored beams at each other. Is that really how creative these people can get with magic? Why not bring a tree to life to murder them, or cast a spell around the opponent to make the air into carbon dioxide? There’s just so much potential and it’s all just green vs red lightning beam fighting.

How in the hell is a muggle so different? They have literally the same anatomy, speak the same language, etc, yet there is a huge research and study branches of government on them? You have muggle wizards too, pretty dumb to act like they’re this big anomaly.

Also with all the crazy magic we can’t do simple interviews and forensics and see Sirius Black as innocent?

Quidditch is literally Griffindor vs Slytherin everytime and it always comes down to the snitch . Why even have other ways to get points when the snitch should be the focus as it’s the fastest and easiest way to win?

As a teen I didn’t even bother watching the last two movies until recently in my late twenties and I didn’t feel like I missed out on much.
It’s very annoying when I see some people say “Oh I like this, but their fanbase turned me away from it”. 

If supporters of someone or something made you quit on something, you either didn’t like it too much to begin or you’re just simply that weak minded.

A singers fanbase should not be the reason why you dislike a singer, because a singer cannot control all of the millions of fans they have worldwide. This applies to shows, sports teams etc.

You are a person capable of making your own decisions on whether YOU like, or dislike something. Besides, you’re not required to interact with these fanbases.It's just not for me.  It can be ok if not overdone, but some people make whole movie plots on nothing but cringe situations, like Meet the Fockers, Elf, etc..  which I find is lazy writing.

For me, when I watch a movie, I place myself in the main characters' shoes, so to have them go through embarrassing situations after embarrassing situations just takes away the joy of watching.I hear this all the time (mostly by those of ages 15-25) that “they don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks” or they don’t give a fuck in general in life. It seems the cultural zeitgeist has shifted in this direction where, the less fucks you give, the “cooler” you are. It becomes this status thing with people. It doesn’t make you cool or unique because its all talk and hardly anyone gives zero fucks about what people think. If you truly didn’t care, you wouldn’t be peacocking all over social media about it. It just shows everyone how much you DO care if you can’t stop talking about it. 

/end.rantJust think you wake up, eat, maybe work, eat, sleep. The same boring thing all day every day same meals same faces same environment. Slowly wasting away in a place that doesn’t want you, around people who hate you, in a society that wants to forget you ever existed. Your life is effectively over but your death is long and drawn out you most likely will never get to have privacy again.As the title says, just because food products are sourced locally doesn't mean it's good, it could be a state away and twice as great so I don't understand this obsession people have with asking "is it local". I understand supporting local business but most people ask to get a feel for the quality.Not only is Mustard less sweet than Ketchup, it simply tastes better.  It's sharper, and better on my palate.  But damn do people flip out when they see me eating fries with mustard.  You'd think I'd kicked a puppy off a bridge right in front of them with how mad some people get.  

I've tried lots of different mustards over the years, but as far as yellow mustard brands go, Plochmans has been my favorite.  Something about that yellow barrel brings out the memories of my gran, and it seeps into the salty crunchy flavor of fries just right.

Edit: some good brands have been suggested in the comments so far.  I will edit as they arise.  Also, you ketchup truthers are really funny, keep it coming.

They include: 

Plochmans (Chicago based brand)

Colmans (English based)

Tracklements (English based)

Zatarains creole mustard

Edit 2: Mayo Gang is out in force today.  Y'all can't eat an instrument.  Mustard Gang StrongThey look like their parents were inbred several times, which they probably were. The face looks like it got smashed in but stayed that way frozen in time. A prize pug is when it can take 6 fucking breaths in a row without choking on its own spit. It's also abusive to the dog because it has so many breathing problems from that fucked up face.This may or may not be unpopular, but I see it happen all the time since I manage a restaurant that shares a common area with a brewery. 

Grown ass adults having their young child’s birthday party at a brewery. Adults putting back 10% abv stouts, all but ignoring their ankle-biters and getting toasty while their children run around like they’re recreating Lord Of The Flies. Then they pile the crotch goblins into their midsize SUV’s and drive off home with a solid buzz.
In the past few years there has been so many talks for reboots of certain shows, live actions for iconic movies and musicals, movies being redone with different actors etc.

Honestly I just find it all so lazy, there are some exceptions like the ICarly reboot was actually pretty good. 

But, I just feel like the television industry should be making more shows & movies that can reach the amount of fame these shows and movies they’re trying to reboot have. 

It’s just a cheap and easy way out method to making money now, they capitalize off the name and just go out of their way instead of coming up with a fresh & original idea of their own. 

There aren’t nearly as many good television shows running as there used to be. Right now, our most popular show in television is Euphoria. 

I like Euphoria a lot but compare that to one of the most popular shows running a few years back like Breaking Bad. It’s just not as good right now. Hopefully we get more originals that can join Euphoria and achieve just as much popularity & more acclaim.You know the whole your/you're or their/there. I have seen many getting offended for being corrected. However I find it quite thoughtful? This goes for grammar too. It's almost like saving from future embarrassment. 
Ok maybe during arguments it can seem annoying but otherwise it's a very nice thing to do.
 It's momentarily embarrassing but only in front of them. I still don't understand why do people find it annoying being corrected. I will still correct people and it's upto them if they correct themselves or just lash out at me lol.I’m always baffled that hotel pillows are too soft to sleep, nobody has those pillows at home, a great pillow should be firm and support your neck and lower head, otherwise you’ll have trouble sleeping and ended up have a sore neck or headache the next morning.

We can see hotels are trying to introduce softer and more comfortable mattresses, beddings, yet they don’t change the style of pillows, and it really bothers me.

Wonder if anyone feels the same? ;-)Small children don’t care if you’re their relation (aunt, uncle, cousin …) they care about people who show up. A kind neighbor will have a bigger place in a child’s heart if they are interested and welcoming and regularly around. A relation can’t show up after months and months away and expect a small child to play with them just because ‘I’m their aunt/uncle/cousin…’ A place in a child’s heart is earned, not owed.you can be honest without just plainly insulting someone. Here are some examples:

Instead of: Your dress is so ugly"

Use: "In my opinion, I don't think that dress looks great, maybe choose this one instead.

and

Instead of:" you're so stupid"

Use: "I don't think that's correct"

Do you see the difference?

Edit: ok yeah I do agree my examples do seem a bit coddling, so I'm gonna change it now. Also stfu about the fucking you're thing. And I do understand dark humor. Just don't like people insulting me for no reason

Instead of: your dress is ugly

use: I don't really like that dress

instead of: you're stupid

use: That's wrong, this isn't wrong

Edit 2: It seems like you guys are much more focused on how I spelled you're in a Reddit post than about the actual fucking post. I made it "your" cuz frankly I didn't think anyone would care and I wanted to type faster. and I'm not saying being brutally honest is the same as being a dick. I am saying people sometimes excuse their shitty behavior by being brutally honest.

Edit 3: I'm sorry if I seemed butthurt so I fixed the spellingPeople that die of cancer don't die because they were weaker. I understand how it feels like an achievement on a personal level but the idea that everyone is fighting the same battle and somehow only the strong survive, dishonours those who don't make it.Yes, I know it has been romanticized throughout the decades, I know it means someone loves you enough to give you a comfy breakfast experience but  man... I can't function properly in the morning unless I go brush my teeth and wash my face.
In the morning my breath is stinky, my mouth is dry, I can't see properly and my face is puffy. And I'm supposed to eat at the exact same moment I wake up? Hell nah.
I need to stand up and move around in the morning, if I start my meal in bed, I might just stay in bed for the rest of the day, cus it will probably make me feel sleepy again.I honestly believe that the spirit of the Olympics has died.  The days of wholeheartedly believing in the purity of sport is gone for me. I see the corruption of countries doing whatever they can for Olympic glory. Big business hawking everything imaginable with Olympians as spokespeople and slapping the Olympic rings on  whatever they can to make a buck.  The IOC is just a sham with coddling to outside influence,  back room wheeling and dealing which has been well documented over the years  I'm all for celebrating the accomplishments of these incredible athletes from all over the world. They deserve it but lose the Olympic venue.  Athletes spend their lives honing these skills and to see some lose due to doping, corrupt judging or whatever unsportsmanlike things they can get away.  It has to be  heartbreaking for some of these athletes. It's obvious why, since getting a gold almost guarantees a pay day.  I just can't pretend that the Olympics are anything but big business and outside interests corrupting the spirit in which the games began . On the backs of inspirational athletes who did it all for the love of sport.  Just my rant take it or leave it ✌People should stop forcing me to be with others. I enjoy being alone. No, I'm not talking about in groupwork/stuff that is required for me to talk to others, I'm talking about break times. 

A lot of people prefer being alone, including me. Asking if someone wants to hang out with you isn't bad, but continuously asking them or physically dragging them over to your other friends is. I don't want to be with people. Just let me be. I'm an introvert. 

Being alone can be calming, especially for introverts. They don't find it upsetting a bunch of the time. Some people enjoy the solitary. 

Please stop forcing me to hang out with others. I want to be alone.There are a lot os socio-economic variables that take effect constantly in the case a person wants to get out of poverty. Don't get me wrong it's possible but not as easy as is preached. 

Many low income families have the dream of getting a small business and scale a little bit in the social ladder, this is until their fridge stops working and have to spend a chunk of their monthly income to repair/buy another one. Just in In 2019, the failure rate of startups was around 90% and people continue to try that MLM or Pyramid Scheme and reject a secure 9-5 job saying that they deserve better without knowing all the work they need  to put ahead of actually having what they want.


In my humble opinion this mindset is not only wrong, it's polisón and recipe for depression and misery. We are told since very young that we can be anything!. But what happens when you don't achieve what you were aiming for? 

Is there something wrong with me?
What mistake could possibly be preventing me from achieving that goal? 

We get too carried away thinking about what we want and forget that we need to give something in return. Failure is common but experience will get you far.

Someone who wakes up at 6am to go to work every day is not lazy.Wearing socks is super comfortable, wearing sandals is super comfortable, wearing both feels great.  Honestly why such an aversion to the combination of them if it feels good?You get insight to the sport and top notch commentary, you can get drunk as fuck for 90 percent cheaper and you wake up in your own house, if the event sucks you can just turn it off and dont have to go anywhere.This is coming from someone who is polyamorous. I fucking HATE the word "throuple" because it sounds really stupid and like you're desperately trying to fit into a heteronormative mold.

Like, I get we can't really say we're couples, because "couple" means two, but why can't we use an actual term like "trio", "triple", or "triad"? 

Or hell, we could even say we're in a TRIUMVIRATE, which is both cool and really funny, but NOOOO, we have to mush the words "three" and "couple" together into a big, stupid mess of a word.One of my favorite shows that aired on cartoon network was the Looney tunes show. I personally found it Hilarious and comedy gold . I know it was kind of weird being set in the suburbs but i loved it and found it to be criminally underrated. The characters were great and the stories were funny. Anyone else watch the show and agree with me"Warning: low battery" never mind, I'll kepp jamming 😙🎵 "Warning: low battery" yep I get it, still gonna enjoy the last bits "Warning: low battery" hmm I guess this was the last one before it turns off. Ouh drop incoming! "Warning: low battery" "Warning: low battery""Warning: low battery""Warning: low battery"

Imagine this for 15min. Yes still 15min left of music and you waste half of it on "Warning: low battery"
I'd rather have an abrupt music stop than "Warning: low battery".I know that some companies like YouTube over do it, but if done correctly it is the reason why we have free internet services. I don’t think they are bad, only the data collection part is messed up.No matter what wine I’ve tried or smelled it’s just awful, everyone always drinks it at functions or with dinner, I don’t know why- they all taste horrendous and smell foul.The yellow Starburst is one of of the best flavors. And idk why the pink one is hyped so much. My tier list of the four original flavors would be red, yellow, orange, then pink (if I have to include it🙄).I just don't see how someone would want them in their house. They have poor stamina, cannot breath well, have smashed disformed faces.

This is not to mention that they drool EVERYWHERE. There are so many far better breeds to choose from.

Edit: ditto for pugsI am fed up with gamers who "Did THIS fo X hours!" or "Did THAT for X hours". These people spend endless hours getting that one item or just show their endurance. Many people cheer these guys (or girls) as heroes. 

In reality, they just spend excessive and most likely unhealthy amount of time in front of a screen. Even though they do it just for attention, they also give a wrong role model of what video gaming should be.

As a person who has a family, full-time job and other hobbies, it just creates this pressure, that I am not good enough when I don't play as much. I really want that casual gaming would be promoted more.I can’t open Facebook, nextdoor, or Instagram without someone asking for money— for pet medication, a trip to see family, rent, or for something as absurd as special wedding shoes🤦🏾‍♀️
I’ve been a little desensitized by the sob stories because I feel like some people are monetizing their grief when they can research what govt or non profit aid is available for them first instead of begging peers and strangers.
I feel bad for being cold, but I just feel weird at the lack of accountability—it’s cringe but that’s how I feel lately.I'm tired of people saying the hunger games movies were good. They were not. They were terrible. When I first read the books, I saw the massive appeal. I thought they were great. When it was announced that a movie was coming out, I was excited. When I watched the first movie in theaters, I walked out before it ended. It was awful. It's like they took the books and just took a big shit on it. They took out or changed everything that was actually good about the books. The books are so graphic sometimes that they should've made the films much grittier and rated R, but no. The Hunger Games could've been as massive as the Harry Potter franchise in my opinion, if they just did the fucking films right, but they just shat on it. Everyone I talk to about this though, absolutely loves the films. Like...what? Did we even watch the same movie? I just can't.I have always been blown away by the sheer number of different types of salad dressings that are out there. I am the type of person that doesn't like condiments and/or salad dressings. I eat salad but just have it .... dry? I think partly with salad dressings, I don't get why you take something almost completely healthy and dump so many calories on it. Sure there are lite dressings but why even bother?I can’t see the future I want being reached in the US. I say this as a college grad, furthermore as someone raised in a highly wealthy community.

I’ll admit, I spent my initial years post-college in addiction (blaming Purdue pharma & lobbyists aside my point). Blame myself. However, starting from nothing with a good education, good connections, leading a good career for 6-7 years. I’m still so far from goals.

Finally repaired credit, built savings, but now my goal of 2022 home purchase is far gone.

I work hard, earn decent income, but seems all the effort is washed out.

Admittedly, I had good family, great  education. Addiction related decisions are on me but, in hindsight, are they? Or was it greed that killed most my friends and left me starting from homelessness at 30 years old

5 years busting ass to repair life and I’m no better financially, besides savings that dwindles with inflation

I don’t see any other way to leave the US for something/anything betterSimply put, you are saying that compared to other people their age, they are on the higher end of the attractiveness spectrum. Of course if we considered them relative to people of all ages then they'd just be average or even below average looking. It's just logical in my opinion.In fact, if they looked the exact same way, but were 19 then no one would say they look good. So their attractiveness is in fact conditional.I think the flavours of hazelnut, almond and others marry very nicely with coffee. The syrups they use are far sweeter than they are flavourful. By the time it actually tastes nicely of whatever, the sugar has already drowned out the coffee flavour and it just tastes of syrup.

Lattes aren’t the strongest as it is, but milk and coffee are nice together and it works, but adding another flavour to that just makes it taste like hot sweet milk.It was reported recently that the cause of death for Saget was from hitting his head. So it led everybody to conclude something like maybe slipping in the shower and then not thinking a lot of it went to sleep. But I'm reading the New York Times article on it and it states the opinion of medical experts that his injuries are what you would expect from somebody who took a baseball bat to the Head several times, fell from 20 or 30 ft or was injured in a car accident. It states that there were fractures to thick parts of his skull including the bones in the roof of the eye socket and all the way around from the back, the right side and front of his skull- which are not really consistent with head injuries from falls. 

Something about this just doesn't add up.I think people are way too quick to judge. There is nothing wrong with doubting someone you like. I know a few people who first appeared as the most sensitive and selfless people. But the more I got to know them the more I started to realize that they were just hiding their toxic traits.

If you are being direct about your feelings for a person the easier it is for her/him to take control of you. Maybe it is worth it, but it's not toxic to act hard to get if you want a better picture of the other person.So, I used to use those plastic bags they used to give you at the grocery store for things like pet waste, and small trash can liners. They also use these small plastic bags at the animal shelter I volunteer at for pet waste. Well what happens when they ban these bags is sale of small, 4 gallon bags, increases by 120%. These sold bags are also thicker then the ones they give out. Paper bags are terrible for greenhouse emissions. Cloth bags need to be used between 130-20,000 times more than a plastic bag to make it better for the environment. Not saying we should do nothing, because plastic floating around for eons isn't the answer. But perhaps something like giving out biodegradable plastic bags would be a better solution than what is currently happening, which is switching to paper and cloth bags.mr beast reacts is there for ad revenue, making my overall liking to mr beast down. the react videos are opposite to normal ones where they steal the videos, they talk too much that is too unnecessaryI see so many people jumping to conclusions based on the story that’s written out in the post. If anyone has ever experienced relationship problems, they will know that there is never only one side to the story; unless there are seriously major problems, such as beating, rape, coercive control etc. And yet, even these terms can sometimes be used in the wrong way.Thr number of mentally unstable people doing outrageous things that triggers everyone to pile on without any sympathy to potential mental health issues is way to high.

Many of these people need counseling and probably medications. Many Redditors would want that for those who fit their definition of "needing help" but when it doesn't fit their view of who should be offered compassion they just pile on the hate train.The general consensus within the snow sport community seems to be that “snowboarding is much harder than skiing”. As someone who has done both, I am here to prove that wrong. 

It literally took me a week to be as good as the average snowboarder. Sure, the first day learning it was tough, but after that it was just heel and toe carving. I got that down, and bam, I can snowboard. Same with my friend, he started skiing, skied for a few years, never got good, then picked up a snowboard. Within the first week he was carving, hitting jumps, spines, and even a rail. 

And don’t even get me started on terrain parks. Holy cow, the difference is massive. I could practically hit jumps on a snowboard in my sleep. On the other hand, jumps on skis feel awkward and difficult. 

This seems to be the same for everyone too. In fact I rarely see new snowboarders on the mountain, but always see new skiers. I think that shows something.

Overall, snowboarding is far easier than skiing is and. I’m tired of people pretending it’s not.It's alright. I don't understand why people get so stoked about it. It gets put on literally everything. Burgers, fries, salads, scallops wrapped in bacon, bacon dipped in chocolate. Bacon flavored vodka? 🤢. It's just a greasy strip of salt.It might be shocking but the first step to having a girlfriend is to talk to woman. It’s not hard. Be clear that u want a relationship with her, flirt a little, compliment her, and for the love of god don’t send a picture of penis, and don’t ask for any pictures either. Maybe me along with every single other dude I know that actually tries is jus lucky but from my experience it’s cuz u don’t tryI'm pregnant with my second and so I frequent subs like baby bumps and it just amazes me how much people complain about how their gift registries are ignored or they aren't getting their dream baby shower. 

I never had one with my first and won't with my second (getting kinda late now as due in a month).  The family aren't unsupportive but I didn't expect anything off any of them.  I purchased everything myself for my first and when people asked if I needed anything there wasn't anything I could particularly think of.  I think in the end my family just sent over money for when my first was older or purchased clothes whilst my inlaws purchased a mamaroo (total fail with our first but his cousin loved it) and an extra car seat for my partner's car so we wouldn't have to keep moving the car seat between cars but we would have gotten a second eventually ourselves anyway. I didn't want or particularly care for a baby shower and I only kept a registry to remind myself of things I was thinking about but unsure of. At the end of the day it was mine and my partner's choice to procreate and nobody else is financially responsible for our offspring and it comes across as entitled to expect others to follow your registry or throw you a baby shower.I know a ton of posts on this sub are actually semi popular posts and constantly get critiqued for being such. However, I hope this opinion is unpopular. To me, the concept of a super bowl ad is ridiculous. Like what is specical about them over then being more over the top, having more celebrities and bigger budget than usual. It's just ridiculous. Hell there are teaser trailers like actual movies! Only that it's a potato chip or soda commercial. Sure some are special, but 90% of them are nothing special. Just companies trying to outdo each other with their air time.i’m sure you’ve talked to friends about someone you might fancy, and they’ll say “you should just go for it! you might be surprised!” no. you wont. this narrative above all pisses me off because it’s a good way to get really hurt. if you mindlessly believe the “just go for it” sentiment you will get ripped apart. in my experience, people are cruel. vulnerability is only flattering to some, and when i’ve opened up, i’ve just been lacerated. girls have laughed in my face, and will immediately go tell their friends how this loser tried to ask them out. i feel as though you need to be 100% in your feelings for someone in order to confess, because otherwise you’ll get laughed at, spit on, and throw out to the curb.Everybody keeps saying "cook for yourself when you are in a relationship" or some shit like that, it works in some cases but I think in most cases it's just so romantic.

I have been cooking for my ex-boyfriend(Even though he was older than me by like 3 years) and it was just so lovely. He was completely clueless about it and it didn't bother me, he liked my cooking most of the time.

Now, does this mean everybody shouldn't learn how to cook? No, everybody has to learn to be independent in some way but sometimes you should try relax and let your partner do it just for once or maybe you do it yourself for them. Taking care of somebody who you love makes one feel really good, at least for me.

This is it, this is my unpopular opinion.

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot "is" in the title.I recently went to a restaurant where there were no cashiers and all ordering and payment was done with Apple Pay on a screen, and I felt like I really lived in the future. I could've never imagined that there'd be a time a phone could pay a non-existent person. However, I thought how much it could help the worker. When I worked customer service, I hated engaging with customers and having to rotate between different job functions. I'd rather just have my one solitary function and keep it moving. Without cashiers the consumer can do things faster and without complaints and keeps the Karens away. I feel like a certain level of automation can prevent burnout in people who get worn out with human contact and the consumer who just wants to get things done as soon as possible.Every time there is something wrong with the food someone else cooked, I always speak up and tell them there is something wrong with it. Too salty, Too sweet, Etc. But sometimes people get really  mad about it. Why? It's like you can't be honest and have your own opinion. It's not like you are trying to be mean on purpose. There is simply something wrong with the food. They either messed up or missed an Ingredient, cooked it too long or too little. They always get their feelings hurt. It's the worst when people say the food is good when everyone at the table clearly knows something is wrong with the food.More often than not, if you correct someone they will get offended. If someone is wrong then it is good to let them know they are incorrect.

People should not be,

"You don't have to be rude, I was just saying."

People should be,

"I was wrong, thank you for letting me know."

This is especially true if they are spreading misinformation. You don't want other people to be called out for this one mistake, so you help preventing it by correcting someone. Most people in today's world will just be upset if someone tells them they are wrong. As long as you're not rude when correcting, it should be no big deal.

If you say,

"Oh, actually it's *correction*."

Then it should be fine.

If you say,

"No, you idiot. It's *correction*, stupid."

Then, I can see why people are offended and where confusion ensues.

Edit : SpellingWe want to believe that everyone is born tabula rasa, but it's not true.

If you pay attention to the life stories of murderers, sometimes they reveal that they started having fantasies of murder as small children.

I remember once on reddit there was a post made by a woman who confessed that she's always had fantasies of indiscriminately killing people, and nothing messed up happened in her life that made her that way. It was her natural state of being.

And there were other people in the thread who said they feel the same way.

Human behavior has a hereditary component, and there are people out there who are natural bullies, naturally enjoy the idea of hurting others, and even committing heinous crimes.

If you're reading this and you have these traits, I don't think you should be hated by society. As long as you don't act on your desires, you shouldn't be condemned for the way you were born.Sorry purists, but almost all veggies are better raw. People be trying to cook onions, carrots, broccoli, greens (kale, arugula) and other veggies stuff and it is definitively gross. It sucks the life out of it.

 Raw is the way to veggie it up. 

P.s. I should eat healthier.Just like in the title. I can't understand why Hollywood and Sony pushes him to everywhere. He is also worst Peter Parker compared to other.  Is he a phenomenon I don't understand?There I said it. I know tons of people loooove shonda rhimes shit but the truth is that she sucks. Her writing is the most unsophisticated sugary sugar bullshit pedaled on modern television, and what's worse is others have now copied her style. No one else can make quite the syrup bullshit-art that she does though. It's like she took Joss Whendon as a basis and made it ineffectual and rounded all the sharp edges and made it stupid. Lead characters are in powerful successful positions but do unbelievable things and say stupid goofy shit and never impress. There's no bite or wit anywhere to be found - everyone and everything is just oh so nicey nice-ies. The music is always this slow bloom encouraging 'route for the happy idiot underdog.' Characters are one dimensional simplifications of real life, pre chewed and fed to the audience through a god damn feeding tube. "This is what you should think right now." It's like someone teletuby-ized drama - it's pure kitsch. I hate it so much.I understand that it is the service business but everything about getting a drink in at a bar is inconvenient.  You have to stand at the bar, flag down a bartender, stand there and wait for them to make your drink and lastly wait for your tab.  Very different than having a sit down food service, hair or nails done.When basketball started the average height of a player was X (WAY shorter than now), players nowadays are so freakin tall that slam dunks are a mere hop.. Why hasn’t an adjustment been made by now..I hold the belief that people choose to let themselves be affected by mean or hateful speech. People need to learn how to excercise the power of indifference and walking away. 

This is something anyone can move towards. And if you break it down: someone says something that offends you > you feel a tinge > then you can either hold on to it, or say fuck that guy and get over it. 

There is no point in trying to authoritate what people say to/about you, and words are just words. They arent tangible and you can choose to let them sink in or not.


Edit: at this point I think it is important to clarify that I am not referring to victims of REAL abuse. But I am definitely referring to more than just "a stranger said something mean to me". There is a whole spectrum of human interaction. I am referring to most situations, but not abuse victims.Maybe I'm just an asshole, but it always bothers me when people working service jobs ask me things like "how's your weekend?" "Got any big plans?" Or otherwise try to make small talk with me. It's not that I don't appreciate human interaction, it's just that small talk between me and some person who's being paid to serve me always feels disingenuous. 
I'm a server myself, and I make it a point to be very polite but not ask questions to the customer I'm helping that aren't relevant to what they're there for. I feel like it's also more polite for me to just mind my own business and do my job rather than put on an obviously fake persona for someone. For me, I've found that most people just want to get in and out anyway so it helps to be expedient.

Edit: Being polite is perfectly fine. Forcing small talk is notThat shit dangerous. I am not saying it’s as bad as  wingsuit flying or BASE jumping, but it sends thousands of people to hospital each year. The only accidents that involves breaking bones in sports in my social circle is either biking in winter or skiing. My friend broke his leg skiing and half of his unit is winter sports related bone injuries. A lot of people and even managements, I feel, are underestimating how dangerous it is. It is not something you go about like playing half court basketball, it is something you need to be mentally and physically prepared like skydiving.I’ve seen people in pet communities post some dumb shit like “ outside = bad 🤫 “ like I get it, you don’t want your bunny to be killed by the vulture out on your patio and maybe your community is invested with coyotes. 

However, if your community isn’t facing any of these problems then it’s hypocritical to criticize zoos while forcing your cat to stay inside all day everyday. Animals are animals, they are not stuffed toys to cuddle with all day. Some may not be interested but as soon as they step foot outside their whole world will change.  

If you let a kitten explore the outside by himself he will learnt to adapt and defend himself. I’m talking from experience. It’s been 5 years and he’s still doing that shit. I particularly think walking cats in a leash is stupid. They’re independent just let them learn!

I do not understand people that shelter their animals. We are all going to die eventually and so will they, so why strip them of their freedom of exploring the outside world ?

Through out history humans were willing to die to feel freedom. I think pets dying as a result of being outside die alot more happy being themselves than dying of old age in a house they never left. No article from google will change that.I have been in treatment for over 20 years. Tried every antidepressant including a few antipsychotics. They either only helped a bit or didnt help at all. Its rare to see a person with depression suddenly felt a lot better by just taking some pills. This is what you call a modern medicine? Its ineffective medicine if you ask me.Getting shitfaced is a dumb idea when you’ve spent $200+ on tickets to an artist I presume you like and want to enjoy in concert.
Also it can be very disruptive to people around you if you’re an obnoxious drunk. 
I’m all for the fun time alcohol + live music can provide. But I’ve been to shows where people show up absolutely hammered before it even starts. Why aren’t you just at a bar?Of course people love suck ups! Just don't make it too obvious that it's fake. Everyone loves attention and consideration from others. It WILL help you at school with teachers, it WILL help you at work as well. 

It often helps with dates too. Literally the only way it backfires is if you're too obvious about it. If people feel it's fake then they feel as if you're patronizing them. But do it well? Reap all the benefits.

Hell, some people do it just on instinct if it's "laugh at your bosses bad joke" or laugh at a potential partner's bad joke. We don't even consider that sucking up in most cases, but it absolutely is.I like songs that were released in the 2000s to 2010. There are very few new songs and artists that I really like.

 But people look at me like I'm some prehistoric animal every time they ask me what songs I like.I still stand by one of my more prominent opinions about social media and how it amazes me how people have honestly bought into social media with what it can do. When, everything you could do *now* is no different than what you could've done in 2007. You just merely had to take an extra couple steps to do it.

It's not a matter of old generation yells at cloud, because it's fact. In 2007, you could already upload videos but people treat TikTok like as if it's the only place. Facebook existed then.

There is absolutely no way for it to be any easier to contact your friends and family, much as social media sites proclaim to do so today. That's just marketing jangle now. Because, E-Mail made it easier so what's better than E-Mail? Instant Messaging in real time, great. What's better than Instant Messaging? Instant Messaging on the go in the age of mobile phones.

I mean, that's the peak. It cannot get any easier than that. Social Media sites today remind me of Web Portals in the 90s of internet. Where they served as a one-stop visit to their site. MSN, Yahoo, AOL .etc served as web portals that offered you e-mail services, games to play, news to see, take bets in sporting, keep track of the stock exchange, watch video clips .etc they tried doing it all.

Does anyone honestly think this Metaverse thing is going to make any of it easier? The only way I can think of that will make getting in touch with family and friends easier, is holograms. Like the ones in Star Trek and Star Wars of people coming up from communication pods. But we probably will not see technology like that in probably a few lifetimes and currently we'll be dead before we ever see it.

It just astounds me at times, the stretches of claim social media goes to say how it's making communication easier. Everything we could already do is just recycled, reworded and re-pitched to be treated like it's new. That's Social Media in a nutshell.For clarification. This applies to video games for my experience, but this could apply to any game with house rules that end up becoming standardized. 

If a developer makes a game where you can punch with two different buttons, but the people who run a specific tournament group ban one of those buttons because of it not being "in the competitive spirit". I am of the opinion that the people making those house rules are against the spirit of the game. Kinda like Free Parking being a donation pile in Monopoly. In the actual game that's not a rule set, but I know so many people who played by that rule that I was like 15-16 before I read the rules and was shocked it wasn't in the rulebook. 

There's probably dozens of other examples I could name but it basically boils down to, just because a group of people agree that a certain thing is a rule, doesn't make it the best rules out there. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and opinions.Their speakers always seem to be set so loud that you can't have a decent conversation without feeling like you're yelling, and that doesn't help their sound either. Which usually isn't great to begin with. To make things worse, where i live its literally always country music.You always feel better after you've had a good cry. I personally am hypersensitive, and as such, I bottle up a LOT of emotions every day. I'm convinced if I let go of my boundaries, I'd actually cry every day.
But sometimes, it gets heavy to keep it all in. In such cases, I find it better to, in contrary, remind myself of everything that hurt me this week, and cry it all out, and once I'm done, I remember everything beautiful that happened as well.
That's my way of taking care of myself.Dave Mustaines song writing, Marty Friedman’s/Kiki Loureiro’s impeccable guitar skill and their overall sound demolishes any song Metallica ever released. I love Metallica but give Rust In Peace a proper listen and I’m sure anyone will understand why they’re the superior band.It seems like most people want to be seated immediately, order as soon as they get to the table, have the food in minutes and have the check and a doggy bag before they are done eating. 

Please just let me come in, have a drink at the bar. Then sit down, let me read the menu at my leisure, order when I'm ready, not when the waiter is breathing down my neck. Sip a cocktail while I wait for a starter. Give me time to eat my appetizer and let me rest after it's finished. Give my food as long as it needs to have to cook properly, it I wanted to have quickly reheated food I could eat at home. Give me time for conversation, offer dessert, offer coffee. I want my dining out to be an experience, not a means to an end before I run off somewhere else. 

Tl;Dr I'd like to have enough time between service at a restaurant to wonder when the the waiter will be back, not have service so quick that I'm rushed to leave.Every movement we take is defined by cars. Walk 2min? Cross streets ONLY at the crosswalk. Visit a friend 0.5mi away? Drive or endangeer yourself by crossing a 6 lane road. Cars are seen as an American value but they have gutted our cities. Cars are bad for the environment and awful for humans living anywhere near their prevalence. I don't own a car anymore but a lot of my life is influenced by cars and crossing their "space". I'm a human and I think I should be able to walk a few minutes to the nearby shops and not need to deal with high speed vehicles.As long as you simplify it and remove certain elements it's not only a thing where you can apply info instead of memorizing it (unlike the educational system) but it can also be fun, have different rules for different math classes (division, percents, addition, etc etc) but it can also introduce them to the concept of tabletop gamingmost people complain about the fatalities being more boring than previous entries, but I don't know  
what people expected for a teen rated game plus I personally likes the quick timed combat it was refreshing after several identical games in the mortal Kombat series, I think the free-falling feature should be brought back in mortal Kombat people also shouldn't look at the game like its mortal Kombat 8 the gimmicks are what makes the game stand outHealthy people can climb stairs. It’s not difficult. It’s usually faster than waiting for an elevator. Using an elevator to go up a few flights of stairs is just laziness. 

Elevators aren’t for laziness. They’re for accessibility.I like subway because you get to watch the process of your meal being created and the fact that you don’t have to wait so long for everything. Most time I’ve spent waiting for my sub was about 45 seconds. Also the hearty Italian bread is to die for. The cookies are perfect. The only fast food establishment that I like more is five guys but I’ve only been there onceEspecially if it’s some random acquaintance. Like what gives you the right? (How can she slap?) Everyone else just nods and smiles with encouragement. To me it’s horrifying - it makes me want to swallow a carton of cigarettes.When it comes to reading, I'm not a huge fan. I don't like to read out loud to groups of people (except maybe children), let alone silently. As a boy, my whole family urged me to read more as they urged me to go to college. I always shied away from reading until I was a high school junior. I had to deal with it since I was bound to take the ACT that year. My English 11 teacher said that the ACT was biased towards reading; it was a reading test more than anything else. My parents had me read about boys and girls I could relate to in preparation for the ACT. I hesitated at first, but it was pretty good; it was okay.

During my high school senior year, my English 12 teacher proclaimed that I would always be a better writer than I am a reader. She read my essays which were written surprisingly well, and I often got positive feedback. However, I didn't do great on reading quizzes or in-class discussions about books.  

In my spare time whenever I am not working, walking, cooking, or on the computer, I choose writing over reading. It just comes easier to me.Over the past years I've felt like people on the internet have gotten less aware about things like satire, I hear a lot of people saying that it's because text can't convey messages as well as in person, but I find that to be BS. I think a lot of arguments and controversies start because of people joking through text and a large group not being able to understand that, I think this mostly happens on places like TikTok and even Reddit itself, I may be over exaggerating the level of unawareness but I honestly think this is way too prevalent nowadays.Plates are cold, then you have to pick if you want if you want a dinner plate or a bowl, then it breaks when it falls or in the sink.. it's heavy

Plastic container eliminates all of these negatives. It's light, it's already a bowl, you can put a lid on it..  
It just makes sense.Yes the og is amazing, and the dark chocolate is pretty freaking good too. But HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS have you tried the coconut flavor? It's toasty, it's nutty, it's sweet and savory and creamy. GOOD LORD it's so good.

Edit: it's Raffaello, probably because it's a work of artPeople say it so often about celebrities, and I've even heard it said to real people. It's literally saying "Yeah you look great for someone most people find unattractive!!" I don't even think the people that say it realize it's an insult, but we definitely need to change our language.The title says it all. Showering with all the lights off and where you can't see anything is so comforting and relaxing. I just woke up, the last thing I want is light, so I turn the lights off. It is THE best way to shower.Let’s be honest everyone, the average college girl is picking the jock type over the beer belly everyday of the week (in most cases). Dad bods work great on some mom bods, and every now and then you might strike gold. But the average girl is going for the hot hunk.
Edit: talking about hook ups and one night staysYou know that feeling when your sweater just didn’t get dried enough, and so it’s still kinda damp. Best time to put it on. Plus, you get to feel it slowly dry while you’re wearing it, which is kind of a nice feeling.

Edit: stop giving me awards. I want to hear your boos. They fuel meI enjoy my life having no friends because i'm free to do what I want. I don't need to talk to somebody else about my life because i'm too focused on living it. 

&#x200B;

I'm doing gym, creatives DIY, videogames, i dance to the sound of music, I spend some time with my family and i have enough social life at my work. I don't need friends because i don't feel the need for it. 

&#x200B;

Why is that so weird for people to accept that you can be happy without friends? 

&#x200B;

Plus when i see most people hanging out with their friends and spending like 80% of the conversation looking at their phone, i'm like "why do you even hang out together? You are just looking at your phones". 

&#x200B;

I don't have friends because most people around me are too absorbed by social medias and the conversations subjects are always about some memes, some random pictures or videos from tik tok and i'm like "Can't you have something more interesting to share than just some cringe internet video?"

&#x200B;

It's a waste of time trying to talk with someone who is looking at his phone while you are talking to him. I'd rather talk to my mirror and speak to myself about my problems and dealing with them alone because i know that people doesn't care about me and i'm fine with it. 

&#x200B;

I mean, friends are good but :  the day when you have a problem, there will be no one to help you and look at you. 

&#x200B;

Last reason, i want to be free. I don't like to be "forced" to hang out because we are friends and we should see each other everyday or so.  

&#x200B;

Everyone is talking about their problems but the truth is that no ones care about your problems, no one except your family. Friends are only there for the best parts, you'll have to handle the negatives tides alone. 

&#x200B;

The only reason I would like to have a friend is to play with him and have fun together. I enjoyed having friends when i was younger because we weren't so absorbed in our phones and the time we shared was quality time. Now i don't see the matter of having friends since most of the time you share isn't quality time.I enjoyed the movie but when I heard the song, it just went along with the movie. It didn’t stand out. I didn’t rewind it to hear it again. I think the song mirabel sang about everyone’s powers is better although I didn’t particularly like any song enough. I understand frozen song being a hit because I thought it was beautiful but I don’t really understand WDTAB topping the charts. It’s an my unpopular opinion anyway lolYou will admittedly get the occasional singular gummy that tastes good on its own, but for the most part, they only taste good when your eating multiple at a time. It's like TicTacs, for the most part, they don't really taste of anything on its own.people don’t understand their words DEEPLY affect others. I understand it’s the internet and people will talk their shit, but it’s like sometimes it’s better to silently judge than ruin someone’s perception of themselves.


edit: it’s confusing so let me give an example…

let’s say i have a crooked teeth, but there are pieces of food stuck between them…it’s better to tell me about the food between my teeth because that can be fixed under 10 mins than tell me my teeth are crooked < shitty example, but hopefully you get it.as I'm watching the flash (season 3), I can't help but feel so frustrated as how bad the writing is. so many fillers. so many unnecessary plot points. if the flash can literally travel thru time, he would be unstoppable.

I mean yes I get it. money. keep the viewers engaged. capitalism. but u know what, fuck you. super heroes was suppose to teach kid to stand up for them self and fight their bullies. 

nowadays, it's all about "not killing" and making peace with your enemy. 90% of all problems today can be solved with violence.Dr. Squatch soap, Purpose mattress, State Farm insurance, luxury skin care products, etc. You name it.

\- A solid product usually speaks for itself, especially in the age of social media. Excessive marketing either means the product is overpriced or has mediocre quality (e.g. doesn't stand out from competitors without loads of marketing).

\- A good portion of premium you pay goes into advertising expense, not because the product has superior quality or expensive ingredients that other similar competitor products don't offer.

Edit:
1. Not against the concept of marketing at all. It's a brilliant and necessary tool if/when used appropriately. It's the "excessive" marketing that leads to questionable doubts.
2. Mediocre products don't mean trash at all. Dr. Squatch and Purple are decent quality products, just at a higher premium.
3. "Most likely" is the key phrase here. Obviously not "all" over advertised products are expensive and mediocre.Vinegar fucking sucks. Anytime I taste it, my face recoils, and it can't be any worse. It is like taking lemon juice and making it salty, which tastes absolutely gross to me. I don't know why, everyone I know seems to like or even crave the taste of vinegar.Sandwiches (or subs mostly) just have a distinct good taste when they have been sitting out for 6 or so hours. A
Oldish mayo on a sub bread create a distinct taste. I know there's a risk to earing mayo sitting out, but what are the odds reall? And I mean mostly sandwiches that are "cold cut" based. Italian like sandwiches. And if the bread is untoasted it gets a nice natural toastiness from stateless. And the cheese kind of half melts into the meat and bread from sitting out.Rum and raisin is a perfectly acceptable and thoroughly tasty ice cream flavour.  

PROVIDED THAT the concentration of rum flavour is strong enough and the ice 'cream' itself is not watery.Smash burgers have become a major trend with restaurants. They use much less meat and pile on additional, low-cost ingredients with deceptively pretentious names (fire-grilled, grass-fed Angus beef on a toasted brioche bun, topped with heirloom tomatoes, butter lettuce, tomato jam, smashed mustard seed and pickled cucumber) to create the artifice of "gourmet" hamburgers.There are so many things that can go wrong when ice skating but everyone goes about it like it's nothing. For some reason no one wears protective gear (helmets/kneepads) and it is astonishing. I may be biased because I broke my ankle 15 minutes into my first time (in a long time), but that's just the thing. No one makes sure that you know what you're doing, and people who have no guidance can get embarrassed by slipping, falling, and far worse, they can get seriously injured. We should take the safety aspect far more seriously than we do. 

"Well just get the proper training to skate safely," if you need training from a professional to avoid potentially getting seriously hurt, the activity is no longer casual. The same goes for people that grow up ice skating.

Of course, I'm not against it, but for those who enjoy ice skating, or those who are looking to try it, please consider what I've said. Don't treat it like a casual jolly stroll on a Saturday afternoon.I usually read articles and posts about how many miss the carefree and lack of responsibility of childhood. People of all ages just constantly complain about how stressful having to do tasks and getting responsibilities and it way worse if the person is an adult, I honestly don't mind being responsible for myself because I actually be giving options regarding my life. The opposite couldn't be said about childhood which I honestly never understand why people feel so nostalgic over, what were so great having everyone control literally everything about you? I honestly resent childhood it was really dreadful not being able to make decisions regarding your own life, I generally would accept needing to work and pay for my own life over just giving it up to others and having everyone control it again. 

I also don't think it not only the responsibility of earning your own life but taking care of yourself, I logically don't understand why people don't want to clean up their own messes and accept being lazy did the entire world really regress that others enjoy having their responsibility being covered by another person, you ladies and gentlemen can do y'all but don't complain about the lack of choices and options as well, I can understand why kids and teenagers might not be enjoying the responsibility considering they don't have any freedom or independence but the independent adults are complaining about responsibility despite you are giving all of the options in your life I never understood people logic? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️It baffles me that banks and postage still get away taking weekends off when almost every other industry is open 7 days a week. Even in global “always on” cities like London where there is activity 24/7, you will still seriously struggle to find a bank open on the weekend. The same applies for postal services.In my network I hear this joke frequently and every year.  It's really not that funny.  Something else that really bugs me about it is that  I think this joke is a big deal where I'm from because making fun of the Super Bowl is a class/education signifier, making fun of people who are invested in the Super Bowl/football in general.  I am not a football fan, but the only people I see making a big deal of this joke are generally being a bit smug about it, pooh-poohing something that a lot of the US is into.I've always hated the "Crunch" and the loud noise that eating popular crunchy foods such as Chips, Cereal, etc. 

So I usually let my cereal sog and my chips get softer or just get puff chips insteadIt was okay. Forgettable and disposal entertainment but it was never this monstrous entity of awfulness that the Internet thinks it is. I see reviews of people saying they were physically hurt by the show, and it makes me roll my eyes. Watching it I kept saying "there's literally nothing to get angry about, it's just...there."

Now maybe if you pair it against Daredevil, S1 of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage S2 and the Punisher S1 it's bad. But in a vacuum it's okay. It had some good elements to it. I really liked the story-line with the Meachums, I enjoyed the villain and the fight against the drunken master was cool and Danny re-claiming his identity was a decent way to kick start the show. Claire going "oh god how may more of you people are there?" was a treat. Madam Gao was enjoyable, most of the performances were solid.    

Honestly, there were times the other shows got way worse than Iron Fist. The back half of Luke Cage S1 was AWFUL. Punisher S2 sucked. Iron Fist was good compared to those.I’ve been seeing this phrase in Reddit every now and then, especially if the post is about someone or people being dumb on the internet in some way. All the comments on that post would be their opinions about the matter and then that one annoying comment would just say “Ignore it, It’s the internet. You’re not forced to do anything.”

This phrase just contributes absolutely nothing to the comment thread and for some odd reason it instantly pisses me off. 

Yes, ignoring is an option on the internet. But we can discuss the matter and you don’t have to go out of your way reminding people that you can ignore it since everyone knows and you’ve just contributed nothing to the thread.If we can openly criticize people for something as minimal as not wearing a fabric mask properly on their face, then telling them they stink shouldn't be off the table.I’ve heard a few people who, like me, work in the restaurant industry and have said their managers are just okay. Not good, not bad, but okay. Personally, I believe that restaurant managers are either pretty good or pretty bad. 

Obviously, there are outliers. there are the type of managers who’ll do some blatantly illegal shit to save a buck and there are those who go above and beyond for their employees. The ones that say “We’re a family here”, but you actually agree because of how well they treat you.

If anyone who works in a restaurant says their manager is “okay”, their manager is either pretty good but doesn’t have go above and beyond or pretty bad and everyone just lets some of their bs slide. There is no in between.If you didn't feel like having sex with me for months on end, and all of a sudden you decide to have sex on Valentine's as a special occasion, do you know what that says to me? "I don't really want to have sex with you, but I took PITY on you." Can you think of anything LESS sexy?

No, it's not special. It's just sad and pathetic.

The same thing goes for birthdays and other special occasions.

Sex shouldn't be a gift. It should be something that both partners want to do.I just can’t with the hair. He reminds me too much of Fabio (who I also don’t think is attractive). I think Henry Caville is a good actor and a very good looking man, but not with the long white hair. It doesn’t work for him imo. I’ve tried to get into watching the show multiple times but just can’t get past it and start laughing. All I see is Fabio. 

Everyone I know thinks he’s the hottest thing ever in the show. And I’m just eh about it lol.No I don't want to go through my cars touchscreen to change the temperature, I wanna feel the dials so I can pay attention to the road. Oh your touchscreen/touchsensor on your microwave broke? Guess you can't use it anymore. Oh yeah, those Bluetooth earbuds you bought? Guess what? You have to learn exactly how it works or  you'll accidentally make a call. It's unbelievable seeing how many things are becoming touch screens now.I think the “name” or prestige of colleges has grown far beyond the niche of academia and has now spread into the work force, for no real reason at all. If you are accepting a candidate for a job simply because they want to Harvard and your other perspectives didn’t, you’re really judging them more  on their performance in high school (and what they did to get in to Harvard) than how well they did while studying in a specific field. There’s no reason for a technology company or a business firm to care what school their candidates went to, except if it is a specialized school.I'm a guy and seeing this type of haircut everywhere makes it a boring look atleast for me. It's a cool haircut but when you see every damn guy getting some sort of fade it just diminishes it's "coolness". It's especially worn by fuckboiis too so that kinda association is pretty iffy for me too.I work as a Nurse so I dont have Weekends or holidays. And it doesnt bother me. I work every other weekend and have days off during the week.

I mean yeah most people dont have time but its great to do stuff. I mean shopping during normal work hours, going to the DMV or other appointments.

And when you work on weekends your commute time is like half. Sundays Morning coming back from night shift/driving to the dayshift is just sooo peacefull and like no one else is on the road.So to post something in r/unexpected you have to include a spoiler explanation people can read as to why it’s unexpected. Mod / sub rules. 

For starters, if you have to explain that *why* what you’re about to see is unexpected it means it probably wasn’t obviously *that*unexpected in the first place, and if it doesn’t stand up on its own as an unexpected post then it must be expected and so it shouldn’t be there.

And secondly the explanation as to why it’s unexpected makes it expected.

Yes, I’m bored today.When The Rise of Skywalker came out, I was disappointed because of how they didn't need to try to make this movie good. I thought that all films after this would end up being bad as well because it gave me the indication that Disney doesn't have to try anymore.

This was my opinion for a while until I've noticed that recent Disney projects hold up pretty well and aren't really that bad, but reach from decent to amazing. Projects such as Encanto, The Mandalorian, Luca, Soul, and much more.

So as long as Disney 'tries' to do good with their projects, I'll be quiet and not mind.Before anything else, I just want to say that relationships are still crucial to humans and if it is done correctly it can be healthy and help you grow as a person. BUT it is absolutely fucked up that you enter one with expectation that it will fix your issues. First, no one is deserving to handle your inner problems and that will just cause a massive mental stress to the both of you, especially to the other party who doesn't have the responsibility to fix you in the first place. Second, relationships are hard work and while there isn't a perfect one, it is an asshole of a move to say that part of that hardwork is to fix each other's issues. Third, it isn't even worth it in the long run it will just cause frustrations and resentments. This even gets more f*cked up if you have this thinking when you enter marriage and start a family. It affects generations after generations of people, you know.Yes, they're exceptional athletes doing the best they can, but it's in sports that nobody really cares about BEYOND the Olympics. 

This happens too during the Summer Olympics, where people take a temporary interest outside of the handful who actually follow the sport, but Winter Olympics doesn't even grab the TEMPORARY  attention of an average person in anywhere NEAR the same way.

I've never heard ANYONE talk about the "Michael Phelps" or "Usain Bolts" of the WINTER Olympics, whoever they might be...

But, despite the constant news articles highlighting "national achievements" etc, no "average joe" will remember your name, your achievements, nor be genuinely OK with the taxpayer money it even took to get you there.

Be PROUD of your medal because you're clearly GREAT in your niche field, but don't expect anyone else to care in even the slightest beyond a (probably genuine) "Good on you!"The only possible issues I see with this is...

if the euthanasia decision was coerced, 

if the decision is not certain,

if the inmate was found innocent after euthinasia,

 if the euthinasia process was equally tourturous, 

 if there was vital information needed from the inmate after euthinasia. 


In most cases, life in prison inmates deserve the right to euthinasia.Ever since before high school, my family watched movies that were set in high schools. In its self thats not much of a problem.

I am currently in high school. And i hate these movies.
First off, the child actors are almost always played by young adults. This can create lots of bodily concern of what you should look like at a particular age. (Although most people already know that hollywood is full of fake people)

Secondly, too much romance. I get that relationships do start happening at this age, but not to the extent that the movies portray it as (but hey, maybe its just my school)

Finally, school work and homwork are shown as a minor activity, or doesn't exist. This is probably for the plot but, if you wanted something interesting to happen, why did you set the movie at a school (most boring place on earth)

I think it is wrong for movies to portray school in the same strong points of view (hotshot, or daggy), as most people in high school are neither, and injecting these false expectations into children's minds about their body, or relationships is not a good thing. Although maybe if they did make it realistic no one would buy the movie.

What do you think?It's becoming such a popular thing to do and people seem to think it's so hilarious. I see videos all the time of people doing this. And sometimes people get hurt.

What if a candle goes right into their eye? What if the cake is so soft that their head smashes the table super hard? What If the cake is frozen and you break their nose on it? That's a great way to ruin not just a birthday but also a friendship.

Injuries aside, even if they don't get hurt, it's still just a rude thing to do. People want to feel special on their birthday, and it's a day to celebrate them, not treat them like crap so you can capture a viral video.

Edit: I know that it's a tradition here in Mexico. Yes. I live in Mexico. When it's done here, the candles are removed, and there's usually a second cake. 

I'm taking about the recent trend online of teenagers doing this on Tik Tok to be funny and in many cases causing severe injury.Here in America we scrutinize everything and if one thing's for sure we judge each other based on the amount of clothing we're wearing. In public, at beaches, on billboards, with media ads, etc..

I think it's ridiculous, family or not doesn't matter. Photography, art, beauty and the like are meant for so much more than bullshit simple social/cultural standards.

Discuss. :)I’ve seen so many cases of this and really annoys so much like during the BLM movement I saw so many celebs get called out for not talking about it. I do believe we should bring attention to this sort of stuff but no one should be forced to speak on it. Just because they don’t say anything doesn’t mean they are apart of the problem or are don’t care about it.I’m tired of seeing videos of someone doing some crazy shit with some huge disability. Like someone with no legs working out and lifting 500 pounds and the caption is like: “He didn’t let life stand in his way, what’s your excuse?”

*That shit is not inspirational*

It’s impressive and amazing but sometimes it just makes me feel like shit (like because I have legs and can’t lift 500 pounds).It's as simple as the title says really. There is, by far, no national anthem worse than this one. There's no story or passion behind it just asking God to save the Queen and then it'll be the king when she dies...like come on.Everything about it is disgusting, from the way the meat completely turns into a gristle-like consistency, to the sickly sweet sauce that people somehow willingly consume. I'm tired of having to explain my opinion every time I say I dislike barbecue, because "how do you not like it?" or "you've just never had it made right".

Edit: I cannot believe that I am still getting people saying that I haven't had it made right. I do not like the flavor profile nor the texture of the meat.There are four "big events" in the religious sense (Christianity). Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage/wedding, and funeral.

Weddings is seemingly the only one where banning kids is common (on reddit). Why would you ban your own family from attending? And how does the church go along with it? Seems weird that one of the foremost bearers of tradition in our society would go along with it.As the title says, if you treat discord and steam like social media I really think you're weird. What makes you want to make your avatar / profile picture a photo of yourself? No one cares what you look like we're just trying to play games.Recently I've seen lots of posts on social media, including by people I'm fairly close to, which are people asking for money for family members who have serious illnesses. In the UK and other countries with free healthcare, treatments for serious and terminal illnesses are completely free, and often still of the highest quality. My dad has cancer so I'm pretty familiar with the some of the systems in place. 

Despite this, I see links to gofundme pages where the title is 'please donate to help *person* beat their illness'. The money won't make them any more or less likely to get better, and if its for something like a holiday or a gift to make their remaining life better, why not just put that in the title? If just sounds like people are pleading for money, taking advantage of their dying relative.For context I am talking about online media as print based and television based are a complete lost cause.

Advertisements are always catered to the lowest common denominator in society, and unfortunately,  those people are idiots.

If there was good thought provoking advertisements that made their point and left, then we would have no problem with it, similarly  to when you go to the movies and are actually hyped to see the trailers.

But when adverts pretend to not be adverts that's what really makes me annoyed, especially these stupid mobile game adverts where its set up like a fake social influencer is playing it.Edit: opinion is ‘there is no reason to wash your feet with soap in the shower’

After explaining this to my team at work, including some very senior members, I was met with complete agreement or total disgust. 

I have come to realise there are two types of people in this world:

1. Those that say they don’t wash their feet in the shower 

2. Liars

What is run-off water for!How is it possible for someone to consider something both interesting and infuriating? it's impossible. you are clearly only trying to karma farm. you should be ashamed for being a sham and thus should be shamed.  


I have seen this happen a few times already. any have yet to see anything that could legitimately pass for both from the SAME person. different people? yes of course. what is interesting to me might infuriate you. but surely you can not be interested and infuriated by the same thing.No not every truck and sports car driver is a rude driver. Theres a lot of them who drive quite respectfully. Then theres those who dont. Usually people who drive trucks and luxury cars show a serious lack of respect and safety for others on the road. Im so tired of them not using their signals as if they have imaginary entitlement of the roads. Its like pushing past someone and not saying excuse me. This is so rude and bothers me so much. 

The speeding is obviously dangerous but is disrespectful too. Yesterday a mustang was speeding so fast behind  my car in a 40 mph zone it seemed like they were gonna crash into me. I actually got worried especially because I was driving a rental car. They quickly cut in front of another car to cut in front of me. Keep in mind the spaces they were cutting into were not that big. I see this happen to other people too much. 

Luckily they did use a signal, but many times they dont. The loud obnoxious engines get on my nerves too. Its like theyre purposely trying to get peoples attention just to show off. The overwhelming loud music reminds me of that too. Im aware that people who dont drive luxury cars and trucks do this stuff to but people with luxury cars seem too do this a lot more. I can even recall a time when one sports car driver had the word arrogant on their license plate, which they drove like they were.This is stupid and a practice I wish never took off. It doesn't help and frankly I wonder how many cancer patients even want it.

If I got cancer had to lose my hair in chemotherapy I wouldn't ask anyone healthy to as well. If I lost a finger in an accident I wouldn't ask my family and friends to cut off their finger either and if one crazily did I'd be horrified.

A lot of people (especially women) spend a lot of time on their hair and go to expensive hairstylists and get lots of products. That shouldn't be all flushed away because of a virtue signal. If someone is single it could possibly impact their dating prospects for awhile (again especially for women.) Making yourself more lonely and missing great opportunities also doesn't help and it's not something I'd want if I had cancer.

And finally like a lot of virtue signaling it becomes a form of oppression itself when people are bullied and pressured for NOT taking part. I've heard stories of co-workers being shamed and bullied because they don't want to do this and that's totally their choice and OK! No cancer patient is demanding it.

There's plenty of other ways to support people with cancer that frankly help much more as well. This doesn't really help and should stop.Listen, I've flown with Ryanair MORE than 5 times, it's not bad at all. Their seats are decent and comfortable and on top of that they are dirt cheap, there are flights that are less than €10. You can go anywhere in Europe with Ryanair for less than €100 euro. Stop saying it's a crap airline. We need more airlines like thisEarlier I saw a post saying Elon Musks conducted tests on monkeys. Honestly I don't see what the big deal is, should we use humans instead? Would you be willing to volunteer? We're the superior species in that we possess consciousness, so we use other species that don't in order to better our life and future. That's just the way it is.

edit - it seems a lot of the answers were written in anger. I appreciate your time but would rather have a discussion based on facts rather than feelings.The popular opinion of many seems to be that its much easier to make online friends than make friends in person, but I disagree.

Its not easier, and its due to 2 main reasons:

People on the internet lie. Now, I am not delusional, I know people lie in person too, but its not as often, and not to such extent. People on the internet are willing to say bigger lies, and often, because they know they can get away with it. Another problem is that on the internet, people are much more paranoid about their privacy, and wont disclose stuff about them that easily.I feel like I'm the odd one about this, but I am just so tired of so many highly recommended horror movies I've picked up recently always always ALWAYS focusing more on the deeper psychological themes and make the horror aspect more of a metaphor about trauma or abuse or faith or family or some other topic that I could not care about at all. They often do this AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HORROR ASPECTS. I came here for monsters and stuff!

Oh, did the ghosts seem boring? Was the monster design /effects lame? Ignore that and watch how meaningful the drama is!!! Listen to this guy talk about his mean dad over and over while crying (shut up about the swarm of giant insects or whatever). Will this couple be able to save their marriage (stop asking about the aliens). Aren't you so moved?! Send all academy awards directly to the studio address in the credits please!!!

Aliens is the gold standard for me in this. It's themes are mainly about motherhood with Ripley having lost her daughter, is caring for Newt, and the Queen is the mother of the hive...THAT'S IT. 99% of movie is about THE ALIENS: how they work, why they are here, what they did to the colony, how to get rid of them, how is the corporation involved, HOW SCARY THEY FREAKING ARE etc. It's focused, terrifying, and a stellar horror movie ABOUT SCARY ALIENS.

If I go to see one more Horror Film of the Year and it shoves the deadly beast out of the way to make sure I know just how CONFLICTED and SAD the main cast is about unrelated past crap, I'm gonna scream and not out of fear.That's how progress is made, plain and simple. Unless someone intends harm, we should learn to be comfortable hearing things we don't like so that new ideas can be introduced and tested as a community without judgementHolding over people's heads that you were the smartest person in your school should be looked upon in the same way as vain that I was the prettiest person in your school. They both come from a place of superiority, and arrogance, even though both those things are unimportant.It's basically the 3DS without the 3D slider thingy. I get that Nintendo wanted to make a safer version of their newest handheld, but for crying out loud, if you don't want the 3D effect or can't have it on because it messes with your eyes, just don't touch it. It's not hard. And if you accidentally turn it on, just turn it back off again. It'll take you an eighth of a second.

&#x200B;

Also, how come the Nintendo DSi allowed you to share photos to Facebook, but the 3DS couldn't? And why did the DSi have a better photo editor than the 3DS?Draft can be not fresh (depends where you drink), not at the right temperature, unclean taps and so on so forth that affect beer quality.

&#x200B;

Give me factory controlled bottle any day over some draft one.Most of the people I've met who have expressed positive things about the taste of whiskey (or any hard spirit), I later discovered had a problem with alcohol.  Liquor is an acquired taste, and among those who have drunk enough *straight liquor* over a short enough period to acquire a taste for it, a very high percentage were drinking too much.

Think back to everyone you've known that liked to drink straight whiskey or ever said "that's good whiskey."  Alcoholic?  That's what I thought.
They weren't?  Hmm,... you sure?Firstly I’ll distinguish between people who want to make a large change to the world that will have an effect even after their lifetime and people who just don’t want to be forgotten. I’m talking about the latter. 

It seems so common for me to see people who stress about eventually being forgotten, thinking there is a lot of pressure to be memorable, but I just don’t understand it and think it’s honestly quite stupid.

The most obvious reason that it’s stupid is that regardless of how long people think about you, once you’re dead, you’re dead, you’ll never even know if you’re remembered, let alone care at that point.

Memorable people rarely try to be memorable, they just do what they enjoy or what they think is right and that way, even if they’re not remembered for long, they can rest knowing they lived a fulfilling life.

I just don’t think it’s worth stressing over how much you’ll be remembered that much, and it’s definitely not worth doing things that you have no passion or enjoyment for purely for the sake of being remembered.And everyone acts like like it would be the end of the world and no one could keep on living without a woman who can lift cows and another woman who causes shit weatherYes, he's a scammer and a POS. however, if you know someone for a few months and hand them over 1k and get scammed, its a shitty situation which you say "fuck" but get it over with as the time goes by, scammer was just doing his job. But if you hand over MORE than 150k, then i can't really blame the scammer, only yourselfUnless you're a studio photographer, a religious iOS gamer, or someone who lives their entire life on their phone (ie doesn't own a TV or Laptop), aside from battery issues that are easily remedied with a battery pack, there is almost no reason why you need the iPhone 13X. Apple has spent way too much time developing the iPhone camera in recent editions. Probably 1% of the population has a compelling interest to have a decked out phone camera at this point. My iPhone 7 photos from 2017 are clear enough for every purpose besides forensics and medical evaluation. Sure, the aesthetics are satisfying to look at and the device is sleek, and if you want to spend money, go ahead. But in general, there is nothing awful or unworkable with a 7.Ok, so inventing Anna was just released and it was good 

but now it’s kind of built this new found fan base around the real Anna Delvey and I’m like she treated her friends like garbage, purposely used declined cards so one of her friends would pay 

I don’t like her one bit, and I don’t understand why people are glorifing a con-womanFor the love of the game! i wanna see some kick off returns and im not 100% sure this is an unpopular opinion and i dont want to see anyone get seriously hurt or injured but maybe come up with something more exciting than a touch back and a pointless kick to the endzone.... This is  the main reason i started to tune out of the game and if it comes to it just replace the players with robots so we can see some kick off returns and some hits again.People turn to violence too quick, if you can’t express your discontent to someone without resorting to violence your drunk or your hyper masculine and cringe. 

People who film it for fun are shit heads seeing their fellow person doing shit that’s dangerous to their help and legal situation and just laughing along. If you were getting kerb stomped would you want me filming and laughing or tryna prevent your death.

Fighting in sport is fine to me that’s like a different thing completely.The first one was actually amazing. It had great characters and the relationship between those characters was really realistic. 

the 2nd one wasn't as good but I still enjoyed it. Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing actor and is a great villain.

The 3rd one was goofier but it had very good scenery and effects and the villain backstory was really interestingThe fries from this place are so gross and inconsistent. The fries are a mix of semi moist giant waffle fries and crunchy crumbles. Some have the skin left on and taste like earth. Some of the fries are so inconsistent in their thickness and it’s annoying.Mountain Dew isn’t that good and we should all stop lying to ourselves. Root beer and cream sodas are so much better. Regular Pepsi is at least 5 times better then Mountain Dew.Yeah basically the title. I've had friends and family tell me I'm going to hell for believing the suck.  I've tried them many times in the past and the flavor and texture just suck.I can't be the only one who wants to see men in peak physical condition hack eachother to death.. that's just prime time entertainment. To be clear I don't want to force anyone into a life or death battle. I want to see people duke it out in the ring and win tons of money with the knowledge they will die if they lose. Well losing and dying here are kind of synonymous. We have created every avenue of entertainment that simulates killing. But without killing. I wanna bring back the thrill of actual death being at riskIf you can keep your shit together, it’s all good. People often look at drugs as automatically bad or using them to cope with life is bad but if it’s moderate enough to not interfere negatively with your life, ain’t no problem.For context, I live in Singapore, which is a hot and humid country but very cooling when it rains. It is common to wear flipflops (we call them slippers) here too, especially if it's hot out, as well as sneakers/covered shoes. 

Got the idea from posting on r/askSingapore, being downvoted and reading the comments: 

>Absolutely not. The idea of my feet squeaking and squelching and being drenched in all that rain water makes me feel ill.

>Second worst feeling is having your trousers/jeans get wet, and you feel the wet ankles slapping about. Gross.

>this belongs on r/unpopularopinion LOL i love it, upvote

>Absolutely not.

>Dude..

**Also, by puddles I mean clean puddles and by shoes, I mean flipflops with no socks while wearing shorts. I hate having the end of my leggings being soaked by rainwater**

I like everything about rain, like thunderstorms and lightning (probably another unpopular opinion) because it makes you feel alive, ya know?So if you diddn't hear,it was recently announced that the next CoD will be a sequel to MW2019,and I couldn't be more disappointed.I miss CoD trying new time periods and scenarios, even if it diddn't always work(I'm looking at you AW).But at the very least,there was a difference between them,and they were at least interesting in concept.This is the 5th modern warfare,and unlike black ops they have all been either very similar or complete carbon copys.CoD has fallen from grace,and unless they start goin balls to the walls,it's gonna stay that way.Unpopular opinion because I see this particular accent mocked all the time and seen as the go-to stereotypical annoying accent. 

It just reminds me of a pretty girly girl. The peak of hyper-femininity. I don’t think it’s unpleasant at all.Everyone complains about when their drink is watered down but it’s actually delicious. The difference in concentration of soda/water as you take a sip is so wonderful. Don’t even get me started on lemonade. The more you drink the stronger it gets—because it’s watered down! Delicious. Fuck.For 5 years I've put my friends before myself. That's only landed me at my worst. Sure I can't speak for every friend group, but growing up in the worst area in my city where everyone claims to be a gangster and a real one, you realise how fake and disloyal EVERYONE is.

I dropped out of school to hang out with my friends everyday. 

I've been bashed, used, abused, sexually abused, mentally destroyed, arrested, drug addicted and robbed for and by people I thought I could trust with my life.

Here I am now with no money, a fucked up head and survere trust issues. I wish I didn't drop out of school, I wish I had higher priorities then my friends, I wish I stopped putting up with people's shit as soon as I noticed disloyalty. I wish I gave no one second chances.

As soon as you have a falling out with someone, they use everything you've opened up to them about against you.

I don't need anyone. All I need is to focus on myself for once. I've moved away from all of them, deleted my social medias and ignored all my calls. I'm a lot happier. Maybe I'm just hypocritical, but in my head I know what I have to do to be happy, even though it might hurt my friends, I've been through enough pain by them.If I could make the rules, I'd do the following:

The absolute lack of whatever flavor makes me wonder what kind of standards do people have, even the 1 pickle slice cheeseburger tickles my taste buds more than that terrible excuse of a burger. It's literally like paper to me, it's so dry, so fucking... TASTELESS, and it makes me angry that there's people that unironically think it's the best burger ever.

There's so many good alternatives to it that have so, so much more flavor, just get a McDouble, or fuck, go to poland and eat a "VillageMac", or go and ask for "The Lumberjack Sandwich" or whatever it would be translated to english, hell I am so sure any of the country-specific McD items is probably 30 times better than a ShitMac.

I would rather genuinely, and this is literally not a joke, eat a slice of bread with butter and salt and I'd enjoy it more than that sad, overstuffed with buns 'burger'Ever since I worked retail (and before that too), I realized almost every holiday is meant to benefit companies and it’s basically capitalism working very efficiently.

I love capitalism only when I’m the one benefiting from it. So I hate holidays because they force me to play the game on wall streets terms. No thanks. I’ll pass. 

Valentine’s Day is the worst of them all. Truly a holiday made to get men to waste their money on expensive flowers that die a week later. May as well burn that cash in the fire pit.I wouldn’t consider myself some sort of alcohol connoisseur but I’m constantly bombarded by videos of people with cases of “Twees”. I simply cannot palate the taste, I tried drinking one and gagged as to how awfully sweetened and flat it was. There’s something unsettling about drinking an alcoholic beverage with no carbonation, please just hand me a beer.Im on episode 3 so far i had 3 chuckles. Anyways, its got cute characters and a light hearted sincere plot going. The characters are a bit tropey but still fine. Animation is like dragon tails or other kids show level, but the design is nice. The pointedly inclusiveness is nice for a kids show, usually that's reserved for young adults. I dunno, i saw a lot of hate for it on youtube, seems undeserved and found due to this current social atmosphere of wokeness vs ... hmm, conservativity? Im an adult but i think like tweens would enjoy this show in a semi-ironic but cult following way. 
Also they have some good voice acting.Years ago people used "ho'" as an abbreviation for hooker. You wanna call someone a hooker or prostitute in writing? Use "ho'." Now, I don't know which dummy first started using "hoe" in place of this, but y'all sound like you've been calling people gardening tools for years now. It should be "ho'," period, and I feel like the only reason the dictionary people added "hoe" as a variant spelling is because people can't be arsed to look up proper spelling for words anymore, even when they're calling someone on the internet or over text a ho'.And here's why. 

If I see a half a glass of water in a pic, other than being under a faucet or some other container thats filling it. it will be half empty.

Why? Cause it is more than likely on it's way of being finished to drinking in the environment it's in. Therefor it is half empty. 

Unless of course it's in a restaurant where the waitress is coming by to fill it from time to time. But that's never the case when you see a glass of water in a pic to determine this scenario.

Now if you showed me a pic of a glass of water under a faucet where water is coming out into the glass that is halfway? It's half full. Because it's on its way to becoming full. 

But a half of glass of water sitting on a counter etc. Will always be half empty. Because it is on it's way to becoming empty.Mars has almost no atmosphere.

Even if the atmosphere was 100% the exact same composition as the Earth's, it wouldn't matter because the atmospheric pressure is too low for survival.

Humans could never go outside without a spacesuit.
Liquid water can't exist on the surface, and so plants can't grow.
The remaining Martian atmosphere is still being stripped away.
Less sunlight.
And more.

There are too many barriers to terraforming.  And if the only way to live there is to be trapped inside a suit, building, biome, underground facility with very slow internet to planet Earth, few people would be interested in that enough to ever successfully develop a permanent foothold.yo imagine putting millions of dollars, rather billions and then creating a tall rectangle ;-; .

idc about efficiency just go back to the time where buildings were art like.The rise of the shield hero I hear is constantly being praised, but honestly, after I watched it I thought “what was the fuzz even about?) like, the story makes no sense, and probably I’m going to be hated for saying this, but I found the false accusation of naofumi kinda an out of nowhere excuse to make him edgy, not to mention that the whole being forced to hire a slave narrative (Raphtalia) is kinda like a hentai fantasy (well the whole Isekai genre  is a freaking male geek fantasy, no offense to anyone), that being said I have to admit that even as critical of the show as I am, I found myself enjoying it, I cheered when the red haired antagonist was being humiliated at the end of the show and even fell in love with raphtalia ( even if her relationship with naofumi is more than problematic in hindsight) you could say that the rise of the shield hero is my guilty pleasure, kinda like twilight might be someone’s guilty pleasure, so much that I can’t wait for the second season, yeah I know I said it’s overrated (and it is) but me, I personally like the anime even if a know is garbage.It's nothing more than a nice and accepted coping mechanism. 

The good might not get their deserved rewards, and the evil might not get their proper punishment.Whenever I see a comment of someone talking about being depressed or whatever there's always a flurry of people replying 'I'm here if you need to talk OP you can PM me anytime <3' but I can't help but feel these people are only wanting you to PM them because they're bored and want something exciting or engaging to do, it always left a bitter taste in my mouth whenever I'd see those comments but who knows maybe I'm just cynicalI can't speak on sororities too much because I'm unsurprisingly not around many females in a normal setting. 

One big superstition I had going into university was the frat jocks. The teen movies essentially brainwashed me into believing that fraternities were just a bunch of sports-playing, booze-guzzling morons who are more than likely peaking in college. Now, I will say this. Not all of them play sports, and they do show some level of intelligence. They are in college, after all, meaning they or someone around them cares about their future success. 

I will say this, though. Every "bro" I've come across on my campus was assigned to some fraternity, and I'm always reading articles of frat hazings gone wrong, or this happening and that happening, etc. A lot of them are nice, too. But they still have that sort of douche-ness, "bro" personality. It's not an overly hatable feature, but it's there and it's noticeable. 

I understand the point of a fraternity: brotherhood. Family. I get it. However, having a bunch of slightly-older-than-teenager dudes all crashing in one house. Doesn't sound like the best idea to me. And that's fine, they're adults, they can do whatever they want. 

All I'm saying is, even though the movies overexaggerate fraternities (as they do with everything else), most of the time there's still at least a sprinkle of douche-bro-salt in the recipe.I’ll start off by saying, I love Aliens. I love Alien, Aliens and also Alien3. 
But even though Aliens is an amazing movie, it turned the franchise to a path that I think it hasn’t been able to get itself out of.
The best decision ever made, and one of the creatively ballsiest decisions ever in a major film franchise was to kill Newt and Hicks in the beginning of Alien3.

Why was this a good decision? Because the entire journey of Ellen Ripley isn’t one to feel comfortable in. To feel love, it’s unrelenting, it’s cruel. That’s the nature of her character. A tragic lonely isolated life caused by these disgusting but yet beautiful creatures. 

If you continued the story of Newt and Hicks, it would have just became a generic action franchise. Now all you see are fucking Alien fans talk about is getting a TRUE sequel to Aliens. Literally what fucking interesting story would this conjure up? Alien has always meant to be symbolizing motherhood, and rape. 
The reason Alien was so scary to a male centered audience was because it forcibly impregnated men. The same men that went into the womb like catacombs to steal eggs. 

Ripley is destined to die alone. 
Newt and Hicks would have taken all that away, and her getting attached at the end of Aliens and then getting it ripped away from her so easily and quickly does so much for her character. 

I move on to Alien 3, it’s a very imperfect movie. The assembly cut is clearly better but it still suffers. I think the story is still a good one. Like most trilogies, the third movie isn’t as good. But it still lands and in retrospect to the later movies, it’s way better.I like both, but on pizza fresh mushrooms are kind of terrible. First they’re fairly flavorless (and mostly textureless) raw. Second, they always seem to make the pizza soggy, with the cheese just sliding right off. I’m guessing because of their high water content. Fresh mushrooms seem to be the only ones “respectable” pizza restaurants will serve, but that’s always disappointing to me not to have canned as an option.Idk why, but something from the can makes the taste feels odd some way, It might not be just beer but in every kind of sodas or drinks. Bottles taste so much better, I'm not sure why, is it because of the Aluminum that made it taste weird?Dont get me wrong, I'm a mustard fanatic but to call that yellow goo mustard is blasphemy.

It adds nothing but some texture I suppose? I dont mind smooth mustard, I mind that it doesn't taste like there are mustard seeds in it, imho.Honestly, I kinda find modern triple AAA games to be unappealing because of all their bells and whistles. I get that games have come a long way. But I don’t want to deal with $500-2000 dollar systems, subscriptions, $70-250 for 5 hours worth of gameplay, games as a service, updates, patches, buggy games, paying $60 for multiplayer, and a toxic online community. I know there are single player open world games, but those are too much of a big investment of time and resources for me. I like going to the arcade and paying $1 for a complete game with fun, quick, and amazing with none of the convoluted crap of home gaming such as the bugs, repetitive “cinematic” gameplay, updates, and online play as well as getting immersive racing, shooting, ride-on, and VR experiences I couldn’t get at home.You learn to grapple with an opponent into submission, you learn to deflect punches and grab kicks, you don't get yourself too much injured and you can smash a guy into concrete, which he'd have difficulty getting up. Nowadays everyone boxes, so you even got an edge since most boxer can't free themselves from a submission (except if they're really good or practice another art on the side). You tell me.Ok everyone has seen Rugrats everyone thinks eating bugs is gross but Be real most forms of meat are not very sustainable or at least not good for the environment .Not to mention the cruelty involved. So if I'm hungry while camping I honestly don't care what everyone thinks I'm trying to put some protein in my system, people already eat fried  crickets and such as a snack so what's the big deal . Hell I think if we were to farm a massive amount of crickets or grubs and process them into a protein dense ground beef alternative it could revolutionize the way we all eat . Honestly It would be like impossible meat without all the estrogen and it would be beyond cheap . But It sounds super gross and most people haven't taken wilderness survival courses so they don't think it's safe. I understand not wanting to eat bugs straight from your backyard cause there's always a little bit of risk there. But on a larger scale we could make it safe and you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between ground cricket and ground beef .I just think you shouldn't knock it before you try it  and don't shit on someone for their food preference.This is an advertiser's paradise. Let me explain why.

Even though it's of course very possible to extract data out of one's posting history, it's a LOT easier to create ad segments out /r/AskReddit particular questions towards groups:

- Nurses of reddit
- Dog owners of reddit
- Russians of reddit

...the list goes on

Why? Because there is a lot of personal info that one just wouldn't just post in their own history. "Oh I own a dog btw lol" HOWEVER when someone replies to "dog owners of reddit" we know for a fact this person owns a dog and we can target dog food ads at him/her in full force.I find silverfish to be cute and pretty fascinating creatures. I feel bad when I have to kill them or flush them down the sink. Spiders can be cute as well. If I see a spider on its web in my house I often leave it to do its thing. As long as an insect is not being a pest or there is a low risk of infestation then I mostly just leave them alone. However, anything with wings can get out.Besides the fact that streaming is now nearly as expensive that cable, it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to find the show you want to watch. 

For example I wanted to watch the latest episode of Resident Alien (great show by the way) and I know it’s know SyFy so I flip there. Nope that’s not it. I don’t have a subscription there but I do have a “coin” that I can use to watch it whatever that means. Okay maybe it’s on Hulu - everything is on Hulu. Nope. You need another subscription to watch there. 

Ah. It’s Peacock. Of course. Why didn’t I think of that first. So five minutes later and many button presses later I’m watching my show. Cable I would have just hit my DVR or on demand and I’d be good.

Edit: most of you are missing my main point here. My point isn’t the cost. My point is there are so many services it’s harder to navigate than cable. 

I also changed “more expensive” to “almost as expensive”. Meaning it’s losing its edge I’d had over cable.It seems like a lot of people my age (27) or younger don’t seem to get the appeal of David Letterman or get why he was so popular with Generation Xers.

Yeah, sure what he did with an intern was awful and sure he could occasionally come as creepy in his interviews with guests and he wasn’t always the best interviewer…but who cares? Nobody is perfect and their celebrities who have done FAR WORSE THINGS.

He was by far the funniest and most popular Late Night TV Host growing up for a reason. and I loved watching his Top Ten lists all the time and as someone who is a HUGE Pearl Jam fan, I have to love Letterman considering even the guys In Pearl Jam loved him and loved going on his show to perform some songs from their albums.

But, I also love a lot David Letterman’s 80’s interviews and material from what I’ve seen on YouTube. He was an original pioneer of the late night tv show genre.If you have at most 20 items, then self check out is an option. It’s not for people with three buggies full of stuff. You don’t have to use it if you don’t want to, but that’s what it’s there for. That way you don’t have to stand behind the extreme couponer.At the end of the day, celebrities are people that breath the same air as you. Just because they’re famous means you get a pass at sleeping with them? I just don’t understand how “bragging rights” trumps the likelihood of you hurting your partner

Also the odds are heavily favoured towards women. I’ve heard numerous times from male celebrities about how they’ve slept with loads more women now that they’re famous. Not so much vice versa

Another argument point I hear is “it’s just a fantasy and not going to happen.” But if the opportunity presents itself, is it still just a fantasy or are you going to act on it? Secondly, am I the only one that doesn’t fantasise about other people (famous or not) when in a relationship.Besides just being fun and full of quippy one liners, the movie subtly goes out of its way to avoid the Deus Ex Machina trope.

Things such as hidden gun placement or momentarily pausing on signs such as "danger ice" just so they can use both of those items minutes later.  The entire movie is full of these occurrences.  They avoid coincidences.

The movie is incredibly technically proficient in its storytelling and deserves more credit.Ironic title I know, but I see and hear this phrase a lot and it’s just odd to me. Who dictates that? why do people with negative things to say deserve not to speak at all? Just because someone isn’t saying it, doesn’t mean it’s not a valid opinion. How can anyone live productively while only hearing the positive side of things? It’s in tandem with removing the dislike count on youtube. sure, it silenced the dislikes, but they’re still there.Forget using a fingernail or toenail clipper. It's highly satisfying working your nails with your fingernails. It's like your making a sculpture. Obviously cutting your nails with clippers is much quicker. But it the feeling I get from tearing the nail perfectly feels joyous. Plus, I have a toenail that I really should see a foot doctor for because it's really hard. I really have to work at finding a weak point in the nail with my fingernails. It's like a fun little game. That's my favorite nail to trim.

When I cut my nails with clippers, sometimes I feel like I cut them too short, but I never feel that way with the fingernail nail trimming.This is probably gonna be my most Karen-like take on Reddit, but I’m gonna say it anyway. Restaurants should still be serving you in the last 10 minutes before closing, especially a fast food joint. A lot of people will say “why don’t you understand from a worker’s perspective” and to that I say I do, I never complain to them about it if they don’t want to serve me when it’s that close to closing. BUT, if those really aren’t your open times, then why not just make it take-out in the last hour at all these restaurants, or at fast-food chains why aren’t they still serving despite the place being “open”? Just close earlier so that there can be clean-up, otherwise the open times just genuinely aren’t true. This is definitely more focused towards OWNERS of restaurants, rather than the people working there. This really wouldn’t even be an annoyance, but when you consider the fact that a lot of people, myself included, drive out of the way specifically to get food because the place says it’s open and we get there on time, we should be getting food.I seen it explained as to why so many adults are into watching movies and TV shows set in highschool, as "they are reliving a better time in their life".

I guess HS would have the best memories for a lot of people? For me it was just the worst, i never want to be reminded of itThis is more specific than I would like but it is in fact a very unpopular opinion. The previous Enterprises (except the C, also ugly) as well as the E all followed rule of thirds, had sleek but retro designs, and looked like a spaceship you could build in real life. The enterprise D on the other hand, looks squat and fat, the deflector looks like a mouth, it’s proportions are nowhere to be found, and half of what it is abandoned everything Star Trek had previously established. You can look up a picture of all the enterprises to see what I mean.As I type this from my phone, I feel like we all ignore our phone usage as if it’s not a problem. Personally, I feel like my life has been negatively effected by how much I use my phone and scroll endlessly for hours. We’re not suppose to live like this.Why should I care about a group of old people picking a movie you probably never saw or will never watch as the best movie of the year as a Spider-Man fan who watch Spider-Man no way home should I care about people hating it calling it just fan service with no other meaning to it no because they are wrong and my opinion matters to me no one else that is how the internet works but am going to end this by saying if you think batman v superman is a masterpiece you should no care about anyone else's opinion.Doesn't matter if it's herbal, black, or green. The only way to make it taste decent is a ton of a sweetener. There is nothing tasty about it. I would much rather drink anything else.I had a convo on discord with some friends and we eventually talked about stomach aches and pooping. I said that taking your shirt off really helps and makes it way more comfortable. They told me I was weird and that nobody likes that.


But it really is way nicer to be without shirt while you are pooping, even when you don't have stomach achesYou’re essentially listening to two people have a conversation you’re not a part of. This could be interesting if you’re invested in the life of someone telling a deep story, but oftentimes, podcasts revolve around a topic that is surface level and easily accessible (and I have a hard time caring about the lives of people I have never met). Sports podcast? I’d rather watch the sport. Music podcast? I’d rather listen to music. Politics podcast? I’d rather listen to nails on a chalkboard. 

Almost any topic a podcast covers can be experienced in a far more direct way and enjoyable way.Yes, the books had more detail, but they were also crowded with a whole bunch of lovey-dovey garbage that just felt like filler you had to trudge through to get back to the story.I feel like the time he took was way to much and he let himself in backline for long period of time. He still is one of the greats when it comes to hip hop but taking almost 5-6 years off. Then playing at the Super Bowl with even bigger great artist as well seems like missed opportunity for a single or even an EP.HAZE (aka the Halo Killer) for the PS3 was hyped up to be the next big thing in 2008.  It failed. But it didn't deserve it. Because after playing both it and Halo 3 for the first time, these two games were basically the same game, just mediocre early seventh generation FPS games.  Despite this, one game is revered as one of the greatest games of all time and one was kicked to the curb, and anyone who thinks that really has no idea what they're talking about.

GRAPHICS:  
Both games honestly have pretty bad graphics.  I'm not talking about the Master Chief Collection version because that game had the graphics remastered for it.  A lot of vibrant colors that pop up against bland environments.  Personally I don't care about graphics, but it's a weird comparison to see reviews saying how Halo 3 looks amazing but HAZE looks terrible. The ONLY reason Halo 3 is praised for it's graphics is because it was the first HD Halo game.

&#x200B;

GAMEPLAY:  
Gameplay between the two is also fairly similar.  HAZE obviously tried to copy Halo's gameplay, but added it's own take on it, with both factions in the game being playable in the campaign mode and having their own unique playstyles depending on the faction.  Halo 3's biggest addition to the gameplay, outside of a few new weapons, was the equipment that I never found all that useful.  

  
Now one of the biggest similarities between the two games are vehicles, which are honestly the most different things control wise outside of unique options for each game.  In HAZE, vehicles are super tight and aren't particularly responsive, while in Halo 3, they are too sensitive and bounce around like they're on the moon.  There's really no fair balance unless you're driving straight.  

&#x200B;

AI:  
The AI in both games is honestly shit.  Halo 3's AI doesn't know what it's doing half the fucking time and HAZEs AI ranges from deaf idiots to aim bot's.  In neither game does the friendly AI add anything to the game outside of being something for the enemies to shoot.  They aren't super useful, but they can be helpful on the vehicles with turrets.  But outside of being meat shields and shooting guns on vehicles, that's it.  No, I don't care Halo 3's friendly AI can drive vehicles because their pathfinding is absolute SHIT you're better off just running on foot than having the Marines drive you.  HAZE at least had the decency to admit it's AI was bad and couldn't drive you by not letting allies in vehicles outside of scripted sequences.  

The enemy AI isn't smart either.  The challenge in Halo 3 is enemies are bullet sponges and have snipers that kill you in one shot, while HAZE can have aimbot enemies if the game decides you're too good.  The harder the difficulty, the more BS the AI is.  Also I don't care that the Scarab is a thing.  It's just a scripted set piece with a turret that targets enemies.  It's not that much fun to fight and isn't that hard once you find a way on.  

&#x200B;

STORY:  
Both stories are shit.  Neither have anything memorable.  Halo 3's story was just the same thing Halo's done twice before, and HAZE's story, while it makes sense, is stupid.  Sorry, but Halo 3's story was the most mediocre, generic garbage I have seen until I played HAZE, which was just as generic and garbage.  

&#x200B;

MULTIPLAYER:  
Multiplayer for both games are the meat of their games. But funny enough I found HAZE more replayable multiplayer wise simply because it has AI bots.  Yeah yeah, Halo 3 has forge but that's not exactly a selling point when I can't play the maps against bots.  And no, I don't care about online multiplayer as you can't even play either game online without using tunneling networks (yes, I know of the Master Chief Collection but I'm talking about the 360 version). The best thing Halo 3 has over HAZE is that it allows you to play four player's on split screen while HAZE only let's you play two.  But with a lack of AI bots, I honestly can't find myself coming back to Halo 3 at all.  I don't have multiple 360's for a LAN party, while HAZE at least let's me play TDM and FFA with bots.  

&#x200B;

COOP  
The COOP for both games was honestly the best selling point.  It allows you to play the campaigns with up to three of your friends. I do think it's cool Halo 3's coop mode has different characters depending on the number of players, while HAZE gives COOP partners a generic soldier.  Both campaigns could be done coop via online, LAN, split screen or a combo of Online/LAN and split screen.  Honestly the best selling part of the games if you have a few buddies.

&#x200B;

I don't care that Halo 3 had a huge release. It wasn't that good a game. The only reason it didn't fail was because there was nothing on the 360 at the time, besides Gears of War.  HAZE on the other hand was a third party exclusive by Ubisoft.  Halo 3 was only praised because it was the first HD Halo game, and because it was the third entry to an established series.  But honestly, both games are pretty generic.  There's nothing super special about either one aside from the soundtrack and coop.  Halo 3 was just 1 and 2 but done worse than 2, and HAZE was just stupid.  They're honestly some of the most middle of the road games (5/10) but I have to be harsher on Halo 3 because it's over hyped, and nicer to HAZE because it's treated unfairly.

Also, this goes without saying, but I'm not saying you have to like one or the other.  But the amount of hate HAZE got and gets while Halo 3 is basically the same thing is just baffling to me.  Both suck and neither is particularly better than the other in any one field.Before anyone suggests otherwise, I have a significant other, so this post has nothing to do with being bitter over being single or anything like that.

In the modern era, the holiday of love is more commercialized than anything else. Consequently, people in romantic relationships have been indoctrinated by corporate ads and marketing efforts into having certain expectations. Those expectations could be anything from receiving chocolates, flowers, cards and candy, to expecting a nice candle light dinner, a romantic night on the town, or even getting laid when the lights go out.

At best, all those expectations could be met. Sure, maybe you will have a great night out, a nice dinner, and maybe a fantastic night in bed. So the day/night passes and you’re left with fond memories of the holiday. Life goes on.

But at worst, a failure to meet those expectations results in anger, resentment, bitterness, breakups, divorces, or potentially worse. Simply put, whenever you create expectations about what *should* happen, you also create a potential for disaster when those expectations aren’t met.

How many guys scramble for flowers and chocolates the day/night before merely out of sheer fear? Fear created by the looming threat that their S.O. will rage quit and break up with them merely because he didn’t setup something fancy for V-day to her satisfaction. When he/she fails to conform with this commercialized holiday, lives are quite literally ruined. 

Sure, for some, the issue may not merely be because he/she didn’t pick up flowers or something simple. Perhaps the issues triggering a breakup are more persistent and systemic than that. But even if that’s true, you have to admit that the straw that breaks the camel’s back is caused by a failure to comply with a silly, commercialized holiday. And when you really sit and think about it, that should give you pause about the state of our society and how far we have fallen.What I keep seeing among the literature community is an abundance of people who believe that a writer who is writing a novel needs to either read far more than they write, they need to have read a ton of books in their life, or in general reading books is more important than knowing how to write books.

I highly disagree, obviously

The reason why is 3 things:

1. Knowing how to read requires little effort depending on your skill level or how grammatically complex the book is. Writing, on the other hand, is a legitimate skill that takes years of hard work to learn how to do. A writer can read, but a reader cannot always write. **Someone can have a great sense of humor, but be terrible at telling jokes.**
2. Reading being more important than writing certainly was a thing before the internet was invented, but now that we have the internet, its easier than ever to learn how to write properly, via taking college classes, doing your own research on aspects of writing a novel, etc.
3. Some people struggle with sitting down for 30-60+ minutes at a time to read a book, even worse if they're reading it on a computer screen.

Regarding #3, incase you might say 'then just listen to an audiobook,' well that doesn't prove my point wrong, because it requires no effort to listen to an audiobook, you're not reading its grammar, how it's written and you're not seeing it on a page. You're listening to it. 

What I'm trying to prove is reading a shit load of books won't make you a great writer. It may make you aware of certain tropes that either you love or piss you off, among other things of course, but it's not absolutely vital to being a good writer like people want to believe. It can be a useful experience when it comes to writing, but it doesn't have to make or break your writing ability or ability to tell a great story.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I've seen SOOO many people on writing forums such as ones on here ADAMANTLY defend and preach the idea that you MUST read a LOT of books before you should ever consider writing a novel. 

The only reason I can kind of see the logic in this, is if reading X amount of books a day/week/month/year is some sort of write-of-passage or its some of determiner of your credibility as a writer? No idea.

**I digress, in general, I hate it when someone suggests that someone should not/cannot/could not do something unless they do X when the two are not the same thing.**[The Kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(Klimt)#/media/File:The_Kiss_-_Gustav_Klimt_-_Google_Cultural_Institute.jpg) is usually thought of as romantic. But upon closer inspection, it's creepy. The man is blocky, black and white, and has his face hidden. The woman is multicolored and flowy. She isn't embracing him, not smiling, and her hands are awkward. She isn't kissing him back. Not only is he very ardent, but he's pushing her to the edge of a cliff, with her feet gripping the edge. Behind her, it's only an abyss. The half that she's being pushed into is noticeably darker than the other side.

Edit: typoOptimal human temperature is around 78 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 degrees Celsius. AC and heat was created to cool places when it gets too hot, and warm places when it gets too cold. 

The goal should be to get it as close to comfortable as possible, not to have it freezing inside the office or classroom.Time travel in the Terminator universe is simply outrageous. There is no logical consistency to it and it results in too many paradoxes. Maybe if they stopped at two movies we would be able to suspend our disbelief and forgive the narrative device to get a nice action move or two. Yes, at most two. Because the more they explore this broken time travel mechanic, the more everything unravels.

Why should I watch a movie where the writers can pull the rug under my feet in the next movie and just erase everything that happened with time travel. It’s a free-pass to retcon and reimagine the story to death. It’s lazy. It’s noncommittal. And it makes me not care about the whole narrative universe.The main root of my problem with him was that stupid NFT song he did for snl, that was the first time I’ve ever heard about him and has put me off him ever since. He seems like the kind of guy to babysit your animals and then steal all your copper door handles. His humour is just bland and I think he needs to just shut up and get out of my news feed.I don’t understand the appeal to being in a crowded room with dozens of people all bouncing up and down to loud music, nor does getting shit faced to the point you don’t remember anything sound fun. And if you’re using parties to hookup, that just sounds miserable and annoying trying to deal with either both of you being drunk or just one. Even if you do with friends or a date you can’t hear each other without shouting and even then you still might not hear each other. 

And if it’s not a rave or something, just a massive get together, if you’re a host or attendant, you won’t get to hangout with everyone there. They’ll all just kind of form up in their own little groups. 

Even in stuff like birthday parties, after a certain number of people they’ll all be in their own groups: be that teams for something like paintball or top golf. At BEST you’ll be able to say “Hi!” And “thanks for coming!” To everyone, and that’s if you’re the host. Otherwise even if you’re friends with everyone there good luck. 

An ideal “party” would be being with four or five of your closest friends doing stuff or watching movies or playing video games or something. Or an online party for gaming or zoom or something.If you've ever been in a deep depression you know how watching depressive content online makes you feel validated. For some people this isn't a problem, for others it can trap them in loop of self-loathing and validation. As a person who spent most of middle school and high school with severe depression, i can tell you for most of it, I was stuck in that loop and it partially ruined my emotional development.He is a mentally ill man scared to take his meds going through a divorce and having custody problems. Thinking that Billie Eilish giving a fan an inhaler at her concert is referencing Astro fest is dumb but I've seen news tabloids manipulating it to be that way, it's likely he has been influenced by them. I doubt many people would have a clear mind going through a divorce let alone mentally ill onesSpecifically, holding hands when walking. When watching a movie or driving, it’s nice. But walking around holding hands is so uncomfortable. It feels and looks so awkward.Stock photos are so horrible in so many ways that I can't even begin to list them. They're too pristine and fake, super generic to the point I feel like throwing up when I look at them, and they ruined my appreciation for actual GOOD photography. Now whenever I look at a high res photo someone took I'm immediately reminded of the abomination that is stock imagery and can no longer enjoy the photo.  


If stock photos were completely banned, or fell out of popular use right now; I'd be ecstatic.Someone getting scammed while trying to turn his/her $100 to $10000 in three hours is not a victim and doesn't deserve sympathy. /r/scams is full of these stories. These people were trying to make easy money and they got scammed by someone who likely worked harder towards making money. (as despicable as scammer work is)I always skip any cut scenes i possibly can so i can just play the game. I hate when it goes to a cut scene i cant skip. I really don’t buy video games to watch cut scenes or to learn the story and lore.If we don't use password managers, it makes it difficult in remembering your password. That is when majority of people make use of some weak passwords and add a number to the end. This completely breaks the entire goal of having a secure password. Rather than frequently asking the users to change their passwords, it would be better to have two factor authentication or sites check up on leaked database to inform the users about any leaks.So there I am, eating some noodles at a Indo-Chinese restaurant, thinking that I'm going to bite in a satisfying mouthful of chewy noodles. And then... CRUNCH. A fucking bean sprout. I hate them so goddamn much. They taste like tiny bags of stale fucking water, add absolutely nothing flavour wise to anything they are in, and absolutely ruin the texture of noodles. I have a theory that they're just cheaper than noodles so chefs puts a shit ton of them in everything. And to top off that mound of shit, depending on the type noodle, you can't even tell the bean sprout and the noodle apart - so you can't even anticipate the sprout or avoid it altogether! Fuck bean sprouts and their stupid ass deception and I hope anyone who excessively overuses it burns in culinary hell.Twisting knobs, pretending to mix tracks. We see you DJs…you’re just pretending! No one expects you to remix a track live, but no one appreciates you pretending to make the track more epic with some knob turns! Admit that your whole performance is prerecorded, and all you’re doing is dancing to it while inaccurately pretending to “mix”!Don't get me wrong, 36 Chambers is an absolute banger. There's just something about Wu Forever though... The quality of tunes like Hellz Wind Staff and triumph is so fuckin' rare! One of the RZA's masterpieces.I don't care that there is a freshly laundered sheet, I don't care there maybe a mattress protector, the fact remains that your skin is 1/16th of an inch away from that vile used 2nd hand mattress.

Having a RV, caravan, or camping with your own bedding is far better than staying in a hotel where others have done all sorts of sexual (and possibly deprived) things on that bed.

And, not very likely, but still possible, someone may have DIED on that mattress. Eeeh.What sparked this opinion in me is my very own experience.
Our town has one of these homes for hard-to-educate kids, and it's a funking curse. Surely some of them were well integrated to this towns community but the majority if them seems to be stubborn, uneducatable scum.

Up until recently we only heard some rumors of bad things happening, but then we got victims ourselves. They have broken into our garage and stole 3 bicycles. That's nothing terrible but we set up a camera following that and then they came back at night and stole quite an amount of booze (masked of course) then we finally got our reinforced locks built in but they still came back regularly... you almost couldn't sleep peacefully, being aware of this. One day we finally got usable footage for the police and got one of them.

He also proposed for being responsible for another crime to a friend of ours a while ago. They broke into his HOUSE and stole his CAR. His group has also been found guilty of mayhem towards people. But get this: Because this fucker is only 15 he will only be sentenced to what? A few days in a safe little youth prison. While being investigated his friends also came back and set off fireworks on our property, most notably underneath our car which is HYDROGEN powered and could've resulted in a very nasty explosion. 

I am sick of the police/law being so soft to these maggots just because they are minors. They steal, act violently and are a general disturbance of peace in our town, they should face the same judgement as adults as they are clearly aware of what they do because all of the ones we got had pre-sentencesIf public companies truly had the ability to act in the best interest of the non-shareholding stakeholders (customers / the planet / competitors/ suppliers), we wouldn’t have them feel this month over month pressure to perform and inflate line items on their P&Ls. Most companies are really at the behest of large funds and individuals who spend their whole day on wallstreetbets, and don’t leave them any short term path aside from boosting their margins or growing their sales in some unscrupulous ways. The day they start to care about people other than shareholders, the market will divest/ find a greedy company that will pump out good numbers, forcing the company to close shop, and put even more people out of a job. Everyone is along for the ride when “greedy” companies grow 10-40% year over year, but balk when shown how the company actually achieved this.Why are so many truck manufacturers moving towards a console shifter? Put it back on the column, or go to buttons or dials. It's an absolute waste of space to have the shifter sit on the console. It is an absolutely terrible location for the shifter and I refuse to buy any truck with it there.Winning felt better when I was younger and won a soccer game or something, but now I feel a strange sense of guilt without any of the pride or other positive feelings.The Witcher 3 game is so long it becomes boring.

The game is so long it makes you loose interest. I was very into the story initially but after 50 hours of play time I find myself not caring about the game at all. 

Game mechanics are great and the story is good, but the tracking Ciri quest line was stretched so long that it killed any desire I had to complete the game.

On the other hand, quiting the game bothers me after devoting so much time to it. Initially wanted to push through bottom mashing just to finish the game and accomplish the goal. Yet it feels like a waste of time.The whole game feels/looks like a chinese mobile game. I understand people are looking for the next big arpg but still I don’t understand the hype around this game. I tried to give it a chance but could not even endure through the tutorial. I guess people will play for the mmo grind cuz the combat has no weight. The only decent thing about the game are the animations except when it comes to anything else than character movement. Appparently Amazon didn’t have the budget to animate facial expressions or talking, not even in the cutscenes. And my god, the cutscenes, why would you make character creation so painful by adding unskippable cutscenes and making the simple act of choosing a class a whole damn scenario?? Honestly I’m also waiting for a decent arpg but seeing shit like this gather such hype makes me think of going back to diablo or PoE...A lot of people dislike hostess and Little Debbie products because they leave a weird film in your mouth. i completely understand that, but i actually really love it. something about the texture is enjoyable to meI’m sick and tired of hearing about California and that dumb state. Nobody cares. Californians think theyre superior. I don’t give af about sanfranshitshow and that dumb red bridge that’s in every Instagram pic. That overcrowded state , that doesn’t have anything more special than the other states 

All over the news just something about California like it’s the only state there is . 

Literally who cares? I’ve been once and won’t be back so overrated and lame
Oh Hollywood? So what Hollywood is lame, the whole state is just lame sorey not sorryHere's how I feel about security breach:It ruined the games, it wasn't scary, seeing another version of William Afton pissed me off HE DIED IN FNAF 6, it wasn't good.

How i feel about help wanted: i like the vr element of it but i don't like glitch trap and the new lore.
Ultimate custom night isn't Canon, they said that beforeThey’re giant sharks, with the exception of their size, they wouldn’t stand out amongst a litany of Apex Sharks

They’re obviously extinct, and there are a ton of animals that exist today and the past that are just as if not far more intriguing:

Blue Whales being the largest animals that we know of, but doing so through consumption of the tiniest animals(Krill)

Epaulette Sharks can essentially walk on land to find better places to hunt and breed.

*Dunkleosteus* was one of the first apex predators in biological history, taking advantage of a niche in the ecosystem and convergently evolving biological features similar to not just large predatory creatures like Orcas but also to *Thylacoleo*.

*Megatherium*, the largest bipedal mammal to have ever lived, are meat to supplement its diet, created tunnel-sized burrows and their extinction nearly lead to the extinction of Avocados because no other animal can eat them


There are so many other animals that one can find interesting and a ton of creatures just as cool that desperately need saving, please stop obsessing over a fat Great White.You aren’t strong willed or confident you’re just an uncompromising asshole who causes unnecessary shit by wanting everything exactly the way you originally stated, or refusing to accept facts when proven wrong. Everyone I’ve ever met that defines themselves as “stubborn” has just been a dick. Stubborn people suck.Every year a birthday rolls around people feel the need to ask for what should we do?! 

I’m at a point where I truly don’t care. It’s not something that needs to be celebrated really. After 21 every birthday is just another year on the planet. 

Legit love that I can use work as an excuse then by the time the weekend rolls around, my birthday is passed and we can move on. Give me just another night of chilling so I can forget I’m getting older.It seems like people are generally HUGE fans of his. I have not come across a single person who’d share my opinion. On the contrary a lot of people have considered him and his music phenomenal and adamantly tried to explain me why he is amazing. Practically attacking me for disrespecting “The boss” I still fail to see the talent. 

To give a little perspective on my taste in music, which is quite diverse, here are a list of artists/groups I consider fantastic:
Davis d Bowie
Pink Floyd
Cream
Rolling Stones
Daft Punk
The Chemical Brothers
Black Sabbath
Deep Purple
Justin Timberlake
Neil Young
Dire Straits
The Police
ABBA
RATM
RHCP
Heart 
Guns N Roses
Queen
Justice

+ more (but not Springsteen)

Edit: Look at all the comments. Defended almost like their lives depend on it. I am the problem. It can’t be true.I don't have much to say here. People say water has no taste but it does. I believe people just say that because they drink water so much, but have you ever had water in the middle of the night and it tastes super sweet? THAT is the taste of water.[This gif](https://imgur.com/T1bncvf) show exactly how chat looks when you're watching a popular streamer, literally *ANYTHING* you say is meaningless and remarkable, unless some "oooh" moment happen and *EVERYONE* in the chat react equally so you see a flood of the same emojies or something, and in my opinion this is just dumb. 

Other viewers cannot interact with you (mentioning is always lost) and the streamer will never notice you, so why do it ? they should just replace chat with a range of reactions or something.

Edit: forgot to mention in the title that this doesn't take into accounts small streams with a handful amount of viewers where every question get answered, etc..You guys have to put some perspective into this. Boomers grew up in the conservative and religious 50s, and had to live through some bullshit, specifically the Vietnam war. This generation literally got suckered into a bullshit war without a choice, and on top of that, if you are a minority boomer, well god bless. All they had was a good economy and cheap homes in the 60s and 70s. They still got ripped off by corporations and by the government. 

Gen X on the other hand got the tail end of that good economy while being young enough to be part of the internet. On top of this, no wars where citizens were drafted, a first in American history (I could be wrong, but whatever). They grew up in that amazing economy, college still was reasonable and accessible, no draft, more equal rights for minorities and women, and they got to be the first to enter tech (as we know it today). Gen X forsure had the better deal. 

We also discount blue collared boomers who also followed their parents foot steps, and suddenly had their unions and jobs stripped from them in the later 20th century, similar to Millennials and college because we followed our Gen X parents. 

I would even go as far as saying Gen Z has a better chance than millennials because they are aware of the risk of student loans. I can understand why lazy bums would hate the "hard capitalism" the US promotes but nobody can deny America's results. The US overwhelmingly has the best stock market returns and out of all the wealthiest countries it has the healthiest economy. Other countries like Canada and Australia have effectively become "real estate only" economies lately and have stopped innovating. They conjure money out of thin air by selling houses to the world's millionaires. As a result you see white collar hard working professionals all around the world target the US as their destination to prosper, creating damaging brain drains in other western countries. I have yet to see any well paid respectable profession that has an outflow of talent out of America rather than inflow of talent. Thus I believe people who claim America is so bad should go improve themselves instead. You live in the best country to prosper on the face of the earth: do better. If the best you can do is work at McDonalds yeah America isn't for you, but with the right skills you can be paid better than anywhere else on earth.I don’t know where to post this… new to reddit. 

Over in r/gangstalking, I responded to a couple of posters that they’re ok, not actually being stalked, just being paranoid. Take a breath, calm dow, everything will be ok.

So, as a result of what? 2 posts? I am permanently banned. Tried to ask the moderators “why”? I’m muted from the moderators thread for 28 days. 

So, what is this? A place where you can build a kingdom and rule autocratically? I suppose we’ll have r/NaziBullshit pretty soon, and with this kind of “content policy” in place, no one will be able to say jack shit in reply, because all the rational voices will be squelched.

Free speech is great, even for hateful speech, so long as the checks and balances — free and open discourse — remain in place.

Obsession over Gangstalking is a mental disease. I know this for a fact, having been involved in its consequences for years of suffering and frustration, trying to get my ex to stop telling our son that horrible things were lurking at every turn. If reddit is going to be a platform for unchallenged bullshit spreading, perhaps it should go the way of 4chan.

Should I have posted this somewhere else?Vast majority of people on earth still believe having children is the ultimate goal of human life, but if you're child free and spend a lot time travelling around in crazy places you get at leadt some amount of credit and understanding. If you don't have children and don't spend at least 3 months a year in Tibet, people think you're totally dumb and a complete faillure of a human being.

In general i'm tired to see "travelling" as the number 1 "passion" that anynody should place in the top tier of their priority.The US should not allow any trade (import or export) with any country whose child labor laws aren't on par with our own. Furthermore, buying anything from such a place is directly supporting child labor. So, if you shop at Walmart, you are pro child labor and don't even start with minimum wage standards.Instead of "Mom" or "Mother". These 2 ways of saying it are no problem but  I don't know what it is about that certain way of saying it. (Mum) It really just doesn't sit right with me.Here’s my take:

&#x200B;

Maybe they HAVE looked in a mirror, looked at themselves, and decided that they don’t like being alone.

Maybe they HAVE been alone long enough to know that loneliness doesn’t cut it for them.

Maybe ruminating in your thoughts and drowning in thoughts about yourself is unhealthy. There’s a fine line between introspection and rumination, and the former is about making yourself better; the latter is futilely remaining in the past.

&#x200B;

Yeah, maybe they are restless, but so what? Maybe they’re happier and more fulfilled when they connecting with other people rather than languishing around without a purpose, without someone to try and make happy, without an opportunity to make someone’s life better, without an opportunity to connect with other people. You can’t go around lauding distant humanitarian efforts while simultaneously cursing somebody you know personally who can’t stay seated. You can’t go around enjoying your entertainment while bad-mouthing somebody who “won’t shut up” about what they enjoy.

&#x200B;

Granted, we all have different interests and tend to place more value on what WE enjoy over what others do. But labeling others as “clingy” and such without any knowledge of who they are or why they might be that way is absurd. Maybe they are, and maybe they have to get better at it. And maybe you just have to go out of YOUR comfort zone and be patient and honest with them, teaching them how to be more secure instead of judging, or you direct them to help. (Of course, if they refuse to see they have a problem, that’s something you can’t force them to accept and you may have to distance yourself from physically or mentally from the situation.) But generally speaking, treating people like lost causes doesn’t help you or them; it only perpetuates their cycle and makes things worse.

&#x200B;

And no, introversion is not an excuse because I’m an introvert and recognize that it can be taken to unhealthy levels because it’s not a badge of pride that you’ve shut yourself off from everything. That comes from being burned by other people, not because socializing is inherently bad. Yes, some people prefer minimal socializing, but EVERYBODY wants their ideas, interests, and viewpoints to be shared and heard. (Whether or not those things are acceptable is another matter entirely.) How would you feel if you were forced to sit in isolation ‘til YOUR personal breaking point, without anyone to talk to? Ever heard of White Room Torture? You’d be frustrated and angry; or tired, wanting to escape into your sleep and your dreams. You’d talk to yourself and your imaginary audience non-stop; you’d feed on media parasocially just to feel connected to someone or something.

&#x200B;

Just because you are or think you are deep for being forced to sit with your thoughts doesn’t mean you’re better than other people. Just because your threshold for alone time is higher than others’ doesn’t make others “weak.” I’m not saying to always force yourself to enjoy what others do, although there is value in expanding your horizons; nor am I claiming that I like everything the people around me like. However, seeing that they’re human and the value their own thoughts and interests have is important.

&#x200B;

No, my defense does not directly apply to soul-suckers, narcissists who want to make others miserable, and people who genuinely need self-improvement. Those people DO need to take a good look in the mirror, if it’ll do something; but even then, many of them don’t seem to feel enough cognitive dissonance anyway, at least the former two.Prioritising compatibility is way more important. Why do you need to be in a relationship with someone you merely enjoy being with or feel the sparks with when you know there are many irreconcilable differences? There are some differences you can indeed work on but some aspects are irreconcilable and your feelings won't count by then. In fact, it is going to hurt you more when your relationship becomes toxic. And it's not just you. The two of you will get hurt. So many people insist that true love is when you two try to make things work because of love. Yes, that only happens when those are the aspects of a relationship that don't matter much to both parties. When the both of you have way too different values in life, you're going to suffer from dealing with a toxic relationship. 

It doesn't mean that if you have feelings for someone you should be with that person. I don't believe in that. There are consequences to face when you try something you shouldn't have. That's how some women and men get into abusive relationships that tie them down for years. Then they hate on each other, get into physical fights, lawsuits, say things that destroy one from within and more. 

People don't understand me when I say that's how I deal with my life. There were certain girls I met that I did truly love and care for. But never once did I have or try to have sexual relations with them nor did I love bomb them but I did treat them well as close friends. I knew we were incompatible and so I drew the line. I already knew that we wouldn't ever have a wholesome relationship and so I never tried to pursue or have more. Why am I seen as the bad person if so? I know what I want, I know exactly what girl I want to date, I know what kind of a relationship I want to have. Maybe we had some sort of connection between us, but at times you should know better that it best stops at that because what we want in a relationship cannot be compromised. People should look for those who want the same in a relationship. When people understand you and can relate to you, they become more attractive over time and that's when to me, true love develops and grows as you two age as a couple.maybe not a cult but i just don’t understand how they always are like top 100 i’ve never met a person who’s said omg maroon 5 is my favorite band like i’ve never met anyone who’s gone to a concert.. and let’s be real i can only name like 5 songs by them but they always selling out and breaking records idk they’re so overrated but yet i never see anyone hyping them up so who tf is buying all their concert tickets like they must have fans but where?They're literally a copy of each other, the more I look, the more it seems as if they were built in the same factory, the tits are just huge plastic jugs, their mannerisms are typical of a dumb bimbo, they look so fake and unlikable. What is wrong with guys who keep commenting on every fart they make? I just don't understand it, all of what they do, say and how they present themselves isn't attractive in the slightest, and showing cameltoe after cameltoe, nipslips after nipslips etc doesn't change that. I don't understandIt's the same as physical pain. It tells you something is wrong that you need to fix so that damage can be reduced. For most people who are unhappy, you don't really need to be more positive, you just need to analyze your situation and fix your problem. 

It's like your intuition telling you that something is wrong. People who spend so much time on social media end up unhappy. Why? Because your mind is telling you that you spend too much time looking at that one thing. If you are in a rut and you feel unhappy then it's your mind telling you that you should try new things so you can progress to the next phase in your life. 

Being unhappy every once in a while is normal. Being unhappy for a year or so is normal. Don't listen to people who want you to think that a good life is one where it's an endless bliss of being so happy you wake up with pre-cum every morning. If someone claims they are never unhappy they are either lying and about to roll out their MLM pitch after they invite you over for dinner or they are legitimately insane and they are about to invite you to their religious cult.I don't know why but everyone I have met till now love to have French fries with ketchup . But here's the thing I like my fries nice golden, crispy from the outside and soft from the inside. You can have a very nice taste by eating it just as it is. Ketchup just gives it a bad sweetish- weird flavor and ruins the whole taste. What's the point of ordering some nice fries only for them to be mushed with ketchup. If you want  some more taste you can sprinkle it with some spices or oregano. So why only ketchupBackground. 
Footage of Kurt Zouma a french footballer and also play for a English team was revealed and he was shown hitting and kicking his cat. There has been outrage all over Britain from many people calling for him to be held accountable etc etc.

People are saying how awful and disgusting it was and that he should prosecuted. However they say this while still supporting intensive animal agriculture which arguably causes way more suffering. They need to be a bit more consistent with their outrage.I'm sick to death of the Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, and the entire population of California being anti American. It's like one big circle jerk of "let's hate America" online. Iran is always making new bombs to attack America, can't you just stop being a dick for 5 minutes and think about your behaviour? Is it that hard to do? It's even with the youth and how they think it's "cool" to be anti American. No. Your cushy life is BECAUSE you live in America..you're lucky to have that ffs. 

I'm sick of it. I'm not EVEN AMERICAN. but I'm really fed up with the constant let's all shit on America.

Sort your behaviour out. Have some respect for your next door neighbours.I’ve been stocking up on canned goods in case shit hits the fan this year, and I bought a few cans of the stuff. Haven’t had it since I was a kid. It’s actually not half bad.It’s crunchy, savory, and usually has a better texture than the popped popcorn which just gets stuck in your teeth. I crunch un-popped kernels and I’m never going to stop.It's basically the same thing. It's full of fake shit that no one actually really cares about, everyone's trying to keep up appearances. The difference being my life and career actually depends on it. I've stopped caring about instagram but it's not like i can just drop linkedin unless i want finding a job significantly harderI know asking someone for a source seems lazy, and I've had so many people telling me to "just google it."

No. I want the exact same source you have. Looking it up myself might end with me having a different source or even a different take and we wont have the same understanding.

So when someone asks for a source, dont be a jerk and just give them a source.

Edit: citing personal experience is also a perfectly acceptable source, though a bit more open to ridicule.Then can you try to learn a little more English better before you post, please? I understand it's not your first language but if you somehow manage to stumble upon Reddit then your English must be at least proficient enough to read the content being posted.I'm going to explain  a debate I had recently which infuriates me. I was talking to my friends girlfriend about the fact Tom Holland was a very one dimensional actor. She's jumped on the marvel band wagon after she used to laugh at me for being an adult but liking comic books. Since her children started to love spiderman Tom Holland is the best thing since sliced bread. 

Tom is a  good spiderman and from what I've heard a bloody good human being but you will never see him get nominated  for an Oscar. I could be wrong in the future but i believe he will be another generic Hollywood actor. 

Back to the conversation... she had the audacity to laugh at me for expecting robert Pattinson to be a good batman. Mentioning twilight and that he's a cringey actor. I tried to bring up his movies 'good time' and the 'lighthouse' but all I got back was her lack of knowledge about those films even existing. 

Then it went on to the spiderman debate about he's the best actor out of those 3 (Toby, Andrew and Tom) again I said no way. Andrew garfield  is a lot more versatile and has been nominated  for best actor twice now. Sony just done him a little dirty as I thought he acted well with what he had. I watched uncharted yesterday and Tom brought nothing to the table. 

I get Tom is loved but don't say to me he's a good actor because he's not shown anything that suggests he is. 

Respectfully I know he's does a lot of his own stunts for spiderman that's pretty cool. He's a athletic guy but don't bring that into the argument either.This was not my opinion when they were released. I grew up on the original trilogy, books, and video games. Then prequels started coming out when I was 11. I loved them; the 6 movie Vader arc was this perfect, complete saga. I would bend over backwards trying to explain away the myriad plot holes, stupid ideas, and continuity breaks. 

     Then Disney purchased the rights. They tore into the holy place for the abomination that made desolate. My beloved collection of stories, filling bookcases, relegated to mere legends. I couldn’t even bring myself to read the new “canonical” books. I managed to watch the Disney movies, and even found the spin-offs to be tolerable, but the trilogy was a train wreck. If it weren’t for The Mandolorian, I’d have given up entirely. Treasuring my obsolete collection alongside the equally dated childhood it represents.
     If this were the end, this would make for a fair popular opinion, but a few days ago it dawned on me, “Hey kid, it ain’t that kinda movie.” I had spent 25 years building up this wacky space melodrama like it was some kind of sacred text. The truth is the originals weren’t very good.  It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. But somehow, I call it luck; Lucas’s Star Wars pulled off a magic that captivated me for a quarter century. I just explained away the bad because I was having fun.
     So, I just finished rewatching the sequels, and I loved them. They weren’t better than the originals, but it would’ve been hard to be much worse. Most importantly, I had fun with it all.
     TLDR: Disney Star Wars was just as good as the original, from a certain point of view.Not only is unsweetened tea better for you, it also tastes better. The stuff put inside sweetened tea is absolutely disgusting, and I’ve never had a sweetened tea that I’ve liked. I genuinely don’t get why people feel they need to add stuff to it. That’s my tastebuds arguing at least.I've seen a lot of people on reddit who absolutely hate pit bulls because of their owners actions. It sickens me to see how casually people will talk about stabbing,shooting,breaking bones,suffocating and even burning them alive.
I understand that a pit bulls original purpose was to entertain people by putting them in a pit with a bull and to watch the bull kill the dog or the dog kill the bull.

But hate is a taught thing not something someone is born with. I don't understand why nobody goes after these owners who haven't socialized their dogs when other dogs are seen or even having them on leashes or securely kept on the owners property. A lot of the times these dogs are aggressive because as puppies they are taught to be aggressive with play or even straight out attack other animals,usually for the purpose of sick entertainment or dog fighting. 
I feel this breed has been given such a bad wrap for their owners lack of responsibility. Any dog can be aggressive and dangerous if taught that that is okay behavior from a young age. It dosnt matter what breed.We are constantly fed an endless stream of bad news and terrible things from all around the world. If nothing bad happened in your town today, it did in the next state over or another country. It's no wonder we have such an issue with metal health these days. I believe we are meant to only be concerned with our immediate surroundings/neighbor/village. How many things would you be completely unaffected/aware of if it weren't for media. If you scale back your circle of concern, I think most people would find themselves much happier.People say " You read so many books you must be so smart". Books are work of fiction just like movies, tv series or anime. A person who reads books for entertainment is no different from a person who watches TV series for entertainment. The only thing you learn from reading books are words that no one uses. You can learn all sorts of information from other forms of entertainment too. 

Ever since  the internet became popular, books aren't the only source of knowledge. You can learn from watching Youtube all day Or use reddit. Reading books can actually make you less smart if you read older books which are bound to have misinformation. 

A person who reads lots of books is no smarter than a person who uses reddit all day. Stop saying someone is smarter because they read books.

Edit: ever since* not science.I hear everyone talk about how they’re “mourning someone who is still alive” but it will never be the same as losing your dad or your mom to death, something that is, in every sense, irreversible. Saying you’re “mourning” someone who is alive is kind of disrespectful to someone who is actually mourning.People hate on bts without knowing anything about them. While I agree that their vocals are not extraordinary but their rap line is solid. Their songs have beautiful lyrics. They have songs for every mood. It's upsetting that many people Judge them just because of their 3 English songs which they didn't even write themselves.
You don't have to like them but whenever I asked haters why they hate Bts they just said that Bts make trash music but in reality, they don't even know their songs.**The exception being if someone is using cheats or exploits to gain an unfair advantage.** Otherwise, you are an absolute crybaby if you complain about other people being better than you. If you don't want to "try," then you should play offline against bots on easy mode. Better yet, if you really don't want to "try," then don't play the game at all.

If something is a feature in the game, and if someone can afford decent internet or a good surround sound headset, etc... it is all fair play. If you prefer to play at a disadvantage, that is on you. Other people don't have to cater to your enjoyment, and crying about it won't gain you any sympathy.I saw from my last post on this sub about vanilla ice cream and hot sauce, that someone said grilled cheese and grape jelly sounded weird. It might be, but that doesn't make it less good. People already eat grapes and cheese on skewer thingies, so this isn't much different, except for the bread, and the vast amounts of sugar. And sugar makes everything better. You won't change my mine from this. Ever.I mean, by the sites. Not so sure about gov't.

Im talking about videos where people expose themselves or masturbate in a park, store or a parking lot. My understanding is it technically isnt a crime if no one sees you, but how many times has someone been seen while they were filming that and made other people uncomfortable? What if kids see it in public catch you? Even the risk is enough for it not to be allowed

You should not be doing that unless you are in a forest or something and it is outrageous that all these porn sites and social media companies profit off of it. They ban rape fantasy and age play stuff all the time, and that is just a pretend.E.g., university, career choice.
I think at a certain point, telling people this does more harm than good. I say this because, if you delay your degree by 1 year, you might graduate at 22, but delay it by 2 years, you graduate at 23 while your peers might've gotten a bachelor's AND a master's by then.

By 25, if you still don't have a solid career out of your degree, you start to feel like shit. 

Having it figured out is much, much better than not having it figured out.

Telling people to "take your time" reinforces the notion that indecision is a good thing. It's not. Good advice = take your life and time seriously. One year is a lot of time. Two years is a lot of time. And five years is a hella lot of time. 

Truth is, we still live in a world that runs on social scripts (a psychology term). You complete these milestones by this age, you can support yourself financially at this age, etc. If you don't follow that script, you're below average. And that sucks. So don't listen to people who tell you that you still have time. You don't.

Work hard. Discipline yourself. Finish your degree on time. And if you still don't know what to do with your life, don't waste time stuck in limbo. If you want to pay off your loans from your first degree or work a low-paying job to explore your field of interest, or if you want to do something knowing it will get you to where you want to be or help you to understand where you want to be, do that. But don't believe for one second that you can take your time. Your time and life is valuable. Treat it that way.

It's an anomaly to have "older" people go back to school or do a major career change. It doesn't seem like an anomaly because people post on here about it all the time, but it is. Trust me, I'm one of those people. But I definitely wish that I hadn't thought it was "okay" to take time to do XYZ, because you start to feel that you haven't done anything with your life. So please, don't do what I did. Be careful how you spend your early 20s. Don't waste it by age 25.We're so egotistical to think we have the power to destroy the Earth. It will heal itself, give it a million years - which is not a lot for a planet. Our home is just going to evict us, if we keep going this way.Its crazy to me how ok people are ok with being drunk really offten. Or drinking a lot offten. I think its wrong. Like 2 drinks seems like the ok amount of alcohol for a normal person. More just seems like a problem. The amount of co workers who would regularly tell me they drank a 36 pack last night or a whole bottle of jack ect is concerning. And maybe it be ok if the other people i worked with had of said "bro this happens too offten" but they all where totally on bord with it and say "you should have called me i would have come over. With another 36 pack". The amount of wives or husbands iv seen who drank a reasonable amount with there partners being drunk while there sitting there looking embarrassed while this completely differently person gose around acting like a fool. Then the next day everyone laughs and jokes about it like it was really cool. People regularly talking about how they drove home drunk, or drank so much last night they where still drunk from last night then drove to work drunk and worked drunk till it wore off like wtf. 

Like the specific moment that really set me off recently was this guy at a restaurant i was at came in drunk ordred more drinks was flerting really hard with these older women infront of his wife. His wife seem embarrassed and he starts talking about how offten he drinks and is drunk then talks about how his son who is 22 and dosent drink and how hes a grate kid. And im happy his kid is a good kid but the fact his son dosent drink at all with a dad who dose tells me his son choice was because he has grown up seeing what drinking dose to his dad and dosent want thst for himself. 

Now i dont know this guy from any other dude. Maybe im wrong. But its just an all around the bord thing that im tired of. Why do we all allow people to think its ok to have drinking problems? Why do we idolize this? Why dont we all just tell people thats a problem, dont drink and drive. Its not cool and its doing more damage than not.Had to resolve an issue from a stock sale on my 2019 return. Dreading the process ahead of time, and assuming I’d have to snail mail or fax documentation, I gave the IRS a call. 

Expecting the worst, I was informed it’d be a 40-60 minute wait time, **but** they would hold my place in line and they’d call me when it’s my turn. **I love this feature in call queues by the way, and it’s becoming more common.**

I was able to make breakfast, get some work done, and 45 minutes later, phone rings. Very polite and professional sounding agent identifies herself with badge # and confirms my identity. She says “if you mail this, it’ll take 25 weeks, and if you fax it’ll take 10, so I can take the information on this call.”

No more than 10 minutes later, she’s sending me a closing letter… saving me $8000 in taxes from a reporting error (thanks e-Trade). 

I was expecting customer service marginally worse than the US postal service provides, but I’d say other than a long wait time which is mitigated with a callback, it was very pleasant and convenient.I am not sure this is unpopular, and I am guessing has already been posted- so delete if need be.

But Michael Jackson sucks. His music is insanely overrated. None of it is anything special. Fine, make your arguments about how he influenced music. I don’t care. It’s not great, and if he didn’t then someone else would have.

He is so wildly revered it makes no sense to me. Best case scenario for him is that he had an insanely unhealthy and inappropriate relationship with kids, and at worst he was a child predator and rapist. There is no music or contribution to culture that can make up for that regardless of how much people like it. Yet there is constantly impersonators, tributes, and shows for him. There was even a major cirque du solei show dedicated to him in Las Vegas. There are so many more artists deserving of higher praise and regard than him even if you remove the allegations against him, and with them it makes no sense to me that he is still popular.


TLDR: Michael Jackson is overrated and in all likelihood a child predator and sucks in all regards.Unless Im applying for a top tier position along side a hundred other candidates and you really need something over the top to sort through the candidate, my resume and interview should be more than enough for you. I hate the idea of having to come up with an essay that is nothing but trying to bullshit my way into a position. There are plenty of people qualified for a job that may not have good essay writing skills.

Ive seen underqualified people get jobs over much more qualified people, just because they know how to bullshit and talk themselves up in the cover letter, while the other guy sucks at writing essays and introductions. It was an accounting job, and had nothing to do with writing skills so the cover letter was worse than useless, it got them to hire a scam artist that didnt deserve the job.I’m probably gonna get downvoted to hell but here we go,  every time that happened to me, nobody was RKOing me into the cake, it was just a light tap, into the side of the cake, not like I got hurt emotionally or physically, it was harmless fun. And I can say the same for a lot of parties I’ve been toVideo games were sold for $60 back in the 1980s, just to consider inflation alone, it should be around $200 per game in 2022.

We are alright with paying more for everything but games. That means studios need to release games faster, developers have to work much harder or just release free to play full of microtransactions games. More expensive games give the studios more runway before each release and remove some of the pressure.

Remember, whenever we get a product for less than its cost, we become the product.I’m not talking about the short pole flags that attach to the front of the house. I mean the big in-ground full-size flag poles in front yards in the suburbs. Every time I see one it just looks out of place, too big for the property, taller than the house, and just plan obnoxious.I don’t know if this is unpopular, I’ve just never seen this opinion discussed. Normally I’m fairly normal/average when it comes to a lot of “trigger warning” type things, especially text based ones. I know how to stop reading something if its gonna bother me. I’ve seen a lot of people demand trigger warnings for what I think are pretty ridiculous things. 

Car wreck videos, though, always pop up when I least expect them and are so fast that I’ve seen it before I realize what’s happening. And it’s so common for them to be posted everywhere.

Even when I modify my feeds to exclude content like that, it manages to pop up in front of me anyway. Just now I saw one from a recommended sub on my feed and all I could do was click “show me less”. Which honestly probably reflected the content of the sub and not the video. 

I have intense driving anxiety to the point where some days it impedes my ability to drive confidently or to follow through with plans I’ve made. My therapist said that it’s a normal and valid fear (after all, you can’t tell me that every ask Reddit thread on what’s more deadly than people realize doesn’t usually have cars at the top). We’re just working on working through it and finding ways to live despite that. 

These videos that just come at me never fail to push back my progress at random times and it’s frustrating that it’s such a commonly accepted content to post and share and consume. There’s hardly follow up on the survival of the people involved and sometimes it seems unlikely.Got roasted by the table at dinner when I voiced this opinion. And to clarify, I’m not a masochist by any means. And the tingling feeling doesn’t always feel good. More so right when it’s starting or after you’re through the worst of it. Sometimes if the limb only had its circulation cut off shortly and the needling feeling is light it feels good the whole time but very rarely. truthfully if you don’t move the limb at all it kinda feels good.I like the occasional chicken burger especially if its spicy. Maybe I've never tried American ones like Popeyes so maybe they are THAT good. But I just don't see why there were people fighting over them. A beef burger just makes sense in your mouth. Beef and bread just go together. Also steak sandwiches. Even a fish burger tastes better. Chicken is just unsatisfying and doesn't hit the spot. Its so stringy (that's if its not pulverised mush) and almost gelatinous in texture. Then with all the sloppy mcdonalds cum mayo. I feel dirty after eating a chicken burger. At least with a beef burger you know they can grill the crap out of it and it doesn't have to be pretty. Basically outside of Reddit I have never seen this obsession with chicken sandwiches (a name that pisses me off). It seems to be confined to america. You invented the burger, have some goddam respect for it.Recently, India burnt up and disposed of drugs worth roughly 58 million dollars and I just find it an absolute waste of resources, sure it’s illegal to consume drugs but are you really going to tell me we couldn’t sell it to a country or a company abroad which could process it? Use the money for anything else?Literally any and everyone. Every individual on this planet can get into a relationship, there is no one who is just too ugly to date. Even the most unattractive, unappealing person possible can date. Getting into a relationship isn’t impossible at allThey literally have one job, and they’re terrible at it. I never use pillows. There’s no reason for your head to be lifted up like that, people only put pillows on their beds because it’s standard practice. 

A small, thin blanket scrunched up makes a far better pillow. You can actually adjust it and get your neck at a comfortable angle. You can shape it to have it fill in the area under your neck and provide support without lifting your head so high. Every pillow on the market is awful.Firstly, the maps were fantastic. Especially the castle one, I loved it so much. The multiplayer was so much fun, gun game was awesome and I used to spend hours on it. The kill streaks were also awesome. The nuke that you could put on regular multiplayer maps, not to mention the helicopter where YOU were the sniper, that was incredible. The skins were awesome, and the gameplay wasn’t over-the-top or super unrealistic. Finally, my favorite part of the game, the INFECTED mode. Oh my GOD I loved it so much. I vividly remember putting myself in the elevator and holding the line with friends as they tried to get us, defending parts of the castle with friends to fight back or go on that palm tree and try to rack up as many kills as I could. I didn’t like the campaign very much at all, but the multiplayer MORE than made up for it. Deserves much more credit imo.Everybody raves on about how great Nutella is. Pizza places around my area only have one dessert option and it’s Nutella pizza too!!!

So many better spreads out thereInternet generations made Rick Astley's resilience song "Never Gonna Give You Up", which is a song that I love, and I love the meme as well.

The meme of Rick Rolling, for those of you who don't know, consists on sending a link to someone while lying to them that the link will send you to somewhere desirable (you trick them into thinking they will gain something out of clicking it, or at least, that was the META in the old times). Then, if the person is naive enough, they are sent straight into "Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley" video music, and they look like fools for believing your trick.

Now, this is a great prank, because:

1. the prank is harmless, or even the opposite of harmless, as the song itself is a banger
2. it requires the victim to "act" first, then react, contrary to some dumb pranks that think getting people's reactions (such as jumpscares, damages, and humiliation)
3. it somehow teaches you to be more careful with links
4. it is easy to spread and teach others about it. even when someone who has no idea of what Rick Rolling is, they can easily get the joke, and enjoy pranking others.   
And those who already know about it, will feel even more foolish for falling into such an obvious trap
5. even though you make the victim feel like fools, both of you can still have a great time

It is generally great that the meme is booming again, newer cultures experience the feeling of being friendly betrayed, and they keep the song/music culture alive. No harsh words are spread, no negativity, no irresponsibility.

BUT...... I don't think it works the same if you "Rick Roll" me through a video instead of a link to a video. The punchline of the joke is that you first believe that the link will lead you to a desired place, but when you least expect it, you realize you are watching Rick Astley's foot mashing a potato on the ground.  
The other format of "Rick Rolling", however, makes it so that the punchline is that you fail to predict that the video is actually planning something else, and when you least expect it, the video transitions into a clip of Never Gonna Give You Up. It is still funny, and sometimes you really get tricked, but it's not the same of speculating whether you are about to be Rick Rolled or not.

The first, is funny because you trick someone into watching the video.

The second, because the media unexpectedly transitions into a Rick Rolls.

It just isn't the same vibe of being betrayed, especially in an environment when you are almost guaranteed to look at the screens, like in golf stadium, powerpoint presentations, or sharing your screen with someone, Why would I look away if someone is showing me something ? At least in the format of a link I can **decide** whether it is suspicious or not. 

I am not here to gatekeep anything, I don't think we should create a new term for this special case of Rick Rolling, and I am not against the idea of Rick Rolling in any way. 

I just think that, if I were shown a piece of the videoclip "Never Gonna Give You Up", but not through a misleading link, then I am not counting it a Rick Roll.i’m not religious and therefore i don’t think i was born with a purpose but i actually find it liberating. Anything i do, i do because i want to, not beacuse it was my “pupose” or because someone told me to.

Once you accept that you don’t have an actual objective purpose you understand the truth, you are here to enjoy yourself and you only keep on living to continue enjoying yourself, when you realize that, things  like “leaving my mark on the world” “accomplishing great things” “having something to live for” 
become secondary. By this i don’t mean that you shouldn’t try to do great things, but you should only do it because you want to, never because you thought you have to.

I think having a “purpose” it’s  like being a sentient toaster, why would you give sentience to a toaster if it existe with the soul purpose of toasting bread? i find that thought horrifying.Seems you can't join many discussions about video games without inevitably someone smugly going on about how much better it was in the old days, or the "golden age" as they like to put it, and I get it. I was there, I've played PS1, PS2, N64, GameCube, SNES, etc. I love the occasional visit to local arcades. I was stuck with older generation consoles because we didn't have the money for the new stuff, whilst everyone was playing the Wii U and Xbox One, I was playing a PS2 and DSLite. It was great fun and I understand where these people are coming from... but I vehemently disagree with the notion that gaming then was better than gaming now.


If you take off the nostalgia glasses for a brief moment the cracks of this so-called "Golden Age" shine through. It seems while everyone remembers all the positives, they all conveniently ignore the negatives. 


Bugs and balance issues are two of the big ones that comes to mind for me, for an example _Soul Calibur III_ had a quaint little glitch where by deleting older games from your Memory Card (or hell just even having saves for old games on your memory card) could activate a glitch where, randomly, for no rhyme or reason, your entire save file got corrupted. This could be 3 hours after the glitch activates or 300 hours, and there's jack shit you can do to fix it. This could be even worse on old PC gaming such as _Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor_ where because of some shoddy coding uninstalling the game would delete core operating system files and brick your computer. Of course there is the positive that some bugs, i.e N64 Cartridge Tilting (which you shouldn't have done either but I digress) could lead to really funny results, but in this case I think the negatives outweigh the positives.


Nowadays, if games came out with _that bad_ of bugs they're rightfully ripped into and if the developers are competent (not saying all modern devs are, mind you) the bug gets patched out and fixed for free. And yes some games released today _are_ buggy (looking at you two, Ubisoft and Bethesda.) but I'd rather have the assurance that most bugs tend to be on the minor-ish side and if there are really bad ones that cause big problems there's the ability to have it fixed across all versions of the game through a simple game patch. I see the "Golden Age" crowd argue that games today are super buggy because devs release them unfinished, as if all the games back in the Vth and VIth generation ran perfectly and I've had enough save data corruptions, DOA games, and absolute glitchfests in my day to testify that they absolutely did _not_. So yeah, I appreciate the fact bugs _can_ be fixed now without needing to rerelease games or jump through a dozen hoops.


Balancing is another thing saved by the miracle that is being able to patch games. I think anyone with _Goldeneye 007_ remembers having that _one dick_ who'd always pick Oddjob for multiplayer shootouts, or knew the exact overtuned combos to unleash in Street Fighter. And if you wanted the most up to date balancing and roster for a game, well that's an entire new game you had to fork out the money for - in many cases an entire new _console_. While balancing, of course, is still a tricky subject today and very few games strike a perfect balance. I appreciate the fact balancing is something that _can_ be gradually ironed out without needing to buy the newest game in the series.


Content updates are also great, I love RPGs (them and platformers are my favorite genre, ever since I was a kid I've loved them) and most recently FFXIV has been a right ol' treat for me, and while yes since it's an MMORPG it has a subscription and expansions to take into consideration, but you know what I'm gonna get to enjoy in a month or two effectively free of charge? More Final Fantasy with the 6.1 content update. And the same goes for other genres, if you like Horde Shooters _Deep Rock Galactic_ is getting a massive update here soon, _Halo Infinite_ is pretty regularly updated from what I see, and while I was dunking on Ubisoft earlier, For Honor still gets updates semi-regularly 5 years later.


And lastly the sheer scope of games available nowadays is great, yeah there's the mainstream stuff - Mostly shooters and Battle Royale games which aren't my cup of tea usually. But that's honestly fine because there's so many options readily available to me that I do enjoy, and if they're not on an online storefront, I can order them online without needing to worry about if my local game store has so and so in stock or if they even ordered it in the first place.


So yes, I just think gaming is in a better spot overall than it was in the olden days and the wider gaming scope on the internet needs to take off the nostalgia glasses for a moment, especially if they're going to be "critical" or "analytical" about it.


TL:DR - The internet unfairly emphasizes modern gaming's faults whilst ignoring its positives, whilst doing the opposite for the "Golden Age" of the N64/PS1 era and similar, emphasizing the positives whilst ignoring the many faults.Don’t get me wrong, horror is my favorite fictional genre. But there’s no way I’m gonna lose sleep over any fictional setting or character. 

The best way to experience horror is when you’re young and can actually get frightened by it. That’s what a lot of children already do. Worst case scenario, they watch a scary movie or play a scary game, and get spooked for awhile. Boo hoo. And then they realize that what’s being displayed on the screen isn’t gonna hurt them, and have a nice laugh about it once they get older.

You could argue that maybe horror is unhealthy for some children, but I think children are objectively the best audience for the genre, unless we’re talking about “intellectual” stuff like Shining, which a child wouldn’t even be able to understand or appreciate.it's okay to be selfish at times whenever your so called "hidden gem" of a song get popular to the point teenagers on tiktok are doing dances on it. it's okay to be selfish because you have a sense of belonging to it, it's not like by you gatekeeping it would affect the artist in a large scale.I was watching the Olympics and you can't see shit. If you actually try to follow the puck you can't see what's going on in the game and you just get dizzy. It's impossible to learn the game and how it flows because you have spend so much time concentrating. This would increase viewers and spread the game.When I read an ingredient list, I want to know what's in the product I'm considering buying.  Terms like "Fragrance", "Natural Flavors" and "Natural Colors" don't tell me anything. 

Where are they getting these scents, colors and flavorings?  Will I end up covered in red bumps? Is is something illegal in 26 countries that is only deemed safe here because a corporation hired good lobbyists? Is it that musk they take from beavers' anal glands? That's not cool. Don't mess with beavers.

Not only are we kept in the dark from unethically sourced and gross ingredients. We are kept in the dark about ingredients that we would otherwise avoid for health reasons.

People with sensitive skin can never know if the "fragrance" on the ingredient list is going to make them break out.  

We are told "only use unscented products!" like it's a happy solution to avoid products that harm our skin. Trouble is, "unscented" products usually smell bad.

What's even worse is that those with gluten allergies and celiac disease need to avoid all things with "natural flavors" because the natural flavors frequently involve gluten and other allergens. This makes already-restrictive diets needlessly more restrictive. 

I know it's common to believe that what you don't know can't hurt you, but when you have an allergy, what you don't know can kill you.Why am I hearing this phrase so often? I hear this sentence quite a bit, and it’s never paired with an intelligent or witty criticism. It’s a phrase that cowardly haters love to tack on to an uninteresting insult. Yeah, it can get annoying if someone only talks about one thing - but lets get more creative than that same phrase as a catchall. If you’re going to be a hater on someone else’s interests, do it with pizazz! 
 
I guess tl;dr it’s a boring dunk that’s getting used too much, and is starting to feel like graphic tee sarcasm. Insult with creativity! Find something particular to hate about their interests! You’re calling someone uninteresting for having an obsession, but using the least interesting way to do it. I want to know exactly why you hate that person.Not even because of the environment, I'm not really sure why, I just like it drying out my face a little and then the cold drink comes through and quenches it.

But hey, I know I'm in the minority. You do you.Basically, if that child has retained memory of you as their father and you have treated them as such and you ditch them, it still makes you a crappy human being to do that to a child. I’m not saying you should be paying child support (that’s another subject matter), but you should continue to be in their life even if you don’t want to be called their father anymore. At least be there. The amount of emotional trauma that does to a 5 year old far out weighs what you can handle as an adult. I get it hurts, it’s infuriating, but that child depends on you as an adult to be able to handle the burdens they can’t. End rant.Every James Bond film follows a very similar formula that is usually full of poorly written one dimensional characters. 

Daniel Craig got a ton of recognition for adding surface level depth to a character and gets praise for revolutionizing the franchise..

The grandeur around “who’s going to be the next bond” is usually more interesting than the actual films themselves.

The fact that they need the same dialogue “Bond, James Bond”, “Shaken, not stirred” plays to the lowest common denominator of peoples nostalgia. 

Everything about these films is bad with the exception of exotic locations and occasional cinematic shots. They are out of date and need to go away.i do think both movies are good, but what bothers me is how inside out was formulated to tug at your heart strings. it’s not genuine, it’s created to automatically feel emotions. much like commercials with the same calculated chords to cause shivers and tears.

good dinosaur is beautiful in terms of graphics. i’m not saying it’s the best or high in top 10 pixar movies, but it felt just a tad more genuine than inside out.

please make no mistake—i love every pixar movie to have come out, but two movies coming out the same year arises as a comparisonMicheal makes pretty good music, and he was incredibly influencial to pop music, and music as a whole, and hes done a lot for the genre.

but in terms of quality of music, he's overrated by some imo. There are lot of other artists like the beatles, bob dylan, radiohead, kendrick lamar, and kanye west, who have achived more acclaim from music fans and critics, and id argue they make better music for all of the right reasons. I simply dont think MJ is the goat of music like some say, and there are other, better contenders for that.

Edit: okay okay I spelled Michael wrong I get it guysI get it, having games be about 60€ includes the fee of paying the developers **and** production costs to actually get them on discs and what not

but what's the point of having them the same price online when there are no production costs outside of paying the developers?I love Boba Fett as much as the next Star Wars nerd, but I hate how The Book of Boba Fett has 2 Mandalorian episodes that just set up Mando season 3. I was ok with checking up on how Mando was going in episode 5. It’s a fine episode. Episode 6 is where I draw the line. 

We don’t need to check up with Grogu. I get he sells a lot of toys, but the whole thing could have been an off screen mention. We didn’t need Asoka to call Luke “Master”. We didn’t need Grogu to return in the last episode. We didn’t need Luke to offer Grogu a lightsaber. We didn’t need any of this. Mandalorian got his own series, sadly Boba Fett can’t get the same.

Another problem is how much we lost spending time with characters from The Mandalorian. Cad Bane really deserves more screen time then LUKE SKYWALKER in a story about Boba Fett. But he doesn’t get it. Cause Disney had so little faith in The Book of Boba Fett, that it couldn’t go with having Mandalorian season 3 squeezed in there. I wanted to see more of Boba Fett, Cad Bane, the black Wokie. But no, get Asoka instead. This wouldn’t be a problem for me if it wasn’t invading someone else’s story to do so.

Edit: I guess this wasn’t that clear. Ima try to word it this way: Everyone thinks as long as Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau are writing that it’s all ok. My point was that this isn’t the case. A lot of people say that Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau are the saviors that Star Wars needs. Star Wars ain’t getting saved. My point is in the end, this universe is the same universe in which Anikan says he doesn’t like sand. This show felt like it had sequel style focus. Even Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau aren't perfect and will have ok stories like this. I don’t hate the episodes (except episode 6 which didn’t need Grogu in there). I hate how little confidence there was in this show, that confidence is reminiscent to the sequel trilogy. That my point. Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau can make bad Star Wars content too. A sequel trilogy with them as writers won’t be any better, hell it may be worse.I feel like this has to be an unpopular opinion because every time I see this comment it has hundreds of upvotes. I don’t give a rat’s ass that a video is fake. Basically everything is fake in the modern day. I want to laugh. And you writing “fake” just automatically makes the post less funny and now I’m not laughing and annoyed at you. I don’t get why people love comments like that or even care about if a video is fake. Entertainment is entertainment. People don’t comment “fake” every time the Bachelor or something pops up. We all know that the producers script the hell out of it and force unnecessary interactions. So why do we care when a short video on the internet is fake. Stop feeling superior because you only like “real stuff” and just let us enjoy what we enjoy without ruining it
Now I am not saying all parents aren’t teach their kids not to wipe their ass but it just came to me that potty toilet has all the necessities of a toilet expect a toilet paper. I think for all intense purposes potty toilet should include tiny roll for toilet paper. I think it can just get misconstrued. I think for a child if the toilet paper would be attach the “ potty toilet “ it would complete the “training”Downvote me to hell but remakes like charmed, saved by the bell, fresh prince of belair, just stop. These shows were in their prime when they came out originally and these new remakes are absolute trash, just let their memories be preserved instead of trying to create new ones.Best examples of random humor is like Sbubby or YTP. A good YTP is enough to make me laugh but if I just scroll through r/sbubby, I will eventually start laughing so hard I need to breathe. Random humor is like the little knee hammer at a doctor's visit. All it needs to do is lightly tap you for jokes and your reaction hammers back harder.The visuals are great and the song is greater. Most people cite that the harmonica at the begining sounds bad as the reason they don't like it, but ignoring that I think it sounds really cool, it's like 5 seconds at the beginning. That can't be the entire reason you don't like itLet me clarify before Reddit grabs up their torches and pitchforks. I’m in no way saying that anyone deserves to have this happen to them. But relationships end and sometimes there’s bad blood.

Not victim blaming, but if you don’t send nudes in the first place there’s zero chance they can be leaked. We live in a digital age where everything put online or sent through a phone can be stored and shared easily.

If your ex is vindictive and decides to start showing them off it sucks, but again if you had never sent them in the first place it wouldn’t be an issue.

EDIT: For all the people accusing me of victim blaming, please take two seconds and reread the second sentence of my post. Either people don’t know what victim blaming is or they’re just projecting their own baggage onto what I wrote.jelly bean is continiously ruining comment sections with the comments "its not a mistake, its a masterpiece" also she is trying way too hard to be funny even tho she isnt even close to being.Pick up trucks may make you feel a lot cooler than cruising around in a minivan. However, in terms of actual functional use, minivans beat pickup trucks pretty much every time.

• Stow and go seating let’s you load a lot more stuff into your minivan than you could ever fit into a truck bed

• You don’t have to tie stuff down or worry about it falling out

• You can carry more people and a lot more comfortably

• Minivans are WAY cheaper to get than pickup trucks

Even though people may think people in minivans are lame, they have the satisfaction of knowing they’re actually winning.Medicine is an obvious one as the benefits to humanity are easy to acknowledge(even if you're against the testing). I've seen a documentary that was hard to watch where they gave monkeys brain trauma that replicated what it was like to be in a car accident. These tests lead to improved safety features in cars. But I hate to upset some people when I'm going to say if the advances in technology are just.... cool(you know what I'm talking about. Neurolink) then the testing doesn't bother me either. Advance medicine. Advance technology. We can always breed more animals for testing.I could give a shit less about how much people feel like they need them. I could give a shit less about how expensive they are now. If $10-11 bucks a fucking day is starting to get expensive then start smoking the cheaper brands or stop smoking three packs a day, Robert. 

I've had a customer at the gas station I work at once tell me the business I work for was exploiting people who smoke. It's not really exploitive when you can smoke cheaper cigarettes or go somewhere else for them where you KNOW they're cheaper.I remember in Elementary school, anytime someone wanted to give a Valentine to someone. They'd have to make one for everyone else. (Or you could give it in secret.) The stores even knew this, they sold boxes with like 60 valentines. As if anyone was gonna use that much on an individual perrson. 

Google says, "When someone says that you are their "valentine," they are simply choosing you as the person that they would like to show fondness to on that special day. When people are married or dating, it is assumed that they are automatically the other person's valentine due to the romantic relationship that they hold"


So it doesn't mean it has to be someone you love, not my point which is what I'm assuming most people would argue. But personally, I don't give a FUCK about any of my classmates. If anything I actually hate a few of them. And you could only every give these cards away if you were moderately popular. (Which I wasn't).If I wanted to give people a valentine, I'd do it on my own terms. Not because I was told to. But the schools didn't want us to. And I'm sure most of us would. 

Luckly, in highschool this annoying rule evaporated into nothingness. Unfortunately, I've still never recieved a Valentine other than from family, which is good enough I guess. Thats why this is a unpopular opinion, seems to be my hatred manifestation.


Edit: Seems it was for psychological reason. Not to be rude or anything but at some point in everyone's life, we'll feel and be excluded. Just how society works. So it doesn't really matter. But I see application. Just better they learn it earlyAll you have to say is, "i like your hair, its cute." "I like your boots" lol.

my girlfriend likes cute boots.

"omg your hair is so cute." "omg your boots are so cute."

"omg your girlfriend is AMAZING." "omg your kids are beautiful! awwwww."

Dude, my girlfriend. Dude my boyfriend just like, says shit lol.

Im just thankful we don't have much to worry about. lol.Hamilton was awful and only gets worse the more I hear it. 
The music from “Encanto” was just as bad. 
The whole thing where everyone is singing different lyrics at the same time in every song gets old quickly. 
I can’t be the only one who finds him overrated.I’d love to hear differing opinions from people who love the area, or people who nominate a different city. After living in Minneapolis for over a year, here are my reasons:

It’s the coldest major city in the country.

The extremely high cost of living coupled with Minnesota being a top five state in highest tax burden is terrible.

It feels like a massive soulless suburbia with little to offer besides built-up shopping areas and malls.

The people are very passive-aggressive. Minnesota Nice is overblown in the Twin Cities.

There’s an identity crisis in which it tries to be a fast-paced no-bullshit East Coast city, but still wants to claim Midwestern values.

The highway system has not been able to support the population growth. Traffic has become one of the worst among major cities.

The job market is very competitive. Both in my and my wife’s field (business & health), our salaries are not ideal compared to most big cities in the country when adjusted for cost of living.

It lacks the redeemable quality of being on a coast (ocean or Great Lakes).

It seems less diverse and cultured than other Midwest cities I’ve visited like Milwaukee or Chicago.

The food scene is mediocre for the price. I still can’t find a genuinely enjoyable brunch spot.

The bicyclists are very intrusive to drivers.


There are my main reasons. Now, let me list what I like about Minneapolis so I can be completely fair!

The summer is elite. However, it gets so humid that I struggle to justify enduring the winter when it’s just as humid in more southbound areas.

The fall is classic Midwest gorgeous.

It’s a great place for hockey, and it has led me to enjoy the sport. It’s fun to watch the Wild play whether in a popular spot or a dive bar. It’s cool to watch people playing hockey on the frozen lakes, too.

The area is pretty clean for a such a large city.

The metro is close to some beautiful gems in Minnesota like Crow Wing county and Duluth.

Lakes in the summer are a blast, and there are plenty of them.

There you have it! I have not visited every major city in the country, but Minneapolis is really not an enjoyable home for me in the macro.For majority of people when your in a relationship you usually stop having romantic involvement with others because you have a significant other. But if your significant other isn’t being intimate with you for long periods of time you should be able to cheat. When your in a relationship you are basically agreeing to only be intimate with your SO but if they aren’t gonna be intimate with you your basically gonna have to forfeit having sex until your SO decides otherwise. That is ridiculous imo I’ve heard stories of people being in relationships where they constantly ask for sex and are told no for months to years. Obviously some circumstances are different but for majority of people there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to be intimate with your SO at least once a month.It literally makes no sense why would I want to wish my opponent good luck when I am literally trying to kick their ass and win? Like no I don't wish you any luck to beat me. Let's shake hands after the match has concluded to say "good game."My mom bought the soundtrack when I was younger and played it all the time. My siblings and I knew the songs word for word. Every time the movie comes on, I have to watch it, sing along and amazed there isn’t hype around it. My kids watched it with me when they were younger but is eh about it. My husband won’t watch it with me. What is wrong with people? This is seriously the best movie of all time!They are purely for entertainment. The jester, the fool.
The weight they carry in a world politics event is the same as a child who says the ice cream truck man was nice.
Celebrities should hold the same weight as a felon in world politics.Humans have the tendency to do good unless there is a strong incentive to do bad like protecting yourself or greed. 
This is one of the reasons why humans evolved to dominate the world. Because we looked after each other and did good. 
Yes there were wars, violence etc. but most people condemn those and would rather not have them.In what silly world did this preposterous idea originate? Paper beating rock? Doesn’t seem right to me. Not even an entire textbook could beat a rock! An assault rifle? Sure. A baseball bat? Sure. But paper? Yea fuck you dudeBut no stretch of the imagination am I condoning what the Germans did during WW2 as it is as diabolical as it gets. However the vast majority of ordinary soldiers didn’t play a part in it. The main point however is that Germany did an extraordinary job of holding on for so long in both wars when effectively it was them plus a handful of other nations vs world superpowers and their extensive list of allies. Most people know that history is written by the victors so I find it a shame how we are only taught about the disgusting nature of things that Germany did rather than their interestingly good things such as Rommel in Africa or how the soldiers held on for so long with dwindling supplies.Hi, I recently watch House of Gucci with my family and I could'nt stand that the actors talk in English but with an italian accent. If the movie is set in a foreign country, they should hire actors that speak the native language, otherwise it's just so cringe to hear them talk... In my case, I just can't  watch movies like that, evenmore when it's supossed to be a serious movie.  I am latina, and when I watch movies set in a Latin country but they speak English it's just weird.

Edit: Im shock no one is with me hahahahah, I guess it's really an unpopular opinion..well, well.. thanks guys for the discussionThe fact we call Germany - Germany and not Deutschland etc really annoys me and I think it would be wonderful if we could learn to call Countries their own name. I think it’s quite lazy and ignorant this way. Pretty niche opinion I bet but still, an opinion nonetheless.I'd argue that at least seven of the nine films nominated were better than *Parasite*. It's a good film; however, it's not a great film. It wasn't the best film that year.Sometimes if it's one of my favorite YouTubers I even watch the full ads or even two ads (Shout out to NW fishing secret ly man). But it gets annoying when I have to watch ads of a video before I even got to see what's in the video. It gets REALLY annoying when I have to watch ads for a low effort non-helpful video.title says it all. I'm not saying that the instrument sucks, songs like Für Elise are amazing and sound beautiful. It's a little hard to explain, can't find any good words for this, but piano is just seen as the "best" because of all these classical masterpieces. There are many other great instruments that don't get much attention because piano is seen to be the most superior and requiring skill the most.I don't understand how entitled people feel on the internet to say a bunch of other strangers to NOT  say "divorce" or anything about dumping their very special s/o about a situation that they shared publicly on the internet!

Like excuse me, you just told the internet that he abuses you or manipulate you into eating peanut butter and not cheese so Obviously we are going to say "REDFLAGS" "DROP HIM SIS" "DIVORCE HIM ASAP" - its just how the internet works!

and their most common reply like "omg it just happened once" or "I am not going to dump him" like damn then don't tell bunch of other strangers on the internet what to say or not say WHEN YOU COULD NOT TELL YOUR OWN SPOUSE to Stop. LMAODon't get me wrong, I have nothing against the creators who are in the dsmp, but its just getting too formulaic. The lore has gone to shit and it's just bad guys do something bad ---> good guys form secret group ---> one of the good guys is actually bad ---> war. I dont have anything against it, it's just not entertaining. My biggest belief is that you can have whatever opinions that you want, but I can also have the belief that your opinion don't make fukin sense. I used to like the earlier streams, no war, no disc bullshit, but now they've gone too far with this shitNo like literally it is so overrated, and for what?! It’s a fast food restaurant that gives you burritos that have a minuscule of meat and just a mediocre taste overall. They need to give more meat, I’m not gonna add 5 dollars more to my 20 dollar burrito for half a scoop of chicken.I don't actually know if this is unpopular it not. I work for a government agency and everyday I have to hang up the our US and state flag. And everyday I take them down. So we don't drop them, we take them inside to fold. Today, a rather aggressive man yelled at me while I was walking back inside and said I should fold the flags and I was disrespectful because "people have died for that flag."

It's a piece of fabric, get over it. You know what would happen if no one flew the American flag, nothing. Life would go on. And I'm betting not a lot of people would notice. I'm just really over the glorification of a flapping piece of textile.

Edit: I don't dislike flags because I have to hang them up everyday, it's just gotten me thinking about how pointless they are nowadays.I've tried it so many times, in so many ways but I just can't stand it. I've tried it crispy, just cooked, streaky, smoked, unsmoked, mixed in with other foods. You name it, I've tried it (probably) and its just not for me. 

When I tell people I don't like it, its normally met with an audible gasp.

I think it smells AMAZING, but the taste? Just no.Just because this person had a good business strategy and makes a lot of money does not mean they are automatically wise / life coaches. You see this everywhere on social media. Mf makes a shopify store to 100k sales, makes videos promoting his course, builds a personal brand, makes keynote talks and has an IG/Youtube posting life advice.  


As if hitting X amount on your bank account gives you some enlightenment in wisdom lol.If you're good parents you teach your kids how to help around the house,  teach them basic respect and not to talk back at critical times, and not be a fucking brat. You teach them how to live, how to do basic laundry, dishes, clean the table, take the groceries out of the bag and put it in the fridge, and how to talk with other people. 

Kids as small as 4 can help around the house(real small stuff) and at 7 or 8 can clean the house at a very reasonable level alone without their parents. 

If you say "my kids can't do X" then you didn't TEACH it. You think they send a fresh doctor from uni to do a complicated surgery on their first day? No they get TAUGHT, baby steps. A new doctor is comparable to a 4 year old. Both can't do shit and need constant overseeing, teaching them constantly how to do shit, and not mess up. You think teaching 4 year olds how to do dishes is a waste of time? It'll be worth it when they can do dishes at the age of 6 or 7. 

They learn if you teach, and then comes a day when they'll take huge amounts of work off you asses. It's the best investment.I don’t know why I do, maybe it’s cuz I’m a bad whistler. Or maybe it’s because they are enjoying there selves, but when it’s quiet and not much going on and u got that one guys that’s just whistling as loud as possible it makes me happy. Maybe it’s a jam they heard in the car on the way to work  or a bird they heard when they got up in the morning. Makes my day :)I’ve seen and experienced this many times in different job settings. An older seasoned worker sees someone young get hired and feels threaten. So they set them up for failure. Either by training them wrong or just flat out not training them. They know they are protected because they have the experience. But the younger worker is always on the chopping block. This is not the case for every older worker. Some are awesome and see the benefit of sharing their experience.Okay, so I know it's not litteraly a waste of time, I know we need it, but I fucking wish we didn't.  

Why would I want to waste my life away, being unconscious? Life is so short, we don't have long is this world. There are so many amazing things in this world, and we waste at least a third of it, letting it slip by us. 

Granted, I'd spend it playing more Video Games, but that's how I'd wish to spend my time. I do not see why people would want to sleep.Reading News allows you to go at your own pace and take time to pay attention and process the information you are taking in. For example, you can look up a word you don’t know, and come back to the text. Listening to News doesn’t allow you to pace yourself or clear up understanding of novel terminology or difficult words. Watching News replicates the effects of listening only with the added distraction of visuals. 

In short, the information that informs one’s opinions on topics otherwise considered News ought to be read and one should carefully examine that News which they see and hear.So here it is; After living in Miami for a decade and seeing female golddiggers use men for their money in such a careless and relentless manner, I laughed my ass off after seeing this documentary.

Example: I had a neighbor (Brazilian, female, late 20s) who didn’t work a day in her life, and she had 4 boyfriends all in their late 50s and they all thought they were exclusively dating her, and she basically scammed them out of a Multi million dollar apartment, Ferrari, Range Rover, Porsche, private jet trips, party weekends in Europe in super yachts, luxury watches, jewelry, ridiculously expensive wardrobe (handbags up to $40,000), etc. She had a kid and she used the kid as an excuse to not be able to see them on certain days of the week and she would leave the kid with a friend and go hang out with a different boyfriend on each day and just conniving them out of money basically every day. She had two engagement rings at the same time and it was all a huge web of lies as she was reselling her wardrobe for cash and screwing these men over. Eventually she cashed out and fled back to Brazil with God knows how much fucking money leaving all these poor old man heartbroken. I knew one of the guys, really nice guy, and he was convinced it was the real deal. Her text messages were similar to the guy in the documentary, always super affectionate and loving but would disappear and sometimes her excuses and the timing wouldn’t add up but he or looked those things because she convinced him that she was in love. She would also always be sending him links and screenshots of expensive shit that she wanted and that would “make her so happy and make her feel so complete“

Once it was over, this guy just couldn’t believe it. So sad. 

I’m not saying that what this guy in the documentary did is right, I’m just saying that it’s hilarious that when one man does this to women, it makes it to a documentary in Netflix, but there is millions of gold diggers doing similar things to men every day and nobody gives a shit.


How do I know this information? The girl that used to take care of this lady‘s son was also my neighbor in the building and we went to the same gym and little by little she would share what her friend did for a living and she was just surprised by it. She was kind of against it but maybe also a little bit jealous because she was living large and never had to work? Idk. It’s just that you don’t see a 28-year-old driving off $380,000 Ferrari daily and not having a job, just 4 different boyfriends, it was just sad for these old men. She was basically a “kept whore” with 4 sugar daddies that didn’t know that were being used. Also I would like to add that these men were retired, they were well-off but they were by no means multi millionaires that could afford all these ridiculous luxuries, they themselves lived very simply and would go the “extra mile” for their girlfriend.

Edit 1: Corrected typos.Whenever there's a post about what you find attractive in the opposite sex, sundresses come up. As a man, I do not find them attractive. Not even a bit.

If it was a black tight fitting turtleneck? Yes

Nice pants that emphases the hips? Yes

Hell I'd even take a outfit that reveals the belly over a sundress.

It's just such a lazy outfit that is little more than a potato sack with 4 holes...Pretty sure this thing came out in 2015 and every year since then there has been viral videos about it for nothing other than the fact that someone is wearing it and I guess people think it’s funny. There’s a girl I know that wears one to social events and it’s as if her entire personality is based off at this point. It’s been around long enough that the novelty has worn off and honestly it just needs to go away.It's a symptom of the society we live in. We all have bills to pay and meals to eat, from farmers to baristas. If mistreating food animals let's me feed my little sisters and myself for less money, go for it.

Edit: looks like I'm at fault for assuming most animals are mistreated as popularized by mainstream media, but I urge you guys having a knee-jerk reaction to scroll down to see some insights from people in the industry, thanks.Why are the Jeopardy! producers so infatuated with her? She is a terrible host compared to Ken Jennings, Savannah Guthrie, Buzzy Cohen, LaVar Burton, or Katie Couric. I said what I said!I have heard friends who work part-time desk-jobs (like being a bookkeeper for a school M-W and a tax preparer Th-F) that they “have to work two jobs to make ends meet”.

While this is technically true, I think that it basically amounts to 1 full time job without benefits and is unfairly being used to make it sound like they are working 80 hours a week. Even if you are working two part time jobs during the same day it maybe adds a total of 1 hour to your commute max which isn’t unsubstantial but isn’t 80 hours a week worth of work.If I’m getting chicken tenders or a chicken sandwich I ask whoever is making it to leave it in the fryer for double the usual time so they’re over cooked. The only time I like moist chicken is something like KFC or rotisserie. I also don’t dip my chicken in any sauces, to maintain the dryness.I don't care what anyone says, I refuse to peel a kiwi fruit before I eat it. Way too much time and effort, just eat it like an apple. You don't even have a core to throw out! Just eat it without peeling it, you pansies. It tastes good and it's good for you.People go to the gym to better themselves, not to be recorded and possibly blasted on social media. 

All over tiktok 'influencers' are filming themselves and then making videos about people in the background. Some even get annoyed when sometime walks in front of their camera. I think it's incredibly selfish and inappropriate. 

I'm already very insecure at the gym and worry about using the equipment wrong or looking unflattering. The last thing I need to be is filmed when working out. I also go to a pretty small gym and if I see someone filming then I just avoid going on any equipment that's in the background. 

I just think it's completely unnecessary. I know some people do it for educational purposes, or to check their form and document their progress. But then you only need a few minutes of video, not your entire workout. 

Even more frustrating, girls film themselves and then call out guys that are apparently staring at them. As a woman myself, I understand the worries some girls have with being stared at the gym. But on the other hand, people can just be looking to see how you're using a machine (if they're unsure themselves) or sometimes when between reps I just zone out and don't even realise I'm looking at something. 

I just feel sorry for these guys that have been blasted on social media for checking out a girl. Then the comments are so horrible about them, and I just think that's really shitty. Some women even call out girls for giving them dirty looks at the gym, when in the video it just looks like they're thinking about their own shit etc.

All in all, I just think it's so rude to film yourself at the gym and have people in the background. Bonus dick points if you choose to draw attention to anyone in your video without their knowledge. If you care that much about filming yourself, then do it at a time when your gym is quiet, or take the time to blur out people in the background. The only thing i changed for my zoom interviews was better lighting, better background, and upped my skincare and makeup, as well as slept more to improve my lazy eye and dark circles. As a result i looked more attractive despite having the same interviewing skills and awkard personaIf more people had an opportunity to try these niche sports then world records would be broken over and over again.

Not putting down the accomplishments of what these athletes are doing but I bet if everyone had the opportunity then it would be next level.basically sex is the maximum intimacy that can occur between people, you let someone inside you / you get inside the other person, there is the exploration of the intimate parts with the mouth (full of teeth!o.o) 

its hella important,

but, if you don't mind letting a guy inside you for fun, meaning total intimacy with someone for fun, then that's the personal value you place on sex, you just yeet the original importance trough the window, and then suddenly total intimacy that had no value other than fun turn intro very valuable and the access needs to be restricted because that person who has restricted access is "special"(NGL it's like paying for a service and finding out it was free all along)

whoever do casual free sex has only two options: or offers free sex to their "special" partner right away or never tell him about past free sex and keep said partner from feeling like an idiot

and yes its about women, women control sex, and have to take responsibility for that controlbiting my tongue is so satisfying to feel especially when i’m like already 10 minutes in it feels numb so then i can bite harder and it feels nice and it’s underrated imo*if not better*

All the returns of classic characters were just so ICONIC. 

In the classics, it feels like there was just a little too much drama which overthrew the comedy and action. Don’t get me wrong, when it first came out it was one of a kind. Still is! But with the technology today, the action scenes in the sequels are just much better with better graphics/choreography. In the classics it felt like C-3PO and R2 carried the comedy, while the humans did the drama and action part. Sequels have a much better balance. 3PO losing his whole memory was comedy gold. 

I Babu Frik
Why *hellooo there*

Babu frik? That’s one of my oldest friends!

When they renewed the trilogy was right around the whole “woman empowerment” thing assuming guys shouldn’t always be the main character in big franchises like Star Wars. Daisy Ridley was a perfect choice, her acting got so much better through each film and her grunts and yelling are awesome in fights. She’s also SO gorgeous, seriously look at her IG fan pages, she could have been a model if she wantedI keep seeing all of these news articles about embassy workers and evacuating Ukraine. I think those who are in charge of diplomacy should have to stay and face the consequences of their failed diplomacy, just like everyone else in the country. Diplomats should have a vested interest in diplomacy working.It's like punching them and apologizing by kicking them. They are already upset enough over their busted vehicle and all the time that is gonna be wasted in finding time to get an estimate and getting it fixed and dealing with a rental. Now you are putting them in the awkward position of having to continue insisting on getting their insurance information or trusting that you won't renege on paying for the repair. A law against this sort of thing would make things much smoother.I have never understood people who have the toilet seat up/down argument, after every use the toilet lid SHOULD be down.

Again, not the seat, THE LID, to me (and I might be wrong about this) the toilet seat has 2 parts. The seat where you actually sit down to shit or piss and the lid that covers everything. Close the lid .

You’re telling me you are flushing with the lid open letting all your urine and shit particles fly around your bathroom? WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH OUT ON THE SINK?

Sidenote: I also believe you should keep your toothbrush in a case or just stored in general, smells are particles of where the smell is coming from. If the bathroom smells like shit, there’s shit in the air.To the idiot thinking that bdsm is what 50 shades of gray had then I won't bother to talk to you because a brick wall is more intelligent than you. To the rest here my opinion:

To have a bdsm relationship you need to talk with your partner. A lot. It may take months or years before something happens. And you talk about details leaving nothing to be just implied. And you need to trust your partner 1000%

Bdsm is 40% communication, 20% kinky sex, 30% other stuff about the life style, 10% after care 

But in vanilla you almost never speak because everything is implied because "it's the normal way"The sudden difficulty to move, the disgusting occasional random sock, and for the bravest who dig to the bottom they find a net separating them from the dark abyss as the foam covers them, sealing their fate.These days you play like 5 secs of a song and you can get a instant copyright strike on pretty much any platform now. And it’s especially bad for teachers I feel like. They have so many rules and regulations you can’t even play a YouTube video anymore these days. Any teacher that says they don’t mind all the copyright rules is lying. Band directors especially I feel like, have to break the rules to provide enough copies for their students or to replace lost copies of music. I understand that copyright laws are needed, but the music industry especially has taken things too far.I see this a lot these days. People encouraging you to not care what people think of you, but I completely disagree. You should absolutely listen to other people’s criticisms, because sometimes they’re right and you’re wrong.

A big problem with the “don’t give a f*** what people think of you” mentality is that it encourages the belief that anyone who’s criticizing you is just jealous and wants you to fail, which is simply not true.

And don’t get me wrong, some people just want you to fail, but you should differentiate between someone who gives actual criticism and someone who’s just jealous.So I have a name brand laptop that I bought for school. I got knocked off my skateboard with the laptop in my bag and it got cracked. I bought it with warranty so I went to the company's website to submit a repair request. It redirected me to a third party. 

So I go to the third party and it has a support bot. I try to avoid using it, but I can't find a way to get the repair done without doing so. I start a chat and it asks me if I want to connect with an agent and I said yes. It then asks me what my inquiry is about, and I click the "repair" option. After that, a window pops up asking about my warranty, and when I say I have it, it tells me to go back to the manufacturer.

So for almost an hour I end up bouncing back and forth between the third party and the manufacturer because every time I try to submit a request using any words like "repair", "warranty", or even "display issue", the I would get kicked from the chat window and it would tell me to go to the other company.

Eventually I had to lie on the form and say that I was having "processing issues" and then finally got in contact with a real person, which I guess is the only way to get access to their repair service requests without the redirection.

Overall, I was left tearing my hair out for something that barely took any time as soon as I got in contact with a real person. I get that these chatbots help to filter out people who have problems that are self-solvable, but I couldn't get the forms I needed for the repair without a real representative sending them to me, so why did I have to jump through hoops just to get a repair on a product I paid for?For one, Richard kills the King Henry and his son Edward then seduces and marries Edward’s widow even though she hates him for killing her beloved husband?? It makes no sense.  
Somehow, Richard lies to and manipulates everyone, yet everyone is so gullible and too stupid to see how they are obviously being taken for a ride.I don't know about anyone else but when I see someone missing limbs or someone with prosthetic legs it instantly makes me uneasy. I think content warnings are sometimes used for a lot less and something that possibly evokes a gag reflex definitely deserves to be tagged as nsfw.

I just never want to see that while eating, it kills the appetite.

Edit: I don't mind that they are disabled, just that if it looks nasty then it should warn you before lookingHow anyone could find thing movie entertaining, funny, or remotely watchable blows my mind. It’s nominated for all these awards and the movie makes no sense, jumps all over the place, and is incredibly weird with a 24 year old being into a 15 year old. What did I miss?Don’t criticize their work by saying “ohhhnoo it’s too long,” nor should you criticize by taking one example of something they said during the critique and blow it out of proportion to make it seem as if that is all the review is about.

Instead, criticize use by actually reading/listening to the critique and considering points/counterpoints, and if you don’t have the time for that? (Which is understandable,) just let bygones be bygones and leave them to do their own thing, because criticizing it for being “too long” is really superficial.When I see the perfectly square and straight across lines on a forehead, starkly lined or traced eyebrows, beards with perfectly bladed crescent lines, I just think it looks like, I don't know, just weirdly fake. It makes you look like a stenciled cartoon or something. Idk, I think grooming looks best when design is met with naturality instead of just ridding all natural look for the sake of design. Not trying to throw shade or anything, and I might be weird for it, but it's like nails on a chalkboard in visual form for me..08% is like 2 light beers. How the hell are people going to jail for that? It just makes no sense to me. I guess I may be biased as I have a tolerance but never has 2 beers put me at risk of anything ever.Every post, if there's some sort of relationship involved or it's like a couples argument being discussed. Then the top answers normally give the "correct" YTA or NTA ruling, but every single time it's "but also you should also dump them/divorce them." Unless you're being fucking abused or they did something like sold your wedding ring for drugs or cheated on you this is a braindead thing to tell someone after gathering 3 paragraphs of information on the situation. Divorce isn't the answer to every problem but for some reason that whole sub jumps right to that. Every time. "My husband's mom wants to be in the delivery room and I said no and he took his mom's side AITA" "girl NTA you need to seriously consider divorcing this man child" 20k upvotes. What? Fucking what? They're ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY together.Ok so I really don<t know about this but Owen just looks like mac and cheese. I really couldn't tell you why but he just does. Maybe discuss what the rest of the characters look like to you lmao.When I go to a bubble tea place and I order a bubble tea I expect to be handed a cup of tea with tapioca in it. But for some reason some people and places think bubble tea means a cup of milk/creamer with tapioca in it with zero tea in it (of at least that’s what if tastes like).

I get that some people like milk teas which are similar to bubble teas but they are not the same thing nor are their names interchangeable.

If I order a bubble tea there shouldn’t be a single drop of any whitening agent be it cream, milk or nondairy substitute anywhere near my order.If you want to collect points with Air Miles cards, or other points cards, it should be your responsibility to ask to swipe those cards. Stop asking me if I have air miles while I dangle my credit card waiting to pay.
Just let me pay with my card that already generates me way more points than an air miles card and leave.The Netflix model of putting out a full season (series) at once has promoted tv binge culture which values quantity over quality. Serially-released shows with fanfare like walking dead or GoT were fun to sit down and watch knowing that countless other fans were doing so at the same time. The week between episodes was spent discussing, theorizing, and community building with other fans. Now, there is no camaraderie with shows like The Witcher because they are just binged and set aside until next year. These shows seem to be produced differently too; cliffhangers don’t matter so much because the next episode is a click away so instead, they keep viewers  hooked with cool visuals, action, and attractive actors. It’s as if they know that a serial release would give viewers the time to reflect and realize that the story isn’t that great.Even when users don’t like your post, but still feel the urge to comment, at the very least your post was attention grabbing.

This systematic change would both influence real conversation, and reward the OP for having the courage to post on controversial topics.

There is so much division in the world right now. Why not become a platform that encourages the tough conversations? This IMO is the healthiest way to ‘bury the hatchet’.They say 30 year old fashion always makes a comeback as it’s currently doing with 90s style. Wonder why. It’s not a generation “discovering it” it’s truly, truly just manufactured interest and marketing. None of your style is organic to you, just the end result of clever campaigns and constant fomo of what ads make you believe people are wearing.Especially at a restaurant. I love finding hairs in my food because it reminds me that someone put hard work into the dish I’m enjoying. A human is behind this cuisine. 

Natural oils can also add flavor to the food (I’m assuming). It just gives me a good feeling and almost like I got lucky finding a hair, since it doesn’t always happen!I get why this is a popular show, but all of the stuff that is being sold is infomercial junk! Honestly, humanity would be better off without this crap and this show. Aaaanddd I will probably still watch this show.Not talking about formal wear, I agree, that is uncomfortable. 

I mean aesthetically pleasing, confident (for lack of a better term) clothing. For me that's a nice shirt and jeans. Even at home on a weekend, I'd prefer to dress somewhat nicely rather than bumming it in sweats. My gf however will take any chance she can get to wear sweatpants and her bleach stained 3 sizes too big t-shirt. Which if that's what she likes, that's fine you do you boo boo, but I certainly don't understand it.I know someones already spoken on this but I was drunk last night and made out with this guy. He was super nice but kissing is just disgusting. I absolutely hate it and I don’t know how anyone finds it enjoyable. (What does this mean for me lmfao)

EDIT question: i get downvoted when my opinion is too popular and i get downvoted when its unpopular. can someone explain how upvotes work on here?

EDIT2: You guys don’t have to be mean. Like insulting my age as if its a maturity thing. I mentioned that I had sensory issues and OCD in the comments, so maybe that has something to do with it.It’s basically an admission that your reasoning sucks or that you have none at all. 
To add to this, I believe that parents and teachers who use this to justify their decisions are only teaching children not to trust them or be able to ever rely on them.No, I don’t wanna eat your cookies fresh out of the oven. I’ll let them cool off to room temperature for a couple of hours first. Warm cookies fall apart in my mouth and they have a weird texture.I get it you all like Eminem or Drake or whoever really, they arent considered bad but honestly just overrated. I dont think some of the rappers music is bad(even though a good portion is just weird words put together) everyone has their own taste.

But I really think that NF is one of the best, (im taking a stretch here) if not the best! Most of these rappers talk about drugs, women, or other stuff like that. NF likes to rap about his childhood with his mother dying of overdose and him just struggling with his mental health. I like it because it speaks to me and makes me calm down a bit because i know im not alone from stuff like this (no im not some die hard emo, im just average dude). But i would just rather listen to him rap about that than some other person rapping about getting laid at a party or something.

One quick note is that "Just Like You" is my favorite song because its awesome :)The worst take I've heard in my life is that the amazing spiderman is an awful movie, an awful adaptation of spiderman, and that, worst of all, Andrew Garfield is a bad actor. Fuck that. 

The amazing spiderman is a movie that pieces the character that spiderman is together and does it how a realistic 16-17 y/o would actually undergo that process. The biggest complaint I hear about the movie is that it's 'too dark'. Well hell yeah it is, it's a dark ass movie. It gets lighter near the end, but It's a movie about a kid whose uncle is shot dead right in front of him and he takes revenge on his uncles killer for it. Now to the next talking point:

"Spider-Man shouldn't be vengeful", I agree, and your point? Stop acting like the minute that he got bit by the spider or saw uncle Ben die that he instantly learned who spiderman is. Between the spider bite and the bridge scene was the time period in which he became spiderman and learned how to truly be a hero. That's the spiderman origin story, not being a hero, but learning how. Him being vengeful and going after uncle bens killer is the point. 

"The suit is ugly." 
1. It's not supposed to be pretty
2. You're wrong. The suit looks badass. 
Yeah, the yellow lenses don't look great, but what do you expect, he was a teenager making the suit out of shit he had. The suit was originally a track suit, and basket ball man? C'mon, the texture isn't that bad, it's a design choice. If that's your only criticism of the suit, then you can fuck off. 

Moreover, it's a work of graphic design genius. He looks scary and menacing compared to normal humans on the street. He looks like a crypt in that criminals would fear like Batman. At the same time though, he also looks weak and he less when compared to the lizard, making the lizard a more scary villain. Do you notice throughout the movie the colors manage to get 'brigher' per se? It's a good costume period

"He's too cool", bitch? You think him riding a skateboard makes him cool? Damn, your standards need reevaluating. Peter Parker in this isn't supposed to be a one to one recreation of the comics, he's supposed to be a realistic depiction of an outcast, just a nobody who the school bully chose to pick on just because he's a bully, and the unnoticeable photographer that no-one cares about because they're living period to period. That's high-school. He's still got the core aspects of being Peter Parker. He's smart, he's a loner, and good god does he pull bitches when he actually tries. 

"he's a douchebag" yeah only during the 'becoming spiderman' period I referenced earlier, in which, yes. He's supposed to be. He is a 17 y/o boy, and the only people he's a douchebag to are the people who may have killed his uncle. He's completely anonymous. You can't tell me that if no-one knew who you were and you words could never be tracked back to you, you would be a fucking saint. 

Please have a brain. Its not as good as spiderman 1 or 2, but it's better than homecoming and ffh, and certainly better than spiderman 3 and the amazing spiderman 2. Needless to say, This movie is great. This movie is incredible, and one might even go as far to say this movie is amazing.This is mostly based on personal experience, but so are a lot of other things. 
It’s like every time you post an item for, I don’t know, $50 someone will hit you up with “I only have $5 is that ok??” Like yeah right, you really think I’ll take 10% of what I originally put up. It’s almost better to sell to pawn shops, because there at least you can expect someone to try and swindle you want they won’t do it as rudely as someone on OfferUp.The Dragon Ball franchise should have ended with DBZ. DBS is so unbelievably cringe that it’s difficult to watch. Unlike the original saga which appealed to a broad age group, DBS appeals to easily entertained prepubescent children. 

It is a money grab with almost no depth or originality. Every time I see a picture of Goku with that stupid blue hair I die a little inside.I hate when ppl feel like they should have a say on someone else’s big day. If they don’t want babies or kids at their event, it’s okay. They’re allowed to be “selfish.”

Plus babies add extra noises to events like weddings and sometimes people don’t want to have to PG an event that they worked hard/paid for.

It’s okay.I have kids who will be applying for college in few years, and as I look closer to the admissions process, the SAT is a good measure of academic success compared to other factors that weigh into admissions decisions.

Colleges require GPA, personal essay, extra curricular activities, and the SAT. SAT has been vilified blaming cultural bias and also unfair advantage for wealthy students, but if you take a look at other three factors that weigh into admissions, there is more room for subjectivity as well as out right cheating the system to get into college. 

Personal Essay

Well to do students or even regular students can cheat this by paying someone to write it for them or just making up a false stories about their background to gain sympathy for the admissions counselor. Admissions counselor rarely do background check on their applicants as they take students at their words.

GPA

There has been a steady inflation of students' GPA over the last few decades as everyone is 4.XX student. GPA has been rising especially among private schools as parents often pressure private school teachers to raise their child's GPA for college admissions.

Extra Curriculars

Students can often make up EC's and club activities to impress colleges as we are all aware of Lori Loughlin scandal. People of means can inflate their child's EC's by making up none profits and provide the means for their kids to travel to third world countries to "volunteer". There have been cases when kids use their parents connections to get their names in University research papers, and other nepotisms that is ripe for exploitation. 

I am aware that SAT isn't a good tool in predicting student success in college, but I highly doubt that other three factors (except for GPA) are all that accurate as well.Having skittles flavoured nicotine that can make you breath clouds is awesome to young teenagers. It's also cool to have this awesome looking electronic device in your pocket that you can compare with your friend group. Also it's almost definitely easier to get hold of vape devices and liquids compared to tobacco products. 

At the end of the day it's an addictive substance and it's more attractive as a vape compared to cigarettes or tobacco.I used to think she was on the same level as other TV personalities but then I did some research

She's been married to her husband for over 7 years

She's raised 6 kids

And even after 6 kids, she still looks drop dead gorgeous. It's literally the dream of every man to find a woman that can have 6 kids and still look great. 

Plus she's an entrepreneur and businesswoman with her own products. 

Her husband Kroy is the luckiest man in the whole world.Social media is toxic but quora takes toxic to a whole new level - full of obnoxious, rude, arrogant opinionated people who dress up their opinions as 'expert opinion'. Totally revolting.Like it literally boils down to "stop criticizing this thing I like." What exactly is wrong with acknowledging flaws in a thing? Why can't I like something but also accept it's not perfect? Why can't I dislike something just because someone else likes it? This is honestly the go to quote when someone has no arguing point other than "I agree with the orginal person you're arguing against."

Also, what if I like being a hater, shouldn't you allow me to the thing I like tooBar soap is easier to travel with. It doesn't require something to lather up your body, once it gets too small put into into a another piece of bar soap, and shipping requires less plastic.
the only advantage liquid soap has is much better for public bathrooms.Vegetables  (combinations of lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles etc) on my burger suck, I don't want your lettuce and tomato or whatever on it. If I eat a burger I want the texture of a burger, not some wet tomato or crunchy lettuce. Give me the bun, burger some cheese and sauce!Now I'm not saying that it's impossible to eventually like something that doesn't taste good, but we're all lying to ourselves just to justify drinking or eating whatever it is more than once. 

Ironically a lot of the things are not even really that good for you to be consuming in the first place. Some common examples would be: alcohol, coffee, energy drinks, and cigarettes. 

The first time I ever had a Red Bull and it kept me awake pretty much all night long and I loved it but it tasted like ass at the time. Now many years later I actually occasionally get cravings for the taste of one and love it. I recognize that it probably still tastes awful, I'm just used to that taste now.Yes we have weird animals. Yes some of them are dangerous. But honestly instances are not common at all to 99.999% of the population. I constantly see posts of huge spiders and Australians being like “that’s not even that big.”  Like of course that’s fkn big stop trying to weirdly flex that you always see dangerous shit. Unless you’re literally in the outback or are a landscaper rummaging through trees and bushes it’s legit not a thing. 

And then I see all these comments from foreigners being like “this is why I’m never going to australia.” Firstly, LOL really?? As a tourist that would just hang out mainly in the cities and beaches you won’t see shit. I genuinely spoke to an Uber driver recently who said that’s his main deterrence from visiting (I live overseas atm). So ridiculous but honestly not really his fault because the internet just loves to grab on to stereotypes and ride it off into the sunset (ik not surprising) but Australians are the worst perpetrators. 

For context:
I’m from one of the major cities and may have a huntsman in the house 0-2 times a year. I’ve seen a snake twice in 27 years and that’s when I was holidaying in the countryside. I once went on a beach holiday and there was a really cute frog in the toilet. That’s probably ^ a more realistic, very chill experience for most Australians who don’t mess with shit.

Edit: when I say ‘I may see a huntsman 0-2 times a year in the house,’ I don’t necessarily mean my own house but encounters in general. I think my last encounter was over 2 years ago? And ngl they’re always quite funny experiences.

Edit 2: okay phobia I understand. A few people have commented this so putting it here: Nobody has died from a spider bite in Australia since 1979. That’s over 40 years y’all!! But also you are unlikely to face anything intense either. Especially if you’re just visiting. I’ve never touched or had a spider on me once. 

If you want other reasons to not go to Australia the UV is fucked and it’s a complete nanny state but that’s a whole other story 🕷💕🕷💕🕷

Edit 3: HUNTSMANS ARENT DEADLY. NOONE HAS EVER DIED FROM ONE. they’re freaky af but not deadly xoxoxoI know based off of the title that some people are going to jump to conclusions. But listen to this. If two guys say the same lines the same way but one is more good looking than the other, the girl has a way higher chance of calling the ugly one a creep for testing his luck. Just like you’ve never really heard of a stud being a creep since girls will want him anyway. Obviously there are creeps in the world, but some are normal guys who are ugly and get called it anywayThink about In N out and Chipotle.. two of the most popular fast food chains. Part of the reason for this I believe is how easy it is choose something from the menu since there’s only a handful of options. They’ve also mastered the few items they have 

Restaurants that have pages of menu options are exhausting and makes me avoid them and typically have a lot of items that don’t even taste great. Focus on mastering a few menu items. Quality > quantityBy this I mean they absolutely refuse to take their psych meds, they have an episode, and they hurt someone. They made the decision to not take their medication so they should suffer the consequences. I feel way more for the victim.

Edit because CLEARLY there are people who aren’t reading anything past this and commenting emotionally: I’m not saying all mentally ill people are inherently violent, don’t deserve sympathy, or any other kind of argument. I’m just talking about those who don’t take their meds, have an episode, and then hurt people. Yes I know most don’t or at the most hurt themselves and that second group is very tragic. I’m talking about that one particular subset.I'm talking about Encanto's "We don't talk about Bruno" that is topping the charts and passes the Frozen's "Let It Go", another song that for some reason became a hit. I'm fine with the concept of these songs targeting and gaining popularity among young ages, but I also see grownups talk about Disney's songs a lot. 

Disney's songs were a part of our childhood and I fully get that. What I don't get is hyping n o w, as a grownup. You could say that the songs satisfy your inner child but there's something wrong when someone tells you that his favourite song is a Disney song.

The only reason that might made people amazed by "We don't talk about Bruno" in particular, is that for a long time the film industry was kinda dead three years now for obvious reasons and any kind of Coco-like song would be a success.After a day out and about, when people crawl into their bed, some crawl in nude, or in pajamas (which I usually do), but sometimes I'll do it with whatever I have on, It just matched my mood of "I don't give a shit, let me sleep." It feels like the attitude of "I don't care about changing my clothes" and just plopping into my bed makes me more tired and get a deeper sleep. Its fundamentally less comfortable, but it works for me. Now I'm gonna go to sleep in my jeans and sweatshirt, have a good night y'all.The label "introvert" is like a zodiac sign at this point. Ive seen people say "I have no problem cutting off friends and family because i'm an introvert", "I don't care when a family member dies because im an introvert", "I act like a massive prick in public to everyone because i'm an introvert." Bro that's like saying "I just hit someone with my car omg i'm such a scorpio." Stop making excuses and just admit that you suck as a person.I’m glad to see people have an empathic take on his behaviour as a father. He is far from a role model and I’m happy that most people haven’t taken up the cause of men who disrespect their children’s mothers. It doesn’t matter if you are a boy or a girl, it often doesn’t really even matter if your mother was “a good mother”, when your father diminishes your mother, it only reflects on his quality as a father. My mother thought that she was doing the right thing by letting my father have partial custody of me and my biggest resentment toward her, despite my father telling me constantly from the age of 6 what a bitch she was and how she was stealing me from him, was that she let that man take me from her, because of the societal pressure of the concept of “family”.I don't know why there is so much stigma attached to the word "moist." It's just a word. Plus, I love things that are moist... Cake, brownies, chicken, noodles... The list goes on.

Tons of people I know physically shudder when they hear someone say it aloud. I don't get it. Moisture is water, water is life. It's a good thing.

Moist, moist, moist. Mmm. don't get me wrong, i enjoy a sweet food in a dessert. but when you add the sweet component into a full meal you might as well poison someone. something about sweet and sour sauce in a fish sounds so wrong on so many levels. and don't get me started on people adding pineapple on a pizza. a meal should taste savory and that's it.What can I say old music is the best in my opinion but whenever I talk to anyone they look at me like I'm a caveman for not knowing or liking the latest a laziest rap songs and it gets quite awkward quite fast 

I think its unpopular that a teen would think jazz is the best genre but hey maybe I'm wrongOverpopulation is diminishing the planets resources at a rate that is too fast for the environment to replenish. If a cure for cancer were to emerge that’d be millions of more people to use resources. The planet needs diseases like Ebola, cancer, and aids to keep humans from overshooting carrying capacity despite it already starting to show.I didn't read of Mice and Men it in school as my English set (I'm from the UK) was too low to study it (though I passed all my exams) However some years later my parents put me in another English class while I studied creative media at a college to see if I could get a higher grade than before even though I passed my English GCSE (general certifice of secondary education). I didn't last too long though before pulling out. We had to read of mice and men here and I absoulutely hated it from start to finish.

What's the appeal about people trying to find work on a farm in rural America in the 30s? It was just depressing. I don't enjoy reading much at all tbh unless it's very specific and something I really enjoy like the Diary of a Wimpy kid books. I'm in my 20s and have enjoyed them ever since the first one came out. They're hilarious, have comical illustrations to tell the story and nostalgic too.This may be a weird habit of your average American home cook but milk does not belong in scrambled eggs. Add butter, salt and pepper. You need nothing else for a proper scrambled egg. Personally,I think milk adds a weird texture to the eggs and makes them dense rather than fluffy and the taste is just off.Its not me being worried if John Di Maggio will return as Bender its that I worry about its quality. Futurama is still great partially because it never got stale and ran out of ideas like its older sibling "The Simpsons" and other Fox animated shows. Its last few seasons during the Comedy Central run had its weakest episodes, not outright bad but more ok then great ones. I don't want it to to run for to long, longevity kills creativity. Granted the universe is its playground, it can do so much but should it? Its most recent ending was a beautiful sendoff and now it has to be undone. The other things shows do that run long enough is realize what people like about their characters and lean on it hard for future episodes. Peter Griffin and Homer Simpson have always been idiots but they used to care more, now they are just idiots and that's all there is to them. How far will they lean on Frys stupidity or Benders  narcissim/reckless behavior for laughs? and will it come at the expense of the heart that has resulted in some of this shows best episodes?Most of you guys have to try to have any curl at all. The day textured hair goes out of style you guys will just wash your hair differently meanwhile curly haired and coily haired people will have to use chemicals and heat to look presentable, most people with 3a and above hair also grew up being bullied for our hair until it became a trend to get curls, once the fad goes away our natural bodies will be seen as “unprofessional” or “dirty” once more and wavies will start looking for hair routines that flatten their hair. I’m not saying that wavy hair isn't challenging, but its different than curly and coily hair and it still seen as socially acceptable, not “wild and free”Now this opinion is obviously very subjective. I grew up in London, in this city everyone seems to be single. 
At the time, I pretty much thought you weren’t aloud to have fun on Vdays, unless you’re in a relationship. 
In 2018  and 2019 I went out (as a single person) on Vadays both times to a gig and it was some of the best nights out, I’ve got a chance to experience in London. Single people took over the dance floor, everyone seemed a bit more honest and outgoing (That’s probably because it’s one of the easiest nights to find a conversation starter).  
To conclude, I don’t think this is the case everywhere, but definitely in places like London.I don't know why people don't eat this more often! I mean, the spice of the sauce goes great with the cool vanilla, which by itself tastes too bland. Whenever I eat this, everyone looks at me like I'm crazy, but don't knock it 'til you try it, right? They go together like grilled cheese and grape jelly do. Deliciously.i mean capitalism has just become a scapegoat for all of our problems. it works sometimes, not others. it can produce massive economic and technological growth. but it can also lead to environmental destruction and poor labour conditions. true socialism can lead to economic stagnation ect. its a balancing act. People nowadays saying fuck capitalism ect. Don’t rlly know what it is. Capitalism isn’t the reason why the worlds burning, that’s bigoted governments that ignored the science for years. Capitalism isn’t why Americas health system is fucked, that’s the government not regulating pharma. Just pisses me off when people blame all their problems on capitalism, sometimes your responsible for yourself.This isn't a big deal, but it can be annoying at times; it usually goes something like this: Person A wants person B to do something, person B says no, person A insists, person B says no again, person A calls person B stubborn. This is usually more inconvenient in a group setting, because most will agree you are being stubborn for not wanting to do something, when the person insisting you do that thing is the person who is actually being stubborn. In other words, if you insist that someone do something and such person does not do it, then you are being stubborn, but many will twist the situation and call the person refusing stubborn. Of course, this does not apply to situations where someone is being asked to do a very simple task like close a door or turn off a light, but usually for more complex requests the person insisting is the one being stubborn, not the person refusing.I'm not talking women in their 50s and 60s. I'm talking 75 plus, raised 3 kids and worked hard their whole lives. 

They're experienced and old enough to not have a personal stake in the outcomes of debate. Maybe it's just my own grandmas and older women I know, but they have firm opinions while also having the humility to admit what they don't know.

They're willing to listen but like to take part in discussion and have no problem asking questions to clarify the points being made.

Because of their social status, they command respect and people are usually willing to defer to them. And if you say something stupid, they'll hit you with nuanced insults like "bless your heart."

I see this as an all-around win.For example i was driving and there was not enough room for both of us to pass due to a car parked. He had to give way as he wouldn't make it in time. I didn't say thank you because he just had to do it. We would have crashed. I don't need to thank someone for preventing an easily preventable crash. My friend said I was not being a good driver. I will say thanks to people in a car when they give way to me as I cross a road more because I feel like I'm inconveniencing them and I hate it when it happens to me. But if by pure chance its your time to wait, you don't get a thank you and I don't expect one.People who do that are just stupid, let me explain.
It's just pointless crying from people who just don't want to make small talk.It's not like the guy is a cop searching your house, so these reactions are pointless. I'll tell you a few benefits of letting the doordash driver come over and give you the food straight away:
1) Less likely to get your food stolen
2) Much quicker which means the delivery guy gets more cash
3) You feel nice because they always say "have a nice meal"/ you can know if these people are bad and should be fired.

Negatives of letting the delivery guy leave the food by the door:
1) Someone could steal the food
2) You would have to get a message which takes longer
3) You won't know if the person did something with your foodDon't get me wrong. He was a great fighter and a trailblazer in sports and a rightful cultural icon. I just think the way he treated Joe Frazier was dickish. I know it was because it rhymed but he called him a gorilla. He also called him an Uncle Tom. Years later he apologized and some of his trash talking is just an accepted part of boxing but how he even fought him was sketchy.

In their trilogy Ali constantly held Frazier's head down and only in the last fight was he actually stopped by the ref. In the final fight he was asking to have his gloves cut off but Frazier's corner threw in the towel first. Rather than admit he gave up and demand a draw he accepted victory. Frazier didn't quit. His corner made the call. That wasn't the case with Ali. He wanted to give up and his corner refused. 

Lombardi was wrong about winning being the only thing. How you get across the finish line matters too. Ali did say after the fight that Frazier was the second best fighter behind only him but with the opportunity then and in the years later to never concede the win is both selfish and shitty of him. Smokin Joe for life.The first season had one good character that was never seen again after the first episode. Than it decided to abruptly end. Season 2's whole story was "don't worry guys the plot will start next season." Most of the violence looks like childish edgelord shit, it doesn't shock you it just grosses you out.

Please don't compare it to Arcane. The show doesn't deserve to lick Arcane's shit.Sorry but if you are someone who looks down on video games, but you are constantly swiping on Tinder, opening Reddit app 15 times a day, arguing with someone on Facebook, you’re playing video games. 

Same thing in my mind, your brain is releasing dopamine and doesn’t know the difference either btw.

Also, an unpopular side note, if you’re super into cars and car parts - you’re equally nerdy as someone whose really into building computers to me as well. Sorry, but it’s true.i read a lot of comics and when a read them at work I'm told that they're for children (is anything by Alan Moore for children?), but then the same people will go out and watch a marvel movie at the cinema even though those films are diluted and child friendly versions of the booksEverybody recommends fucking Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. "It changed my life" and other bullshit.

I do not live for the species. I do not live for society. I live for myself. I *can only* live for myself, as a subjective value maximizer—biology will not allow otherwise.

Hence why I am so terribly bored with the world. It's already given me so much.Seriously this should become a thing, have you tried driving in the rain behind one of them? Can’t see anything and not to mention they kick rocks and mud at the vehicles behind them. I think there should be a law in place that required a lifted truck to have mandatory mud flaps for the safety of other drivers in bad weather conditions.I was cooking a pizza and I sat down next to my room mates and when I pulled out a knife and fork they looked at me funny. I know that people usually use their hands when eating pizza but thought it was because they just didn't have access to cutlery at the time and so they used their hands, not that they chose to use their hands over cutlery. Why would you ever do this?

Firstly, pizza is floppy, meaning if the pizza is greacy and loaded, your toppings are going to slide. Also, doing this is just messy, you get sauce around your mouth and greacy fingers. The only acceptable way to eat pizza with your hand is if you roll it into a cylinder but even then that should never be purposely chosen over a knife and fork.

When you use a knife and fork you can cut down the pizza into bite sized chunks. Your toppings dont go everywhere, your hands dont get greacy, its clean and you can even pick off a cheeky topping now and then to eat and to add to the culinary experience. You can add order to the mess that is pizza.some people classify “good rap” as just rapping slowly over a mellow beat. sometimes* it’s not even good. and people will automatically consider a male better than a female because they’re male, when 90% of the time the females are out doing the males. (this usually happens in rap, but it extends to other genres too). people also consider a few artists having a “good” or “unique” music taste, even though in reality it’s a very basic music taste. and if you don’t like the artists, you “don’t” know music. not that the artists aren’t good, they’re just not very unique, and you don’t have to like a certain few artists in order for your music taste to be “good”. and people have these few artists that they consider the best artists ever because they’ve been around for so long, even though there are artists that are way better than them. longevity ≠ superiority!You can cosplay, great. You have a kid you dressed up as a jedi, good for you. I really do not care about seeing it in every Anime/fantasy/Sci-fi subreddit. I'm here to see news, trailers, and products. A thirst trap in a shitty wig isn't on topic. I'm not here to see people in crappy costumes. Please put that shit in a different sub.Whenever someone says good for you, I never sense they actually mean it that way, it’s usually a replacement for “ I don’t care “ ,“ stop bragging “, “ not really that impressive” etc.

Saying “that’s very good “ has better emotions behind it . 

“Hey I just bought a new car “- good for you

“I just got a new car “- that’s very good


Two totally different vibes from these two responsesPeople refuse to believe that some of the best artists of all time were hip hop artists, public enemy, nwa, Kanye west (I may not agree with his beliefs but you’re lying if you think that he is not in the 100 top artists ever), biggie, Tupac, jay z etc. these artist get shit on just because their music might not be as traditional as people like the Beatles, queen, led zeppelinIf I go shopping and go to check out and there isn't a human at a cash register, forcing me to use a self checkout machine, I damn sure am stealing a bunch of shit. 

I have to ring up and bag all of my own things for free? Nah, either create a job and pay someone to do that or I'm going to pay myself for doing it by stealing multiple items to make up for making me do their job.Most sports games nowadays are so repetitive and just bland. Actually, it always has been. Sports games are only fun for about 20 minutes then you get bored of it. Mario sports games on the other hand are a lot more fun. Reasons being because each character you play has their own unique personality and powers to achieve goals/points. They also have their own pace and aesthetic to match their character which makes the games more competitive. I remember being so hyper playing Mario Strikers with my cousins because of the reasons I just listed. Mario Strikers has their unique way of winning and also using some powers to make goals. It was fun seeing your opponents getting angry for slipping on a banana or get hit by a green shell. Meanwhile I once played FIFA 12 and got so bored because basically all players are the same, and it’s way too bland that you might as well go outside and play in a soccer field instead.I still can't fathom this. People tell me "location location location" but I've been all around the country, and only ONE Popeyes I have ever been to has had GOOD fried chicken. (Coincidentally it was one I stopped by in Covington, Louisiana. Just north of NOLA.)

Every Popeyes in my home city is bland, it tastes like the chicken has no seasoning, has all the juices removed from it so it's dry, and the breading is just flour. No egg, no salt, no pepper, nothing, just flour. And I thought it was just my home city. 

Then I moved away for college, entirely new city, and the whole craze with the chicken sandwich happened after i graduated and I think the chicken sandwich is the most egregious case of it. My family and classmates in my program LOVE it and say it's amazing, when it's all the same. No seasoning, just flour breading. The spicy chicken sandwich is PASSABLE but not **GOOD**. 

My best reason for this post is after a big test in my masters this past January a bunch of us went out and drank together. Our DD took us to the nearest Popeyes, and we all got a bunch of food. I am an absolute savage when I've been drinking, I'll eat anything, I don't care how it tastes. This was the first time IN MY LIFE I've ever stopped eating a meal while drunk because it just didn't taste good. And my DD and classmates assured me this was the "good" Popeyes in our city. 

Sure compared to like Chik-Fil-A it actually  feels like real chicken. And it's not whatever the hell KFC is doing. But both of those at least have SOME flavor to them, even if it's very minimal in both cases. 



Don't even get me started on their fries.After a couple years of quarantine and social restrictions, many people want real socialization. They want pre-2020 lifestyles. They don't want to be forced to stay indoors anymore.

Then what would lead to so many people adopting VR helmets as the main ways to work and play? It would have to be because we have no other choice. A global war, an economic depression, a combination of both plus new unexpected stuff... we would have no choice but to stay inside.

And that's where the metaverse comes in. Virtual Reality will pick up the pieces.Saying you created a job to justify a waste is like saying you spent 5 more years on that novel to still write the same drivel. Busy work and mess do nothing for the economy or our culture. Creating wealth is not as important as making a difference,  and both are possible.I really can't stand when I see a parent walking around with their child and they're talking to them like they are ordering from a Chinese restaurant, when they assume the person can't understand English so they dumb their language down.

Kids CAN understand you, and the more you talk to them like they are adults, the quicker they will learn to communicate eloquently. I see it all the time with my friends, one kid is 5 years old, talked to in fake babyspeak and still talking like a cartoon baby, where another is 4 and since the parents decided to speak to the child like an adult, they can have full conversation with me.

Also, children like feeling involved and equal, it does wonders for them developmentally to bring them to your level. I'm not saying you should discuss Tolstoy with them, but just stop with the cooing and goo goo gaa gaa babyspeak. It's just making kids dumber.I have never liked the grilled cheese sandwich. I like bread and I like cheese and I like toasted bread but together they just taste like shit. It’s like adding cola with water. Fine apart but together just makes it taste gross.What if someone landed on the street, because he abused alcohol and beated his family and they finally said ''that's enough, gtfo''? Or lost his entire wealth to gambling? Or lost his well-paid job in driving, because he DUIed and lost his license? Or fucked up his own life in any other way?

And don't get me wrong- many poor or homeless people are victims of the circumstances or got screwed by the others or the system, I won't deny that. But the fact, that someone is poor doesn't mean, that I should be compassionate- I have nothing against people with history coming back to society and fixing their lives, but if their current situation is the result of their own bad decisions, I won't pity them.Peyton won league MVP 5 times (which is a record), 2x OPOY, 7x First Team, 3x Second Team, 14x Pro Bowler, led the NFL in touchdowns, yards, passer rating and completion percentage (multiple times for each), set NFL records for most TD's in a season, most passing yards in a season, and most game-winning drives. He also had a 65.3 career completion percentage, a 539-251 TD-INT ratio, 71,940 passing yards and a rating of 96.5.

But the main reason why I think of him as the GOAT goes beyond statistics... his leadership and play recognition skills can't be matched!

As great as Brady is, he can't hold a candle to Peyton!

This opinion doesn't get anymore unpopular.I mean, I realize it’s practically a trademark of the show, but it’s just dumb if you think about it. They don’t even need the question to be grammatically correct— you can simply add ‘what is’ to everything (“What is George Washington?”, “What is sea mammals?”). So it’s just a gimmick that serves no purposePeople always rave about the benefits. The pension, mostly. And the relatively easy work. I have worked at other hospitals and the VA is far slower paced and people hardly ever work harder than they need to.

But the base pay is horrible compared to other hospitals. They consider the pension and other benefits offset this huge discrepancy in pay, but the base pay is a “now” problem whereas the pension and retirement benefits are a “future” gain. So if I’m trying to buy a house or pay my loans or anything in the present, the retirement benefits don’t do shit for me and the VA pay is not sufficient. 

Next, docs are condescending and the nursing staff are so beyond rude and inappropriate. They treat other hcw with so much disrespect and attitude, and behave out of line and out of control. A nurse screamed and yelled at me yesterday because I guess that is how nurses at the VA communicate when they disagree or have conflict with another healthcare professional rather than having an actual conversation. And sure this is my personal opinion, but I’ve worked at many other hospitals and speak from personal experience that the nursing staff at the VA is some of the meanest, tasteless, classless people I have ever had the displeasure of working with. I have never filed a harassment report anywhere until I came to the VA and now it’s just a thing I do because nurses are batshit insane here. They also require the most help and handholding to do even the most basic tasks (like simple math, if a medication is 1mg per 1mL of volume, and the doctor orders a 5mg dose, how many mL would you draw up. If you have a dose at noon, and the order says to give a dose every 8 hours, what time would you give the next dose. I kid you not, I have to answer these and questions like it constantly for our VA nurses). This is to the point where I worry about patient safety and would absolutely not want VA nurses to care for me or my loved ones in a hospital because their inability to do simple, routine aspects that are basic requirements of their job are highly concerning and seriously a danger to patient safety

Third, the electronic health records and all of the data management systems are beyond outdated. Like, from the stone ages. Other hospitals are using integrated systems like Epic, but we are still using 0s and 1s on a black screen green font computer from the 1400s. It also takes 45 years to get anything done. If you want to implement some sort of change, or hell, get an email reply from HR, you’ll be waiting forever. 

Fourth, there is a salary cap, which you reach very very quickly. Your federal pay scale will max out likely within the first 5 years youre there, after which there is no growth and you continue to make the same exact salary year after year for the next 40 years or so until you retire. There are also no opportunities for advancement, especially if you are younger and newer, because movement up the ladder is seniority based so until every single person in the department that is more senior to you has retired, you’re not going to move up. 

Fifth, you will never get any of your PTO requests approved. Again this is seniority based so if you’re new, you only get what’s left after everyone else has gotten heir requests approved. And by the time that happens, there’s nothing left. 

Sixth, the VA honestly just provides poor quality of care to veterans. Nurses are crabby and rude. Docs just give patients whatever they ask for to get them off their backs. Xanax 20mg/day? Sure! Dialudid for your mild pain ranked 1 out of 10? Sure! Oh you “lost” your supply for 180 tablets of Percocet for the third time this week? Here I’ll write you a new prescription! It’s honestly a ton of enabling and looking the other way. Not good care at all. 

Seventh, The VA is where your skills go to die. Once you have worked at the VA, your chances of getting hired at any other hospital decline significantly because the VA is known for being easy and barely using half your brain to do the work. Your clinical skills will become nonexistent. You won’t remember how to treat babies, children, teens, pregnant women, women in general. 

There’s a dozen other reasons. But I digress. The VA is trash. Don’t ever fall for the trap of working thereSorry in advance for the somewhat click-bait title, but my experience with discord has been a mostly negative one.    

I was fairly reluctant to join discord, due to every person, subreddit, and youtuber begging me to join their server.  I didn't join until a MMO guild required it for voice chat during raids.    
A side note, I've since quit MMO's since then because they're all slow progression to draw out your monthly subscription so I haven't found any use for voice chat since.

&nbsp;

General chat is essentially a group txt with either hundreds/thousands of people or a small community that say they welcome newcomers but keep conversations to the original members.    
    
Memes are recycled amongst every other server, users latch onto one trend and keep posting variations of it until it hasn't been funny for weeks.  Some of the more recent trends I recall have been Super Idol RickRoll, multiple Memamind templates, ~~Christmas~~ just a week away, Mr. Incredible becoming uncanny, the skeleton appears.    
    
A lot of discord users just seem to be unserious about everything, like you can't have a conversation with some people because they're playing some character.  Discord users also love to shit talk other platforms (tik-tok, reddit, & twitter for example) they'll cherry pick a bad comment, post, or tweet saying this is what that platform represents but those same users won't hesitate to steal memes, and topics from the same platforms. 
    
&nbsp;

All I use discord for anymore are a few community pings for when streamers go live, but I could just open twitch to see if they're online or not.    
A friend of mine also made a server for scheduling dinner and game nights but I don't see any benefit to using discord over a group txt.Yes, I'm pissed because gas in my area jumped 15+ cents over the last week, but that does not mean you get to say "wEll, iF we all sWitChed to elEctRiC, this woULdn't be an iSsUe".

There are just so many reasons that trying to get everyone to buy an EV, even over the next 20 years, would be a completely fruitless goal, both for the environment and the average American's bank account. We're never going to get the proper nationwide infrastructure for it, and again, the environmental and monetary costs of mining and disposing of the lithium for the batteries feels like it's only going to go up. It's not time to use the power of marketplace mechanics for pushing the price of gas up in an effort to make people switch to something "cheaper". Time to go back to the drawing board and focus on other ways to fix the issue this is trying to address, though I understand solutions like hydrogen fuel cell cars face similar barriers. Still better than EVs, tbh.If you dont know there home life, you dont have any right to judge. In alot of homes, there boiler might not be working or they cant afford expensive clothes. Dont make fun of someone for things they cant control

Edit: Over 2 million homes in America dont have running water. Also, im not saying dont make them aware just dont make fun off them. Another thing is mental illnesses/disorders can make it impossible to even get up in the morning let alone showering. I drive 55 miles one way to work everyday through ATL. When in traffic it sucks following behind someone (in a normal vehicle) that is driving too close to the car in front of them and is constantly tapping the brakes. Semi drivers for the most part drive cautiously in traffic thus they aren’t on the brakes as much. Additionally, people that like to cut in and out of traffic don’t want to get behind a semi so I rarely get cut off when I’m following a big rig.I worked in dozens of restaurants and it always frustrated me that you give someone a fork and spoon to eat pasta alfredo, and then you completely submerge their shrimps with tails on in sauce. This is confusing to humans, as they either should use a fork, or use their hands. but the back and forth is really frustrating. Seems to me there is no good reason to leave the tails on in Alfredo other than pure laziness.You'd think some guy with dark circles under his eyes and "bad hair" banging hot chicks like Tan Barbie would be a little more idolized, especially in America. Doesn't everyone want to believe they can be weird and still succeed? Making fun of Pete Davidson for doing it just shows you're envious you haven't done it yet yourself.I really don't find them appealing at all. I much prefer the look of kitten heels or flat shoes. They look way more attractive and classy. Plus you can walk property without messing your feet up. 


Also, while we're here, I prefer close toe. Nothing worse, for me, than seeing toes out and about in the wild. Especially the messed up piggies. All those should "stay at home".It saves you a bunch of money (if you don’t have one already), first off. Second, dishwashers often miss shit somehow and doing it by hand ensures that there’s nothing left on the plate or utensils. Third, it’s super annoying to do an entire load of dishes in one sitting. When you do them by hand right after eating, it doesn’t take that long and then you never have to do a bunch at once.This is like, the most telling fact of how influenced this generation is by materialized group think. If you legitimately find yourself wanting one video game console to defeat the other console…think about what you’re really saying. You’re rooting for one corporation to win over another. 

Brand loyalty that extends past “I just really like how this looks” is stupid. This conversation can even be applied to clothing or any form of physical or digital product. I can speak from experience, once you hit 30, work a full time job in salaried position, and have actual things to worry about….this shit ceases to matter. 

Stop propitiating the notion that brands can win or that they care what you want/ think. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo are all spurred on by numbers. That’s the only thing that matters. 

Most of all, stop flooding comment sections with incorrect, opinionated, biased garbage about a console exclusive game.I finally succumb to peer pressure and watched some of the dream SMP and it’s OK my opinion it’s just a fucking fandom Half of TickTock is cancer and the extent they went.but, the videos/streams themselves are OK but that’s just me. even if he cheated in some speed runs he still has a lot of skill (not saying he doesn’t deserve the lash back) what do you guys think?Maybe it’s just a small part of the internet that believes the cold side of a pillow is better or maybe it’s everyone but I believe that having a warmer pillow is soooo much better. 

I see so many people talking about how nice a cold pillow is or people saying that they want both sides of a pillow to be cold but for some reason this doesn’t faze me having a cold pillow. 

Is this an unpopular opinion, I don’t know but my opinion is that a warmer pillow will always be better than a cold one.I think dry shaving is far superior. I always used to get my face (and other unmentionables) damp, lather on the shaving cream and then shave like I had been for years. Until one day I was in a rush and tried taking care of my morning grooming routine dry. To my surprise I got a closer cut and didn't have to deal with all the hassle of the whole process. I've never since used them again and I never will. Convinced that shaving cream products are just another unnecessary product we've become accustomed to purchase.Violence, death, accidents, and conflict have been, and always will be a major part of human history. These are things that need to be shown as is, to the public. We should all have the right to a uncensored unbiased source of reality. Not blocked from our eyes due to being “offensive” or “obscene” The world doesn’t give a fuck about any of that.

Attempting to censor or hide content just because it’s deemed “too graphic” add nothing but ignorance to the world. It gives you a warped unrealistic sense of how the world works and the dangers it presents. Humans act invincible, but are nothing more then raw flesh and bone. Easily broken, shredded, or destroyed.

There is a reason why graphic imagery is used in warnings and safety videos for example. It puts into prospective how fragile the human body is. How quickly your life can be changed or cut short.

Social media companies, News corporations, and search engines will continue to block, ban, delete, censor or do anything they can to hide or erase this content. Because of this, it might seem like the world is a better place or at least less dangerous. Nothing can be further from the truth.

Awful events will happen regardless of what is shown to the public. We can not prevent this, only learn and document it. 

I've never understood the coffee culture (in North America at least). YOU DO NOT NEED COFFEE TO FUCKING FUNCTION.

Everyone is my job site cannot work one day without drinking at least 10230120 coffee cups a day, its so fucking sad. ITS ALL A PLACEBO EFFECT. Lets say you feel like shit in the morning and "cannot" work without coffee...just wait 30 min or an hour and you get used to this shitty feeling and naturally it goes away. Now if your mind is telling you that you really cant handle it so you drink a coffee you feel amazing for the first 20 min and then CRASH EVEN HARDER SO THEN YOU NEED TO KEEP DRINKING TO KEEP FEELING IT. Just fight off that shitty feeling for less than an hour and you do not ever need to drink coffee.

I work as a superintendent at a construction site and my hours are minimum 10 hours and i've never drank coffee ONCE. The job is super stressful, always need to be thinking and you cannot relax for even a bit. IF that doesn't prove that coffee is useless then i do not know what to say

Do not get me started with the coffee culture as well. I come late to site.."oH YoU OwE EvErYoNe A CoFfEe nOw xDDDDDD"!!! Also some people try to send me articles that coffee is healthy for you...ya not if u drink it 50 times a day that you need to take a piss every 5 min even in the middle of conversations...ya very healthy. Also cream/sugar everyday plus the cost. i can go on forever

Alright imma stop. PeaceI just really fucking hate when people say "Spill the tea, sis!" and other shit that includes the word "Sis". Like, no! I don't want to spill the metaphorical tea, you damn roach! Call me "Bro" instead. This is exactly why I hang out with myself over anyone else!All the people that thinks it's taboo to sleep with socks on don't know comfort. 

And no way in hell am I going to go to bed barefoot on a cold night just to satisfy the gatekeepers who hate sleeping with socks on.This has gotten me a few weird looks and comments. I just like being done with the crust early on, so I can enjoy the rest of the soft part of the pizza without the throught of crust coming up soon. And also, if you don't eat the crust, you're a child.  
Additional thing: I eat the first slice without any dip, so that when I apply dip on the second slice it actually feels like an increase in taste quality, as opposed to "just the same as the first slice"; You don't develop a Dip-tolerance. If you ate all the slices WITH dip, and then ran out at the end and had to eat the last slice without dip, you would feel dissapointed and it would seem boring because you got used to the dip experience, but that same dipless slice would taste great at the beginning because you hadn't set the standard as high (and you're more hungry+ it's warmer).Unless it’s in-house freshly made, there is no bigger waste of money at a restaurant. It’s easy to make at home, takes zero skill. I can’t understand why anyone would go out for pasta.Especially here on Reddit, any sort of family disfunction seems to get the response "go no contact" or "cut them out of your life they are toxic" and I really think we need to talk about this, because everyone's family is a bit fucked up. 

I get that it's a scale, and if your families fucked-up-ness is affecting your mental health, then yeah maybe you need to take a step back, but I don't think it's healthy to encourage every single person with an ounce of bat shit crazy to go "no contact". 

Lurking in a bunch of advice subs, it seems like I’m alone in this opinion.I’m tired of my pop tarts turning into dust after leaving them in my backpack for a week and then when I remember it’s in there and need a quick boost of pure sugar and processed pastry, it’s basically sand from the beach that sits in the seashell jar on my moms toilet. Do better Kelloggs…It's actually annoying when people will do things for you without asking. "Hey neighbor, I pulled your garbage down for ya" Oh great, now I fucking owe you something, for doing a job that I was planning on doing myself. 

"here's some baking" Great, now I need to throw these cookies out and I owe you something.His sketches teach valuable lessons that people can use to better themselves. People are always calling him cringe and I think that they should just keep their opinions to themselves.I realize that frozen is incredibly popular, but on this site whenever I see frozen mentioned it is in an “overrated films” thread, and in that thread the next comment after frozen is always “tangled is the better film”. I think Frozen has more compelling characters, Christoph is cooler than what’s his name Eugene or something. The twist of the prince being the bad guy is fun, and the music is 100x better. I’ve never maxed out on deadlifts to a tangled song, but “Let it go”, “into the unknown”, and “show yourself” are regulars in my power up playlist.Sending someone a link that goes to that Rich Astley video instead of what you said it was isn't, wasn't, and won't be funny.

It's not witty or clever, and is about the lowest effort joke out there.

End rant, tear me to pieces.Time measures are time measures, and length measures are length measures!!! If I have a store 3 kilometers away from my house, why do you tell me it's 10 minutes away!?!?!? I know sometimes saying very specific numbers isn't convenient BUT USING TIME MEASURES FOR LENGTH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE! it's not gonna be 10 minutes if I walk at 5kph or I run with all my strength!!

Something similar happens at spotify. When I try to see how much I'm downloading, why do you have to put X hours of music? Not only is this inaccurate because weight per hour strongly depends on the frequency of the sound, but if it really is supposed to be more convenient it's actually extremely hindering. I'd rather see megabytes or gigabytes instead of this "hours of music" hipster crap.I will never understand this war on context. Of *course* context matters. Not to say anything is justified by a proper context but this practice of *clipping* people saying stupid shit and refusing to acknowledge proper context is so incredibly dishonest. If you’re ever online and you see a video meant to character assassinate and it purposefully limits itself to the worst part know you are being deceived. People go to college to learn how to do this kind of deception."alcohol make you drunk, drugs make you high, so they're the same". If you only drink alcohol to get drunk that's a problem. You can't enjoy a good cheese with crack, but fine wine will enhance it so much. Same goes for beer, whiskey, and a lot more.I’m not into weird stuff or anything like that, but after an intense and long game of soccer. We all take our shoes off and gather around in a small room together to chat.
And I cannot describe how good the stinky socks smell, the beauty of it is that every person’s feet smell different, and when they’re combined, well, it’s just marvelous.Idk I like the texture better and they tend to be saltier than without the shell. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll still fuck up some shelled peanuts. However, peanuts with the shell still on are superiorAll of reality/the universe exists simply because it can (obvious), it can because nothing stopped it (obvious), and nothing stopped it because there is nothing outside reality to stop it (also obvious) - because reality is by definition everything and anything.just like pj pants or underwear, maybe a shirt, and maybe a pillow. I just don't especially like how blankets or sheets feel. I've tried them and I have them, but most of the time i just won't bother or end up kicking them off in the middle of the night. I'll use a sheet if it's particularly cold but I might also just put on a Hoodie. I also like having a fan on and pointed towards the bed. this isn't just in hot summer months, it's in the winter too. I remember as a kid liking to be able to see my breath while I slept. I would close the heat vents and open a window in the winter all the time although I suppose I did have a blanket when it was thet cold. I can't do that now because I have pets and plants that would die but if I could I probably would.I think this one explains itself .I miss the days when I could look forward to watching 22 episodes of my favourite show each year. This was especially great with comedies because they were 30 minutes long and often standalone episodes meaning that you didn't need to drag on a single narrative arc longer than needed. I was particularly bothered when I was watching Mythic Quest(great show,highly recommend) and it just ended after like 12 episodes. The most recent show I can think of that still does 22 episodes is Superstore. Unacceptable I tell you!Most of us got married too young.  By too young, I mean

* Before crushing financial responsibilities
* Before woman were easily approachable (online dating or online social clubs / 2000-2015)
* Before kids and knowing how it would compeltely change the relationship
* Before we really knew ourselves emotionally
* Before we were established in our careers and standing in society

What could we really offer a woman at that young of an age?  We learn from our mistakes - alimony, divorce settlements and juggling new kids schedules.  We find out what is important to us - not that we all liked the same pop culture or even grosser, were in the same religion.

If we are not too jaded after the divorce, life is good.  There are good, appreciative woman out there.  It is just not worth staying with someone because of the kids or because you are just afraid of the unknown.  Yes, paying for the responsibilities of the first marriage and the child support sucks (and if you don't you are douschebag and belong on r/trashy ), but what you have in your head as a negative is not that bad.  The kids will understand as long as you are there for them.  Society doesn't care because the divorce rate is over 50%.  Your family wants what is best for you as long as you do what is right.  Life is good.Red vs. Green is much more opposite, it even hurts my eyes to look at when the colors are together. Plus it makes me think of Ireland, Italy and Mexico flags.

Red vs. Blue just looks too good together to be opposites.I get guys. It's convenient to just walk up and go. But the amount of times I've had to shit and walked into a restroom with 3 unused urinals and 1 occupied stall is too damn high.

Just make 4 stalls instead.I mean the animation is the best out of all the animes I've ever watched, but all the other factors? nah, jokes are trash, characters are annoying, the main goal of making nezuko a human again is dumb, rengoku's death isn't even emotional. It got carried by its fight scenes and animation, and people still call it the best fucking anime? Bro, you haven't even watched a fourth one yet, chill the fuck outJust not the best quarterback of all time to me. Seems like everybody else disagrees though. Sure he has 7 Super Bowls but football is a team sport and a big part of that is the defence. Tom Brady’s playoff win percentage WITHOUT a top 10 defence is around 11.8%. There’s just so many more QB’s that are better imo. Just to name a few: Peyton, Montana, Brees, Rodgers. Not to mention having probably the best coach of all time (Bill) and a stacked Buc’s team.

Edit: Other QB’s playoff win percentage WITHOUT a top 10 defence: Peyton (78.6%), Brees (77.8%), Rodgers (54.5%)I grew up thinking that car sex was uncomfortable and awkward so I was reluctant to try it, low and behold, it's actually great. I haven't had a single time where I regret it and I've tested this theory out multiple times either with the same or different men. Now I get it's not for everyone like bigger or taller people but I'm 5'1 so for me it was quite comfortable.I’m at work, I just switched off ‘This Morning’ in the UK, cause it’s mind numbing garbage. 

Two boring hosts talking absolute nonsense, getting members of the public to call in with ‘funny stories’ which are about as funny as a rake to the forehead. 

Segments include a woman talking about buying cheap wine from the co op, how to make what looked like an awful cheesecake, covered in fake strawberries (with completely clashing flavours). 

I don’t understand why these things are still popular, apart from ‘there’s nothing else on’. Abolish morning shows or make them better, it feels like there’s no structure to it and the hosts are winging their way through every morning by filling the time with the most mundane drivel that they can find. 

Clearly these shows have an audience, as they’re still making morning shows across the world, but it’s time for them to change.As the title says - I find Japanese made games have a certain stiffness to them. They most often don't use physics, have awkward/stiff controls, and don't allow for organic gameplay (botw is an exception). To me, these emergent gameplay mechanics are essential to what I consider as a well made game. Would love to see some examples to the contrary.Feel like it's straightforward enough, when big headliner stories come out where a voice actor was shitcanned for a reboot because negotiations fell through, or a YouTuber lost half of a multimillion income, or a famous musician only gets  5% of 9 figure sales, I really just cannot bring myself to care, hell even if you're hitting the glass ceiling and that means you're getting 700k while another dude is making 820k I still  don't care. You're so far ahead of so many people by that point that it is legitimately impossible for any ordinary person to be less privileged than you.All too often at my high school, one or two people will be walking ridiculously slow up a staircase during a passing period causing the whole rest of the crowd to slow down. 

If you are walking up a staircase during a crowded time, GO FAST! JUST FUCKING GO! ITS ANNOYING AS HELL TO BE WALKING SLOW UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STEPS BECAUSE OF ONE PERSON!

Should be said that this also applies to going down the staircase, though I don’t see as many problems going down as going up.

That’s all.Eating cake that just came out of the oven 10 minutes ago is so much better than something that’s been cooled for hours. Since it’s hotter it melts in your mouth more, the flavors are newer and haven’t left yet, and it’s much softer. Sure there are some cakes that need it to be cold like ice cream cake or frosted cakes, but hot coffee cake, poppy and lemon cake, ie: are all much better.Yep. I'm a 30 yr old male surrounded by dudes who do nothing but talk about video games. And yes its true. A loooottttttt of gross ass video game playing dudes jerk it to cartoons on a regular. Men are fucking grossA year ago, the alleged mass graves where all the rage. Media coverage, billions worth of payouts in "reparations", public apologies, and denunciations.
Now, a year later, nobody talks about it anymore because actual digging actually disproved a lot of the allegations. But now it's too late, the people who were the loudest got tens of thousands of dollars each and everybody who raised questions back then was branded some sort of bigot on par with a holocaust denier, which is a well proven event that was uncovered during the war, not something that was first brought to attention generations after it happened.

It was understandable in older times when the world was much more disconnected. No matter what language names should be left in it's original form.

Marcus Antonius not Mark Antony.

Jeanne d'Arc not Joan of Arc.

Also it is not impossible to learn to pronounce foreign names correctly.a lot of times people make grammar mistakes either in their native language or another language they're trying to learn, i see a lot of people ridicule and make fun of people that make grammar mistakes but sometimes especially if you know more than 2 languages you mix/forget how some words are spelled.  same goes for your/you're mistake.Obligatory "Not always". Don't be nasty to people like.

I see this often and it grinds me. Examples: just because I don't have the personal capacity to, say, play guitar, it doesn't mean I can't recognise that someone else isn't actually super talented at it. Just because I'm not a spokesperson doesn't mean I cant tell when someone is not good at getting their point across. Idk

My personal skill is not necessarily relevant to every point. I can still recognise when something isn't all that good

Edit: I'm trying to bait the idiots in my lifeI heard everyone say it tastes amazing so i tried and its disgusting. It has no flavour to it at all it literally feels like eating play dough, and it has the consistency of wet cement. Also theres no reason to use peanut butter when theres so many alternatives insteadI just love getting bloody nose since it usually clears out my nose and once you get rid of all the blood pouring out and out of your throat it’s not bad. Now sometimes I’ll dislike them at random times where I don’t have a tissue or something to cover it with other than my hand.I don't know when this trend started but of course you didn't expect your post to blow up. Neither did the other user, the user before that one, nor the one after. There's no guarantee that anything will be blown up except a bathroom after bad taco bell. Just shut up already.More sensual and connected acts of love are more appealing to me than intercourse. for example, kissing, watching a movie and cuddling, etc. so many teens are banging at such young ages and it hurts to seePrius? Volt? Bolt? Why are electric cars so ugly? Even most Teslas look like squashed VWs. It’s not aerodynamics because the Corvette would be a perfect design for an electric. Postulating government officials paid off by big oil made back room deals to slow down electric car growth.I see so many posts about games with predatory microtransactions that are "preying on kids" or some shit like that. The truth is, children aren't that stupid. When I was a kid, I knew about the value of money and what I should and shouldn't spend it on, and some of my friends are parents and their kids are fairly well educated on the subject as well. They don't look at ***20,000 gems ONLY $99.99 10% OFF!*** and think "I should go steal my moms credit card and spend 100 dollars on this game". And no, I'm not saying overly intrusive microtransactions are a GOOD idea, I'm just tired of people using children as an example.disability isn't necessarily a bad thing. the bad part is how disabled ppl get treated.

most disabilities wouldn't be bad if the right support was in place.

we live in a very ableist world and it fucking sucks.Guys playing football on scholarship at Alabama or basketball at Kentucky aren't taking any tests, they aren't writing any papers and they're not showing up for 8am Econ 104. It's a sham and no one is pretending otherwise. They're competing for a chance to get drafted or hit the pro tour, etc.

They should just be allowed to attend the school in the athletics program explicitly, take classes during their off season if they want to, and focus on the sport full time. When their eligibility is up, they should then have the option of vesting their scholarship and becoming a regular, full time student. Pretending they've learned as much as someone who isn't at the facility 6 hours a day is screwing them over long run. They are at the school to play sports, let them do it at the same level of commitment as someone studying to go to med school or someone mastering sculpture. They can do an academic degree after.Inb4 "you just haven't had a good cannoli" 

I've had cannoli all around Arthur Avenue that supposedly have the "best cannoli" and, while it was noticable that they were better than the run of the mill cannoli, it still wasn't worth it.

Honestly they're close to disgusting at worst and mediocre at best. A cannoli is just a mouthful of sugary cream with a soggy shell most of the time. There is no depth of flavor in a cannoli, just sweetness. Might as well eat a spoonful of powdered sugar.Nothing drives me crazier than when parents post a photo of their child and then caption it "my stinky", "my croch gobblin", "monster" etc. I keep thinking about how these kids are going to see these posts someday and have a really bad view of how their parents felt about them as kids.

I just feel like parents shouldn't post these names for the whole world to see. It is one thing to call your kids these names at home. But when you post it for everyone to see it might make your kids have mixed feelings later in life.This is about Music,Gaming,Movies,Anime etc! I know many don't care or want to care but I feel like its very toxic and super annoying. To me overrating is not saying something is number one or the best that is fine. Its your opinion that imo should be respected something that hardly exist sometimes. 

 Overrating is when you claim a name of media is better than all others and its not even close. Reason you are putting your favorite name of media on a high pedestal above all others no matter how popular it is you are overrating it if u do this.

The second form which is very toxic and many people do which is the someone likes something else "their stupid" or "their opinions are wrong" obviously they say worse shit than that but many get angry when someone likes something different. If you have to tell others they are wrong or shit on there preference to boast yours you are overrating. 

  The final form of overrating which imo my bro does "This insert media name requires more brain etc tham most" Rather its a game,movie,books,music you are not more woke or intelligent because of what music,books, movies you like and you are not more skilled and a better gamer because you play a certain game.It is the only sport in which your only goal is to just look good. And any person who used Steriods to build there body is not Great bodybuilder in my books, even Arnold Schwarzenegger. They are just Sculptures of Oversized Unnatural Build Physic while inspiring thousands of people to Inject Steriods in there body and lead an unhealthy lifestyle just to look good. PATHETIC, STUPID and an extremely SUPERFICIAL sport.I’m a dude in his 20s and I travel frequently for work and fun. I also try to go to the gym at least 3 times a week, but I aim for 5. As a result, I’m constantly trying out new gyms and it fucking pisses me off how little standardization there is.

If I’m going to squat or bench press, the god damn barbell should always be the same weight wherever I go, or at the very fucking least put the barbell weight somewhere on the bar itself. 

If I’m going to incline leg press, the sled should either be the same weight as other gyms or again make it abundantly clear how heavy it is. No one should have to google to figure out how much they are lifting or feel the damn shame I’ve felt when taking weight off after my first rep. 

Etc. etc. this pretty much applies to all gym equipment. 

Nothing’s worse than thinking you hit a PR while out of town and then going back home and realizing the barbell you were using over there was somehow made out of fucking down feathers. Maybe I’m stupid and I should automatically notice the difference between an Olympic bar and a Powerlifting bar (and whatever other bar types are out there) but regardless, a little note on the side titled, “For the dumb ones” describing the weight of the bar, would be a wonderful.

Edit:

For those of you who keep pointing out that there are only a limited number of barbell types, you are correct and I was just using it as an example. The biggest culprits in terms of weight discrepancies are the various weightlifting machines.Specifically in the years before (and even during) high school, It's kind of pointless rewarding students for their attendance seeing as it's usually the parents that are the determining factor on whether the kid can go to school in the first place. 


Kids from bad situations usually disappear from the school system for long stretches of time due to their home life. The ones with parents that care about school will make sure they are in school as much as possible. Giving the kid a sticker for showing up 5 out of the 5 days really isn't going to change their parents perspective/opinion on how important school is in their childs life.Never found these funny. They show exactly how astrology works, basically making up memes about moments in your life when you feel insecure or accomplish something and then attribute it to a particular zodiac sign as if they are specific to someone born in September or something, even though they are general and can pretty much apply to anyone. So it's just the Forer effect.Sandra Laing was not a unique case… she looked the way she did bc her mom cheated on her dad. I have absolutely no idea how anyone actually believes that story. It’s very clear that Sandra Laing’s mom simply had an affair, that there is nothing more to the story than that, to be perfectly honestI know it had terrible reviews by the critics but when I watch it I burst of laughing, the Matt Lauer bits, the Danny Mcbride character, it's not sofisticated humor but to me the script is pretty good actuallySure… I’ll answer a survey.  Either way, you in internet land already know what I’m watching, when, how, where.. so whatever.  I’ll tell you what car I’ve heard of, or what kind of restaurant I prefer.   I am sick of seeing (and hearing) a loud ad.  

I will not buy something from someone who uses blisteringly loud YouTube ads to try and get me to look at their totally useless product.I completely get if you want to live alone, I do too. But, if every single story you have with a roommate with a bad one, I’m going to lean towards you were more of a problem then they were.Someone that thinks 'My dad/mom/sibling/friend literally just died, let me take a pic and upload it to Reddit', is seeking attention. Who does something like that? Why would that even be a thought that pops into your head?"Oh no, that place is awesome, it's just you're a tourist/foreigner so they think you're an idiot/dislike you, so they just don't care/actively want to serve you shit lol it's really awesome."  


"Oh no, that place is awesome, you just have to go within at this specific day at this specific time and order only this.  That's when it's fresh lol if you don't know that you're an idiot."  


Nah.  If you decide to serve some of your customers shit because of who they are, not only is your restaurant shit, YOU are shit.  


Also, if something degrades in quality so much over the course of the day/week, you should have it as a special only and take it off once it because unacceptable.  


/rantI don't like it when they shove the camera in their face trying to get a reaction but I like it when the camera is far away and the people don't know that there's a camera there. It's better when their faces aren't visible tho cos they aren't aware that they're being recorded.whenever i eat babybel cheese i like it warm and i don’t like when they are cold i put the cheese with the wrapper on in my armpit until it gets warm and a bonus it makes my armpit cool off and then i’ll eat it i refuse to eat them coldPeople that claim they have people person skills are just excessive talkers. Is it that hard to talk nonstop to someone? Depends. But to me, if someone says they are a people person, I just take it to mean that they talk a lot.The "Jordans" and all that; ever since I was a kid they get SO much hype like it's a big-budget Marvel movie coming out.  Every time I've seen whatever is the newest thing people are hyped for in terms of sneakers, it's some tacky-looking nonsense I wouldn't even pay $10 for.  I'm not even sure I'd take them for free unless it was to just turn around and sell it to someone else for a nice profit, considering how much people are willing to pay for shoes like that.  I prefer a more plain design (that most would call boring) since shoes aren't really a major focal point of your outfit/look, at least imo.I have seen first hand so many people that always teach their kids that nothing in life is free, and that you will always have to work for anything in life regardless of what it is; consequently, this creates a vicious cycle of people believing that the whole world is against you. 

However, if fewer people had this mentality, people in higher positions would be more willing to "let things slide" so to speak, and more willing to give others the things that they want/deserve freely, without the pressure of needing to work for it, thus eventually trickling down to younger people and overall making the world a much much more forgiving place.

I'm not saying that anybody should be able to become a doctor just because they want to, even if they have zero education. I'm saying that I believe that its ridiculous that you cannot borrow a pencil from the teacher in math class if you forget one.

The world would be a better place if people stopped believing that it is permanently awful.What right do you have to be mad? Your relationship with your ex is done. Yes, your ex might turn your friend against you. Yes, your ex might hurt your friend as they hurt you. But, your ex might also have grown as a person and your friend is allowed to do mistakes on their own. I am just trying to say if you are mad at someone in your inner circle for dating your ex after you have broken up you are the problem. You can be mad at your friend for the fallout afterward if it even occurs, but not for the potential.if someone grows up rich and/or very privileged, it isn’t their fault that as an adult they don’t know how to do certain chores or things that most people consider basic knowledge. 

it’s the parents that didn’t teach them those skills nor expose them to that environment, and while i agree they should properly try and learn, that can be hard when they are met with people shaming them. 

i understand that sometimes people are just joking around, but it means these people are less likely to ask for help. we should offer help and guidance instead.I’m guessing this is unpopular since most people I know only eat honey when mixed in a drink or put on food. For me personally, I only like it when I grab a squeezable bottle of it and put some on my mouth, way better then putting it on a food or mixing it.Pretty much title. If I wake up in the morning I’m not gonna spend any extra time undoing my “inside out” sock, and I’m just gonna put them on my feet. 
It’s nice with laundry too because it’s just easy to find two like socks and put them together than having to make sure they’re all the same orientation. 
They feel the same no matter how you wear them and there is no difference.
No one ever notices…Video games has taught me friendship and brotherhood. Games like cod can teach you strategies and decision making. RDR2 taught me to do the right thing and redemption funnily enough. The most important thing its given is a lot of fun. are shown in a bad light and I think that opinion is baseless. It should be moderated like everything but starving your kids of video games is bad parentingThe world I live in is much better than the world I grew up in. Technological advances have made us more connected than ever before. The struggles of the past in human rights continue but there have been gains. We’ve made advances in every aspect of human existence.Songs like Johnny guitar and big iron are the only songs I can even remember from New Vegas and that's just because of memes. Fallout 4 and 3 have way better radios, with 4 easily being the best. Songs like The Wanderer , butcher Pete,  crazy he calls me , rocket 69, etc. smoke anything from New Vegas out of the water.No one wants to see your face up close, smeared with sauce, making stupid faces and moaning like it’s an orgasmic experience. Tommy Winkler comes to mind. I hate the way he bites the silverware he’s using. Plus, eating all this greasy, nasty food in his Tesla, watching the crumbs and lettuce reign down on the upholstery. It’s all pointless.I love drinking hot beer!

You get the whole richness of flavor out of yer bottle or can!

Taste the happiness, the hoppines, citrus pungent goodness, ahhhh.

Not only does it hit you quicker, but I also notice a betterment of my digestion. 

Aye, harken thine land rats, what do yer think?

I DOETH INDULGE IN INDIAN PALE ALES AND DRY IRISH STOUTETHS FOR THE MOST PARTE!The capitol shouldn't hold all of the names. They should take DC and be happy with it, as it's much less of a mouthful. Instead, they prefer to create a bunch of confusion by calling themselves "Washington", in gleeful preparation to correct the poor bystander that asks them about  Seattle. You can see their smug little face, lips puckered, simply waiting for the bystander to almost finish their sentence. Lips quivering, sweating profusely, they proudly interrupt - "*well I actually meant the capitol of the United States of America*".It’s a great holiday. I love being able to celebrate the people that I love. Valentine’s Day always feels special, and I have never (until now) been in a relationship during it. A lot of people hate Valentine’s Day because they don’t have a romantic partner, which is dumb because there’s types of love other than romantic. I also know people who refuse to celebrate it when they have a partner, which I think is usually selfish. It’s just a day where we can love the people around us a little extra and appreciate them.Granted, I"m not the biggest fan of tv shows, so there is a lot I have not seen, but I've tried giving Brooklyn 911 a shot, Rick and Morty, Family Guy (awesome in spurts), Sunny in Philadelphia, etc and I don't think those shows and a lot of other shows are just as funny as Arthur.  The humor in Arthur is so much more wittier. 

 I did not grow up watching Arthur, in fact only started watching the last couple of years because of my daughter. Other shows I don't watch, but find funny, Reno 911 and The Office.  I also appreciate the hell out of Arrested Development, of course Seinfeld.Small Business Saturday is also a stupid day of the year. “Please come spend 1.5x as much money for the same goods/services so I don’t have to get a real job. Please?!”

If your business can’t handle minimum wage increases and is constantly about to fail, it’s a bad business. Just go get a job.I totally get that they are used for different things. I am just saying if I had to choose to only have one, it would be white gravy. It seems no one in my family or friend groups agree with me.I'd hardly consider Kayne West to be a rapper. A producer turned pop artist maybe but definitely no "rapper" by today's standards and I'm not fucking calling him "Ye"  lol because wtfResponsible drug users have to keep their use discreet from many people, so they are mindful of who they share this information with. They have to keep track of their health, and also how they interact with others more than the average person.

They also have to deal with the stigma of drug use and account for that when going to a doctor, therapist, or psychiatrist. Instead of being fully honest they often have to tell partial truths to get adequate treatment. They also have to deal with the stigma from people in general, even when many people drink or eat themselves to death without batting an eye.

So that means that there are people who use drugs that are significantly more productive and intelligent than the average person, but somehow there are still people who feel they are better than them while working with real estate or at a Menards as a manager or some real estate job.

I would argue responsible drug users have more empathy than the average person as well, because of the fact that they have to hide so much about themselves for fear of discrimination legally and socially speaking. I guess it hurts people who hate drug users to know there are people out there who can do more than they can in life despite their drug use. Or maybe it's denial about the fact that drug users are people.I love spicy food, but I'm not always in the mood for it, and sometimes I have heartburn. So many people who enjoy spicy food, have to drench every meal in hot sauce. Every time they order food, it has to be spicy, they'll never opt for the regular chicken sandwich, always the spicy one, because they love spicy food. It's strange to me, it feels like an extension for some people's personality.

Nobody does this for anything else food related, you won't hear people raving about how they only order burritos with steak because they just love it that much, and they're never in the mood for chicken burritos.

I feel like alot of people like spicy food, and think that they have to get spicy food every time, just to prove that they like spicy food.Stay with me.

I heard about Bitcoin while many of you were still in grade school from my brother who is historically anti government. I clearly should have listened back in 2009/2010 and could have been rich.

Many of the crypto bros have already missed the boat for crypto that “mooned” and are late to the game. In a lot of personal finance subs they jump in trying to convince people to buy into their pyramid scheme so they don’t feel so bad about their poor monetary choices.

You all need to come to reality that it isn’t a good play. Not that you shouldn’t diversity and put SOME of your net worth (NW) into it but betting the whole enchilada is stupid and foolish.

Like the old proverb - “There is nothing easier to separate than a fool and his money.”They taste like liquid salt, but thats how I like it. store bought soy sauce smells. I can't taste the salt in any store bought soy sauce, even in high sodium ones. I don't know how bad they are for you, but I'd love to buy bottles of them. 

there's no way I can write 160 words about this. among us among us among us among is among us among us among us among is among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us2 truths 1 lie? Sure! Never have I ever? Sounds fun! Heads up? I’ll give it a try! I liked all the games at school and summer camps, too. Of course, this hinges on the fact that my workplace respects me and pays me well. It’s much easier to have fun when you know that your colleagues think of you as a human being.They Olympics should only be sports that can be timed out use a point system that equal for everyone. I don't care what person the judges think are the best, those aren't sports, just popularity contests that can be bias.Seriously, who jumps on reddit and starts click-clockin' around all the while carefully avoiding NSFW tag so that they don't see any description or mention of sex or whatever. First off, if that's what it's for, it's just a terrible filter system, since there is a comment feature on reddit. Second, it is virtually always appended to post titles that are already clear about their contents without it. And finally, why the reference to being at work? Where do people work that their employer doesn't mind if they are surfing reddit, as long as they are not reading a post that mentions something naughty.  I don't see the point of it, unless it is to make the post seem a bit racy or something for clicks, which is also annoying.

That said, if it's warning about sexy photos or something like that then fine, it makes more sense. But the fact there is a few clearly helpful examples is just one more reason to drastically curtail its excessive use.For new drivers, driving a stick shift really makes you focus on driving and what you are doing, it’s very hard to do normal distractive things while driving a manual car, such as texting and eating. Usually by the time they start doing these things while driving a manual car they are very competent drivers. I personally don’t know a single driver that is capable of driving a manual transmission car that I don’t feel comfortable with. But I do know a lot who have only driven automatic that I would not ride with even if my life depended on it.Unless you came from a well-off/privileged family, your 20s tend to be filled with sadness, depression, anxiety about your future, and poverty. At least mine were. You're also still developing and learning (for better or worse) what it's like to be an adult. But even with my depressing 20s, they were still in every way more superior to my teens, which I like to pretend never existed in the first place. 

When you reach your 30s, you tend to be more self-assured, confident, financially stable, and aware of what your mind, body, and soul needs to be happier. 

I'm currently 32 and the past couple of yrs have been filled with more amazing moments, joy, pleasurable experiences, and travels than my entire 20s. You couldn't pay me to go back to my 20s.What’s not to like? Fancy clothes, open bar, good food, music, old people being cute, your close friend experiencing the best day of their life, probably a lot of your mutual friends to party with. I don’t understand people who are like “any excuse to not go to a wedding, amirite???” Weddings are a big free party full of close family and friends and are a blast.In the flat screen game the more “ robotic” (for lack of a better word) movements feel a lot cooler to me, and the on rails movement bugged me more then I expected. Also, the VR version is way too easy in my opinion due to the extra body movement, which to be fair I most definitely should’ve expected a little bitIt’s still a good show, don’t get me wrong, but I think season 1 was the most high quality season. The quality has slightly decreased with each season. As the show goes on, it keeps explaining more and more about the Titans taking away from their mystery and menace. I still watch the show, but I just haven’t been as engaged as I used to be

Edit: I’m glad I’ve found an ACTUAL unpopular opinion lolwhile i was watching an episode of atop the fourth wall, linkara said that the phrase everyone\`s a critic is true because whenever you watch a movie or a tv show or read a book or play a video game, YOU become a critic as you form your opinions on it. when i said that, i realized how right he actually was. 

the phrase everyone\`s a critic has become a phrase used to decry criticism. however, it\`s actually true. when you watch a movie, you will either like it or you will not like it and you\`ll have reasons why. that will make you a critic. this also applies to basically anything you pay money for. even something as simple as gardening tools. when you use a gardening tool, you will either find it useful and a good product or you will not find it useful and a bad product. that makes you a critic.If current events have shown us anything it’s that the ultra wealthy have no interest in altruism or the wellbeing of others. There is no ‘Tony Stark’ do-good genius on the horizon that will use their wealth for the betterment of humanity, leading us into a better future. Quite the opposite in fact since they doubled their wealth whilst everyone else suffered.
It’s highly likely that we are at the dawn of the age of techno feudalism where a small ultra rich minority hold all the worlds wealth and power. Some would say we are already there, however at the moment we have the numerical superiority on our side. Given advances in technology however it is likely that this will soon be nullified and the bulk of human kind will be discarded as soon as technology makes living breathing workers be deemed unprofitable.
Your children may live to witness the private ownership of states/countries, after mass unemployment leads to such shortfalls in taxation that governments go broke and are purchased wholesale by private mega corporations or even ultra rich individuals.
Imagine living in a country operated by Amazon where there are no voter rights  only ‘shareholder rights’ and your meagre rations are calculated by algorithm, dispensed in relation to the number of ‘productive’ hours you spent picking through rubbish piles or carrying out tasks deemed unworthy to be carried out by an automated machine.
As soon as driverless trucks, AI security and worker robots become more profitable than people we will be discarded with the click of a button, in the spreadsheet column marked (overheads).
We should act now and move against these oligarchs, while we still have the numerical advantage or your childrens children may grow up learning the corporate anthem of the United States of Teslica.

Still, they might get Rollerball so it’s not all bad.Most of my life I’ve enjoyed watching TV. But lately, I can’t seem to stay focused on most movies or shows. They’re often too predictable. I find myself getting incredibly restless when watching 90% of them. When it is truly well-made I can focus and enjoy it, but it’s kinda rare for me. Like I LOVED the new Boba Fett series. But I would say the majority of the time I don’t enjoy watching TV any more. Anyone else feeling this way?Everytime this has come up people complain about the food, but i was on a 12 hour flight and the other day (Iberian Airlines, 50ish row so no first class meals) and the food they gave us was better than what I eat at home.


 I was first given spaghetti as main plate, some more spaghetti in a smaller bowl and a sort of cake and also a drink. Later I was offered another drink and a sandwich and a while later another drink.


I understand that the nutritional value and all that isn't that good, but who complains about good tasting food?The ability to understand what it is exactly that you are putting into your body is a luxury that is completely necessary to ensure that you are only doing what you believe is actually what you're doing. Street drugs such as fentanyl or heroin do not have this fool-proof method of knowing the true potency of what they are about to injest. This lack of information is entirely crucial to the extent of this being a life or death decision. Is it good enough that I can do the same amount, or will I have to do more? Should I start with more? All these questions run through your head when you don't know what to expect so alot of times you make the irrational decision to do just as much if not more than the last time... Except this time the potency is 3 times what it had been the last time you copped. You're dead and that's that. Sad story....

Long story short, if addicts were able to pass an inspection and get a recommendation from a doctor, they should be able to say," listen doc, I'm an addict and I am using street fentanyl. I'd really like to stay alive for my family but my mind is so twisted right now all I want is the real deal and not some blocker... Could you prescribe me a couple weeks worth to help deal with the craving and we'll see how I feel from there. I'd rather not wake up dead by doing something real stupid with something I can't trust is either garbage or a trip 6-feet under." And the doctor would understand and oblige.

Anyways that's my rent...
TL;DR - I believe that prescription opiates should be available over the counter to those struggling with addiction issues and could use something regulated vs something someone mixed up in their question without a measuring spoon lolReal estate investing has boomed in recent years. People make tiktoks about the millions they’ve made off of investment properties, HGTV makes everyone think they can flip a house, low interest rates have encouraged more investors, and AirBnB makes it easier now more than ever to get tenants (even if they’re short term).

I know a huge chunk of the housing issue right now is inventory and a lack of new construction in the last decade. But so many home buyers just looking for a place to live are getting outbid by cash investors who are going to go in, paint the walls gray, add gray laminate flooring and a stylish backsplash, call it a flip and list it for rent, AirBNB or resell for an unearned profit. Leaving the middle class who just need a decent home in a decent school district or with a decent commute in the dust. And it’s just going to keep getting worse, making inventory worse, and driving up prices. I think this will lead to the worst housing market and housing crisis the US has ever seen.I wonder if people will downvote based on title and rightfully so BUT I mean on your own. I miss my time working and hanging out in bars. I met some cool ass people there but I didn’t want to do it forever. This is reflective because I self medicated for so long. I have a happy life with pets, kickass husband and baby, but damn I’d love to hang out in a bed I don’t have to clean watching tv with nothing but a knock on the door from overpriced, over rated hotel food, looking forward to an under $20 breakfast buffet. I want to wake up starfishing in a giant bed with no pressure besides an 11am check out time that I politely request and am granted an extension until edit 1…. Or maybe noon.I am an Asian American, so I eat a lot of asian and american food. I know so many Asians who criticize american cuisine as being unhealthy. (hot dog pizza burger stereotype) 
However in recent years, asian countries have been adding so much cheese and unhealthy stuff to their traditional recipes for no reason. I recently went to a korean restaurant and they added cheese to the ramen, rice cakes, and chicken. Every dish had a version that was deep fry or added cheese on it. The dipping sauce was a lot heavier than it used to be. 

It’s interesting that a lot of asian cultures judge americans for eating a certain way but they seem to be going towards that direction themselves. I wonder why?Many subs, ads, trends, movements, etc. are flooding the social consciousness with the awesomeness of “being you” and touting the freedom of doing things for yourself. That’s great and all and has it’s place, but imo it’s gone too far. I’ve seen countless comments where any reference to criticism from an SO is met with responses about how the person should dump/divorce them immediately. Any disagreement with parents/authority figures is met with declarations that the other party is insane or a narcissist or is just trying to hold you back. Good lord - NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IS A PART OF LIFE. Society does not and should not cater to you. People need and deserve criticism lest they conclude that they are above reproach in every way. Bosses get to tell you what to do. Parents get to make rules. Society gets to criticize your stupid choices. Christ on a cracker get over yourselves.I mean we know right off the bat (depending on the YouTuber) 90% of the confessions are fake. This on its own is not super annoying especially if you can make a compelling story, but most people just ask themselves “what’s the most shocking thing I can say?” and send that in.

That’s annoying, sure. What’s MORE annoying are the stories that I know for a fact are true. The almost mundane, vaguely shitty confessions. It’s not something as crazy as the constant inc*st, but situations where the person was selfish or jealous and acted on that. Ruining someone’s day because they were in a bad mood. 

And even after all that, I could maybe stand it enough to watch my favorite creator’s reactions and listen to their commentary. But it’s that pompous, patronizing attitude that oozes out of those submissions that makes me irrationally angry. No remorse to be found, they even think it was funny. “Yeah this girl had on the same dress as me at homecoming so I “accidentally” spilled my drink on her. Oh well lol ;p”. That’s a bad example, sounds like a Disney movie but you get the point. I can’t stand it.

But they’re only getting more popular and more and more YouTubers are doing it. Fuck me.You hear a lot of people now chanting "same work, same pay". No. It should be "same work, same place, same pay". Salaries should not be equal, they should be fair.

This means that  developers working from Ukraine or Poland making less money than ones working from SF or Austin makes sense; Factory workers working in China or India making less money than ones working in US or Germany makes sense; And so on.

This is all due to one fundamental truth: the value of money is relative. We can't live in money, we can't eat money, we can't drink money, all we can do is trade it for the things we need. Is a salary of $36,000/year good? Depends where! In some places you can live like a top exec with that kind of money. In other places you might need to have 3 roommates, a bunk bed and your idea of eating out would be McDonalds

Salaries mean nothing without a geography to put them into context, and as long as living costs are drastically different in different places around the globe, it makes total sense for salaries to be just as different. It isn't abuse, it isn't bias, it's just plain logic.It is disgusting. If Will had cheated on Jada the entire internet would turn on him and crucify him. Except because he is a man he is the one being mocked and memed.

Firstly, we don't have a reason to be involved in their relationship, and if they choose to make it work then good on them. 

However, that doesn't mean Jada should be proud of her actions. She abused the trust of a great man. I'm kinda surprised the internet isn't backing Will on this to be honest.

FYI the mods have banned me from posting.I don’t understand why it’s illegal in some places and under many circumstances to sleep in your car. Your car is your property and you should have the right to sleep in it without question. For any reason whatsoever. It could be that you can’t afford an apartment or you just decided not to drive home drunk and sleep in your car. Or any other damn reason. I understand if you park your car on someone’s property illegally and try to sleep in it you should be forced to find another spot but sleeping in your car should be legal. It’s property and no one should be telling me that I can’t sleep in it.As a man in my late 50s I wish I had the halls to walk off a job when I was younger. After starting my own business and spending years in upper management I have to say I love millennials and think they will change the work place for the better. Seeing a 22 college grad say that's not my job and not in my job description always gave me a envy boner, watching a middle manager retort with if you don't like the job leave and having a millennial fire back I'll send out 100 apps on indeed tonight and have a new one tommorow bye! Wanna know what that makes me do? Think hard about how my employees are treated and how well they are paid because on today's day and age my job is just as replaceable as they are. Keep ghosting and walking away my young friends I get it!I’m just one guy. I try to be a good person; I try to treat everyone equally; I try to be kind and compassionate; I try to be a force of good.

But I’m just one guy. I have problems of my own. I have a life of my own. I shouldn’t be expected to constantly wade through the shit that is the political and societal hellscape of 2020. I’m not a racist because you don’t think I’m angry enough. I’m not uneducated because I don’t pour through hours of toxic political commentary. I’m not privileged for wanting to distance myself from hatred.

I’m so sick of being alternatively mocked and hated for not living up to other people’s freedom fighter fantasy. I’m trying my best but I’m just one guy.

**Edit: I just wanna say thanks to all the folks leaving comments like “Get the fuck over yourself”; “You’re a self-absorbed loser”; and “Shut the fuck up”.**

**You’ve done a marvelous job demonstrating why this post was made.**I hate hearing people say, "oh, he bought a Corvette because he's balding and needs to feel younger." No. No no no no NO. As someone who's never earned much money because I made the spectacular decision to do what I love rather than what was lucrative, I'm finally in a position in my late 30s where I can actually save up to buy my dream car.

I get it if cars aren't important to you. I get it if you dislike the impact they have on the environment. I get it if you think sports cars are too expensive and a hassle. I get it if you see a forty something guy in a BMW M3 and assume he's compensating for something. But realize that automotive enthusiasm is a huge part of life for a lot of people, and can often be the biggest connection they have to family members or friends. 

As a car enthusiast, I look forward to increased electrification for a lower carbon footprint (and ridiculous torque for better acceleration). I accept that my budget will have to increase for a cool exotic car and decrease for other pursuits. It's worth it to me. Just like you might enjoy collecting stamps or having a closet full of nice clothes. It's also the first thing I talk about when I call my dad since he used to race cars and motorcycles in the 70s. We bond over cars and car news.

So the next time you see some guy with graying temples and a widow's peak driving a Ferrari, understand it might be the realization of a dream from childhood and try to, you know, not crap on that dream because it's not YOUR dream.I'm British, from a small town in the middle of England, nobody EVER says "Y'all" here and i don't get why.

When i first heard the word i thought it was stupid, but the older i get the more and more i realise how much i would easily use "Y'all" in every day life.

I'm a manager in my office so i often have to refer to multiple people at a time, "You all" or "You lot" or "All of you" is fine for now but can come off quite harsh, i've now rotated "Y'all" into the mix and it just FITS so well. Its soft, comes out friendly. Everyone knows what i mean, it rolls off the tongue nicely and i get to put that sweet southern accent on when i say it.

I think we should all adapt to it because honestly, it works.

EDIT: Jesus christ, this was a quick 5 minute post... how on earth did it boom this big?!When at a restaurant, waiting staff always find it weird when I order the dessert before the appetizer and the main course. They ask “oh, is that all that you’re having?”. I’m like “no… I just want my cheesecake first, please”. I have to convince them that I’m just a dessert first kinda guy. I feel like the main course is much more enjoyable when your dopamine levels are boosted.Graduates and school leavers already have an extremely hard time finding work in todays economy, most of which are forced to do jobs that had nothing to do with their fields because companies are too lazy to train and too cheap to offer training, they always want some other company to train them. Also if you require 3-5 years experience then the salary of those jobs should be considerably  higher and NOT the basic entry level salary, they just want more for less. So long as your qualifications meet the required job they should be considered.  
It's so hard to find a news outlet that will just present the information without spin. Without trying to push you one way or another. I just want to know what happened so I can decide whether I like it or not. Why is that so hard to find? Quit telling me what to think.Let’s be honest, most of you barely pay attention on geometry. How many of you will honestly say you’ll pay attention while they teach how to do your taxes or explain to you how to cook or sew? How many of you will pay attention while they explain to you how to change oil or how to do quick fixes around the home until you can get a professional? Not many of you, and thus would make the classes null and void.                             

Also, how many of you would actually sign up for these classes if they were offered? Because a lot of my classmates wanted Japanese and German as a foreign language classes instead of the standard Spanish and French. And of those 50 students that petitioned for the classes only 3 signed up.Stealthing was rather prominent in the news not too long ago (over here in the UK),  
our laws cause this to be classified as rape.

If someone female lies about using birth control, they *should* face prosecution.  
 Furthermore, any child should not be the financial responsibility of the father.Don’t find fulfillment in your career. Find fulfillment in the hobbies you have, adventures you go on, and people you help because you have the financial freedom to do so. If you love your job that’s awesome, but this isn’t realistic for many people.My words might be all over the place, just trying to gather my thoughts. 

It’s crazy to me how in this day and age we advocate for women’s mental health, we advocate for people to be understanding of women’s needs. But i noticed with the whole Will smith debacle (His wife jada was sleeping with someone while they were still married but taking a break) anyways in the video he looks really sad and like he’d been crying - might’ve just been tired but nevertheless, the internet wouldn’t stop with the jokes. If the shoe were on the other foot it would be people banding together calling others insensitive. I know that it’s popular right now to say “men are trash” and i just think if people went around saying “women are trash” everyone would be up in arms. We should be advocating for good mental health for ALL people.  I know statistically speaking men commit more crimes and stuff like that, and it’s more of a reason to lift men up and advocate for their mental health.


Edit: Hi all, didn’t expect this to get so much conversation going but I’m glad it has. Thank you for sharing your stories with me.As the title says. I’m so sick of this virtue signaling on social media and cities where everyone is clapping and praising us. When you apply to medical school you apply to these terms and it’a just our job. Sure, it’s tiresome and the situation isn’t really great but still. A lot of my coworkers are pumping their ego with this and enjoy the attention. I don’tSeriously, this shit needs to stop. So many people, with nothing wrong with them other than gluttony and laziness. So many people walk in to walmart, plop their fat asses in the chairs that are for older people and cripples, then just leave them in the middle of the parking lot like the waste of space and resources that they are.

Let's be upfront and honest. You don't get to be 500 pounds due to "genetics". 95% of people you see that are that size on a daily basis had NOTHING wrong with them before turning in to a drain on society.This is something I seriously want people's opinions on. I saw a post of Leo DiCaprio taking a selfie with a young fangirl (looked like 12yo or something) at the US Open and just sitting there chatting to her. The first comment I see is "Idk this makes me uncomfortable"

I can't tell you how much it pissed me off. Someone in my eyes doing something so fucking cool as giving a fan the time of day and chatting to them can INSTANTLY be associated with pedophilia. It makes me sick. And then we call out celebrities when they don't want to take a selfie with us? 

I love kids. I love listening to them, I love escaping reality with them, I love teaching them, I love watching them grow. How does someone see that and think "Well then you must love having sex with them too"

How fucking disturbed are you as a person for your mind to take that route? [In this picture](https://www.google.com/search?q=leonardo+dicaprio+fan+us+open&client=ms-android-huawei&prmd=niv&sxsrf=ALeKk03K6AFayKktovpg3WRJnc0CWF8z1A:1594114917775&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQvZ7r7LrqAhXiVhUIHewPCW8Q_AUoAnoECAwQAg&biw=360&bih=524&dpr=3#imgrc=jvgzTazmflhuCM) Leo isn't touching the girl, he's not sniffing the girl or doing some other creepy ass shit. How is talking to a young person instantly associated with pedophilia? 

We desperately need to change this attitude, because the people protecting and making young kids feel comfortable are being shamed and wrongfully accused of pedophilia. 

By all means, at all times be wary. But don't just jump to pedophilia. That is fucked up and we need to change that mindset.Pretty much what the title says. Not my opinion, but my husband’s. In college my husband and I would make oven pizzas and he would run his slices under the water fountain to cool it down faster. He says it didn’t change the taste and was still good.

Edit: I’ve gotten a lot of accusations that this is fake/karma whoring. My brother that lives with us took a video on Snapchat at dinner tonight, so you may all feast your eyes on water pizza. 
[water pizza](https://imgur.com/a/MH9McIw)I have been getting so much grief from my gamer friends for playing games on easy mode. They are calling me “not a true gamer” because I don’t play on hard mode. I just want to enjoy a game for the story line and not get frustrated dying endless times not being able to defeat a boss or making a simple mistake. Does that make me less of a gamer?Wikipedia is a practically unlimited source of free knowledge which is constantly being monitored by an army of nerds. 

The fact that we do not have to pay for access is a miracle.

(Near enough) every article has a full and reliable list of references at the bottom.

I understand that students should be encouraged use the references at the bottom for true research but this is not taught. Students are simply told ‘Stay away from Wikipedia, anyone can change it, it’s completely unreliable’.Whenever I hear someone talk about a restaurant where the menus have pictures of the food on them, they talk about it as if it’s a red flag. Bullshit!! I want to see pictures of what the food I am going to order looks like!! It’s so much easier to decide what you want to eat that way. Oh and I don’t understand how people can think it’s tacky then look at the food at the table next to them and be like “oh that looks good”, then ask the other table what they ordered so they can order the same thing. I don’t care if it makes me seem like a dumb small minded person. I wanna see more pictures of food. It rules!!The company is avoiding the following costs by selling digitally:

Sourcing materials

Manufacturing

Shipping

Shelf space

Employee wages

YET IT STILL costs the same price as a digital copy. Anyone who buys digital is absolutely being scammed.Every time I open my phone, look at a newspaper, watch TV, or go onto my computer, all I see is news about the United States of America. I don't give a single shit about that country, its infuriating. I couldn't care less about who is running the USA any more than I care who is running Zimbabwe or Denmark.

Edit: Grammar and spellingI deleted Facebook in 2011 and since, never looked back and if anything so glad that I did. 

The issue now, FB is so integrated into day to day life people only use that for advertising. 

I hate getting emails about "Win this product" then you read how to enter and they say, Like Us/Follow Us and re post Us on Facebook to be entered. 

Or a restaurant which is FB only and clicking the link you are greeted with a million log in screens and limited information. 

IMO this is a rubbish way to get to your target audience and I avoid companies who solely use FB.

Edit 001: Spelling

Edit 002: Wow. Yeah, so this early Sunday morning post has got a lot more upvotes than I expected. Thank you all. 

I'm still reading all of the comments but here are some updates to some of the more common comments I've read so far. 

1. I do get small businesses depend on FB as it's free. Also it's great to have transparency for reviews from genuine consumers. Being able to openly read these comments would be great - but these aren't always visible to non-fb users. Question: Can the FB Page Owner just delete comments/reviews or is this like eBay in which you have to appeal them?

2. Yes, professional websites do cost a lot - agreed. With digital e-commerce/SEO required, this can be difficult for smaller businesses to get into - but there are lots of free domain services with easy to use GUI's (similar user experiences that they would find when using FB Pages to set up/maintain) that also display in Google Search's. 

3. A few comments saying "I must not be the target audience" - this is a bit of a tricky one as context matters. The reason I posted this was due to a BBQ Restaurant about 1 hour away from where I live that I wanted to eat at today with my GF. I'm 30, love food (especially BBQ) and have spare disposable income to spend eating out - how am I not the perfect target audience? - the reason I was looking for a website (which lead me directly to there Facebook page) was to find info about Covid Restrictions, whats in the Menu, Pricing and if I could book a table.  The FB page had limited information without having to log in.

4. Seems like a lot of people use fake Facebook profiles to get around things like this. Personally I don't really like the idea of making fake profiles for anything. 

- I'll update further once I've read more of the comments. My app notifications have gone wild. Definitely brightened up my Sunday. Thanks Reddit ✌️If i could, "Just be confident" don't you think I would be already?!  I hate being nervous around new people, but I can't just decide to not be.  I already understand how important confidence is.  I can't explain why I don't have any because I don't know.

A depressed person may want to cheer up, but they just can't will themselves happy.  There is more to it.

This is how I feel about it.  I know I can't be the only one.

Edit: this blew up/thanks for awards/yadda yadda

A lot of people are saying to "fake it until you make it".  That advice also feels dumb.  If I knew how to fake being confident, isn't that just be acting confident?  Even if I do not feel confident acting like I do requires me to know what the fuck I am doing.  It's like, when I try to talk to someone I just met I just lock up and can't think of anything to say.  I make some meek greetings before withdrawing from the conversation into myself.  I know this is an issue, but don't know how to get around it.  If I just knew how to get past that hurdle than I wouldn't have an issue with confidence.  I would just be able to talk to people.  

"fake it until you make it" falls into the same pitfall.  If I could, I already would!I get that they are historically important, but some people think these guys from 200 years ago were incredible at predicting the future. As a non American, this always seems weird to me.

Edit: Wow the replies in here, way to prove my point!So, I myself have big boobs and I have no idea why people wish they had big boobs so badly. They're so annoying and don't look good and I've even been mocked for the size of my boobs. I wish I had small boobs and would happily exchange mine for smaller boobs, especially since I'm a dude.Yeah sure, it’s futuristic and all, but a lot of them are just becoming a hassle and a hazard. I shouldn’t have to spam tap a screen to change the climate controls, whereas a dial would be so much simpler and easy to use. The screens are basically impossible to use with gloves on if you live in a colder place. And frankly, most automakers just suck at making them. They are super laggy and hard to use. Cars can still look modern with a clean button and dial interior setup, and perhaps a smaller screen to display information. The infotainment system should not have to constantly take the drivers attention off the road.

Edit: thanks for the awards, unaware that this was previously posted on r/cars though, my apologies"In 2015, 6ix9ine pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance and received a four-year probation period and a 1,000-hour community service order. In 2018, he was arrested on racketeering, weapons, and drugs charges. He pled guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to commit murder" [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6ix9ine)

Yet somehow all his videos get 100s of millions of views. He is the Roman Polanski of hip hop. There are tons of hop hop artists who are better than him, both musically and as people. He is the very definition of someone who should not be celebrated. A disgusting, child abusing sicko.Sorting by "most popular" proves it. What the hell is this? 4k blondes with huge plastic breasts having cliché american porn sex with chad.

What's erotically even remotely interesting about that? It's the porn equivalent of listening to Nickelback.I mean that’s pretty much it but if you post about your problem in your marriage or with substance abuse or difficult parents for the love of GOD get a second opinion from an actual professional - who will tell you that, fun fact, your husband not making you a sandwich is not spousal abuse.


EDIT: thank you for all the awards! I really appreciate all the feedback too. A ton of people have pointed out that professional help is expensive and hard to come by and I 100% agree - if anyone’s interested, I use these videos to check myself before I wreck myself when I can’t physically go see my therapist in person.

 Also, I see a lot of people are offended over the fact that I said 23 years olds in the title - this is because I am literally 23. I for some reason assumed most people on those threads are around my age, but the truth is I have no idea how old the average Redditor is.

EDIT 2: I am not the husband who didn’t want to make my wife the sandwich. 
1) I am a woman 
2) I am not married, and thus have no wife to feed. 
3) I would never not make a sandwich. Making someone else a sandwich means I get to make myself a sandwich, and my sandwiches are a goddamn delight. Like breaking and entering, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, first degree murder, terrorism, etc...  the coordinating police chief in charge of the raid should be held responsible for whatever happens.

Thanks for the awards. Glad we’re on the same page......The last war that was really about “our rights” was the civil war. Vietnam, WWI, II, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan were really about global power dynamics. The soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights, because our rights were not really being threatened.

Edit: this has been very interesting! A few points to address.

1.	A repeat theme is that WW2 was about American Rights. I politely disagree. The US entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. We had no choice. We had been declining for 5 years to enter the war. Now I guess it’s very true that many people joined the military after Pearl Harbor out of a sense of duty. But I just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights. It was 100% a just war. But much of the justification was learned of only after the fact (most Americans didn’t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps). 

2.	I never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty. Join for whatever reason! I’m all for it. 

3.	This last point is very important. Many have said that without the military we wouldn’t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing. This is an interesting notion. Because from my vantage point as an American, our military is the most powerful it has ever been, yet I have seen a steady derogation of American rights and freedoms throughout my entire life - from within. Being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure. It’s actually the opposite IMO. The lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked. Look at China and Russia where it’s happening today and has happened for a while. Look at the last 12 years in the US (increased surveillance, Portland, police brutality etc).Like come on, people who work their assess off have to struggle more so than people who are good at a sport? It's just like how Doctors are paid less than NBA Players... one saves lives, the other plays basketball competitively.I hate always being teased for ordering vanilla ice cream or buying a vanilla cake. No, vanilla is not plain. It is a flavor, and there is such thing as plain ice cream (nasty btw). If anything, chocolate is more plain than vanilla since literally everything can be chocolate.

EDIT: Wow didn’t expect so many people liked vanilla. It’s been brought to my attention that in some cases, vanilla actually is plain. Most of the time however, it is just called vanilla, and doesn’t actually have any vanilla flavoring, which doesn’t help vanilla’s reputation at all, so I’m referring specifically to vanilla flavored things.In my opinion, math is the most beautiful of any "traditional school subject," but the thing is schools are set up in a way that encourages teaching math as a bunch of formulas to memorize. And real math is seldom about memorization. I heard a friend describe math as "the most useful game humanity has ever created" and I have to say I agree with that. Math is like a game, it's a playground where you try to extrapolate truths from a set of rules. I will now spend the rest of this post explaining parts of math that are ignored in schools but are super interesting to me. My explanations don't use any technical math terms, but some of the videos linked will require some thinking.

1.) fractals: You might have heard of these before. Essentially, they're shapes that no matter how much you zoom into them, they're still rough. They never end up looking straight like a polygon or curved like a... curve. Some of my favorite are the [Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPHbgHVxLYY), the [burning ship fractal](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-burning-ship-fractal/), and the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). All of these are mathematical objects that have infinite complexity but are governed by relatively simple rules. The Sierpinski triangle is just putting triangles in triangles, and the other two use something called "complex numbers" which sounds very obtuse, but can actually be explained in under 30 minutes. But these fractals are even crazier: we often think of shapes in terms of how many dimensions they have. A line is 1D, a square is 2D, a cube is 3D, etc. But by a certain definition, fractals have a **fractional** dimension. So. for example, that Sierpinski triangle is about 1.585 dimensional. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4) for details

2.) Chaos theory: ever heard of the term "the butterfly effect?" This actually originated from a field of math called chaos theory, which studies systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. One example of a system they study is called the Lorentz Attractor, which is a simplification of the laws that govern the weather. What I love about the Lorentz attractor, is that when you "solve" it with a computer, it draws out paths that look like these [beautiful butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/a/0FS86tI). Let me make that clear: a couple of mathematical equations draw out something that looks as beautiful as that. There isn't human intervention in that drawing, that's just what the equations draw. There's also the [Chaos Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) which uses probability to draw things. When you run the chaos game on certain initial conditions, you get this [absurdly accurate drawing of a fern](https://imgur.com/CizSVy1). Again, none of this is done by a human, all of these works of art are made entirely by solving mathematical equations. If you find that out and don't want to learn more, you're crazy

3.) Unexpected results: Let's take a second to play a [game of pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). We'll knock one pool ball (ball one) into another (ball two), and count how many times they collide with each other or the wall. Then, let's change the mass of one of the balls and see how that affects the collision count. Tell me if you notice a pattern

    Mass of ball 1    Mass of ball 2      Collision #
    1kg               1kg                 3
    100kg             1kg                 31
    10000kg           1kg                 314
    1000000kg         1kg                 3141
    100000000kg       1kg                 31415
    10000000000kg     1kg                 314159
    1000000000000kg   1kg                 3141592

Now you might not notice it, because it's not something you'd expect, but when you increase the mass by 100x, the collision count adds **another digit of pi**. Again, hitting some balls against each other writes out **the digits of pi**. I find that crazy. Pi is normally about circles: I don't see a circle. And pi is counting something. When was the last time you saw it do that? In the words of the legendary math educator Grant Sanderson "If you have a **soul** you need to know why!"

I could name more instances of math being beautiful, but I think these three should be sufficient for a silly Reddit post. However, even if I didn't completely change your view of math, I hope you understand why people like me love it.

Edit: I just looked at this post on my phone. God that chart looks horrible. Why can't code blocks look consistent on all devices?

Edit 2: I'm not saying that teachers who teach math don't try, I just think it's inherently incredibly difficult for 1 person to teach 50+ kids math every day.

Edit 3: I'm aware of dyscalculia. The use of "only" in the title was a bit of an exaggeration, however, I do feel like for the vast majority of people they simply aren't taught in a way that suits them.I hope this doesn’t come off as an “I don’t understand this new social media thing, so I hate it and I think it is going to rot my kid’s brain.”

If my kid wants to play single-player games, even if they have gores, horrors, sex scenes. I don’t mind letting them play these games because I trust my ability to guide them and to point out and explain any potentially problematic areas.

But with social media, things are totally different. While Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat still let you just engage with your friends, many others just open up to the public and anyone can engage. Things like Discord, Twitter, and pretty much everything comments section under an online video and online game voice lobbies. Knowing that behind those aren’t codes and pixels but real 
 human beings make me uncomfortable. 

Not to say that we should just ban social media, but that anything that just opens up to the public should have a 17+ tag on it.

Full disclosure, I’m about 60 pounds overweight and I’m included in my statement. I don’t like the way I look and feel. But I’m not out here like “ahh I love my curves”.

Now cue all the anecdotal, medical-anomaly rebuttals 😉

EDIT: Thanks for the discussion folks. I feel like all dissenting/agreeing opinions have been voiced from various angles, it’s Christmas Eve, my family is here, and my phone is getting blown up. Love your people 😘You see it all over the internet these days, people recording themselves giving food or money or whatever to homeless people. All it is for these people is a personal boost, a way to get views on the internet and make themselves feel important. I think these actions should be shot down not praised and receive 10 million video views. If you’re really this good person you claim to be you would give to the homeless, give to shelters, help people and not tell anyone else about it, it’s that simple.

Edit: I don’t think people should stop giving to the homeless all together, just stop recording it, in my eyes it’s just another thing that proves how shitty people are, instead of giving because they care about their fellow human they’re giving strictly for the imageWatching yourself lose all of your hair and not being able to do anything about it is an agonizing process and no one deserves to be made fun of for it. It is just as bad as any other form of body shaming and people who do it should be called out on it. If you think making fun of people who are fat, skinny, small, big etc etc is bad, but making fun of bald people is okay, then you are a hypocrite.When browsing on some shady websites that aren't centered around pornography, I'm sure we've all had porn ads with either partial or full nudity pop up out of nowhere or on the sidebar. Just because you're on a website that requires 18 plus does not mean that it should be perfectly fine to show porn without the consent of the viewer.
For example on Spotify I don't listen to any sexual content or sexual podcasts, however I get recommended a show called "hentai with senpai," and I have to deal with an extraordinarily sexualized hentai face on my home screen. I'm not even the only person who deals with that specific show showing up on their home screen unsolicited. So to reiterate, if exposing yourself to someone without their consent, even if they're 18 years old or up, is a crime, then it should also be a crime to show nude or sexual contents to people in pop up ads without their consent.This way anyone falsely accused does not get their name dragged through the sand until they have been convicted. We have made it too easy to destroy people's lives on false accusations. I believe protecting the innocent is just as important as prosecuting the guilty. The only downside would be if someone had evidence on the accused, but this could also be found as a part of the investigation process.

So maybe a better definition if the initial hearing is not dismissed and the judge wants to pursue the case further. I just don't think its fair to lose your job over something that's dismissed in 5 minutes in court, because that's all someone with a false accusation wants.

Edit: Thanks for the gold.

Edit: It seems the general consensus is that we all hate to see innocent people's lives ruined. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity a little.

Edit: The main counter argument (In my own words) - "The government can abuse this by silently incarcerating and sentencing people, and it has been written into law (US) to release a public record of these events". So my main problem with this argument is firstly I was referring to protecting innocent people from a false accusation, not from a tyrannical government. If you are being targeted by a tyrannical government, I don't think you really care about slander and being cancelled. However I did not know the reason behind this legislation (in the US) so I appreciate the info. What we should really define is at what point during the legal process does a public record get released? What forms of evidence are needed? Obviously video footage over word of mouth. The whole point of the legal system is you really can't trust people to tell the truth, doesn't matter because until you catch them in a lie you can't tell the difference. Can the media be sued for slander if they publish articles that corroborate a false accusation without doing enough research? Should they be forced to remove these articles or publically renounce any false information? These are all questions that came to mind when reading your comments. Again my main goal is protecting innocent citizens from the horrors of mob justice.

Edit: I keep seeing Sweden pop up in my notifications tab. So shout out to Sweden for protecting the innocent.

Edit: If this opinion was "popular" innocent people wouldn't have their lives ruined by this. I think we all know there is a problem and I am glad this post can foster discussion on the matter.

Edit: 
Guys I said innocent people, not celebrities. /s Honestly, this doesn't really apply the same to someone who made a fortune based on their fame, since they are probably not employed anyways.I see a lot of posts on Reddit of people whom have gone through traumatic experiences in their lives; be it war, rape, suicide, depression, that sort of stuff.

Usually, 50% of a comment thread consists of 'man up' and 'X can't happen to men!'. It's annoying as all hell, and yeeah often those comments do get downvoted, but not enough to send them straight to the bottom of the list.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Holy shit this blew up.

EDIT NO. 2: As said by u/Zap__Dannigan:

> Context is important, which it seems many people don't understand.  
>  
>If I say "Man up" to my buddy who is trying to talk to me about his emotional needs, that's pretty shitty of me and is perpetuating a harmful stereotype.  
>  
>If I saw "man up" to my buddy working up the courage to go on a roller coaster or ask out a girl he's interested in, it's just harmless chat that means "be brave right now".

Couldn't of said it better. The first is what I am meaning by 'man up' here.There must be a whole population of lonely miserable redditors who satisfy their pain by squatting in new and making people feel bad about themselves for NO REASON.

Asked a question about baking? You're a fucking idiot

Posted a piece of your artwork? You talentless karma whore

Discussing grammar? How DARE you try to stop the evolution of language you timewasting nonce!

I will never understand why some people so actively seek to make random people feel bad as a way of uplifting themselves.

Participating in reddit fucking sucks 90% of the time because the shitty people are so active, and the 10% of the time i have a normal, polite interaction with another human it seems so exceptional.

People fucking suck.Porn is being promoted as positive and a sort of ritual for men these days. Its deemed by most as a positive pastime and to critique it will be met with scorn and many will see you as against sex positivity for doing so. It is seen by many as a private hobby with no harm to most, except some complaining about misogyny towards women in porn.


However, as growing amounts of evidence show porn is having immensely negative effects on men. Many are becoming addicted to something encouraged and as safe by society. Men are having problems performing in bed with their partner, reduced libidos, fetishes they did not previously have which cause shame, seeing women as sex objects solely, having to watch more intense and degrading and even violent porn to get the same dopemine hit. 


Many men are also attaining erectile dysfunction where they cannot attain an erection without porn or even with porn. Studies into when people first locate porn shows most boys begin watching at around the age of 9-10. The beginning of their sexuality is being distorted and twisted in their formative years when they are vulnerable to an addiction they have no idea about. There are also studies showing that porn consumption causes anxiety and depression in its users. 


There are literally hundreds of thousands of men now coming forward, largely on the internet due to the stigmas of this addiction with their stories. How has this been received? Well as a joke. An ex porn addict went on tv and told a presenter telling him his addiction did not exist that his penis could no longer get hard. Academics researching this area have been mocked and ridiculed for their research.


This problem is only getting worse and if not addressed very soon will probably become one of the greatest concerns for our society on a social level. It will possibly reach an epidemic proportion as men in possibly their millions will be addicted to something very, very hard to quit and the assistance in fixing this issue will be very difficult and very expensive. 



If you are a man who has a positive relationship with porn then thats fine, but this post is to show the unpopular opinion being ignored by society. 


Check out No Fap and Porn Free if you want to see what men are having to silently endure at the moment.


Edit: realized I fucked up the title. My point was that if porn addiction is not addressed and started to be dealt with now I believe in mere decades we could have an epidemic on our hands. Also I swear to god I put this in the post but if you watch porn and are not an addict I am truly happy for you. I am also pro masturbation and sex positive. My point is for a sizeable number of people porn is addictive and this reality needs to be known and we need to help porn addicts. I hope this clarifies everything.


Also thanks so much to the people who commented talking about their struggles with addiction or their SO's struggles. Also thanks to those who gave me awards. This post hit the trending page so it shows just how many people are impacted by this. I really hope we get the help and support we need.Even with all this stuff going on. I don't believe that Racism is as bad as the early 1900s. 

With the way technology is advancing today, we're able to see people for who they really are and called them out. Say what you want but atleast people from other races are fighting together. It isn't perfect, but I can say, atleast we're trying.Video games have become all about competition and getting the flashiest new upgrades, or spending hundreds of dollars every 'cycle' only to have all your achievements washed away at the end of each one. Every forum is filled with hardcore players who do their best to ruin the game for those new to it, and the idea of coming home to relax to video games is dead in the water. 

Games used to be about the story, more than the mechanics and the competition. All the big companies are now running after the online money, while good, story driven games are pushed under the radar and independent artists are being killed by lack of support. Tons of franchises like FIFA, CoD, NFS, and Halo that used to be great are now terrible in the campaign. Meanwhile, games like Fortnite, Valorant and Apex are so hyper-competitive that they have sucked the joy out of gaming. Every time I see an old title, or a AAA studio, come out with the words Multiplayer in the description I feel a sense of dread now.I know a bunch of doctors and celebrities and pretty much everyone else is all for giving just about everyone the number to the suicide hotline and pretending they are helping. They aren’t.

I’ve called them myself, spoke to countless other individuals about there first hand experiences, and read the stories. Most of the time the suicide hotline ends up doing more harm then good. They have been known to hang up on people in crisis, prematurely call the police on their callers, and use very scripted methods that usually don’t help. I’ve brought this up to multiple mental health professionals and they know the line sucks but they still send it out. It’s over glorified so people can feel like they are making a difference or helping when in reality they are recommending something that does more harm them good. 

Feel free to downvote me into oblivion.

Edit: oh my wow. I just woke up and wow thank you so much kind strangers. I feel so touched by everyone’s bravery to share their stories.The idea that a man is so aroused that he can barely last long enough when he’s finally inside you is extremely attractive to me. I know there’s a stigma against minute men and a lot of discourse regarding how long men should last in bed, but seeing your sexual partner so completely overwhelmed that he loses all control and cums fast, and then acts a little sheepish or embarrassed afterwards? Top tier. I know I can’t be the only one that feels this way.

Edit: guys what happened 

The discourse around this is incredible. You’re all very hot and sexy. Thank you for so much love! My DMs are absolutely drenched in cum.Every developer and programmer I know says they learned far more in one summer programming an app themselves than in college.  I have a mechanical engineering degree but I make 6 figures doing nothing that was taught to me in school.  Most jobs, even office jobs of a technical nature, are specific enough that you learn what you need in a training period on-site.  It stupid how we demand everyone get a college degree unless they want to do labor or vocational work.  It just isn't necessary!  If you want to be an aerospace engineer or neurosurgeon yeah you need a degree but you sure as hell don't need one to work technical support at Salesforce or to play with spreadsheets.

Edit: wow this blew up faster than student loan debtI've been going to baseball games my entire life. I have well over 1,000 games attended. One of my life long dreams is to catch a baseball in the stands. To me that is a chosen from the baseball gods moment. Lately I've been seeing more and more when someone catches the ball a parent will send a kid over to collect their prize. Everyone boos the person who caught the ball for not giving it to the kid. The person who caught the ball has likely been waiting since they were that kid's age to catch one and now they have an entire section if not stadium bullying them to give it to some little kid that will have 0 appreciation for it because they just did what their parents told them and went and asked for it. 

Obviously if I ever catch a ball I will break it to the kid that inevitably gets sent over gently that no, I will not give them the ball AND I will take my boos. But to the parents who send their sex trophy over to collect something that they aren't entitled to, you are horrible parents/people and I don't feel bad that your kid is sad now, it's your fault.I don't know how 'unpopular' this is. I don't have a whole speech prepared.. it just occured to me. So quirky. So different. Have to be an intellectual to use it. Yikes.Unless you like drinking bitter dark liquid. And if you don't, you add milk or creamer, which just makes it slightly bitter but still not good. And for those who add sugar, it gets too sweet for there to be a real taste.

So I don't understand. I will have the occasional cup in a group setting or at my mom's, but I can honestly say I've never had a cup of coffee and said "Oh this one is actually good."

People say if you buy super expensive ones, there's a massive difference, but I don't see myself making that investment, nor knowing anyone else who would in order to try theirs. It's just not good, man.

Again, it smells amazing. But can coffee lovers just admit they drink it for the poop regulation and caffeine energy boost? This is a safe space.

**Edit: Whoa, was not expecting this level of response. The coffee lovers part was genuine humor and I didn't realize people would take it seriously. It was not my intention to offend or sound haughty, but since people are messaging me privately to tell me about myself, I just want to emphasize that I was being playful with this post. I know that many people enjoy the taste of coffee, and that is 100% cool with me. I am just not a fan, and apparently have not had great coffee. Also, not a teenager and not a guy, and thank you for the awards.**As a British guy, I shouldn't have to know everything about the US or have to introduce myself as "The British guy" every time I talk to someone online. I also don't want to be treated like some mystical being from lands afar just because I speak a little differently.

The internet (unless you are playing a game where you can pick the server location) is a worldwide thing, that isn't based in one location. It can be used by anybody. Most people on the internet aren't even from the US.

And my biggest pet peeve through all this has to be when Americans say "the world" but really just mean "the US". The world is all countries, not just all the states.

EDIT: In light of this post blowing up, please remember that you are on r/unpopularopinion. Yes, my opinion is controversial, and you may not agree with this. This does not, however, give you the right to harass me in my DMs. If you do this, I have no choice but to report and block you. Sorry not sorry. Also, if you feel it doesn't fit this sub, do not attack me. Please, think before hand. I assume a few moderators have already seen this post and they did not take any action, however, if you must persist, contact the moderators, not me. Thank you all.That's right. Salt and vinegar are the superior chip. Sour cream & onion chips just have an overly sweet yet salty taste that is just overwhelmingly disgusting. Barbecue chips leave your mouth feeling dry and bitter because of the awful taste. Salt and vinegar are just a perfect combination of flavors that is just overall better than other chips.

EDIT 2: oh lord I believe I've started a warThere are 24 hours in a day, not 12. Adding am and pm is an extra step and makes signage unnecessarily confusing when they are omitted. Even if you are used to using the 12 hr format, the math is really easy to make the conversion.If you made a typo just fucking fix it. No one cares. Why the fuck do you need to add "Edit: Spelling", "Edit: a typo". Literally contributes nothing to what you said and if anything takes away from your point and is annoying. Thank you. That is all.

Edit: typoUntil this year, I thought of China just as the closest contender for America’s heavyweight superpower belt, especially in the next couple decades. Recently, however, after reading article after article about the brazen systematic detainment, and torture of a conservative 1.5 million people from a single ethnic group I’m getting serious fascist Germany vibes. 

At least the United States hides its ethnic mass incarceration under the veneer of mandatory minimum sentencing laws (I’m kidding, this is not the same thing, obviously)

One article published just today presented evidence that the Chinese government had been collecting involuntary samples of DNA in order to map faces. Are you fucking kidding? 

Also disturbing has been China’s active use of existing technology to repress dissent in Hong Kong. 

China has repeatedly demonstrated they have no qualms about shoving racial minorities into concentration camps, and a brutal capacity to eliminate opposition. I don’t see any reason why China will not continue to get worse in these regards. It seems that if any country is soon to reach ww2 Germany levels of power and fascism it will definitely be China.Unless you’re adopting them, there’s no reason why you should have 10 kids. Especially if you’re struggling with your other kids. 

Just absolutely no fucking reason why. Four kids(biological) should be the maximum and even that’s pushing it.

Edit: honestly, two kids should be max.

Edit 2: to the the people saying that ‘if you’re rich and can afford it, then go ahead.’ Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Overpopulation and _carbon footprints_ are still a thing and this planet is still getting fucked everyday because of humans so...  there’s no reason to, as I’ve said and *just because you can doesn’t mean you should.*

Edit: I’m just going to stop these assumptions: I am not white, I am not male and I am not American.

Edit 4: I came from a big family as well. I’m not saying our existence is a crime because we’re more than I think we should be.Random opinion I just thought about from past experiences. By this I don't mean absolutely freezing/sizzling climates, I just mean from *mildly* warmer/colder weather than normal. I've seen myself be really stressed during warmer weather, with no real way to cool myself at all. On the other hand, with colder climates, it's really easy to cool yourself down; get under a warm blanket, get a hot drink and just **vibe** there I guess. It's really comforting too, probably one of the best feelings ever.

Though this doesn't really make sense if you're outdoors and not inside, it's technically inside I'm talking about. Being outside is a whole different story, though it's technically the same answer on that side in my opinion.

So in conclusion; I don't like going outside because it's too warm  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Edit: Geez thanks for the awards and stuff guys, I didn't need this much attention. :-)
Men, it can hurt when romantic desire is unrequited. You’ll feel your pride take a bashing, wonder what’s wrong with you. Understandable. But you do at least still have your dignity. Embrace it and try your best to move on. Remember it’s not personal, that attraction can’t be forced and that they’re not right for you anyway. If you think you’ll struggle remaining friends, explain and back off – politely, in a noble manner that doesn’t burn bridges – until things are clearer and you’re ready to accept it. This is how a gentleman behaves.I've found people with less social media presence tend to be less narcissistic and worlds more interesting. It seems like everyone wants to be an influencer nowadays or needs to feel validated for whatever reason. Don't even get me started on influencing. You can be a catch and not put yourself out there so much. Idk, maybe I just enjoy my privacy. I don't like having selfies of my spouse and I posted every day and to have my personal life plastered across the internet.  I doubt I'm alone with this opinion.

-Thanks for the awards everyone.I never answer my phone if its caller unknown and that could be a problem in an emergency. At the same time I can get up to 10 unknown calls a day from two separate numbers attached to a single device.  If your calling me I should have a right to know who you are and yes that should influence if I will answer or not.But, when the yogurt sits for a good deal of time and settles leaving that wonderful liquid floating atop. Drinking that liquid is much much better than the actual yogurt.This one makes me rage sometimes.  So there you are, having made some sort of mistake. 

For hypotheticals lets pretend you forgot to put your mask on before going into Walmart.  (This isn't about masks dont make it about masks, just using an example).

"Sir you need to have a mask on." (Acceptable)

"Why yes here it is, I'm so sorry I forgot.  You're right." (Puts on mask)

We are officially done here. 

"Well you see theres a pandemic going on....." (wrong.  The conversation is over)

"Yeah, you're right I'm sorry man." (Acknowledged twice now, problem corrected!  We are done now.)

"When you dont have a mask on you can infect other people...." (why the fuck are you still talking)

Edit:  First, oh my poor inbox.  

Second, thanks all for making this thread awesome.   

Third, I notice a trend in the naysayers - you can only make your point by assuming things incorrectly, adding your own imaginary details and then baking them into some scenario that has little resemblance to anything I've described.    YOU, my friends, are what is wrong with the world today.Like, you can't say that you support male victims and then only bring them up when people talk about women being raped. It's not talked about enough but the fact that most of the times it's just a counterpoint is disgusting.Our $250 range microwave broke. Repair guy came out and cracked it open and said it was a bad door switch. He wanted $389 to fix it. NFW. Besides, he already pointed out the bad switch, so I figure, how hard can it be. 

I take out the switch, and jot down the four digit alpha numeric code on it. I go to a locally owned appliance parts distributor. The lady at the counter was very nice, but said that number means nothing to her or her computer. She says she needs more information. I tell her the make and we kind of come up something similar that will (probably) work. But... it’s not in stock and they are moving their warehouse, so two weeks minimum. I ask for suggestions, and she gives the name of three other places in town. 

I call those places. The first two are total assholes to me. Very condescending, and telling me I need the model number. Again, the four digit code means nothing to them. I give what’s in the confirmation email from Sears. Not enough. Kenmore doesn’t manufacture their own goods. She needs to know the manufacturer. I’m not at home. I’m sitting in my truck on the phone.   Second call goes just like the first. Treated me like a child. 

At this point I go home, get the info on the manufacturer, and call the third place. Very nice. They don’t have it, but can get it that afternoon. For the low low price of $40. 

I can’t get there in the afternoon, and $40 seems outrageous for a door switch. 

I take a last ditch effort on Amazon. I put in only the four digit code that nobody could work with at four different distributors. 

158 sellers. Most expensive one was $9. It will be here tomorrow. 

KW3A. Look it up yourself. 

Unbelievable.No. I’m not gonna say “hE’s CrEepY tOwArDs MiNorS” or anything like that. I just think he’s genuinely off-putting. 
He’s this tall, extremely thin older man without eyebrows who prances around and wears the personality of a shallow, “yas kween” teenage girl. Everything about him sends me into defense mode and I don’t get why he’s so worshipped. Yes, his makeup skills are phenomenal but Jesus Christ his actual personality is so cringy and creepy to me. 
Sorry for the ramble, just wanted to express it. 😷Seriously wtf is up with that. Just write "I'm 24f and my dad (48m) something something". This is so confusing. Every single time I have to go back and reread the sentence.

Edit: 
1 - Whoa, thanks for all the awards and fake internet points <3

2 - To all the people saying this isn't unpopular: I think I've been called an idiot by enough people to warrant this as unpopular. 

3 - To all those calling me an idiot and saying I can't read: I hope you drop your phone in the toilet. Doesn't hurt to not be a cunt.This goes for a lot of electronic devices.  I'm sick of realizing the 64gb phone I bought ACTUALLY only has maybe 40 gigs of space.  

Imagine signing a lease to rent an apartment that has 3 rooms; you toured it and everything.  All sources told you there would be three rooms.  Then when you open the door on the first day of your lease you see that actually you only get to use two of those rooms because the landlord needs to use the third.

It's just not okay.I’m talking the ones that have been bred to an early grave with deformed features and problems that make them suffer their whole life, with breathing  problems, walking problems, brains that are too big for their craniums etc. Like Pugs, King Charles spaniels, Bulldogs, Great Danes and others. 

Some might be saved by cross breeding and a complete change to the breed standard, but we shouldn’t go on like we are now. 

Dogs shouldn’t be born just to suffer and die for our entertainment.

Edit: Holy shit! I guess I’ll have to apologise for posting here, seems this wasn’t an unpopular opinion after all. Thanks for the awards.Staying up late feeling like you got all the time in the world the night before a day off is 10x better than the actual day off where you need to be asleep by a certain time to get up for work the next dayI am senior and the number of adults that have told me that these will be the years I’ll miss for the rest of my life is disheartening. I feel I have a lot to look forward to in life and I think the message we should be sending to kids is not “it’s all downhill from here.”I hate, hate, hate coffee culture.  I can't stand people saying, "Oh, I can't do anything until I get a warm cup of coffee in me."  Shut up.  Being a former smoker, I recognize the addiction and subsequent irritability of coffee drinkers and it bugs me to no end that caffeine gets glossed over as an addictive substance, or even fucking celebrated to some extent.  Those people who brag about needing 5 expresso shots (sorry, esssspresso) a day need an intervention, not a nod of approval.  Seriously, all you coffee drinkers are the biggest group of fucking enablers I've ever seen.

When doing group activities, like camping, I loathe waiting for others to start their day after a morning ritual that hogs counter space, or propane, or dirties good clean water.  I hate the sleepy look in peoples' eyes as they grasp their cup of stimulant that they wouldn't need had they never started drinking it in the first place.

There's an entire fucking cupboard in my kitchen dedicated to stupid coffee mugs and their dumb sayings staring back at me despite living in a household where only one person drinks coffee.  Why?  And the dishes.  Since nearly every person drinks coffee, inevitably us non-coffee drinkers are going to have to clean up after your morning fix.  Seriously, I've done so many goddamned cleanings of coffee mugs if I had a dime for every one, I'd probably have enough for a Starbucks franchise.

And don't even get me started on Starbucks.  Godamned devil business slanging legal crack for decades, hogging good real estate so addicts have a place to slurp up and get their morning shit in before work.

Lastly, I despise the amalgam of ways people cook up their black powder and then talk up the flavor as though it tastes like something other than a dirty sock.  That's your addiction speaking.  You want to know why you need to dump half an udder of cream in your cup?  It's because cream is fucking delicious and when combined with your filthy water, makes it somewhat bearable.

And your stupid machines that creak and groan through the quietude of my morning can go fuck themselves.  Talk about a waste of counter-space.  And the spent black stimulant granules that spill over onto the counter, staining the grout drives me nuts.

And lastly, the goddamned keurig cups or whatever they're called are one of humanity's worst inventions, sandwiched between Glyphosate and Joe Rogan.  At least the meth addicts don't deposit a plastic remnant that will persist in landfills for hundreds of years spreading micro-plastics into our environment every time they need to get high.Firstly i want to mention that i have worked with both physically and mentally handicapped people and among them were the most lovable, loving and truly inspiring people I've met in my life. Albeit i don't think it's fair for parents to be required to sacrifice their chance of a normal life for their child. To those who do, whether by choice or not, give birth to handicapped children, you have my deepest respect and I don't doubt that parents will do anything in their power to provide the best life for their children and love them the way they are, but i don't think it's wrong to assume that such a life is more emotionally taxing than raising healthy children. As previously mentioned these people often exhibit a love for life most of us couldn't compare to. Still i don't think you should be required to give up your own life and sanity for someone else because of societies morals. 
Honestly i wouldn't be strong enough to handle such a situation.Now i know that this is a REALLY unpopular opinion because Elon Musk is a poster boy for zoomers because he posts and likes memes on twitter. Right at the start of the world pandemic he was posting on twitter how the panic is stupid and that people are panicking without a reason, even though people were  falling and dying like flies into thousands of numbers, he belittled the virus and said how it was not that bad, and even compared it to a common flu, now he posts tweets to free the country and that people have lost their freedom, other than that he is praizing Texas on twitter for openning up stores and businesses, this is a great example of a billionaire that doesn't care about people and only cares about his money, i don't know how i feel about him at the moment, i am sad because he was one of the billionaires that were doing good for earth.. but this is just a big disappointment, i wonder where will he take this. What are your thoughts on this?I don‘t care how big that bag would be, just hang it onto the horsesaddle somewhere. I absolutely hate slaloming around those piles of shit while riding a bike somewhere.I think a good example of this is the show Riverdale. If you don’t know, it’s a show using the characters of Archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show. In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). 

In the show, or as much as I’ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people. 

And I’m realizing now that Riverdale isn’t the *best* example (a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship) but there are a lot of shows like this out. I think Hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don’t have to. My issue with it isn’t so much the displays of sex, more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are **supposed** to be minors. Gives a weird voyeurism vibe. If the plot allows, just make the setting college, it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes.

TLDR: I have no issue with sex being a plot point in teen-oriented television but the mentality of “We have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let’s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can 😎” is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic

EDIT: Restructured as paragraphs for clarity

EDIT 2: I understand not all viewers relate to college, this was merely a possible suggestion to a pretty pervasive issue in televisionBasically what the title said.

IF YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON REDDIT REWARDS YOU DIDN'T DESERVE THAT MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

The kid got a shit ton of idiotic redditors to give him gold and its always funny to see people waste their money on useless crp.

&#x200B;

I guess you can say faking brain cancer was messed up, but i guess we all have different tolerances for stuff like that. People who like or hate dark humor for example.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;It’s impossible to watch something nowadays that’s aimed towards teens without these portrayals. This is creating massive delusions for young teenagers in terms of what they think they will look like or should look like and it’s terrible. It should be banned. They are designed to be idolised or even sexualised and displayed as desired so what do think it does to a person who doesn’t look like that.

Edit: Why tf are people saying “well we can’t have real children fucking each other so we have to have pretend children fucking instead” like that’s okay. What the hell? That’s so messed up. Why would you think that children having sex is ok if they’re not children just labelled as children. Seek help.When I was young I was interested in science and tech and stuff and all my classmated used to just laugh at each others farts so I got bored of them.

I used to dream of becoming an adult and being able to talk to people about philosophy and politics and science and I thought adults were a more elite class who were higher in social standing and ranking than us kids. 

When I reached my late 20s I realized that most adults are just fatter uglier kids. Like, theyre morons. They still dont know anything, many have never even read a book. Theyre dumb af to be honest, fumbling around doing everything wrong. The average adult in the street is dumber than even the most idiotic kid in school, at least the kid has potential. 

Something seems to take place around 40 where they just become a drone, who goes through the motions with zero self determination. If you use a word bigger than 2 syllables they glaze over and lose train of thought.

What the hell is up with people.

EDIT: wow, I came back a few hours later and hadnt anticipated how much of a response this would get. Im happy others can relate 🤣You may not want to admit it. But it's the truth. With having no knowledge of the outside world except through what was allowed in through propaganda, you'd most likely be swayed to join. They were humans just like us. And if you grew up during that time there, you would most likely be one of them. When the option is join or be labeled as an enemy with the threats of death, most people will join. Edit: Look at all these brave martyrs who know they'd be the select few to defy history. That's true arrogance.I've always thought the idea of "equals" for a novel would be incredibly interesting. To read the exact same story, but from a different perspective. I imagine this would be great for the Harry Potter books, as there was so much depth shown in certain characters that it's a shame we only got to read it from Harry's perspective. This idea of "equals" would also allow readers to see depth and traits in a character they may not have seen before just by reading the main character's perspective.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm blown away by the amount of upvotes and awards on this! Thank you guys so much.Swimming is like walking, but for water. It's part of the few basic means of movement we, humans, have at our disposal, along with running, crawling and climbing. Not knowing how to swim puts you at a HUGE disadvantage, as you pretty much can't avoid water. Any mildly interesting / fun activity might turn into a potentially lethal one, should you not know how to swim. Going fishing? Better not fall into the water... It's like permadeath for video games: instead of ending up wet, and maybe slightly (or very) cold, you just friggin' die if you fall into deep water. I know, swimmers can drown too, but if you can't swim, you're guaranteed to have to be rescued.

On another note, it's so weird to see healthy people being incapable of performing the most basic human activities: I've seen grown men injure themselves trying to climb over a 3 feet fence (not drunk), women twisting their ankles and tearing tendons when running towards a bus stop, etc. Now, I'm not saying that everybody needs to be a world-class climber like Adam Ondra or swimmer, like Michael Phelps. But learning how to... I don't know, not die when navigating anything but flat terrain seems like it should be part of being a grown human.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up... Most of the negative responses are about not having access to swimming facilities (either due to lack of money / lack of said facilities or both). I'm obviously not suggesting someone shouldn't eat for 3 months to pay for swimming lessons or move to an area just to learn. 

But "I'm scared of water / I've had a bad experience" are not valid excuses, all the more, they're reasons to push your boundaries and defeat said fear. It's like saying "I've had my heart broken in high school, I will NEVER date again". Sure, you can avoid both water and dating, but is it worth it? If you end up falling in water / love unexpectedly, you'll just panic more because of the unfamiliarity of the situation.If true gender equality comes to fruition, then what it will mean is that people will stop giving a fuck about one another's gender. Everyone would have equal opportunity, treatment, respect and appreciation, while being judged based on character, ability, personality and other proper grounds based on the situation. There would be no need for gender-based celebrations, since all related hurdles would have already been crossed. 

What will be celebrated though, is mankind coming one step closer to overall human equality.You can't legally require kids to be in school for 6-8 hours a day and not expect to feed them. On top of that, since schools receive federal funds for the food, making kids pay for their meals means that the schools are essentially being paid twice for the same meal since the government pays for them, plus the students pay for them.

Edit: I should probably point out that I know many school districts have been getting free food. The point of this post is that a lot of people argue that they *shouldn't* be given free food. Just because they are doing it doesn't mean these people are happy about it or agree with it.It just makes me so angry to see someone say shit like this because the person was trying to be considerate and you ruined it. It bother’s me so much every time I hear it. I would consider myself agnostic but I don’t go around flaunting it. I think this goes well with any religion, really.I think backstories influences the judges' decision unfairly.  Who would you rather choose, a kid who got cancer or an actually talented person but has had a good life. It's called America's Got Talent for a reason.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not some sympathy-less person.  I certainly feel bad for them and do hope they have a better life in the future.  I just feel like talent shows should be judged on actual talent.You were the adult when they were a child. If their first instinct, as soon as they get out from under your thumb, is to completely ignore you forever, you need to own the fact that you messed up as a parent at several, consistent, points along the road throughout your child's upbringing. They hate you for a good reason, and they're probably better off without you in their lives.

There are a number of forms of abuse that range from over-parenting, to neglect, over-discipline to straight up negative enabling behavior.

I have friends who don't talk to their parents because the strictness was so suffocating, and friends who don't talk to their parents because they were lazy bums who never took an interest in their child's life. There are tons of other reasons kids abandon relationships with their folks, but the one thing that stays true through all of these experiences for me is that it's always the parents fault.

This is mostly about relationships that end as soon as the kid leaves the house, not necessarily relationships that break down during adulthood, although the same reasoning could be applied in a lot of these cases too.

EDIT:  
To the people in the comments defending parents and blaming the kids: If you're a kid defending your parents then congratulations on having parents who treated you fairly and cared for you I'm sincerely happy for you (everyone didn't get the same life you did), if you're a parent defending yourself then just own up to the fact that you messed up and move on with your life, try to be happy and leave your kids alone because they've cut you out for very good reasons and they're better off without you.Why on earth would ANY adult want to have their ass wiped by their children? I can think of nothing more humiliating or dehumanizing. 

I never understood why nursing homes (pre pandemic) were always such an awful thing. 

My bfs grandma would get up an wander around the neighborhood and forget where she was. She would trash the house. She would need to be bathed and fed by others because she couldn’t function. His aunt had to quit her job to look after her, all while having kids of her own. What mother would want that for their children?? What *person* would want their own health and safety in the hands of someone who is trying to juggle their own lives and children and work instead of a person who takes care of others as their chosen career? 

There is a HUGE difference between changing a 6 month old’s diaper and an 80 year old’s. And imo there is a HUGE difference between having a medical professional see you naked and clean you than your grown kids seeing you naked and cleaning you. 

I would not want my children to remember me as an invalid who needed shit wiped away from their vagina because of diapers. 

As soon as a person is unable to function alone, they should be put in professional care and NOT be shamed for that decision.And no, I’m not vegan or vegetarian. Meat on pizza is fine, great even. A pizza loaded down with so many different meats that chunks of sausage fall off when I’m trying to eat it is not even appetizing. There are so many contrasting meat-flavors and I really don’t understand why it is so popular. I truly think some of its popularity stems from some weird place of machismo and anti-veganism. Many of the same people who order meat lovers pizza turn their nose up at even the mention of vegetable toppings. And you know what? There are some bomb ass pizzas with veggies on them.It doesn't make sense to me why we have so many cemeteries, some of which are huge. We could be using that land for homes, businesses, agriculture, etc. Even if a person wants to be buried, there's no need to pour cement into the ground or to bury the body in a casket that won't decompose after a few years.I've been on this platform since 2008 after lurking for a few years due to seeing little need to make an account and comment. After posting something on this thread and seeing it hit the Front Page (FP), I had a bunch of oddballs sliding into my DMs trying to sleuth personal information from my post history.

This account has been used over the years to help build my professional network and make new connections in topics of interest. It is sad to see some basement dweller use that information to try to harass or manipulate emotions.

I can only imagine what women go through on a daily basis. We need Reddit to allow us to make our accounts completely private and lock down all comments/history without making a burner account to drive up their numbers and make them feel like their platform is growing.

Front Page Edit:

For those of you creeping into my profile you’re just proving my point.

Reddit has filed for S1. The company is going to go public sometime in 2022. If you think my little voice isn’t impactful, no problem. Do you know who they care about? Shareholders and investors.

Those people are going to make Reddit change and it isn’t going to be popular. Complain all you want now because change is coming.

Edit 2:

Feel free to keep using profanity and nword counts on me.

Heads up. The answer is zero. I haven’t dropped a bomb or the n word at all on any social media account. Keep swinging for the fences trolls. Maybe you’ll find something?

Also, some child is making accounts just to spam and annoy me. Thank you for the free real estate in your mind. Maybe you need a life?

Lastly, this troll is trying to talk smack about my 3 month old child.

Like really? Are you that sad of a person you’re trying to make fun of a baby? Grow up and focus your hate elsewhere.There are 0 scenarios where I should receive an email from a god damned manager that reads 'take a look at these, there both for you'. I have to go behind my 2 colleagues and 'clean up' the work they fill into communal spreadsheets because I'd be embarrassed if other people thought I contributed such dreck. Just today my workmate had put the simple input 'Mr & Mrs Smith' into a spreadsheet as, and I quote, 'mrq ans mrs smih' and then just moved on with his life with nary a care in the world, like what the FUCK, people?

PSA: everyone who comments 'humorously' bad grammar replies to a thread complaining about bad grammar pulls their shirts all the way up to their chins when they peeThere are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. This naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

If you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. It's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

Contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, I think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. There just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and I can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. Young men don't owe society anything. We should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

Edit:

Thank you all very much for the positive feedback and the support here! I'm really glad to see that we, both men and women, can actually have a productive and civil discussion, and that men are there to stand up for each other. Also, thanks for all the awards, never had that before!!I am not American, but my country's tv channels play a lot of American shows and all these kids always complain about how utterly disgusting they find broccoli and how they would rather die than eat it. 

Well if you're gonna salt and boil it, what else do you expect? Add some spices, red chilli powder, olive oil, turmeric or some sauces, and it tastes absolutely godly. Even without too much spice, it still tastes so good and I love gorging on them.

Edit - this post was sponsored by me buying a huge amount of broccoli and adding it to freaking everything I can and loving itThis is perhaps the weirdest thing I feel comfort in and I thought this was the right place to post it.
Feels nice against my skin and don’t know why
Also don’t mind sand in my shoes

Edit: I’m sorry AnakinThe dude is a prick and an asshole flat out, yeah maybe being bipolar is why he is an asshole but it doesn’t make him any less of an asshole. Everyone has problems some people are assholes because of how they were raised, some people are assholes because they hate their job. They are all reasons but not excuses. Kanye rushes the stage at the VMA’s and took over a speech I don’t care if he’s bipolar he is a fucking asshole. He has also acknowledged he is bipolar accepts his diagnosis but still goes off his meds! Fuck that dude he is an assholeIt may be just the nostalgia talking, but I very much liked the "quality" of the content you could find on the internet back in the day, when the majority was created by people who had real jobs (or schools) and could only create content in their spare time. And I'm not talking only about YouTube videos, but also about general blogs and more "specialized" sites.

I'm not 100% sure what it is, but to me it's either that the content was not so much money-driven and people could fully express themselves without caring for the "brand" or "monetization" or what not, or that they were much more connected to the everyday issues of everyday people.

I'm also not saying there are no good content creators right now, or that all of them are disconnected from the reality, but it's kind of sad that it's not the norm anymore.

**Edit:** Well, this blew up. Thank you all so much for all the upvotes and for my first awards!To me it makes no sense that you can't legally sleep in your car in certain places. Like sure if you're on someone else's property you should find a better spot. But there are whole cities where it is flat out illegal to sleep in your car on public property overnight. You own your car, it should be your decision if you can sleep in it.I'm not even sure this would be an unpopular opinion on Reddit however I feel in general videogame composers don't get enough credit from everyone. Composing music for a video game can be significantly harder than for a movie because during a movie the composer knows what will happen and can compose the music so that it sounds perfect for the situation this is not the case in a video game. As someone who has played over 170 hours of ori and the blind forest, hollow knight and Cuphead it disappoints me to see that although they get lots of recognition by gamers the music industry really just snubs themMost people I've talked to say they avoid giving money to homeless folks because they think they will use it for beer, cigarettes, and/or drugs. They would rather give them food or some other tangible item to help them out. While I understand the thinking behind it I'm also not naive enough to think that my $5 is going to magically get this person off the streets and back on their feet. These people are already down on their luck and have enough to worry about. If my $5 helps get them a pack of cigarettes or a beer and that's what they need to get through another day with the shitty hand they've been dealt then i'm OK with that.

Edit: Since some people seem to think I'm explicitly giving homeless people money for vices I felt the need to clarify. I'm also 100% OK with homeless people using my money for food. The point is once I give it to them I'm OK with them spending it on whatever they want or feel they need. Not all homeless folks are addicts people.Got a call from the school saying my son punched a girl in his class. I was mad and ready to ground him when he got home when it occurred to me that I should ask why he hit her. The principal told me that the little girl pushed him and took his lunch money and continued to take her folder and smack him with it when he got fed up and punched her in the shoulder. Now, if they knew that the little girl had done all this and was continuing to do it, they should have intervened. They didn't so my son defended himself. Not in trouble.

When I told the principal that it seemed justified, she told me that I shouldn't make it seem okay to hit little girls. I let her know that my children know that it's not okay to hit anybody. But that it's also not okay to stand there and just be hit either. It's totally okay to defend yourself against anybody and everybody that is attacking you.My ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. 

Anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent. 


Edit 2 - Well this blew up. I'd like to say that I really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. Thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. To those that disagree or say "man up," that's why I put this in unpopular opinions. Not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

As has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. Sometimes its hard. Just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. I can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props. 
Burgers that require you to unhinge your jaw to take a bite is not an enjoyable eating experience. For people that worry about making a mess and getting food all over their face and hands, there’s nothing worse.

Edit: thanks for the silver, kind redditor!Seriously, pan searing or regular baking will always be better. I swear to shit Jared if I hear you compare fried chicken to air fried chicken one more time I’m gonna smack the gob out of you.

Edit: I’m in danger, I never realized how deep the air fryer fandom goes. I will die on this hill

Edit2: I’ll never stop upvoting and loving you all but… but I’m just gonna go cry about something totally different..

Edit3: i think id be a lot less upset if it was called an “extra air oven” as its a convection oven with extra fans.

Edit4: if I had a dollar for every comment “you clearly don’t own an air fryer” I’d be able to put it towards a new toaster oven.

Edit5: the chances of getting doxxed over kitchen appliances isn’t high.. but never zero.

Edit6: apparently air fryers are taking my job? Sorry boys and girls, no more foi gras for the rich.

Edit7: I just woke up.. what have I created? Talos be with me.

Edit8: If you’re telling me air-fried chicken is better than real fried chicken that only means you haven’t had good fried chicken… still love you all though!.. heh.. I’m not crying you’re crying.. 

Edit9: I thought I’d die on this hill, but like the beacons of Gondor my fellow convection brethren have made a stand. A civil war has begun and I was the powder-keg; blood shall be shed on the battlefields.

Edit10: the amount of chefs coming out of the woodwork to tell me how incorrect I am is absolutely staggering. BigAirFryer is sending their agents after me, I don’t have long - hear my warning - they’ll come for you next. 

Edit11: there’s a knock at my door… I feel warm air and hear wooshing… this is it guys. If my body is found warm and crispy just know I wasn’t fucking fried I was baked.

Edit12: A better battle story than Le Miserables. 
Ps. If you have to threaten someone in their DMs over an airfryer then you’re not giving your food enough love.. or yourself.

Edit13: currently on shift and the tides of war hath slipped into the real world. My Sous is on your side… You beautiful heathens.

Edit14: you sinners are keeping my line from getting anything done today. Still love you all… the gods have abandoned me.

Edit15: BigAirFryer is coming after my edits now. They can take my fries but they’ll never take my freedom. 

Edit16: 
“Chef we need Tartare on 13” 
“Sorry Brandon, one redditor wants to murder my dog and the others have determined how upset/triggered i am; 13 will have to wait.”Social media was introduced as a way to communicate with friends or classmates and other strangers. Now, it seems that social media is one of the worst things ever. Twitter has become a prime place for lots of beef and drama and other nonsensical conversations. Tiktok really is just for people to simp over hot girls doing dances. Instagram is where everyone likes to post their whole life story, and these people always have problems with stalkers and other complications with the lack of privacy. I could go on but I'm really over it. Social media will never be the same and this really sickens me because there's a lot of good on twitter and instagram, but these platforms get completely drowned out by all the bad.

Edit: Well this blew up. I'd like to clarify that I don't think the concept of social media is bad, but I do have a huge problem with how we use social media. Reddit is no exception to the toxicity of the modern media.I get it, you are vulnerable if you have a mental disorder, however that does not give you the green card to expect people to be automatically sensitive towards you or your needs. Sure, when others try to help you because they know of your disorder, they are doing this out of their own kindness not because they owe you anything.The only exception is if you cannot donate an organ for medical reasons, I've heard people say that they would accept a donated organ (but they wouldn't be happy to donate one) which is the height of selfishness in my opinion, letting people die so that a dead religious person can keep their organs (which will be cremated or buried) is insane.Reddit is just as big of offender of this as the news and other platforms. Multiple "no politics" subreddits block any discussion of it even if it is otherwise relevant to the sub.

We need to stop with this "who do you believe" takes. Science is there to be understood, not believed. The whole point of it is to be discussed and to be okay with any hypothesis to be wrong.being wrong in Science is still a valid reportable result. On the other hand in Politics people get entrenched and refuse to even contemplate that they are wrong.

By assigning politics label to the issue we automatically create "sides".Facts:

•	Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	Cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	There is not one single state in the United States where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	Student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in America, and many "entry level" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	Cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900.

According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

A gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation. The actual national average price, as of July 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to "put ourselves through school" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, "you're lazy and entitled" and we need to "just work harder", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, "OK boomer".


edit: i didn’t actually expect this to blow up but I muted it bc RIP inbox.

Edit two: Y’all smell bad and are boring, stop messaging me to tell me how much you hate me. I get it, you hate me and I touched a bad place in your heart, breathe and go smoke a joint ya nerds.Disney obsessed people tend to say they enjoy the magic and fairytales, but that just feels like denial of how terrible real life is. So instead of working together and fixing life, they spend hundreds, even thousands going to parks, buying merchandise, and watching movies over and over. All the while that money goes to a mega corporation that contributes to the worsening of real life. 

Also, Disney is pretty much geared towards kids and being crazy about it is sorta creepy. It just seems like these people have experienced a failure to launch. People should grow up and stop expecting life to be a fairytale.

Edit: if you don’t live in Florida, I don’t think you understand how obsessed these people are.

Edit 2: Florida is a large place, I have this  unpopular opinion because i live walking distance from Disney.

Edit 3: yeah edits are unnecessary, but you can really tell who knows the people I’m talking about, and people who can’t distinguish passion from obsession.

Last edit: I don’t live in my moms basement because Florida doesn’t have basements.Showering at night ensures you won't get into bed with your day's sweat and dirt and so your sheets will be cleaner plus you yourself would feel more relaxed going to sleep. Plus it saves you time in the morning and I usually feel wake enough with just a nice cold facewash . My mom however doesn't like this and since morning baths are such a norm I decided to post here.

Edit: Okay sorry guys didn't know it had been posted before.Mentally twisted, ill, fucked up people will always exist, and both women and men need to have the appropriate psychological and physiological response to prepare for such a threat, particularly when we are alone and vulnerable in the dark. Striving for a world where women (or more generally, **everyone**) can roam freely at night is unrealistic.

I regularly hear that women should not have to feel unsafe walking alone at night, as a result of the patriarchy and men preying on vulnerable women. Apparently it's a common assumption that men do not feel this pressure whatsoever, which is entirely bullshit. Everyone **should** feel this way when walking alone at night. Anything can happen to anyone.

I'm a white male and have been assaulted walking home from work last year, when a group of drunk men asked me to have a drink with them, I declined and they yelled slurs at me and threw empty glass bottles at me. One of my male school friends, who is a bodybuilder, was stabbed walking late at night.

We *all* feel that way because we need to be psychologically and physiologically prepared to flee a threat. Sketchy, fucked up people will always exist, unfortunately. They prey on vulnerable targets, and night time is the peak for these twisted fucks as it is isolated and dark, and when most are drunk.

If we hypothetically reach a state where people can feel entirely safe walking alone at night, they are more vulnerable and unsuspecting to possible attacks. We need to be alert. It's our natural response to trying to stay the fuck alive.

Edit: I probably used 'unsafe' and 'alert' interchangeably when they have different meanings. This is poor phrasing on my behalf, what I mean is that we should be alert. We shouldn't feel unsafe at all times, but rather we should recognise that the environment can be unsafe. The majority of homeless people are men. The majority of suicide deaths are men. Young men graduate college less than young women. Young women are out-earning young men. Single women are more likely to own a home than single men. There are gross discrepancies in the amount of government aid available to men and that available to women.

Yet I've never seen women marching to end male homelessness. I've never heard a radio ad about raising money for prostate cancer. I've never seen a commercial asking men if maybe it's time to give college a second chance. Literally, nobody cares if you live or die. Nobody cares if you're educated or fulfilled. Nobody cares about you.

And you will be openly mocked, belittled, and humiliated if you don't fit into the predefined social mold that exists for men. Homeless? Fuck off. Small dick? Haha. Suicidal? Ew.

Why bother trying to be part of society that at best ignores you, and at worst is openly antagonistic towards you? I've seen so many articles like this: "Why are young men dropping out? It must be because educated women scare them." They always come to the same, obtuse, and illogical conclusions. "Men are just stupid/lazy/useless/onerous in some way, I guess. Women are better anyways."

Young men are dropping out because they are treated by society like actual, literal disposable objects. That's the real reason.

Edit: To everyone asking me in the comments why women should be responsible for helping men, this is the reason: Feminism by its literal definition is about fostering gender equality. If men are disproportionately negatively affected by things like homelessness, violence, a lack of education, and presumptions of criminality, then these are inherently feminist issues. If you are a feminist that doesn't care about male problems, then *you are not a feminist.*As Bill Burr once said 'ladies your issues may not get resolved but at least people give a fuck'. 

And its true. Women have support systems for their depression, they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and don't want to see a woman suffering, people want to help and show they are not alone.


But for men we are alone, partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness, but the biggest reason is no one cares. People don't just not care they distance themselves from you. Men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion. Men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse, not better. 


There is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this, I think that's a small component of the reason, but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun us. Therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves, not because we are afraid of not looking like "real men" but because we know we are alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so, so much.
They have no reason to have access to internet.

They will find information that will destroy their innocence 

They will start being influenced by dickheads on the internet e.g. Jake Paul. Which will lead to a bunch of other problemsFree reporting is a must, but media also often consciously transgress boundaries to generate viewers.

Whether publishing the faces of children who are victims of violence or the like, or spreading false information.

The media often get away with a reprimand, which does not stop them from continuing to transgress the boundaries in order to increase the number of readers.



Edit 1: After being called a left winger: Both sides should be punished if necessary, left or right, it does not matter.

Edit 2: I was "recognized" by a Reddit user by the "smell" that I am 100% a right-winger because I wrote in the first edit: "Both sides should be punished if necessary, left or right, it does not matter."  

This ladys and gentleman would be an example of diffamation without context, aka false information.Something that annoys me so much is when you see people wishing the moms who had to be the mom and the dad for their child/children a Happy Father's Day. Father's Day is a time to appreciate the dads that were there for their kids, so why should we take away from that by making this day about moms too? Mother's Day is the day that's meant for that. If the roles were reversed and we were doing this for single dads on Mother's Day, people would freak out.

Edit: To clarify, I have no problem with someone's kid wishing them both a Happy Father's Day and a Happy Mother's Day, since it's their kid. My problem is adults trying to MAKE other people wish single parents both.

Second Edit: For all the people who still dont understand, if someone's child wants to wish their single mom a Happy Father's Day, go for it. What annoys me is the people who try to make Father's Day about single moms and take away attention from good dads who were there for their childrenLike if you like to be called "Daddy" in bed it's a bit Freudian, weird maybe, but I don't mind, you know? If you wanna be tied up, be tied up. Have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, I don't mind at all. 

But if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness. 

Calling someone out for basically being into pedophilia or bestiality and hiding it as a fetish or kink that should be understood and respected isn't 'kinkshaming', it's just being a concerned citizen and perfectly fine.Adults shouldn't complain about kids not wanting to play outside, because the outside we build for them often lacks children-friendly infrastructure.

Think about it. Half of America's residential areas lack sidewalks. Most of our towns and cities don't have safe biking areas. We have huge intersections that children need to cross in order to get to the local mall. Our parks are miles and miles away from our homes and not to mention-- even when we do have parks close to our homes, some of them don't even have *good* equipment for children. 

And most importantly, we've perpetuated a damn culture  where adults freak out if any child of any age is left alone for any amounts of time outside. We *HAVE* to always have an adult supervising them now-- which frankly, kills the fun for some of them, but also limits them to the amount of free time their parents have. (Now obviously, don't go leaving toddlers outside, but why do you need to follow 12-year-old Timmy around the neighborhood?)

Adults really should not complain when kids don't want to play outside. We make it so difficult for them to do it safely and in peace.Did so myself years ago and life is MUCH improved.  Used to find myself getting constantly pissed off as I scroll through my feed.  And even though I never posted anything, I would need to pull out my phone every few minutes and get angry at some post or shitty opinion.

Although years have passed, I am occasionally reminded that there are many others out there that are just like how I was.  I see the involuntary scrolling and grimaces that follow.

LPT - Improve your life and delete Fakebook.A few months ago, while walking my dog outside, an off leash dog approached. What was only probably 5 seconds felt like a lifetime. This off leash husky ran over, with his owner about 30 FT away,  attacked my greyhound in the jugular, stomach, butt, and all four legs. After the attack, my husband walked our dog to the nearest vet, as blood pumped with every beat from my dogs chest. For 3 tenths of a mile the sidewalk was covered in blood and all the while the other dog owner kept saying "shes so friendly, she never does this." He continued to say that to the vet and the police. My dog was in emergency surgery and was bit 3 veins off the jugular. He was so close to not making it and I was stuck with a $6000 bill that I had to pay if I wanted him to live. No the other dog owner didn't pay, and I have to go through the trouble of suing him. 
There are leash laws for a reason. I don't care if your dog is "friendly" and "well behaved". Put it on a leash. If something happens, you're entirely at fault. 
I now carry a taser after what happened. Keep your dog safe, and keep them on a leash. People like me are out there, with tasers, ready to protect their dog. Be responsible. Its literally the easiest thing you can do.
    
EDIT: Wow, thank you for the awards. Thank you everyone who sent me warm messages. I didn't expect this to take off like it did and I'm so happy with the response. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

My dog right before his stitches came out, almost fully recovered: https://i.imgur.com/TleXHz6.jpgThere is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to Disney every single year, almost without fail, since the award was invented in 2001. 2017 is probably the best example for this. The two greatest animated films that year were Loving Vincent and the Breadwinner. Loving Vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium, having each frame be a full oil painting. It also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent. Breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a Middle Eastern girl searching for her father. Either of these films should have won best animated picture, but they didn't. They lost to Coco. Don't get me wrong, Coco was good, almost great even. But it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as Loving Vincent or the Breadwinner. Coco won simply because it was Disney Pixar. The only reason Disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known, whereas these other films are indie films. But the best picture shouldn't go to a film because of the company that produces it, but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself. Indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by Disney for best animated picture. In fact, only once did a 2d film win, and only once did a foreighn film win, and that one time for both of those was when Spirited Away won in 2002. Never again has a 2d or foreign film won, and never has an indie film won. 

Disneyland is a fucking scam. It's a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman. They brainwash people with their slogans like "happiest place on earth" and they cover up anything bad from their audience. Not to mention the corporate greed, and the continuous raising of prices for tickets. Disney also own half of Anaheim city, and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by Disney. Some goes for the nearby gas stations, diners, etc. Disney pretty much runs the city of Anaheim in secrecy, and the Anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it. Disneyland isn't even as great as everyone says it is. The only reasons people go so much is because people are sad, and where better to go than what is advertised as the "happiest place on earth"? People take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to Disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood. People I know seem to go to Disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are. They're using Disneyland as a way to express their higher class, not as a way to actually enjoy themselves. Walt Disney imagined a Utopia, but it seems to me that he got a Dystopia instead. He wanted to use his money for good, for human progress in technology, but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money. Imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money. That is what Walt wanted. He wanted money for the people, not for the corporation.

Working at Disney is terrible. If you work in animation, any drawing you produce at the time, whether on duty or not, are the property of Disney. This prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time. (This also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that Disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles). If you work at Disneyland, they treat you like shit and they don't pay well either. But hey, you get free tickets, so it's all good (sarcasm). Disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money. 

Disney is continuously fighting their competition until they win, and they almost alwats win. And by competition, I don't mean enemies, but allies too. This can be seen in the Sony argument where Disney continually demands more and more, until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they can't make it opposing such a powerful entity. This is what happened with Spiderman, as Disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and Sony said no, so Disney broke off their deal until Sony finally gave in because they'd make even less money if they cut ties with Disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for Spiderman. This bullshit has been pulled off so many times by Disney.

Disney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that. Disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities. Movies like Frozen, Brave, the Incredibles, etc are only popular because of the company that is making them, not because of the quality of the films itself. People expect a Disney film to be good, and oftentimes people's opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting. People need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do, before there aren't any left to support.Every year there’s always those kids who say “school needs to teach us important things like taxes” but when you take a step back and look at who the students that say this are, you realize that lots of them (not most or all) are the disrespectful and most juvenile students who are likely not doing very well in school. They don’t give a damn about doing taxes they just want to complain about the school system. I don’t want to discredit or disrespect anyone who does want to learn taxes, this doesn’t apply to you guys.

Also, yes I do believe the American education system needs to be reformed, and we should be taught about taxes

Also also, no just because you want to learn about taxes in school does not make you a “lazy juvenile”.

Also also also, I am a high school student so I am not using a “boomer bias” when I say this

Also also also also, no I’m not saying you guys are juveniles and lazy if you disagree with me, sorry if you saw it that way, I’m talking about a loud minorityShe *raped* them. Say it with me now...

She. ***RAPED***. Them.

Doesn't matter if the victim was a boy or a girl. It doesn't matter if it was a student, a child she babysat, her own children, or anyone else. If they're not adults, and she is an adult, **it is rape**.

**Children. Can't. Consent.** **The Triple-C law.**The title pretty much says it all.

This might be worded weirdly because it’s late and I don’t speak English but let me explain.

I don’t think that being a tolerant society is wrong, but we need to set some boundaries.

I shouldn’t be expected to respect someone’s religion/lifestyle when they go around claiming they can cast spells, control the weather, make potions and hang out with spirits from other dimensions. Edit to add that yes, this goes for Christianity, Islam and any other religion.

I also shouldn’t be expected to respect people who don’t “identify as human species” ... excuse me? I don’t even have an argument for this but if you think that you can identify as a whole different species you need therapy.

I understand that reading about your horoscope can be fun, stars are pretty and if you wanna read about it or just enjoy the zodiac sign aesthetic that’s more than fine, BUT if you start justifying your shitty behavior because you’re x sign, you’re just trashy.

Sex positivity is fine and healthy but there’s no need to be openly doing your kinky stuff in public, if you want to walk your partner on a leash, that’s cool, but the other people at the dog park are not consenting to be a part of it, it’s not kinkshaming, but there’s places for that kind of stuff.

These are examples of my point, my opinion goes for any other crazy belief that people try to pass as normal and acceptable.

I love that we’re becoming more accepting and people feel comfortable enough to be themselves but there should be some limits, calling people “bigots” because they don’t respect your wild beliefs is a bit extreme.

Edit: I meant to say that English is not my first language, evidently I do speak at least some English

Edit2: I wrote this post because an acquaintance saw a picture of my house on fb and said I shouldn’t place mirrors in front of each other because they are portals to the other world, I laughed it off, she was serious and then called me a bigot for laughing at her beliefs.No, your responsibility as a parent doesn't end when they hit a magical number of years. You chose to be a parent, that's a lifetime commitment, not an eighteen-year contract.

I live in a predominantly Asian country, and children living with their parents as an adult is a given. Everyone does it, nobody thinks lesser of young adults living with their parents. Certainly nobody charges their kid fucking rent to live in the same place they have their whole life.

Of course, I don't mean you let your kid leech off you till they're 40, never working or doing anything worthwhile with their life rotting away in your basement. But, provided that they are actively making something of themselves, be it education, pursuing their passions or something that will eventually lead them to achieve full independence and move out anyway, adding an unnecessary expense to their budget just makes the time they take to get to that point *even longer*.


Edit: Maybe I should make it clear. This applies to situations where the parent doesn't need the money desperately.


Also, everyone seems very uncomfortable with the notion of an unpopular opinion on /r/unpopularopinion. I wonder why.In the United States at least, you can own a firearm, drive a vehicle, and enlist in the military at age 18. You are considered an "adult" when you fuck up in the name of the law. But at the same time, heaven forbid you drink a beer with your friends, have a cigarette, or rent a car because you're not... an adult. Fuck out of here. Make it one age and call it a day.I’m not allowed to make tuna in front of people anymore because it grosses everyone out that I LOVE the taste of the tuna water. It’s better than the actual sandwich. If I could buy it as a drink, I’d buy a 24 pack every time I go to the store.

People say the tuna juice is for the animals and believe me I love my dog more than some people but I don’t love him that much! I get the juice he gets what’s left in the can after I make a sandwich. Some people without animals even pour the juice out in the sink… what a waste! The juice is by far the best part.

Now drown me in upvotes because I’ve never ever met anyone who doesn’t gag at this opinion.

Edit: My first gold! Wow. Thank you kind redditor!For some reason it's a popular opinion on the internet that Ikea furniture instructions are incredibly complicated and undecipherable when they're actually extremely simple.

Ikea furniture has one if the clearest and most straight forward instructions for putting together furniture. Every piece is clearly identifiable, every step is shown with clear visuals and labeled in the order that you should do them in. They somehow managed to make the visual instructions so good, that they don't need to use any text at all.

I don't know how you could be confused by anything, literally just put the pieces together like an the picture and you're done.Chihuahuas are too small and they seem really aggressive all the time, not to mention their annoying barking & growling.

Cities would be cleaner and it would help the homeless get back on their feet. I don’t know why people haven’t started doing this.Sometimes the mommy vlog world just makes me sick, between the Stauffer family "re-homing" the difficult special needs child they adopted from a third world country because it was "too much", and the vapid nature of the Ace family and their sketchy philanthropic endeavours, it feels like children are turning into commodities instead of being nurtured and cared for as vulnerable minors.

They don't get a voice, they don't get to agree or disagree in allowing the internet access to their growth and development. The copious amounts of blog articles, IG posts and Youtube videos of their childrens lives from the first weeks of pregnancy onward has come to a point where people are getting pregnant on purpose in order get views, they are adopting kids from other countries in order to get praise, they are buying puppies they don't train because it's clickbait. I can bypass the other platforms to do with makeup and fashion and travel and fitness without much trouble because it's not a genre that relies on minors or animals to drive revenue.

At the very least, once these kids are old enough, they should be able to get a percentage of that money back from their parents as earnings during their time as a Youtube content pawn.I know it comes with some negative connotations but construction work is a respectable job they build the houses we live in and the schools we learn and teach in.Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. The girls save the day. I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile "Mommy Pig" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.

From an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? Like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.hear me out. simply put, if we were in the delivery room and it was between my life and my baby's, i would want my partner to choose my life.


i would do this because that baby is nothing and is no one. babies are a blank canvas that take in information 24/7 to become who they are. we literally create, physically and mentally, humans.


so with this mentality, i'd say we can always have another. obviously obviously we both would be devastated. we're looking forward to having kids so so much, especially him. to lose the child my partner and i created would be life changing. but i think he and i can both say that we would rather have our children grow up with both parents. he would raise a baby well, i know it, but i cant imagine the depression he would fall into if i were to die. and having a child may not be enough for him to power through. i'll be damned if i set our fucking kid up for failure like we faced as children.


hope it makes sense. i dont want to kill babies or even make such a difficult decision but this is reality. and this is only during delivery, not in any other circumstance. i would rather talk and decide now rather than not have talked about it and he has to make that decision on his own. he would implode.


we can always have more babies while remembering any we've lost, which hopefully will be zero. i just dont think i could leave this earth with so so much unfinished business and leave behind a child i'd never meet and a husband that needs me as much as i need him. i dont want to do it. so this is my choice.


i believe im putting my baby first in this situation. i dont think it should even be a question if i would give my life in order to save my child's. it's a yes no doubt. but that is the child i know that isnt a blank canvas. theyre an actual person who's (self) aware, at least more than a baby. but i would also prefer to be alive for my children to grow up how they deserve, with loving parents who only want the best for them. i want to give them the best life i can offer, we both do. but we both need to be there to do it, at the very least, in the beginning.As a pharmacist, I am so sick and tired of pretending to be a doctor. Its so annoying how everyone in my profession has this doctor imposter syndrome. It even influences the way we dress.

Why on earth do we wear labcoats? Who’s idea was this? What are we protecting our underclothes from exactly?

Its time we start to distinguish ourselves from other medical professions. Scrubs are for nurses. Labcoats are for doctors (and actual lab people).

It should be a requirement for pharmacists to wear capes to distinguish ourselves from others. There is no practical reason for wearing capes, I’ll admit, but neither is there a practical reason to wear a labcoat.

Additionally, I’m tired of being summoned to help a customer (probably with something incredibly stupid, obvious, or boring) without making a grander entrance. If I had a cape, I could briskly walk towards the costomer and come to a quick stop and allow the cape to flow up and consume me a little before I begin to speak.

I would want to do the cliche vampire reveal thing using one arm to hold half the cape in front of me and then toss it asside, but that would be very unprofessional.

Additional comments:
1) Yes, I am technically a doctor because I have a doctorate. You know what I meant though.
2) A lot of people doubting I am a pharmacist. I am indeed a pharmacist, but I was not put on this earth to argue with internet strangers so, idrc
3) Looks like there is a lot of support for capes here. Might try to make some shirts that push our edgy cape agenda. Might actually look into making custom capes. Thanks guys!


Finally made shirts that support our edgy agenda: https://teespring.com/stores/viral-designs-8When I finished my tea, I'll leave about an inch or two of my tea water in the cup. First I will suck the water content from the tea bag dry, then dip it back into the cup and repeat. If the bag rips open for some reason, I won't *eat* the leaves of course, but I might chew on it for a little bit. The leftover teabag offers a strong, earthy flavor that stays on my tongue for a while. Earl Grey teabags are especially tasty.Pretty much just what the title says. I understand that it's a celebration of love between two people, but sometimes it's just too much. A bridal party, where the maid of honor and the bridesmaids feel obligated to pay for their dresses, make up and everything the bride wants, expensive unnecessary stuff, a rehearsal dinner, a venue for a lot of people you don't ever see, sometimes a destination wedding where you have to spend money you don't have for a hotel, a plane among other things. The culture is so weird too, relationships and friendships can be deteriorated if you don't agree on everything about the wedding. I see everything just plain ridiculous.I don’t know if this even actually happens in real life, I just can’t see why an engaged man would want a stripper ever, let alone the night before their wedding. If you like someone that much that you’re going to marry them I don’t think a stripper would be very enjoyable.

Edit3 - fact I’ve actually got people going out their way to message me abuse privately is hilariousThere's this constant thing at the minute where we talk about how "everyone gets offended all the time" and the reality is it just isn't true.

Social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. We act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. I mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? Because I only hear about people getting upset with things like "Baby it's Cold Outside" https://youtu.be/YavL_IVSGV4 at 3 mins she goes off about men being ugly, "if you give an ugly man a chance he thinks he rules the world", "because they got a hot girl they can be horrible" implying men who are "ugly" are horrible (based on what?), then goes on to stereotype men who are ugly and have "small dicks" get huge mansions (how in the hell would she know the size of someone's penis based on their choices in housing, their faces, or their choice in women?) "to make up for it (their penises- therefore now dick shaming men)" 


In a minute or so she demeans men in general, stereotypes men with choices in cars and homes, and completely devalues the worthiness of "ugly men". 

She's not against body shaming. She's against people making fun of her.

Edit: Was informed she also made a comment that people who wear vans have "small dick energy". 
https://youtu.be/sS5OVFNzixc 

Men have thoughts and feelings which are sometimes negative, sometimes positive, and sometimes defensive. Usually because people are making judgements, like equating their penis size to their shoe choices. (penis shaming based on opinions) (edited to reword this part)


Edit: For any and all of you trying to penis shame *me*, I am a 32 year old female, without a penis. But thanks for telling us you're unoriginal.

And to be honest I judge too, I would never date a girl posting nudes of herself on the Internet.
Also calling it Female Empowerment is very disrespectful to all the people in the world who fight for real issues like the lack of girl's education rights. Just because you are getting called a whore for your OnlyFans doesn't mean you're the next Malala Yousafzai.Boiled or microwaved veggies absolutely suck and are the laziest way to cook them. If you Sautéed those bad boys in butter, roasted or grilled them with some actual seasoning, then your kids would have a grand old time eating them and you wouldn't have to threaten them with no play time while they sit there and throw up in their mouth. Stop torturing your kids and learn to cook.I’m not a morning person and I hate getting up early but I love morning people who try to make the day good. Just that smile early as hell actually made my day a tiny bit better, like a ray of sunshine. Now I’m not saying be a headache at 5 AM, but I like the contrast to my morning grump when I first go into work. Thanks stranger.

EDIT: A clarification, I think it’s worth noting that I like people who have a cheerful spirit, not obnoxious. I agree, it’s not binary. There is a middle ground for sure. Also, being loud and rude is not the same as being a cheerful individual. Like the hot cheeto girls in high school is not fun at 5 AM, but a nice smile and a cheerful attitude are good things. Also, lots of comments mention how they don’t want someone in their face and they don’t owe anything to anyone in the morning and all that. I’m just saying it’s nice to see a smiling face early in the morning and maybe have someone say hello cheerfully instead of everybody drudging around. Even if I don’t reciprocate totally, it’s still pleasant, you know? Mainly because they are like that even if I’m in a shit mood, they just radiate some good vibes and it makes me feel better. 

Thank you all for your awesome comments and people who downvoted to balance out this post.

Their sole “job” is to make people think they actually use the crappy products they are paid to advertise.  The whole thing is a case study in herd mentality and the gullibility of the modern consumer.I've heard many, many people say that janitors and cleaning staff are losers. While to them they are "losers" to me they are the most hardworking, caring, and kind people I have ever met. They don't deserve the shit given to them. I know plenty of people who say they are low lives, so in my opinion, this opinion is unpopular. People are assholes

Edit:I've literally been two seconds away from crying reading some of the replies down hereIt's such a common phrase anymore to hear "I don't owe you anything" to phrases like "You could at least be polite?"

Well if you don't owe me anything, I don't owe you anything, nobody owes anybody anything, and we should all just be selfish and look out for ourselves, is that what you want? I should just be able to walk up and treat you like crap because I don't owe you anything by your own logic.

This is one of the most basic agreements of a civilization, you don't treat everyone around you like crap.

**EDIT:** because this is a really common reply I want to address it here. The reason I use "Owe" in this context is a bit twofold. Firstly, because in every circumstance I hear this discussed, people will use the phrase "I don't *owe* you anything" as some sort of excuse to be rude and treat people like garbage. Secondly, you "Owe" politeness as a social contract as an exchange you pay into society as a whole, as we all pay into society via the social contracts and are thus owed a debt by it. Or, if that explanation doesn't help, it's more of a turn of phrase, even if it may not be *literally* correct, the English language rarely cares what's literally correctI just heard a news report about a woman who tried to PET AN ALLIGATOR and was killed. Game officials went on to kill it after the incident. Why? The alligator was doing it’s job. Same thing with Harambe. If you can’t watch your kid at a freakin zoo, or you’re 58 years old and think it’s ok to pet a wild animal, you had what’s coming to you.Trying to imagine my own grandfather running the country with the same ideals and standards and slightly outdated views that he picked up from his years in college and graduate school in the 1960's would be an absolute disaster. He's an intelligent and progressive man, and was very valuable in his field for years, but soon became very disconnected from the direction the world was moving... eventually you just run out of steam, or become impatient with things and find it harder to learn new skills and adapt to new ways of thinking.

Seeing Scandinavian countries with leaders who are younger and more in tune with the changes in society, and the different challenges current youth and young adults are facing economically is incredibly valuable. They seem to have an energy and drive to progress forward and it is so much more refreshing than watching these heavily aged candidates try and rally the country together in an effort to tie up their legacy before they die.

I’m glad this provoked some controversy and conversation.I am tired of all these pussies thinking they are tough because they ride a motorcycle and die an early death and blame it on car drivers instead of their poor life decisions.

Kids need to go see friends at the park, play video games and just have fun. Also, keeping your child sheltered from everything slightly different from them is training them to be judgemental. As a 16 year-old it honestly makes me sad to see classmates not being allowed to see their friends or have a phone and being totally oblivious to the world. It baffles me how some parents think this is a good idea.

EDIT: Holy crap this blew up! I saw alot of comments explaining how they like to shelter their little kids. I should have mentioned this originally I meant more sheltering teenagers. Of course your 3 year-old will be sheltered he's 3, but its one thing to protect a toddler and another to limit a teenager's freedom.I’m so sick and tired of the idea of smoking being cool or classy, it’s not. I also don’t understand why the hell society doesn’t have a bigger problem with this.

If you ask me, it’s not enough that it’s prohibited in certain public spaces (a rule that is often not respected by smokers anyway). Since smoking has no medical use (or at least not any that have scientific backing), combined with its high potential for abuse and addiction, it needs to be treated with the severity it deserves.

And don’t give me that bullshit of “smoking doesn’t hurt anybody but the smoker, so piss off”, because second hand smoke definitely exists and can even cause lung cancer in non smokers.

I don’t give a fuck if “ohhh society’s normalized it so it’s too late”, because we’ve changed a lot of normalized things since the last century.

Edit: Changed “tired and sick” to “sick and tired”. In hindsight, no idea why I didn’t write it like that in the first place.

To nobody’s surprise, I have offended plenty of people, mostly smokers, with this post. I have been called a  child,Karen, and Nazi for sharing this opinion. I have been occasionally reading the responses - and I’m not going to apologize to the smokers I’ve offended; I’m just feeling sorry about all the smoke in your lungs. This is unpopular opinion, you’re inevitably not gonna agree with some opinions, but that doesn’t give you the right to be an ass about it.Especially with recent events, I have been flat out accused of being racist for not showing my undying support towards BLM. 

I was no where NEAR in the know enough to be able to make the decision to support BLM at the time, and after doing my research I have decided that I agree and support most of what they are doing.

People really need to be able to admit when they don’t know about an issue. Too many people are pressured into “picking a side” when they really have no idea what’s going on. 

So I challenge you this, instead of supporting what the Internet, or your friends or your co-workers tell you to, do your research, and decide based on YOUR moral judgement system which side you support, or if you support bits of both sides, or neither.In a recently discovered online video, Cardi B claims “I had to go strip, I had to go, ‘Oh yeah, you want to fuck me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go back to this hotel,’ and I drugged niggas up, and I robbed them. That’s what I used to do. " 

That is the work of a predator. Maybe it isn't as bad as Bill Cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. Cardi B should not be a celebrated public figure.

As a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. If you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less. 

How many of those men overdosed from the drugs and never made it out of the hotel room? We will never know. 

*Update* It looks like an alleged victim has come forward. He claims she stole $850, an iPod touch, a belt, and she also raped him.

*Edit* thank you for platinum/gold/Silver! 

*Edit* THESE ARE NOT SONG LYRICS! She said this in a video speaking to her fans. https://twitter.com/HipHopRatchet/status/1109894804790366208?s=19There. I said it. It's been bugging me for 11 years. People keep going on and on about those first ten minutes like they are the pinnacle of animation. But in my mind, I think Pixar basically botched what *could've been* one of the actual greatest animated moments. I feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the *middle* of the film. Almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought.   


Throughout the first half of the film, Carl doesn't really open up to Russell; and we don't really know why he's so keen to get to Paradise Falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house (except we do know since we watched the opening). Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes. I'm convinced that in an earlier draft of the script, the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene. And I believe that if it had played out like that, the moment would've been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film. Because then everything would click, suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did. The buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger.  


But the way the film is now; we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about; and throughout the entire film we know everything about Carl's life and motivations, making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand. It would've served better as a reveal later on.  


Rant over.Why is it important to know what race or sex the person is? 

The only thing important on the application is work history and any felony convictions. 

You shouldn’t be hired based on race/sex just to fill a quota 

You shouldn’t be turned down based on race/sex 

Employers just need your name and work history before they decide to reach out and schedule an interview with you.Hear me out.

I've been thinking about this opinion for a while now ever since I've hit my teenage years. This is because my mom always tells me "If it weren't for god I would've **\[*****insert messed up action*****\]*****\****". So when I got older, I realized just how messed up that actually is.

The reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion. What if that religion never existed? What would you do if you all of a sudden didn't like religion anymore? What would you do then? Would you go, and kill people? Would rob banks? Would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously?

Those who think this way usually don't even know or care for the reason *why* they shouldn't do horrible things. They only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them, based upon their religious belief.

*Now to clarify, this isn't to say that I hate people who believe in religion, or think all people who use religion in their life think this way (although, I do personally despise religion, as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life). This is to say that I think if you use religion as your entire reason for not doing awful shit, then you aren't a good person in my eyes.*

**\*Note: Some of the things my mother has said were REALLY bad. She even said that she would've killed me and my siblings by now if it weren't for god. Yeah.......Really. Smh.**

**Edit: WAY too many people keep saying that I think all people who are religious, think this way. Not true. I'm talking about a sizable amount of religious people who refrain from evil deeds simply because they fear harsh consequences based on their own religion.** ***I repeat not all people think this way, but a sizable amount of people do.***

**Edit 2: Displaying my opinion the internet isn't edgy.**

**Edit 3: Don't disregard what I say simply because of my age. If you think this way, you're being closed minded.**

**Final Edit: This is a nuanced topic, so there is a lot of room to debate here. I'm okay with that. However, please try to be respectful to others in this thread, and don't attack, and insult people for their own beliefs on the matter. Everyone should try to learn something from thread about humanity, morality, and religion as a whole. Thanks for teaching me a few things here guys, I appreciate it. That being said, may the debate continue!**Honestly I hate this sub, but I needed to get this out.  I hate the "doggo woofer pupper" shit *so fucking much it's insane*.

Every god damn Askreddit thread that says "What's something that the opposite gender does that's a turn off", people are all like "hnnn I hate baby talk it's sooooo gross brrrrr" and then turn around and spew shit like "awww lookit the FLOOFER DOGGO BOYO doin a HECKIN TAIL WAG i wanna BOOP THE SNOOT haha HENLO FREN".  Holy shit it makes me want to stab something.

It's just the same old "LUL i'm SO R4ND0M!!!" and "I can haz cheezeburger??" that people laugh at now *even though it's exactly as fucking cringey as this doggo shit*.  I fucking guarantee you in 2 years people will look back and go "what the fuck were we thinking, speaking like toddlers that had their head bashed in with a hammer?"

Fuck, I swear to god whenever I see this stupid hivemind unoriginal bullshit I turn into a fucking black hole.  SPEAK LIKE AN ACTUAL HUMAN ADULT.  GOD DAMNIT I'M SO MAD I'M FUCKING MELTING.  ^FUCK ^HELP ^ME ^I'M ^SHRINKING, ^^FUCK, ^^NO, ^^HELP, ^^I'M ^^SHRINKING, ^^^I'M ^^^^SHRINKING ^^^^FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKI am 60 years old I will be 61 soon. as I age I know my memory my thought process has slowed down. It's a fact. I wonder why both major parties want to give us these decrepit 70 + senile old ass people running our government. We deserve younger more adaptable who understand the world we live in now. Who get the information age and can make laws that are in the public's interest. I don't know what that age should be but + 70 is far to oldI was always the "weird kid" in school. There wasn't anything wrong with me, the popular kids just decided to shit on me all throughout school. As a result, I made it all the way through my shitty, 200 student high school without being in a single relationship. 

I always see in my reddit feed, people, (mostly women on subs such as r/twoxchromosomes) talking about how men are nothing but lustful monsters who will only use women and it makes me sad.

I couldn't care less about sex right now as my self esteem is so low I dont think I would be good enough for anyone. I want someone who will fall asleep on my shoulder or listen when I have a problem. I just want someone to love me the way I want to love someone. Idk, maybe this is stupid. Might delete later. I'm just depressed and needed to get it out into words.I was watching 90 day fiancé the other day, and it got me thinking about how everyone usually feels sorry for the dudes getting scammed for money or a visa. But the thing is, most of these guys are using the women just as much as the women are using them. They either want their youth, beauty, big fake tits, or they have a weird fetish for the ethnicity of the woman. Same goes for women who do the same (like Danielle and Mohammed) though they aren’t shown as often.  She could’ve easily found some wonky eyed dude who would love her in the states but she went for MoeMoe and was surprised when she got scammed. Point is, gold diggers and the people who date them deserve each other 99% of the time becuase they’re both shitty people taking advantage of one another.

Edit; thanks everyone! If another person says It’s none of my business please keep in mind these people are on a reality show and choose to broadcast their relationship to the world, so it’s public business now.

Edit: after reading some comments I’ve changed my mind, I now believe if the “hot” person in this situation is in poverty, they are very much not shitty people and doing what they need to do to survive, and the “rich” one in this situation would be even dumber for not recognizing thisJust because someone's popular and is good at acting doesn't mean they have any knowledge or skill in politics, logic, law, etc.

Feels like just because people like them, their opinions get given so much more weight. If anything they shouldn't have any weight at all considering how many are uneducated and live in upper-class bubbles separate from the real world.

Frankly whenever I see a news article about this actor/actress making a statement on an issue, I just roll my eyes.There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.


Imagine, you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot, whether it’s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family. And one day you’re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them, just snapping photos of you like you’re some kind of landmark. What will they do with those photos? Who knows? Not like it’s any of your business, right?


Let’s put it in a different perspective. What if you aren’t a celebrity, you’re just some average joe on your way home. Would it be ok for someone to yell “hey! Smile! Ooh turn your head this way for me!” Whilst they start following and photographing you? Of course not, that’s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy. So why is it ok to do it to a celebrity? And how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it?


I genuinely hate the “oh well it’s just one of the side effects to being famous” answer. No job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work.


Even at movie premieres, the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at, they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres.

Also half the time it’s done without the person even knowing that they’re being photographed, such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw Demi Lovato have at Starbucks the other day. Nobody should have permission to make someone’s personal life public to everyone when they’re just doing the same thing as everyone else. If I started following the guy who owns my local KFC and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on Facebook then I’d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment. But it’s fine if said person happens to be famous?

Hell, Princess Diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her! Someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing.

Paparazzis are the literal scum of the earth, the bottom of the food chain. Only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private. They’re like secret spies, except, instead of finding out about the enemy’s secret weapons projects, they’re filming someone’s daily life as if they’re one of the animals on a BBC documentary.

Another thing that I hate is when they make it sound like the celebrity is totally in on it and is intentionally attracting paparazzis. For example: when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like “[insert name here] shows off growing baby bump during walk in [insert location]!” As if they’re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant. A pregnant woman isn’t “showing off” her belly just because you can see it, she’s just walking around and *surprise surprise!* it’s not really easy to hide your belly when it’s growing a mini person inside it.


The whole thing about paparazzis and reporters just make my blood boil, whether it’s their annoying personality or their complete lack of respect for someone’s privacy.I just turned 25, and the one of the biggest things I noticed was how much of a difference there was in the maturity levels of my 18 year old employees and my 26 year old friends.  


18 is still a kid. Even up to 22 you are still pretty much the same as when you're in high school. The ones who appear more mature are just faking it til they make it, and by the time they "make it" everyone else has caught up developmentally.   


**The amount of times I've managed to resolve issues in work/study for younger adults just because I'm old enough to not be intimidated by dick-swinging boomers is fucking ridiculous.**

Things like:  
Being paid on time and for all hours worked and not missing lunch breaks  
Not getting in huge trouble for tiny mistakes (E.g. Being late for work by 5 minutes ONCE)  
Not having and identification document in time for university  
Not knowing rates for mechanics or other services  
Having ideas or input stolen  
Misunderstanding taxation and financial documents and contracts  
Being a waiter and the food taking too long so you have to deal with the piece of shit karen  
And much fucking more I'm sure a lot of you have dealt with.

The amount of times I've seen people 40+ absolutely ruin young adults careers and studies is beyond ridiculous. These people are insanely young. It's not ok for you to try and kick them out of uni because they didn't have one or two documents in order in their first semester out of high school (Attempted on 8 people I know, 7 of which got out of it because they contacted me). It's not ok to attempt to fail a girl out of uni because she missed a compulsory class for health reasons, but doesn't understand the how to navigate the bureaucracy  of university administration and contact methods.

**Your goal should be to help and guide young adults in any way possible.**  


I saw a twitter post recently where a manager talked about letting her 15 year old employees take food from the fridges at her shop; like YES. GOOD. They're kids. They're still growing they're hungry. It's fine.  


*Rant Over*Doing what you love no matter how pointless People say it might be is not a waste of time. If you enjoy doing something then you should be able to do it without having people complain that its bad or pointless, its not pointless if you enjoy doing it.I'm not saying your partner or my partner can't have a celebrity crush, but having a crush that you gggguuuuusssshhhh over is lowkey kinda rude and hurtful to your partner. I get what a celebrity crush is, but im watching my girl get so wet to nick jonas to a point that I just straight feel like...idk like im less than what she wants.... I just don't think its fair to be so blatantly obsessed with a celebrity in front of your partner.

Edit: Yo, I went to bed like right after I posted this. I was a little drunk and in my feelings, ill admit; but idk all the likes and comments I just woke up so appreciative of that. So thank you all more than you guys know.

Edit 2: Some of yall being getting so mad bout how i feel, and I love it hahahaTrue it can be used as an ice breaker in a conversation involving someone who has no clue about you but sometimes if you say a job which makes a low income some people tend to look down on you and its quite often people who actually know you (friends and family) that do itThere are a lot of racist sentiments floating around as a result of the coronavirus spread, but this is not one of them. This is simply trying to encourage a healthier lifestyle for the sake of the Chinese people and (apparently) the rest of the world. This isn’t the first outbreak caused by exposure to rare and tainted meat that shouldn’t be eaten to begin with. 

Holding Chinese citizens accountable for poor food standards is not calling out a specific RACE. Chinese citizens come from all walks of life. There are white Chinese citizens, black Chinese citizens, asian, etc. All of them need to stop eating bats and wild, tainted animals. 

Same argument goes for banning flights, etc. The argument doesn’t target a race. It targets all races, genders, etc from a geographic location.If you spend a lot your time increasing your knowledge in the minute details of a topic or engaging with other people on the basis of that topic (debates, discussions, etc.), you fit society’s definition of what a “nerd” is. I never understood how that label has never been passed on intense sports fans when they do practically the same things. The only difference I can see is that some (only some) sports fans actually engage with the sport physically but a lot of them don’t. Engaging in sports is a far more virtual experience than a lot of people would care to admit.

EDIT: Posted this because I had argument about it with a coworker, idrc if it’s popular or not honestly. Nothing wrong with being any type of nerd, I just don’t understand why one is viewed as “nerdy” or “geeky” and one is not.The song is so fucking overused. It should be deleted from the internet and banned. Its existence should be erased from history, and everyone who puts this song on videos should be gathered and sent to an island somewhere far away from normal society because they are fucking idiots. Thank you.It's funny to make fun of neckbeards I get it, I'm not even implying I never do myself with that post, but I think beyond that there is a discussion to be had about why these people end up where they do.

It's much more about social anxiety, depression and self esteem issues than it is about personal responsibility or life choices in my opinion.

I have, in the past, teared up because an ~~r/neckbearddens~~ r/neckbeardnests post I saw on the front page looked 5 times better than my room. I was in a dark place for a few months at the height of the 2020 pandemic lockdown, drowning in garbage and surviving on chips and strawberry mirinda and a shower a week. 

Since I got past that, I really have a harder time making fun of the "neckbeard" stereotype and think we should probably better reach out instead.Long colorful plastic fingernails just are not attractive.
They are counter-productive and ugly. I don't see any
point to them, they just make your life harder. Haven't met a guy who actually likes them. Women with long fake nails look worse than without them.In the United States, only 6 states give you the right to claim a prize anonymously. The fact that it’s even acceptable to force someone to out their identity baffles me. To have someone publicly announce that they won a ridiculous amount of money automatically puts a target on their back, especially in today’s political climate. If a lottery winner were to be robbed or killed, the government should be liable for all damages caused, since THEY were the ones to expose that information.I’m a female, outside of a work setting, I address everyone as dude. I can’t read minds, I can’t magically know your preferred pronoun. You know I don’t feel comfortable asking either. That can get offensive real quick. 

When my group of friends comes up to me they say “hey dude” and that’s 100% fine! 

Maybe it’s just the straight white middle aged women at this pointed offended by it but like come on...

Edit: If your the person who becomes openly offended you should re-evaluate your time. Go advocate  for a cause that helps a more life threatening issue.Back in the days when humans used to travel in mass...... I had been on so much public transportation. Even in other countries. And there was always a child(ren) that would kick/hit someone's seat in front of them. Sometimes mine. I never used to say anything when I was younger because "Eh, their children". But now that I am a "Get off my lawn" older man, I look back every time. If it continues I say "Can you please have your child stop hitting my seat?". If that doesn't work I tell the workers on the transport (assuming there is any that can do anything).

I am tired of people making excuses about them being kids or "Don't talk to my kid like that" or other crap. If you can't control your child then it reflects poorly on you. To note, if your child is disabled, obviously I'm more willing to deal with it because of what they have.

Should note this also applies to your kid at a theater, restaurant...etc. I HATE screaming kids that have tantrums. Even worse when they parents don't even care how their kid acts. Like your brat standing on his seat and playing with my hair as I eat. Ugh. Only special note for these situations is if your in a theater seeing some G rated little kids movies, then you can't really expect peace. Not that you want chaos either mind you.It’s far easier to adjust your mirrors if you don’t have go through two menus to get to the a touchscreen that allows you to adjust your mirrors. 

I find having a home button on my phone much simpler and easier that one without that and I find it easier to navigate my phone. 

I don’t some fancy motion capture that doesn’t work half the time to detect my hand movements in order to do something. 

 I don’t care if it’s minimalistic, futuristic or if it looks cool. I want a physical buttons that clicks. It’s cheaper, more reliable (sometimes), more satisfying and a lot of the time, more convenient.

Edit: to all the people calling me a boomer, I’m 17At a young age children can learn information much easier as there brain is developing so they are more likely to remember stuff learnt in that time period. I think from a very young age children or their parents should chose between a few simple languages (Spanish,French or German) to learn through their schooling. When I was younger I would learn multiple languages in a not very good system so I would never actually know a good chunk of a language. I would just know little bits of multiple languages which isn’t good.The "thank you kind stranger" shit, the comment threads that build on some reference or pun where everyone adds some kind of variation, the replies that are just a subreddit name like r/rareinsults and r/whoosh, all of it is fucking annoying. It's like watching poorly socialized people attempt to make some kind of "cool kids club".

I'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. Reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely "oof", "yikes", and "le" ("Doggo" and "pupper" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). Expanding on what I said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. It's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.I think pregnancy is wonderful. I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

Edit 2: No, it's not a sexual thing. Also, to clarify, I am happy as a straight male and I do not want to transition to become a woman.Chess is a game of memorization, pattern recognition, and prediction. Having separate tournaments and titles for women makes it seem like men and women have different baselines when it comes to chess. I understand that there are many more male players than female players, but being a minority of the player base should not give you special privileges and distinctions.


Edit to clear up some confusion:
There are no men’s only tournaments or titles. There are tournaments and titles for everyone and there are tournaments and titles that are for women only.I used to remember when Netflix had really good shows and they weren't limited to Netflix Originals. They also had disney movies and other great movies but now it all feels like the same thing: 15 episodes of the same thing. For example, 13 reasons why (don't roast I know it's garbage) was pretty okay with one season. But the other seasons were totally unnecessary. Stranger things was great but then it kept feeling like the same rehashed plot but with a different monster. And as much as I really love the effects in Sweet Home, it feels like every episode is super dragged out. It's not netflix's fault but it seems to be missing something that made it really cool back in the day and I can't figure out why.

EDIT: wow. I had no idea my small rant would attract this much love and attention. Thank you guys for the awards and the upvotes and thoughtful comments❤️. I actually was feeling pretty shitty today (the flu, let's hope) and I was low-key disappointed in netflix. But this made my day and honestly if you guys have recommendations, I'm making a list and planning to watch those shows. So definitely comment some recs too! Thank you reddit community of UnpopularOpinions ❤️❤️❤️❤️If you’ve been on the Internet for longer than 10 minutes you’ve probably already seen a dozen people complaining about the empty ‘air’ in bags of chips. You may have even seen someone complaining about the size of a Pringles tube. But for all of the complaining I’ve seen, not *once* has anyone shown gratitude to Pringles for filling the whole container with chips. Those guys made a sturdy cardboard tube with a damn *metal base* so they can protect the chips and fill the whole package, and don’t even get me started on the resealable lid they include for freshness. I don’t even like Pringles all that much to be honest, but damn do they deserve some respect.They’re over-saturating the market to the extent that they’re really going to go the way of the Western at some point. Talk about franchise fatigue. Yeah, *Marvel isn’t immune*. They’re going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

And, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren’t honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest Marvel releases. 

From a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren’t good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. The stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

They’re almost identical to the Transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

No, I’m not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up RT with fresh scores for every Marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it “4 Stars” or “fresh” because “it’s fun, I guess” or “it’ll work for the audience it’s meant for”. These films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it’s in the zeitgeist to. 

Of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, Marvel is the one that earned that success the least. It just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them “new” and “creative” because they change up the setting a bit. No. No, I’m sorry, that’s not the picture of creative dexterity. They’re safe, bland, blow em up action films.It's virtually tasteless and adds a nice surprising crunch to usually really soft eggs. I also like eating shrimp tails after eating shrimp sometimes idk maybe I'm a psychopath.Seriously, this is probably the dumbest law I have ever seen, why should you not be allowed to sleep inside your own property?? 

It doesn't even change a damn thing, wether you are insinde the car or not, you are neither disturbing nor endangering anybody. 

The only thing this law probably does, is encouraging driving tired or intoxicated and making the cops arrest innocent people for another absolutely stupid reason.

I wonder why this law even exist and why there isn't an outrage to abolish it.

I'm so happy that it's legal here where i live.Every time this damn show comes on I change the channel immediately... it's just so horribly unfunny and the laugh tracks after every single line is just the worst thing ever. I cant put it into words how much I hate this show.Needless to say as at this very moment you might have already guessed. Yes. I just listened to 34+35 by Ariana Grande. The girl can sing but maybe it's me getting old or something...(I'm 24...I don't think I'm that old but whatever) But hearing someone sing "Fuck me until daylight" is straight up cringey to me. And don't start yelling at me saying "iF yOu DoN't LiKe  iT DoN't LiSTeN tO iT". Listen.....I like to give everyone a chance when it comes to literally everything and I've given Ariana Grande too many fucking chances and this was like thee absolute last chance for me lol. I am a adult and I can handle adult things but those lyrics to me just kinda  lack any thought....like she couldn't have come up with anything more creative lol say it in a damn different language or something I don't know. 

I just feel like kids won't get to have that fun light bulb moment when they grow up like some of us did and be like "OMG THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT......???? THAT'S WHAT I WAS ROCKING OUT TO WHEN I WAS 7?????" (My personal experience of singing Pour Some Sugar on Me by Def Lepard....yeah didn't really click what they were singing about until I was like 21...yeah late bloomer here). But that moment is freaking hilarious once you grow up lol you can't do that really anymore because no one who's mainstream really tries to be creative and it sucks.

Edit: I just wanna say to the person who quoted "My neck my back..............." I'm sorry your comment appears to have been removed, but you have a valid point....but even as a kid that song cracked me up because it sounded silly af to me and it still makes me laugh that that somehow became a song...but so did WAP soooo who tf am I? Lol

Edit: I have a very wide range of music that I listen to. I just found this specific song because of a Google search and was curious and decided to have an opinion in the opinion. Part of reddit.

Edit: I'm NOT saying that explicitly didn't exist before, I'm saying i enjoyed the shock factor of someone saying something that sounds totally normal and the finding out...that's not at all what they meant.

Edit: Wow...I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thanks guys!😄 Even if you disagreeIt’s not because I like the smell or anything, I’m not that type of weird. 


But when they take that dump and realise ‘oh fuck this smells’ and they have to leave the bathroom and look me in the eyes - that’s power. 

For the rest of the time they are at my house, they are constantly anxious about the smell of their poop and it takes any stress off of me. I can do anything awkward but it won’t matter. The stench of their shit is lurking in the background, all the time. 



They are my poop prisoner.Friends say games are for kids, and that adults watch things like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc. I enjoy some tv series, but get way more enjoyment from games. I feel it develops more skills than plopping in front of a tv and turning your brain off for hours.






Edit: Wow, I went to sleep and this blew up. Thanks for the rewards! Great arguements from all sides.There was a news story a couple years ago where a very prominantent pro-birther in my area learned that her baby’s brain didn’t develop and her doctor recommended termination. The news story was basically “How dare a medical professional say such a thing; my baby is perfect to me.” A lot of people called her a “hero” for continuing the pregnancy and giving birth. The baby died before her first birthday. 

If doctors are recommending termination, nature has decided the baby isn’t going to make it. Generally speaking, there are two instances where the parents decide to continue the pregnancy anyway. Either a) the parents are in total denial about the situation and are pretending it isn’t happening or b) the parents are putting their ideology/religious beliefs first. It is truly sad and horrible when babies die in this way, no one should ever have to go through this, but it is delaying the inevitable and forcing your child to needlessly suffer is cruel and selfish. 

Obviously everyone has the right to make this decision for themselves and their children but I do think you’re a bad person if you put your own beliefs above your children. I think the woman in the news story is a bad mom who doesn't care about her kids.All too often lately I’m hearing the phrase “educate yourself”, mostly on very politicised topics which there isn’t really an objectively correct answer. I can’t understand how people think it’s an effective argument.


Very often they just want you to read biased views until you have the same opinion as them. But they fail to understand that it’s not because you are uneducated, as they’re suggesting, but because you have looked at the facts and come to a different conclusion.

Edit: There are obviously some people who provide good sources to back up their viewpoints, but I’m not talking about them. Similarly I’m not talking about people who give statistics.

I’m on about people who make the general statement “educate yourself”. I’m also talking about people who give links to opinion pieces on reputable sites, or even sites with a straight up political bias like Breitbart or Vice.

Edit 2:  I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT OBJECTIVE FACTS

Obviously if it’s in terms of a disease your doctor told you to research, or the infection rate of coronavirus then educate yourself is clearly meant in a sincere and objective way.

I’m talking about when you’re in a political debate and someone says you’re wrong and that you should educate yourself. There’s usually no correct answer in these situations so you can’t do it without finding a biased sauce.Okay before you delete me because it’s related to abortion hear me out. I don’t care which side of the argument you’re on. ProLife, ProChoice, whatever, more power to you. I’m just specifically saying if you ARE ProLife, you have to object in vitro fertilization.

IVF clinics trash more fertilized eggs a year than abortion clinics. The entire process is them fertilizing a certain amount of eggs, transplanting the ones least likely to have genetic problems into the mother, and tossing the rest and/or freezing them and then tossing them later if the parents decide not to try again. If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.

The only reason people don’t make a huge deal out of it like they do with Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics is because it’s EXPENSIVE. It’s for upper middle class and above. Meanwhile, abortion is often seen as a lower class problem. 

So anyway, pick whichever side you want, but whatever side you pick, actually follow through on those beliefs. Don’t make exceptions for the shiny new thing.This should be normal, i mean maybe it is but not where I'm from I guess.

Title says it all, I am really sick of the whole men should ask women out on dates cause most of the time I don't like girls the first time I meet them and when I do ask them out after knowing them it's kinda too late.

Example from my experience, I met G at the start of the school year and we became fast friends, she flirted with me a lot but a lot of people flirt with me so I ignored it, fast forward 3 months into the school year we hangin out after school while waiting for our rides and it snapped to me that I like her romantically.
After half a week I go up and ask her out but she goes "I really liked you when we first met but not anymore" then i ask what stopped her from asking me out and says "Guys should be the ones asking us out". We still close friends but yeah.

Maybe as I get older this would be different but why would the idea of guys going first be a normal thingHey guys, newbie here

I’m African and I’ve realized that whenever I start talking to someone online and I mention that I do in fact live in Africa, the entire conversation goes sideways and then it becomes “how do you have internet?” “ do you see lions frequently?” And other weird questions like that. And I’m not the only one who gets questions like that. 

My mum went to the USA a couple years back for an internship at a Montessori school. She still keeps in touch with one of the teachers there via email and Facebook. But last week when they were talking about ideas for online school during this pandemic, the lady still asked if there was access to electricity and internet in our community. My mum was quite irritated and she had to explain that yes, we have internet access in our homes and business and that’s how we’re able to use social media and email. 

I understand that the media in these places depicts Africa as a place where people wear leaves and hides and sleep in huts but don’t all continents have villages and rural areas?

Not everyone has to climb palm tree to get internet access and no, I have never seen a lion or a giraffe outside the zoo. In fact, i think the ‘wildest’ animal I’ve seen outside the zoo is a garden snake. 

Thank you. 
P.S. I’m new to reddit so please don’t judge me too harshly. Cheers:)

P.S: A lot of people have been asking why I say I’m from Africa instead of specifying where exactly. When I say Lagos, Nigeria, they always ask “where is that?” Then I say Africa and the questions follow.

P.P.S: there are a lot of things I’d like to clarify 

1. None of said conversation happened on Reddit, or during quarantine 
2. Lagos is not the capital of Nigeria 
3. If you’re saying a larger percentage of people in Africa don’t have internet access, you are correct. But if you are chatting with people over the internet then is it too much to assume that they aren’t part of that percentage?
4. It has come to my notice that this sub isn’t the perfect place for this post. No need to bite my head off, I shall crosspost 
5. For all you peaches who keep yelling “But Africa is POOR!!!” In the comments, no one said it wasn’t besides, it is rude to assume that the person on the other end of the phone or whatever is poor simply because they’re African and no decent human being should do that

P.P.P.S: thanks to everyone for the awards, I truly appreciateGod every time I go on tiktok, Instagram, Snapchat, all I see is stuff like “real women support each other” or “men suck, women rock” “girls support girls”. How am I supposed to stand behind that sort of thing when I’ve only ever been torn down by other women? SUPPORT GOOD PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY’RE GOOD, NOT BECAUSE THEY’RE A CERTAIN GENDER!!!!!Who the fuck would find it more comfortable to sleep with the door open? In my opinion it would be way more terrifying to see a ghost looking at you from the hallway instead of in your room.The same goes for “your” vs. “you’re” (and also “two”, “too”, and “to”). These words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy. 

I feel like telling people (politely) when they’ve used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying “language is fluid” isn’t appropriate for such a serious mistake. I think it’s fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong “there” actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used. 

I’ve seen a weird trend of people proudly not knowing the difference between these words, and it just feels like they’re patting themselves on the back for not understanding something that takes less than five minutes to learn. It’s embarrassing and it honestly makes people look stupid.I'm not talking about ruining the day for the birthday boy/gal/non binary person. It ruins the party FOR ME. I came here to eat cake, and I'm sure as hell I'm not the only one that thought the cake looked delicious.

But no, an asshole thought it was funny to completely destroy the cake because of some tradition.

I have legit seen people destroying the cake with the face of someone else. And I have also seen moms or the birthday boy give pieces of what's left of the cake. The hell, I'm not eating that. It has your boogers and your dead skin all over.

Stop wasting cakes for a stupid tradition. Let me eat cake, dammit.

Ps. No, I'm not buying two cakes.

Edit: For many people confused, this is a fairly popular tradition here in Mexico and I have seen many friends choking on cream or almost getting blinded with candles. So I guess my thoughts would be unpopular here in my country lmao.I am a hard left leaning person yet I roll my eyes every time people advocate for some right wing sub to get banned. no matter how shit, how wrong or how awful one person’s opinion might seem to you, they should have at least a place where they can talk and voice what they think. banning places where people share what they think will just drive them further away from any form of a discussion. people will just double down on what they think, even maybe they are now more open to radicalization. at any point it could hit you. imagine people advocating for your opinion to get banned. how would you feel? would you back down? 

I don’t want any opinion to be declared the right one. I want to have a good climate where people are able to discuss without having to ‘win’ arguments or fear of getting banned. This all under the assumption that an opinion isn’t actually a call to action to hunt down people or whatever.I usually check out any local shops in any town I happen to be in, and with that, I absolutely adore any time the owner has their loved pet walking around the store. I've seen dogs, cats, birds, I even like to see fish tanks. My parents and some friend seem to either not care, or dislike pets just walking around, but its just about my favorite possible thing for small shops.The family is already in shambles, Liz has been queen longer than any of us and some of our parents have been alive, Whats the point of going on after this? The 1000 year monarchy should end with the longest reigning monarch. God save the queen.Had a heart to heart with a friend and when I started talking about my autism they told me how I must be "really smart" and that I had "advantages."

I'm sick of this garbage. I have never once felt like I'm smart or that I have any sort of advantage. I'm knowledgeable in very trivial and useless things that will never help me contribute to society in a meaningful way, and I'm sick of the notion that I must be some sort of Mathematical Big Bang Theory type genius on the level of fucking Einstein.

Everytime I try to bring this up to me I'm accused of being ableist or some other type of crap. Do I believe I'll eventually do something with my life and feel accomplished? Hopefully. Do I feel like I was born wrong? 100%I’ve got a son and a daughter, and every time I go to shop for clothes, I see girls’ shirts with slogans like “the future is female” and “future president” and “girls run the world”. Boys? You get superheroes and monster trucks. Commercials seem to focus more on girls taking on typically boy oriented activities now. It gets pretty damn old. Girls get all these awesome, uplifting, powerful messages that you can be, do, accomplish anything. Little boys? Not so much. Even calling someone bossy is frowned upon. I got corrected by a nosy woman for telling my daughter she was being too bossy with her brother. Was told “no, she’s just strong and executive minded”. Thanks for undermining my parenting, lady.

We get it. Quit browbeating us.Graveyards are a waste of space and people should be remembered with stories, paintings, photos etc. of when they were alive and happy - not where their rotting corpse lies. 

The space taken up by graveyards around the world could be used instead amazing parks, public spaces etc. for new memories to be made by new generations. Cremate them all and be done with it.Phrases like, "Either you're with us or against us", "Silence equals violence", "love it or leave it", and ect are manipulative language to force peope to side with you without doing the work to give your movement or mission broader appeal.

For example, what the terrorists did on 9/11 was obviously horrible, but invading Iraq was awful too. Two wrongs don't make a right, and it's not fair to say people support terrorists if they are aginst invading Iraq

 Basically, this abusive language boils down to, someome was shitty to me, therefore I feel justified in acting shitty too, and if you don't support my shittiness, you support theirs. Toxic!

Apthathy is a perfectly acceptable response to both sides being assholes

Edit: Please don't give me reddit awards / gold, it's wasted on me. Instead, if you feel so inclined, and are in the US, show your appreciation by shopping at local black owned businesses, for multiple reasons, a lot of them are really struggling atmAs title says, people are crying their asses off about China censoring the site and how Reddit is selling their users right to free speech away but to be honest, I don't think Reddit has ever been particularly good at free speech.

If you got to any political sub and question their views, there is a high chance you'll get banned. This isn't just "The Donald" either. And it isn't just politcal subs either.   
Overly positive subs such as r/wholesomememes will literally ban you for not being positive or nice.  
It works for anything really, say anything particularly unpopular or not nice and you have a high chance either being banned or having your post deleted.

Don't like a meme/picture/post? Too bad you can't say anything unless the majority agrees with you.Wanna question something quite popular? Too bad.“I smoke a bowl each night so I can actually fall asleep”

“My.. leg.. hurts, so I smoke weed for it”

“Have you heard what weed can do for your \[insert health problem here\]? Try smoking indica, it’ll clear that right up”

Let’s not kid ourselves. The grand majority of people who smoke pot do it to get high. Of course there are people who do have legitimate health stuff that they treat with weed, but come on. Most people are just trying to get stoned but don’t feel comfortable enough to admit it, so they blame it on a health reason. You’re most likely not smoking because you get headaches, but rather because you want to binge watch Netflix and eat a pint of Ben & Jerry’s without people giving you shit for it.

EDIT: Not sure where some of you are getting the idea that I don't want weed to be legal from this post. I'm all for legalizing weed. This post has nothing to do with legalization. My whole point was that most people who smoke pot do it to get stoned but use it as a medical excuse so that other people won't judge them. Should people judge them? No, but there is a still a stigma attached to pot.

EDIT: I also clearly stated in this post that I know there are people who *do* smoke it for medical reasons and it helps. Once again, I never said that it didn't. All I am saying is that the grand majority are just trying to get stoned lol.

EDIT: Wow, this post sure hit a nerve for a lot of people. Maybe you guys should go smoke a bowl and chill out! Every fucking time I buy a frozen pizza, I put that sassy bitch in right when I start the oven. Why? Because I’ve figured it out. That’s right Uncle Sam, I’m onto you. 

The directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425F and cook for 15 minutes. My oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. So, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? No way. Not chance in hell, buckaroo. When I shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, I add 3-4 minutes to compensate. This means I wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. And guess what? It tastes fucking delicious. Ask any of my friends. I cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can’t get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. The pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. Source: I’ve been doing this for 12 years.

So nice try, Mr. President. I know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. Maybe it isn’t significant if one person cooks their frozen Italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you’re a thinker. You’re looking at the grand  scheme of things. MILLIONS of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? That’s straight theft, my man. And I ain’t giving in to that scheme .I cannot tell you what a struggle it was dating someone who did not like eating pasta, anything with cheese, seafood, all vegetables except like 5, pork, soups in general, most salad dressings, most spices, and so on and so forth. Like, what should we eat for dinner? Sushi? Spaghetti? Ramen? Steak? Pizza? NOPE. Like I get stressed spending so much time finding a place we can both eat.

Edit: My ex had absolutely no dietary restrictions. I have asked multiple times.

Edit 2: Omg thanks so much for the upvotes and interesting comments! I'm having a blast reading them. I'm happy to know I'm not crazy (which is what I was called by my selfish man-child ex and his crew for this issue specifically) LMAO

Edit 3: Last edit I promise, there seems to be some confusion, we are both in our mid twenties.I get the need and importance for activism, but if you make it your mission to creep it into every conversation you have, just to prove to everyone that you care, you’re really annoying. There are other things in life to talk about that believe it or not have nothing to do with your opinion on society.This may not be unpopular- the suicide and depression memes everywhere indicate I may be in the Reddit majority here, but when I say this to my family/wife, they do not enjoy it, thus, unpopular.

I do not want a funeral. I do not understand them, I never have. The price of them, the pomp and circumstance, the miserable wakes afterwards. It is not my job to give you closure. Make peace while I’m alive, if that’s what it’s about. Just let me the fuck go. I don’t want to “live” on the mantle in a jar, I don’t want my remains spread anywhere, I surely don’t want some punk ass distant cousins child live streaming it for 7 likes. Put me in your “most modest receptacle” and yeet me into a dumpster somewhere. 

The people who will remember me, and who will honor my memory, will do it in their daily lives, in whatever way my lasting impression on them fits. I hope those I love and care about are better people to have known me, and I hope they look back on the time we spent together with warmth. I just hope they do it, you know, without spending 10 grand on a wood box, hole, and day in a church I may catch on fire just being in.

Edit: I swore to myself if I ever had a post blow up I wouldn’t edit it, but I’d like to address the fUnERaL iS fOr tHE lIViNg crowd: you’re fucking right it is you pity sucking vampires. You gather around to stare at the real grieving, sucking every morsel of “thank god not me” you can. Fuck you. If any of you were my real friends you’d have punched the person trying to sell my grieving wife the “platinum widow package” right in the mouth. If you were my real friends you’d know I’d fucking hate that shit, and upon hearing of my death you’d know I wouldn’t stand for such tomfoolery, smoke a bowl in my honor, and go about your fucking day. For the living. How selfish. 

Edit 2: if you’re living with regret over having not spent enough time with someone, their fucking funeral isn’t the time to have that thought. I hope every person I have ever met, upon hearing of my death, thinks they have spent the exact right amount of time with me. Good or bad. Duck that guy I saw him twice and it was too often. Great. I had 55 years with him he was my soulmate. Well baby, if that’s all I had, it’s exactly how I wanted it to be. DONT WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE DEAD TO SEE THEM. Because they might just be yeeted into a dumpster before you say your piece, or whatever. I’m done editing. Christ.

Fuck I really was trying to get everyone back at least once. It’s late and my kids will be up soon. I’ll try again tomorrow.Obviously I'm not saying that people should lie about having a medical or law degree. But I hear stories of people who have been doing jobs for years and then it's found out they lied about having a degree but they've been doing the job for years and clearly didn't need one.

This usually ends with them being fired for dishonesty, which I understand. But the fact that this could happen just proves that we put way too much stock in degrees when most jobs will train you anyway.At least, this has been my experience.


I think it's great when people take a stand for social issues and I have no issues with being awake. However, this can go too far and it allows for people to become abusive *while thinking they are completely in the right*. That's an incredibly dangerous thing.


My ex was one of these people. She cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing. To an extent, I even agree with that. She was way too hypocritical though. Eventually she became dead to my feelings. If she hurt me, I did something to deserve it, or I was overreacting out of fragility and needed to "get a grip". She was never willing to admit wrong, and my views were always tainted because I was a guy.


I spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because I respected her efforts for change. It wasn't until I sought therapy that I realized how hurtful she was being. Eventually I came to the conclusion that believing the same things she did didn't give her a pass to treat people awfully. So yeah, sometimes the most outwardly caring and seemingly empathetic people can be the most abusive ones in your life.


Edit: there's nothing wrong with caring about or trying to fix social issues. I hold values very similar to hers. This isn't targeting beliefs saying they are wrong, it's targeting bad actions done thinking they are justified with good beliefs.In my mind the beach is a relaxing place to unwind and get some sun, but when I'm actually there the wind, sweat and sand remind me that things aren't always what they seem.It’s very interesting to sit there and watch them draw out the blood. I can sometimes see them getting bigger as they go. It’s a like a nature documentary right on my leg or arm. I feel nice letting that mosquito have a meal. It probably gets shoed away all the time, left to starve or worse live in fear of being killed every time it needs to eat. That poor mosquito didn’t chose to eat blood, it’s just hungry.You know what I'm talking about. Cereal commercial with glue instead of milk, so cereal would nicely float on top. Perfect burgers with fake grill marks, stacked by food stylists etc.

How is that even legal? Isn't that a false marketing when it looks 20x better in a commercial than in real life? I'm super mad about it.I don't carry a gun, don't do drugs, and don't break the law. I still do a massive double take when a cop car pulls behind me. Yes I realize they're human and most of them aren't sociopaths. But people with a  badge can totally fuck your life (sometimes without meaning to) and rarely face repercussions. Telling people that if they're not doing anything illegal they have nothing to be afraid of is stupid. You should always be on high alert when you're dealing with someone with a weapon who could easily shoot you on a suspicion and would almost certainly not be prosecuted for it.

EDIT: ok so a lot of people are saying this is popular? If this were so popular why would there be protests across the us? Reddit is a lot more diverse than some of you seem to think, and plenty of people have commented saying this is bullshit. So no, I don’t think this is popular. Maybe in your circles, but it’s very controversial in general.If I was in a marriage, and my husband wanted to take another wife, then I’d genuinely have no issue with it as long as he respects and looks after both of us equally. Ditto if I was in the position of being a second wife. 

Plus it would likely be a good thing for me too. I’d have another woman around the house to talk to, we could do things together and things like housework could be shared and less of a burden for all.

 If you have a program for kids and a program for adults, you can't remove videos from the adult site for being not kid friendly. 

I should clarify that I mean things like profanity. I think things like heavy gore and pornography should be removed.

That's my opinion. Feel free to debate in the comments section

Edit: in the title, I meant a moral right. I understand that as it is their platform they can do whatever the fuck they want, but I don't think the way they're doing it is alright.

Edit 2: once again emphasizing that it is their platform and they can do whatever they want, but I think it's hypocritical bullshit

Edit 3: I'm hoping this will be the last edit. I have a couple of things to say. First: once again, when I used the word "right" in the title, I did not mean that so literally. It was a case on bad wording and I am unable to edit titles.

Second: I was not aware that this was a popular opinion, so please stop telling me. I got it with the first 12 times people told me. I haven't really heard anyone else complain about it, and I hadn't seen anything on this subreddit.

Third: for those of you telling me that, "If I don't like YouTube make my own platform" Ah yes, I'm going to build a multinational platform from the ground up, just to spite YouTube /s. I don't have the time or money to pull that off.

Fourth: to the person who sent me a death threat in my DM's. Why? I just made a post? There was no need to, and I quote, "slit your wrists and murder your family while you bleed out" what the actual fuck? I have blocked you on reddit and blocked the memory of you from my mind.I know it’s messed up but kids falling over is funny to me and I’m sorry but if your child is going 60mph and they trip, chances are I’m going to laugh and I don’t care.It makes the bread soggy, it’s often cut too thick and it drips everywhere. It only belongs in a burger in the form of sauce. It is a terrible choice for a burger filling. Thanks for reading.In my opinion, from what I see Native Americans keep getting ignored/quieted. Too many people I’ve talked to have said or suggested that they believe no full blooded native Americans exist. Some even ventured to say that Natives were “extinct”. The pipeline problem, the drug abuse problem, the significant impact of covid-19 on native communities and other issues are all issues that should get more attention.

(Source: I am half Native)In the lockdown I have visited many high end brands’ websites and I was shocked to see that many don’t mention the price of the product. So you expect me to fill out a form with my details to have someone from your end contact me so I can ask them the price and then tell them I will get back to them? I can’t go through this entire process just to find out that I couldn’t afford the product anyway. Same issue with many Instagram based businesses which ask you to dm them if you want to know the price.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to get so many upvotes. Thank you for the awards and the upvotes kind Redditors!!“Your Honor”. I mean gimmie a fuckin’ break, dude. What else do you want me to call you? Your highness? Do you want me to fondle your nuts while I blow you, too? 

I’ve seriously seen courtrooms where they’ll say “Sir” and the judge will be like “It’s “Your Honor” young man!!” 

Fuck off. How much of an egotist you gotta be to care about some medieval-ass title? Use “Sir” like everybody else. 

It’s some LARPING I’d expect kids to do. “Oh Billy you have to call me supreme ruler snorlax the magical wizard!!1!” 

Shut up.

EDIT: I’m literally 22 and have never been in front of a judge, y’all, please relax and slow down with the theory crafting/ story writing.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are saying “it’s just a title, like Doctor!”. Judges have a title like “Doctor”, it’s called “Judge” - Doctors don’t expect us to call them “Thy Healer” or some crap like that.100- the ferocious Tyranno Saurus

Dead human beings simply cannot live up to the purity standards demanded of them by living human beings.

For 200 million years the dinosaurs ruled the Earth.I mean, I get the health concerns but...dude, that's still a living thing. There's the disconnect because it's a shelled creature that doesn't make any noise but that doesn't make it less fucked. And we just casually put them into a pot of boiling water or a steamer and just wait til it's done.

Jesus...

Edit: I've learned a few things from this post that apparently exploded over night

1. This is a regional thing.

2. Most professionals do something before boiling, but a knife to the head seems to be the least inhumane method

3. When people read the word "crustacean" they will most likely default to lobsters. Not always, but mostly.

Also, I'm not a vegan surprisingly. Shocker, I know.

Edit 2: "consider the lobster" is something that keeps getting posted which I'm reading atm. Just putting it up here so others can see that this exists.It has all the same problems, exaggerated and unrealistic scenario's that leave people wishing their perfectly healthy relationships were like those movies and end up causing problems that didn't need to be there.10 years ago, subscription networks like HBO, Showtime, Starz, Encore, AMC, etc all competed with each other on cable/dish television with their original content and on demand movie libraries.  Then, Netflix became a place that consolidated TV shows and movies from all different networks and time periods, and so many of us cut cable.  But now, with the original content being produced on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc., it is almost like we are back in the premium channel days where you need a subscription for all of them to see the shows you want!

EDIT: my unpopular opinion is that I WANT them all condensed back onto one single-pay platform optionI see a lot of hate for customers who say things like "oh it didn't scan so it must be free." or "a million dollars" when you ask if they'd like something else with their order. 


Those types of customers are the best. Sure the jokes are lame and you've heard them over 100 times but these people do it in hopes to brighten your day because they know it's stressful and miserable at times.


I prefer customers who try to be humorous over customers who are jerks any day.It's one thing to debate someone who's argument revolves around the assumption that God exists, but when people use phrases like 'Thank God', firstly it's sometimes not literal, especially if coming from a religious country. Even if it is...why do people want to go out of their way to show their superior knowledge by saying "God doesn't exist" or "If God exists then why doesn't he....". We get it, you're atheist...woohoo, very smart...but guess what, you're not convincing anyone of anything, you're simply triggering unnecessary arguments and showing the world you're a prick. I'm atheist, if that matters, but unless I see any harm done by what people say, I just shut my mouth.I just want to preface this post and say I have nothing against anyone who is working through mental health issues or am I trying to offend them. You have your own battles to fight and that's okay. 

I've noticed that recently there have been a lot of social media posts about dating people with mental health issues (eg. post like "dating someone who understands ur mental health is soo important. there's humans who will make u feel terrible for things u can't or don't know how to control yet"). I feel that posts like this don't understand the impact it can have on the other person in the relationship. 

As someone who has been in a two-year relationship where I was the emotional dumpster for my former partner, I felt insanely guilty for even wanting to break up with them because I couldn't continue to support them in their mental health journey. My former partner would often blame for me not being understanding or patient enough. They snapped at me on multiple occasions when I was talking about my day and my work team and how fun my day at work was because it made them feel more depressed that their work team wasn't as close. Later in the relationship, I had learnt to only ask about how their day went but never share my own, in fear of not being supportive of their mental health. 

Now I know that not everyone with mental health issues will be like my former partner, but posts on social media perpetuate the stigma that YOU'RE the unempathetic/uncaring/non-supportive one if you can't understand your partner's mental health. 

It's not true. You're not a bad person for wanting to break up with them. It's okay to break up with your partner if they're being toxic. Being with someone who is going through mental health issues is draining and it's okay to break up with your partner if their mental health is too much for you. It's okay to not be an emotional dumpster for your partner. Please remember that you're a person too. You have your limits and your own mental health to take care of. It's okay to break up with someone with mental health issues and it's okay to break up with someone because of their mental health issues.It is a dick move to ask someone to marry you for example during sport game on jumbo screen where thousand and thousands of people are staring at your partner EXPECTING them to say yes.The fact that so many Americans do this is mindboggling. Just look at the bottom of your shoes. The amount of dirt and bacteria you could bring into your house is outstanding and yet, many people wear them on the couch and bed. So gross to me.


Edit: I seem to have angered quite a bit of people. Those who are messaging me or getting upset, clearly you don't realize what sub you're on. Have fun in your dirt house. 

I want to clarify I absolutely don't mean people who have disabilities. There are obviously exceptions to everything. 
It's just kind of disturbing how many people are fine with dirty floors just because your feet are the only thing touching it.


Sorry last edit: 

1. I'm from Canada, not Japan lol (not ethnically Asian either)
2. I don't have dogs 
3. I proudly have a bidet (for those wondering) and house slippers
4. Even if you disagree, I can appreciate your comment. That's the beauty of having opinions. Doesn't change my mind about your dirty house, but that's alright. C'est la vie.I think that just having yellow emojis was best tbh. How come black hand emojis have black palms even tho they’re slightly white? Just a question, not an attack. Anyway, just having yellow emojis should be the only colour for emojis.

Edit: I’m not cancelling emojis, I know it’s not that big of a deal I just preferred the cartoony ones. It was neutral.

Edit: The colours other than yellow would be: Purple, green, red and blue. Just keeping it simple.
(P.S, I’m not trying to be PC, I hate political correctness)

Edit: idk why people are calling me racist, because I’m talking about ALL skin tones. And if you disagree that’s fine, that means that I posted it to the right subreddit.

Edit: people are apparently still thinking that I’m ‘racist’ thick doesn’t make sense. I’ve said nothing racist and when I tell people that I’m nor racist and that my closest friends are black apparently that’s not enough. What else can I say? Because you disagree with a post on r/UNPOPULARopinions doesn’t make me a racist, ok? I should be able to say something on reddit without some greasy neckbeard in the comments saying I have ‘white privilege’.Edit: just so we’re clear, men’s gaping buttholes are not anymore erotic than a woman’s. 

Like wow, a gaping asshole! Very cool! I just don’t get it. It’s like, hey there, here’s MY ASSHOLE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.

What’s that? You want me to pull it open even wider? Okay! I’ve gaped myself just for you! Upvote my BUTTHOLE PLEASE. There’s nothing sexy about it at all. It’s an asshole.May be a biased opinion. I was in boy scouts, and learned fire arm safety, and use in my early teens. While I don't think it should be mandatory, for a country that made gun ownership one of it's rights, we certainly don't educate our citizens very much on fire arm safety or use. 

I would have loved to take a fire arm class in school. Maybe as an elective, or alternate to gym? Learn archery and fire arm use and safety? It could destigmatize a lot of negativity regarding fire arms in the US specifically.I'm personally frustrated with people who cannot drink just a glass of water and need either soda or crystal light or something to make it more exciting. Water is great, you need it!

Edit: I assumed this post would just die honestly because I thought it would be judged to be a popular opinion, and based on the majority of comments it is generally a pretty popular opinion if not too strong of one for personally insulting people by calling them infantile and immature. I stand by this modification: if you have clean water and insist on drinking something else with a bunch of sugar all the time you are behaving immaturely and childishly. If you do not have access to clean or drinkable water this absolutely doesn't apply. I posted on an old throwaway (not made for this post) because it stemmed from a very recent conversation with a few people who know my main account, and this old throwaway was also a water related AITA (I was judged to be TA, which I ended up agreeing and seeing the other side) so I thought that was a decent use of that old account. Please consider drinking more water and taking some of the suggestions within the comments for how to make it tastier without adding unnecessary sugars to it.I will start by saying that I'm not the expert either, proving the point. 

I'm using the United States as the basis for this argument since in my country Portugal, we have a Communist Party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party - it's basically impossible at this moment and they have 7/8% or less every election. 

But in the US I come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are. Socialism isn't equal to communism. Also, "everything I disagree with" isn't communism. You are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesn't want to hear "no" more often than none.

I would even argue that most people can't even point if a political idea is mostly left or right-wing.

**EDIT 1:**

 It seems to be important to clarify that my goal was never to promote communism as some great idea that is the best option for your country or something. My only point was: people talk about stuff and equate it to communism when there is actually no evidence of it being the case or it being even remotely close in terms of what both represent.


**EDIT 2:** 

In my interpretation and simplifying it, Communism is a socio-economical and political ideology based on a self-sustaining human existence that wants to promote an egalitarian society and with no social classes.

Thanks /u/aprx4 for the correction on the definition. Proving my point that even OP doesn't know the exact and correct definition and that's why I'm not throwing the word around like it's nothing.

**EDIT 3:** 

Taking away your rights =/= communism. Inter-racial marriage =/= communism. Yes, socialism is on the same spectrum of communism but there is a big difference between both ideologies but you can argue that socialism is a middle term for socialism but you can have a Socialist Party that doesn't intend on becoming a Communist Party or even implementing a Communist Regime/Society. The same way you wouldn't classify every single right-wing party "nationalist".So much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. No shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. It's just how things were. Despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

It's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. We would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

Note: This post inspired by a twitter rant about HP Lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. Dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. Get over it.

&#x200B;

Edit: My inbox hurts. Thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. Also, I get it, Lovecraft was *particularly* racist. Still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. Separate the art from the artist.

Edit 2.0: This *really* blew up... Thanks to everyone who came here to actually discuss this in an intellectual capacity rather than hurling accusations of being a white supremacist at me. I've barely had time to address any comments, but I've enjoyed reading them. If you're seeing this as a "justification of racism," you're exactly part of the group of problematic people I'm talking about who want to pressure wash history with a broad stroke. It's important that we take into consideration the norms of the time when discussing the merits of our forefathers. As several people have mentioned here, it's really best to grade everyone on a curve based on what was normal at the time.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.Gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive. Although gaming can be addictive and a time sink, I argue that it's still much better to have a society interested in gaming, especially young adults, than all obsessed with social media and YouTube instead. Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.

Social Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses. They need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they don't document it in a way that looks appealing to others , they're afraid of being judged. This is bullshit. On the other hand, if these people didn't put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead, there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesn't value dumb stuff like that as much. They're too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers.

YouTube: Yes, everyone watches YouTube. But non-gamers who put more time into YouTube I argue can be bad depending on the content they consume. YouTube has all sorts of content, but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda. A lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an alt-right rabbit hole without them even realizing that it's happening, they're just browsing videos on YouTube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these right-wing beliefs that they probably wouldn't have if they didn't fall down a rabbit hole. 

Huge channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs, it's not a fair balance. Google doesn't care as long as they're getting paid. If these impressionable young adults were just playing video games, they'd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there. They wouldn't be as vested into these channels and spend their focus on improving on games.Been doing a lot of dishes lately and realizing that I’d rather wash 20+ dirty plates than oily Tupperware. Don’t feel like I ever successfully clean the Tupperwares cause I can still feel the oil whereas for plates, I know its clean. Anyone else feel the same way?Every time I’ve ate a cheeseburger I found myself highly disappointed and always regret it. Every bite into a cheesburger I feel a horrible clash of flavors and  tastes that just go against the essence of the meat. I believe Burgers are much better suited with on your fresh veggies like lettuce, pickles, red onion, and possibly tomatoes (depending on what you like), and either simply just some ketchup, or a more interesting sauce if it’s available to you, but not anything that will overpower the meat, like cheese does.

Edit: just got back to this. Wow. Thanks for the platinum kind stranger!! And all the other awards thanks!!

Edit 2: I’ve had fast food cheesburgers AND “fancier” cheeseburgers... both are just so unnecessary to me.The saying is a British one, which is 'I COULDN'T care less'.

Which makes sense. If you couldn't care any less, means you care as little as is humanly possible. You can't care any less.

However, Americans say that they COULD care less but with the same intentions in using the phrase. If you COULD care less, surely that means you do actually care? Like, there is room to care less.

Dunno, just bugs the hell out of me.

Edit: Didn't expect this to blow up. Does this mean it's a popular or unpopular opinion?

EDIT: For all those asking why I'm picking on Americans here, it's genuinely because I only hear Americans do this and I never hear them say it the correct way. I'm sure there are other people around the world who say it incorrectly, however, I get the impression there is more of an acceptance of the incorrect phrase in the US. FYI I love the US, it's one of my favourite places to visit. Subreddits like r/earthporn, r/Animalporn, or r/Natureporn just sounds disgusting. I get the intent right away that it’s supposed to be pleasurable to the eye. But in no way do I relate anything beautiful to porn. I think it really misses the mark.I'm so sick of people telling me to not only want to go into IT for the money, and instead choose something I like to do. What I like to do is play video games, and make music, but that isn't secure at all. I feel like it shouldn't be looked down upon, pursuing a career just for the money it brings, because some people just want financial freedom more than anything and thats ok to want. 

Also, some successful people originally just went into it for the money.

Edit: for those saying this is an unpopular opinion, I'm talking about career advice, and not what people actually do. So yes people usually do this and its a popular opinion, however advice is usually to do something you like to do.Drake isnt even a good rapper. His voice sucks and is so obnoxious. I hate how people say that hes one of the best rappers when hes clearly not. Hes so overrated that its not even funny

Edit : didnt expect this many to agree with me. Thanks for the awards. Appreciate it. Also ye fuck drakeI have heard so many complaints from teens who are forced to pay rent about their parents still entering their room without permission, looking through their stuff, taking their stuff and limiting use of utilities even though their parents charge them for them anyway. It really isn’t fair. 

If you’re making your kids pay rent, treat their room and property like a real landlord would and anyone who doesn’t should face legal penalties.

I also believe that once kids are being charged rent, they should be free to make their own decisions, eg. Going out whenever they want or inviting friends over.

And if any of you are getting ready to comment about how they should move out if they don’t like the rules, this isn’t an option for everyone especially kids aged 14-16 who are being charged rent but aren’t old enough to live anywhere else.I see it all over the internet. "Yell at your kid that'll toughen em up", Or older generations complaining about how weak the younger generations are when they're the ones weakening them.

Talking calmly toughens them up, wanna know how? Because it teaches them to engage into the conversation and stick up for themselves.

What I have noticed is people who have been yelled at a lot by there parents growing up tend to cry or keep there head down and not say anything when being yelled at by someone else.

Just to clarify: I mean constant yelling, not sitting down to talk about the problem from time to time. Of course yelling is necessary in some cases.

Edit: Thank y'all so much for blowing this up, I seriously hope this helps people understand yelling or raising your voice isn't always necessary in minor situations. Have a good day everyone. And thank y'all for the awards.

Edit 2: A lot of you are saying this isn't an opinion, I personally think it is, because a bunch of people are disagreeing with me in the comments lol. Sorry if it isn't.

Yet another edit: Okay, I can't believe I have to address this. EVERYONE PARENTS DIFFERENTLY. Everyone has different opinions on parenting styles. This parenting "Technique" If you could even call it that, is just wrong and hurtful, IMO, note, OPINION. 

Another edit, Lol: WOW y'all really blew this up, I seriously can't thank you all enough, I did NOT expect this. Have a wonderful week beautiful strangers.When I was younger, I hated when my mom did this, but I always thought it was just the way teens were and I'd grow out of it at some point. Here I am, some 25 years and 3 kids later. I was on my way to see if the paper in our office printers needed to be restocked (I always like doing this to be a good guy and help everybody out even though this particular thing isn't really my responsibility) and ran into my boss on the way who said "Oh, you should really check on those papers downstairs". Alright then, fuck you, Jeremy, I don't wanna do it anymore.

My husband has always been the ONLY exception to this for some reason 😆I feel like whenever someone has a good singing voice, they’re always singing. Yes you have a nice voice. It’s pleasant but that doesn’t mean I want to hear you sing all the time. If I wanted to hear you sing, I’d ask.


obligatory edit: thanks for my first award, I think I’ll go sing about it alone in my car!Everywhere on the internet, especially reddit i see people assuming these things about people and it bugs the crap out of me. I see people saying things like "you wouldn't know because you're probably X", like, how the fuck would you know???


EDIT: I sincerely apologise if this isn't an opinion, i thought it was and so i posted it.Let me explain. The Reddit community is the most condescending trash I have ever seen. They constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

Now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto Reddit.

The majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. You get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. This is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? We're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfuI swear, half the stuff on that subreddit is nowhere near insane. And anyone who thinks it’s insane is clearly under the age in Reddit’s ToS anyway. 

Mom demands to know where you are after school because you didn’t check in? What an insane overbearing controlling parent!

Dad took away your SnapChat because you’re 14 and probably shouldn’t have that shit anyway? INSANE. 

Parents took away the WiFi password because you didn’t do your chores? INSANE AND SLAVERY!

Just because your parents are parenting you and not allowing you to run amok unchecked doesn’t mean they’re insane/bad parents. And while there is some insane shit there, there is a very large percentage that isn’t.Someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

So many people go out and buy like bulk packages of water bottles. Single use water bottles should be banned,  people should all have reusable bottles.

I mean in capital cities of Australia our tap water is perfectly safe, everywhere,  even public bathrooms,  so why wouldn't you just drink it?

Avoiding tap water is a first world issue,  I mean places like Bali have tap water that is riddled with giardia and bulk ecoli and here we are absolutely avoiding ours when its perfectly safe (mostly,  sorry flint and parts of the USA)

EDIT: wow fuck i didn't expect this to blow up, kinda devo my first huge post wasn't some funny meme. A lot of you make really good points that I totally didnt consider. I enjoyed this discussion but some of you are also stupid and unnecessarily abusive.It’s horrendously expensive. A dry and dull city in the middle of nowhere, filled with shallow women and Rich blokes flashing their cash. Literally he’ll on earth.A lot of people I know have this idea of “my wife/girlfriend talks too much, I have things to do,” but with my girlfriend it’s different. She can talk and talk and talk for hours on end probably, and I would listen to it all. It makes me strangely happy to listen to her ramble on about whatever Is on her mind. Yesterday when I called her, she talked for almost 3 hours and I just listened to her talk the entire time while simultaneously doing whatever I was doing, games, working out, and the entire time I was extremely happy. I love listening to her talk.

Edit: this is a couple hours after, but if you’re gonna comment “aw yeah honeymoon phase, it’ll never last” or “ah young relationships, makes sense, we’ll have fun kid” can you please not. I get it, it might not last but let me learn on my own for fucks sakes, stop making me feel like shit.

Edit 2: for all of those asking, we’ve been together for around 5 months, but have known eachother much longer than that.Look at him. Arms folded with a slight smirk, like he’s a fourteen-year-old redditor who just typed out “yikes sweetie, let’s unpack that”. Maybe he just finished an hour-long shit slinging fiesta with someone online that led to literally nothing. Or maybe he just posted a very popular opinion here and knows he’ll be raking in karma. He thinks he’s hot shit because “Comedy laugh tracks are bad” or “Old people should have to retake their driver’s license tests”. Yeah, no shit bud.

I fucking hate that smug prick.Look, weebs are kinda odd... any extreme obsession is odd. But, why are people so quick to look down on anime fans or whatever when I met some weirdly obsessed adult Disney fans? It’s really normalized. I don’t know, I mean, at least anime isn’t targeted towards children. In the end, they’re both cartoons: one is made for an older audience while Disney princesses and stuff are targeted for kids.Seriously, there seems to be a trend among some parts of the internet and real life to just flash faux motivational feel-good phrases like these to get cheap emotional responses from people who are truly desperate enough to believe that somewhere on the internet or in their vague proximity there is a person who actually genuinely cares about them. Sorry to break it to you, but they probably can't. How can you care about someone you don't even know personally? They have no idea who you are and you have no idea who they are. You are therefore completely blind to any reasons why you are truly loved by anyone, which makes perceiving this feeling as genuine extremely difficult, and impossible for me.

The sort of people who would actually unironically find these phrases motivational are so devoid of any positive social interaction (which I am not saying NEVER happens but is such a desperate situation) that any string of words vaguely resembling a heartfelt compliment brightens their day. The trouble is that these phrases masquerade as heartfelt compliments but are such cheap emotional signalling that anyone utilising a sliver of their human observation and reasoning can see that they are being emotionally manipulated.

The other day at school, I saw a message scribbled on my desk that said "Whoever sits at this seat, know that you are loved #SpreadPositivity". The vagueness in the wording baffled me. If someone sits at this seat, by virtue of just being there, they are loved, and I, sitting in another spot, am no longer told that I'm loved? If I am truly loved by anyone in particular, then the message would have been a lot more personal, and due to the circumstances in which that message is being presented, it could not be. That message would have had some positive effect on me if that were the seat I was assigned to (which would make the message take on a new meaning, hence why here it was used so generically), but no, it was a classroom shared by 4 grades above and below mine and due to COVID we have free seating. The message is not personal; I don't think the writer even knows who I am, and even if they did, it was not targeted at me, so I cannot personally feel good about anything in the message. If anything, seeing that message made me upset, knowing that my feelings have been pandered to in an attempt to have a cheap emotional response elicited from me. I felt manipulated. It was insulting, too; I do not need anyone to remind me that I am loved, especially not from an anonymous entity I don't even know. The message implies that the only criterion that I have to fulfil to be loved is to sit at that particular seat, which makes me feel that I do not actually deserve the praise, since I have not done anything worthy of that praise. I have to work my ass off to get the grades to make my teachers and parents happy, be funny and genuine with my friends to make them happy, and meticulously plan every encounter to make my girlfriend happy. I know that in order to be loved you must be willing to put in the effort, and any "free love" you get is not at all genuine. Consider this to be akin to an infinite fountain of counterfeit cash: while you can take as much as you want, all you get in the end is some free paper in case you run out of tissue or toilet roll.

This is a wider problem on the internet, where out-of-touch celebrities, influencers and even some of you on Reddit collectively tell us that we matter or that we are loved blah blah blah. Alright then, if we truly matter, then we don't need you to tell us that we do because we should be able to feel that every day! If our feelings need to be validated in such a way, would that not suggest that we are in fact not loved by many or do not matter to all but one or two? I do not feel any better after reading your post, nor do I appreciate that somehow I am targeted to be emotionally pacified. You only use such generic phrases because you are sure that it would apply to everyone, just as if you were tasked with buying me a shirt without knowing who I am you would probably just buy a plain black or white V-neck because it's such a safe choice, with no polarising or remarkable elements. I have no interest in what you say about me without knowing who I am. I do not deserve to be loved simply because I exist, I should be loved because of who I am and what I do, and if being who I am means that I will grind more people's gears, so be it. Being who I am is expressing my personality. Existing is not a personality.

A big part of what makes a compliment special is how personal it is. I cannot be made to believe that any celebrity, any influencer, or even that Redditor I have never interacted with before know me enough to genuinely compliment me. I know your intentions: You want to scribble something in real life or online, in the hope that someone would stumble upon it and you would brighten their day. But you did not brighten their day. It's an insulting, condescending and frankly manipulative genre of phrase that serves absolutely no purpose.

Anyway, I am by no means saying that we should just stop spreading any form of positivity and self-love. I understand some people are going through tough times in their life and need any emotional support they can get. In that case, establish connections with them in private, make them feel like you give a shit (even if you don't!), DM them, make them feel better as a person with lived experiences, not a publicity stuntman because you either want some Internet brownie points or just want to demonstrate to the world how virtuous and caring you are. Promoting love and positivity only works well if there is even a façade of reciprocity. If you were talking to a friend in great mental distress, your magnum opus surely would not be such a simple phrase overused to shit. So, treat people online as you would people in real life. Have a genuine two-sided conversation and step outside the box of virtue-signalling.

This new genre of feel-good phrases just doesn't work for me, and I'm very sure many other people feel the same way. I just don't see the majority of the Internet agreeing with this though (with all the positivity movements and shit), but hey, that's why I'm here ranting and you're here reading (hopefully). Thanks for listening :)

&#x200B;

tl;dr: What makes a compliment special is how personal it is. Phrases like the ones in the title used between strangers are so generic that they lose any sincerity left in them. Therefore, the people who use these phrases are (willfully or not) engaging in emotional manipulation and the person who unironically feels good in the face of these phrases are really, really fucking desperate and they might need actual help. In that case, stop and talk to them as a person.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I see a lot of you in the comments commenting about how this is a symptom of a lack of empathy. I disagree. Empathy is when you can connect with someone's lived experiences because your imagination and lived experiences allow you to do that. In my case there is a complete lack of information: I don't know who wrote that on my table and the person who wrote it on my table don't know who I am (or even if they do, they most likely don't know I'm going to read it). When there is a complete lack of information, there is nothing to base empathy on.

Edit 2: To clarify, there is a difference (which I have probably not made very clear in my original post) between a conversation between two individuals that one appreciate the other and someone being told by an anonymous random message that they are loved. When this message means the same to everyone, it means nothing to everyone. Telling someone that they are loved (or equivalent) is a personal sentiment. When you, while writing the message, don't care if it ends up in the hands of any person, it brings no value to anyone in particular because it brings everyone else the same value. Then, the message ceases to be personal because it means that nobody feels special after reading it.Just because you have a low paying job doesn't mean you are a loser . Life isn't fair , not everyone has had time nor the opportunity to study . 

Not everyone wants to open a business nor become rich by working long hours . Some people just want to get by living without mansions , sport cars and overpriced holidays .


Edit : thank you for Reddit silver 🥈!!!

Edit2: Oh shit reddit gold !!!, I feel like Obama winning the nobel peace prize, I didnt do anything to deserve it but thank you so much!!!  🥇

Edit3: holy shit , Reddit platinum!!! I don't even know what  is this  but thank you so much for it and for all the upvotes. 🏆🏆🏆🏆A lot of retail employees don’t have chairs and are only allowed to sit down in their breaks. I’m sure this is so to customers the employees look professional. But you know what looks more unprofessional than sitting down? Leaning on stuff, rocking back and looking uncomfortable. Plus it’s just going to make them find somewhere to hide where they can sit down

There’s absolutely no good reason an employee who stands in one place for a large portion of their job  to not have a chairLike chocolate is delicious but doesn’t exactly leave a very refreshing taste in your mouth. And mint is clean and bright and fresh. The two together make no sense and taste disgusting. Complete opposites. Both loved separately, not combined.PenisA pretty obvious opinion, but rather unpopular where I’m from in the Midwest. I’m thankful that my mother told me that if I ever needed birth control, she would get it to me. That was 7 years ago when I was 13. Now I’m 20, in a long term relationship, and have been on birth control since 17. Might not like some of the side effects I’ve seen (acne, bloating, slight weight gain etc.) But at least I don’t have a child.   

Both of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control. One had to get it through college, one didn’t have an option till post graduation. 

My point is, you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them. If you as a parent truly think that, you are delusional. Teenagers/young adults will always find a way to do what they want, and their parents telling them ‘no’ is just going to make them want to do it more. 

And this doesn’t just go for girls, I’m only writing it this way because I am a girl, and I know firsthand. Give your son condoms if he needs them, and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe. 

EDIT: Took a nap and came back to all of this. Just wanted to point out a few things as I’ve been scrolling through the comments. 

1. Yes, I am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects. I’m also aware that it’s trial and error. I’m on my 3rd type of birth control and I’ve never been happier. It’s hard to discover what really works for you and that’s why it’s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now. 

2. I’m well aware that female birth control doesn’t protect against STIs. But here’s the thing, condoms don’t protect against babies either. Doubling up on both female birth control AND condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and STIs. 

3. Some are talking about fertility and birth control. It is known that the birth control shot CAN increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control. But let’s think of other things that can affect fertility. Smoking, extreme weight loss, other types of hormones such as things we put in food, endometriosis. I could go on.

4. Rape happens. If you’re on birth control, chances are you’re not going to get pregnant.

5. Women can do whatever they want with their bodies. 

6. 20 y/o female living in Ohio, grew up catholic. For all you saying religion is the answer.

7. This is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill, instead of boys with condoms. If you are calling your FEMALE child a whore, slut or anything of the sort, there is something wrong with you. Women can have sex. WOMEN CAN HAVE SEX.

8. How could I forget something so important? BIRTH CONTROL IS USED FOR SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

EDIT 2: LolThe whole thing of wondering what they look like bare is what makes them sexy. Once you see them, the novelty wears off quick. Especially true after you’ve seen several pairs in person, the novelty just wears offLately I have been seeing posts where someone is banned for being apart of another subreddit. For example I saw someone who was subbed to the_Donald was banned from offmychest and the reason the mod listed the ban for was he was apart of the_Donald and they immediately thought he was a troll. I personally don't think people should be banned and stereotyped because of their political veiws from non political communities.


Edit: Yes I know this is very cliche. But, thank you to the 13 people who gave me my first awards. I very much appreciate it!!!!He acts dumb for comedic purposes, is tiny and  cute, speaks gibberish, eats things that shouldn't be eaten, gets into trouble easily, can't obey simple commands, has one solid base color and it was created to sell toys, it check all of the boxes.

Edit: i know his name is Grogu but it hasn't even been a week since we learned that, most people still think of him as baby yoda.

Edit 2: i realized this on the last episode when Din says Grogu he answers with gibberish and it sounds EXACTLY like a minion.

Edit 3: [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandalorianMemes/comments/k4lx8d/this_is_the_best_scene_of_this_season/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)It ruins the magic for me. It includes another person's perception of who the characters are and my brain automatically begins to shift my own reading to fit their narrative. Gah I cannot truly express how much I hate it. But the people around me seem to like seeing people on book covers a lot, leading me to think that maybe this is truly an unpopular opinion that I have.

Edit: Thank you guys for all the responses and making me feel like I'm not alone in this! I guess I had it all wrong and it might not be unpopular after all!I get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and I am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.  The world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. But still...

&#x200B;

Edit - added sources for the statistics I used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. Maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. I appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, I think it's a good debate. But even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. Have a nice day!

Edit2 - This post was inspired by my personal perception that this issue (which generally has no relevance to me) seems to be in front of me where ever I go (on the net/media/movies) and honestly it seems completely disproportionate to the number of people actually affected. So I stated my [/r/Unpopularopinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unpopularopinion). There was some good debate and the usual amount of insanity, but this post by  u/[shadovvvvalker](https://www.reddit.com/user/shadovvvvalker) makes a great point that I wanted to highlight.

TLDR - I stand behind the sentiment that "I" think we have bigger fish to fry, but I deeply respect the position expressed by another redditor and I hope others will read it and appreciate it as well.I was going over job posting in my area on Indeed. They are so many jobs( call center, front desk, etc.) that pay $9-$12/hr but require college degree and multiple years of experience. Like what the hell. It is so sad.There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of "moral well" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

EDIT 2: This post is really blowing up, so I wanted to share [this video]( https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw) posted by /u/thefarrquad which I think applies to this situation.That's right. Taking a bite out of a freshly opened KitKat Bar is more satisfying than splitting up the little sticks. If you open up a wrapper and start breaking these wafers apart, you're not only making more work for yourself, you're ruining a perfectly good candy bar. Biting down into these connected pieces of chocolate gives you the added texture bonus of biting through the crevice between the connected mounds and then being able to snap them apart in your mouth with your tongue. I will not hide this anymore, I don't care how much my fiance threatens to leave me and I don't care if my children call another man their father. This is the superior KitKat eating way and you all are doing it wrong.This is all over social media and completely ruins any video its used in, instant skip even if its good content. It'll be something so obvious too like "my dog met another dog at the park and they really hit it off" for a video of two dogs playing, having an AI voice read that out loud af is so unnecessary. It drives me nuts! Most stupid pointless trend ever and it makes videos unwatchable. The text is plenty or just read it out yourself 🤦‍♂️😂No one has ever smoked a cigarette and then wrap his car around a tree or beat his wife, yet smokers are completely despised compared to drinkers. If someone is an alcoholic they are met with sympathy and support, but smokers are simply called idiots. My father was an alcoholic and it affects me to this day, if he smoked instead, our family would be intact. You see politicians posting pictures of themselves drinking, yet what they are doing, is partaking in, and frankly, glorifying the most damaging habit ever to society. Smoking kills, sure, but only the individual, not children’s futures.You hear a lot about guys that are bad in bed: the orgasm gap, one minute men, guys that refuse to go down on girls at all, small penises etc.  It’s politically correct to criticize men and women are always willing to complain.

But in my personal experience and talk with my successful with women male friends women are quite likely to be bad and selfish in bed.  I don’t sleep with men so I don’t have a clue about men but a sizeable minority of women exhibit almost all of these traits:

- doesn’t move and is only a passive recipient of pleasure 
- foreplay is only for her never for you 
- frozen hands never move or stimulate partner 
- unnatural revulsion at seminal fluid 
-  always wants to be on bottom
- rarely initiate
- lack enthusiasm 
-  thinks penetrative sex must be so good for men that it’s all they need to offer in bed to be great
- unwilling to discuss it and/or super defensive and projecting if their partner brings it up 

Maybe it’s the constant cheerleading or the constant male libido but don’t be fooled ladies, some of y’all are garbage in the ole sack!  Personally I think some men are so thirsty these girls never know they are a potato in the sheets.

I am aware this is likely to get me roasted on a stick but it’s r/unpopularopinion soThe government and society want to keep us working and spending as much as possible, so obviously they can tax us all along the way.  The amount people work to spend their money on the useless shit they don't need is in my opinion unbearable.  Especially to anyone doing hard labor work.  People wake up and prepare for work, work all day often until the sun goes down, and by the time they are done washing up and feeding themselves, you literally have 1 or 2 hours of time each day to spend by yourselves. For anyone who plays a musical instrument or does any other practice time consuming art, your entire life consists of work and practice; leaving you a overworked, unhappy husk.

If there is anyone considering a life of minimalism and less work, I strongly advocate for it.Pretty much the title. All these "gourmet cupcakes" with a flower the size of your fist are just a mound of sugar on top of a mediocre cupcake. Put the effort into making the actual CAKE taste good, and you won't have to hide it under an avalanche of frosting.I’m sick of seeing the comments of anything slightly controversial be turned off is your gonna post a news story at least let people share there opinions on the story.  I want to see what people think and I want to share my opinions and I want to like or dislike the video there no point posting otherwise.I see all of these people talking about how America is this and America is that. 
I wanna take these people to a third world country, leave them there for a couple months and then watch their opinions change faster than they can complain about their favorite taco bell closing.

Edit 1: Yall acting like me saying this implies I hate people crticizing the country. I hate people on Twitter and reddit whining for no reason. 
For all you simpletons out there
BLM= good; 
Hating on America cause you have to wear a mask= not good

Edit 2: all of you getting butthurt and straight up salty, I live to watch people like you rage 😂When a person who wins a lottery is forced to reveal their identity to claim a prize, that greatly endangers the individual. Their chances of being robbed and/or killed is greatly increased as a result of this. They also start getting targeted by random spam calls much more often, and called by people who beg them for money.

Winning the lottery should not result in you losing your right to privacy, safety, and security. Being forced to reveal your identity is a form of doxxing. If it is illegal to dox someone on the internet, then it should obviously also be illegal to do so in real life, especially if it puts their life at a greater risk.I despise getting into a good series/book/anime/manga/cartoon which has a terrible cliffhanger "ending", with next to no closure. 

I don't want to have to come up with an ending for their story, I want the writer's/director's ending, their interpretation of the story. If I wanted to come up with a story that suits my interpretation, I would be the one writing something. I want to read THEIR finished work, not mine, or some other random internet person who came up with their weird "head-canon".

It baffles me when people actually defend this kind of behaviour, since it just promotes laziness. They are the ones (and sadly the majority of readers) that allow writers to get away with this shit. Storywriters like this should be called out on this stuff way more harshly, they would deserve the negative criticism, which could be avoided by not being lazy and finishing their story properly.

I don't care how disappointing the story's ending is, as long as it came from the writer's mind, and has almost full closure on all charaters and major plot lines.I always hear people talking about how gross it is when this happens but I personally don't mind it. it adds an extra bit of texture that I think makes the food feel more fancy. IDK maybe I am a psychopathy for thinking this but for foods like microwaved oatmeal and breakfast burritos its really not horrible.Firstly, I think this could be changed quite easily by simply doing away with up/downvotes. As someone new to this site, it seems to me that these do nothing to encourage the free exchange of ideas, and basically just exist to reinforce some kind of unwritten, yet universally understood consensus criteria which is executed unconsciously by members and by which everything is Judged.

People seem to have a vague, instinctual sense of what the Hivemind wants, and play up to it for purposes of generating the social currency of Reddit which is Karma. Sometimes they get it wrong, or just resist it, and in such cases, they are instantly and viciously torn to shreds like an ant entering a stream of ants from a different colony  by other posters who apparently relish such opportunities to pay totem to the reddit Hivemind God, which validates this behavior and rewards their faith once again through the miracle of upvotes.

The net result is a kind of vapid, recycled echo chamber. The froth and dregs, but no middle. The same ideas offered up like prayers, in all manner of instances which may in some cases even be unique in their particularities, but usually aren't, and never vary in theme-- -Forever.

It's a collective beast of emotion operating on some algorithm of demented, utterly artificial and totally insincere pseudo-morality which is either the petard upon which it has hoisted itself or otherwise serves as an excuse to spruik inconsequential, meaningless drivel to the end of feeding its insane and profound addiction to a meaningless Fiat: Karma.

I do not think, outside of a very select handful of subs, it is good for anybody.Nobody is responsible for your traumas. If someone says/does something unknowingly triggering, let them know nicely. If you lash out at them rudely, be prepared to get put in your place.

It’s about how you approach the situation. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk

Edit 1: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up ❤️ I went ahead and removed that curse word because it was a bit insensitive. Hope that helps a bit xxWhen I was in middle and high school, one of the greatest sources of trauma I have ever endured was being forced to change in front of the other girls in locker rooms. They would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time. Not only was I the nerdy kid, but I basically had the body of a 11 year old until I was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where I went from completely flat chested to 32DD in the span of a single summer. So, my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a child's body to being accused of "getting implants" and further ridiculed the rest of my school life. Because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls, the administration did nothing to stop it, even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school. It's worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew, so I wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them. However, those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym.

The worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault. Four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts, to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days. It was some weird test to see if they were real or implants.

I was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and, to be completely honest, the abuse I suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that. In a way, it was even worse because there was no escaping it. At least when I told my parents about the abuse from the adult, it was dealt with and I never had to see him again. With the abuse from my peers, I had to suffer for years. 

Some of you might argue "that was an especially shitty crop of girls, not every locker room experience is like that". Yeah, but a) the administration didn't believe me because it was my word against everyone else's so I had to go through this shit for SIX FUCKING YEARS despite making literally 8 different complaints. b) quite frankly, it shouldn't take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that CHILDREN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRIP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE UNNECESARRILY WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. c) if you think locker rooms abuse is rare, you are living under a rock.

Honestly, I gotta say- I genuinely don't see how anyone, besides pedophiles getting off on it, could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other.

Edit: oh lawdy thanks for all the awards!I don’t understand why people think it is appropriate to aim anti-rape media and slogans at boys or men. Especially at university campuses and colleges where it is very common to separate the boys and the girls at the start of the year for workshops against sexual assault, imagine if they separated the whites and the blacks and taught the whites how to avoid being robbed and taught the blacks the definition of theft. Or if they gave all the non muslims a ‘bomb whistle’ to blow when they think they are about to be bombed. None of this is considered ok but still we see rape as a women’s issue, rape is a societal issue regardless of who the direct victims are. NOBODY wants rape, and yet we treat men like they are rapists by default unless taught otherwise.It goes like this: 

Person 1 makes an inflammatory statement that strongly challenges another's views. Person 2 (the target of the statement) will take the bait and respond, often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked (they were, that was the point of the initial statement). Person 1, elated with themselves, smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down. Person 2 wants to respond, but if they defend themselves, person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility. If they don't reply, person 1 will claim they've won the argument.

This is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points. Nothing is gained here. No meaningful discussion is had, no views are changed. If anything, all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1's views, increasing polarisation. 

The goal should be to win over people that hold opposing views with rational argument, patience and understanding. Ridiculing doesn't work, especially not online. I personally feel like a large percentage of social media users needs to take a few deep breaths, stop focusing on 1upping each other with meaningless, toxic argument and focus on commonalities that bring us together rather than militantly pointing out differences that cause frustration and division. Wishful thinking lol.


Edit: For examples of this in action, just browse the comments


Edit: It appears in principle this view is quite popular, but in practice I see the dismissive technique I described used all the time, making it arguably popular, which is why I posted here.

Edit: Perhaps I should have used the word provoking instead of offending in the title. Agree with comments about claiming offence being used as a way to shut down meaningful discourse.Let me start by saying that I'm 17. This is coming from a place of serious concern. I'm not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because I have nothing better to do.

Everything is so unnecessarily sexualised these days. Adverts for the most banal products, music, random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them, you name it: there's a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo. It's kind of sickening.

A lot of people argue that "it's not over-sexualisation, it's sexual liberation!" That this phenomenon is taking motion because people (mostly women, whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries) are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality. And that's great! 

But we don't need it everywhere. Every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulation/release. Everything is just constantly screaming sex, sex, sex.

Now, here's where my concern comes in: if the Internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves, this onslaught of sexual content wouldn't be nearly as worrying as it is. But that's not the case. Younger, much more impressionable kids are using the Internet nowadays, and it's bleeding into the content I see from them.

Take the biggest culprit as example: TikTok. What may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother, and I couldn't say I would blame it. Kids doing sexual POVs, inappropriate dances, and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it, normalising it, and running with it. There have been countless times that I have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then I click on their page and see that they're 13, 14, 15, or 16.

That is horrifying to me. It's basically a new wave of paedophile fodder, and it's the fault of society's hypersexualisation.

I'm not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something. Of course not; everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do. But we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content, however fleetingly, and censor ourselves for their safety. I'm also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people: but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as "easy" and therefore vulnerable. That's why I'm so fucking scared for them.

Anyway, this is just an opinion. Looking forward to the "society has always been sexual" comments.Some people would say teachers are like your second parents. Children spend many, many hours of the most important stages of their lives with teachers, so without a doubt they have a huge impact on their growth.

Sure, if we're comparing them individually, one bad drug dealer can definitely hurt a single person much more than one bad teacher. Drug addiction is a pretty serious thing after all. But take into consideration that drug dealers sell to a very small percentage of the population, whereas teachers are going to impact much more people, teaching hundreds if not thousands of students throughout their entire careers. They can be the reason children end up resenting a certain subject they could have had a lot of potential in, or worse, resenting school entirely and maybe even dropping out and becoming a drug dealer.

Heck, bad teachers are a gateway drug themselves in some cases.(Title is incorrect)
 Capitalism is just legal slave labour and I never really thought about it because I was born in a privileged place and thought nothing could be done so didn’t care. 

Fuck all billionaires

🚩I find this to be complete BS. You've got the kids who work hard in school, getting great grades, straight A's, often get passed over for scholarships and entry to prestigious universities. 

Meanwhile, some idiot who can toss a ball around gets a full ride. Just because he's violent and can throw a football. Some of these kids are pretty damn daft, can barely tie there own shoes. But they're the ones who get all the full rides. While the smart kids who work hard have to take student loans and go into massive debt to get the same opportunity some numbskulled idiot who can tackle people gets for free.

Something needs to change.I'm talking about the girl, the painting itself is beautiful but man Mona Lisa is mad ugly. DaVinci literally went to his local library and picked up some random ass girl. I'm sorry but you 1600s hoes are mad ugly.How is it that I can make a simple post that any other person could make that would spark conversations yet I not only get nothing out of it (not my point) but it’s always some toxic bs that people come out with. 

I just posted on showerthoughts about how movies having crows fly on screen after a kill was reminiscent to how they’re called a “murder”. Dumb post or not what gives people the right to act like they’re so elite? Yes ok cool my post is “average” to you. Do you have to write a paragraph on how it was such a waste of time instead of continuing to scroll?

Christ people even tend to just downvote over the fact that they don’t want to talk about the topic. But all these huge posts full of comments are packed with cute convos and fun threads. It’s like the least popular side of Reddit is cursed with negativity when the biggest communities are wonderfully supportive. So I ask you redditors that think they need to go out of there way to shit on other people, what in gods name is up with you. Because I’m frankly so fucking tired of seeing y’all shit on anyone of us lesser posters just trying to find people to converse with.The sticky feeling of tables in general is very soothing to me, mainly in restaurants. It gives me the feeling that someone had such a good time before me, that they spilled their drink laughing. That's how I look at it.**UPDATE** on the situation if you care. [This](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467%3famp) article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because Taylor fans were sending death threats. The article also quotes a label exec saying: 

> Taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the AMAs. Big Machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn’t have the right to block her. Labels can’t block any artists from performing any songs live.

So take it however you will. Lots of cool and differing opinions in here and I’ve enjoyed reading them. Thanks for participating you guys 💕

(**Original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

Taylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

Example. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

Ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

Nope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Look at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.

Look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

And didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

Now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

It definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.

But she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

Taylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her "squad" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

Taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. Nah Taylor, you're the problem. The common factor in all these situations is you.

Oh and her music sucks.I'm not talking about people who just don't want kids. That's your personal preference and I respect that. It's the people who tell you constantly that they hate "nasty little crotch goblins" and feel the need to express their hatred any time a child is nearby. Or make some disgusted face when someone is holding a baby. 

You don't look cool. You look like a fucking asshole. Children are people too. And depending on age you can really mess with the way they see themselves if they hear you express how much you hate them and how disgusting you think they are. Like bro chill the fuck out. Let the kids be kids and keep your shitty opinion to yourself. Just say you don't want kids and be done with it. No need to go on and on about how much you hate them and what you think of them.

Edit: Lost my phone for a whole day and come back to this. I didn't expect such a huge response, honestly. Thanks for the rewards I guess lol

Edit: I can't respond to all these comments but I guess I should've added that I do have a couple people I deal with on a daily basis that do have this kind of attitude in real life. The post was actually me being annoyed with someone using the term "crotch goblins" in real life conversation.Here are my reasons. 

1. 95,000 people die from alcohol related causes every year in America. This is the third highest cause of death in America. 1st is tobacco, 2nd is poor diet and exercise habits. It causes more deaths than all other drugs combined. 

2. It’s one of the only drugs and by far the most mainstream that actually causes you to be violent, and is a factor in large amounts of violent crime/ domestic abuse. 

3. The life expectancy of someone hospitalized with an alcohol problem is about 50. Almost 30 years shorter than the average life expectancy in America. 

4. 28% of driving deaths in America are caused by alcohol. 

5. It’s the only drug that has withdrawals that can actually kill you. 

There are many more reasons that I have but those are statistically backed and not opinionated. It’s dangerous and absolutely terrible for you. The only positive it provides is more fun social interactions, which literally any drug used in moderation can provide, the difference being that it’s not taboo to drink a beer or 2, while it’s taboo to casually do some heroin. 

Also, who likes being hungover?

Worth noting you can make most of the same arguments for tobacco, but in my experiences tobacco is typically more frowned upon than drinking.

Edit: I understand that prohibition didn’t work. I’m not saying alcohol being illegal is feasible. I’m just saying that I don’t think it should be legal. Plenty of other drugs are illegal and people don’t throw a fit

Edit 2: Y’all are bringing up good points and counterpoints but it’s too much stuff for me to reply to. The war on drugs and prohibition are great reasons as to why this won’t work. Don’t have much of an argument there. 

I’m not totally opposed to the idea of all drugs being legal and providing medical care and safe spaces for addicts. This has worked in other places around the world but the American health system is so screwed up that it would still just fuck people over. Mainly just because it’s so for profit and unaffordable for so many people that I don’t think this would help anybody. That is an issue with medical system as a whole and not with the idea of drugs being legal. 

I’m seeing people bring up caffeine and sugar. People really need to educate themselves on the negative effects of both of those drugs. The long terms effects of those are silent killers, mainly sugar. It’s pretty unavoidable and not terrible in moderation the typical American diet has wayyyyyy too much sugar for anybody to consume healthily.

Edit 3: a point I failed to make is that alcohol is way more dangerous than other illegal drugs, mainly weed and psychedelics. I don’t smoke weed myself but there’s no denying that it causes way less harm than alcohol, both in society and to your body.

Edit 4: damn y’all are salty. But my opinion has been confirmed as unpopular.

Edit 5. Who tf submitted me for Reddit care resources?😂No I don't want to buy your crappy CD of covers now get out my way so I can shop in peace.

I swear people slowly singing pop songs in public with an acoustic guitar is this decades version of the panflute epidemic.People get passive aggressive comments when they mention their religion in the context of an opinion, but when people actively shame religious people their comments are not seen as offensive.

I'm an atheist and I understand that religion has been the cause/ catalyst for reprehensible actions. That doesn't excuse being a dick.Whether it was the 80s 90s or 00s. My bank lady has huge 80s hair and wears Madonna eyeshadow/bright ass blush everyday with no shame and I absolutely live for it. I also have a coworker that was clearly a teen in the 00s and still wears the multicolored eyebrow piercing with the thin brows and black eyeliner look. They’re like a staple in time and I’m impressed by their loyalty to their era’s.I hate people (especially Mark Wahlberg) that brag about how they get up at 4:00 am every morning. They get 8 hours of sleep like most people and therefore (theoretically) get the same amout of work done as someone who gets up 6 hours later.

During the summer I got up at 3:30 most days to workout because I wanted to avoid other people in the gym. Did I feel like I was better than everybody else who got up at a normal time? You bet it did. But in the 24-hour window I got the same amount of shit done as before and as a matter of fact wasnt special. 

&#x200B;

**Bonus**: I also hate these "entrepreneurs" or motivational speakers that say you have to get up really early to outwork your competition and claim thats how you become better than everybody else. But unless I sleep less, I wont get more shit done.I get this is controversial, but while I understand that parents need to make sure their kids are not slackers, becoming your kid's landlords once you legally can is sending the message that they aren't that welcome, that your ties to them are far more conditional than family blood would hopefully suggest, and I think in general sends a bad message. Now I agree with making your kids, once they have a job, paying part of the rent to the landlord, chip in, etc., but that's everyone in the family working together. But telling your kids to pay an amount to stay at the family home or btfo once they turn 18 as if they were some random stranger is bad parenting and a bad thing that too many families do.Edit 5: Please. Read. The. Edits.

Edit 6: Stop. Jumping. To. Conclusions. Read. The. Damn. Edits.

Look, I understand why you don't want your teens to be sexually active so young. But that's the problem, they're young and dumb. They have urges and hormones. They don't always think about all the consequences of their decisions. 

If they trust you enough to come to you and ask something like this and you turn them down because you don't want them to have sex, youre just screwing both of you. Think back to when you were a teen, if you *really* wanted to do something and your parents said "no" , were you immediatly going to accept the answer? 

Pregnancy is preventable, even more so with a doctor prescribed bc. If you deny it to her, you have no right to be angry or surprised when she tells you she's pregnant, because it could have all be prevented had you said "yes".

Edit: Stop taking this post out of context. Stop compairing it to drugs and murder. Those are extremely different situations. I think some of you all are just looking to bitch about something.🤦

Edit 2: To the people saying condoms are easy to get. Yes, youre correct. However condoms can break very easily and an inexperienced person might not realise it until too late. Yes, you should *always* use condoms but condoms + another form of bc is best. That's what I'm talking about.

Edit 3: I'm talking about *all (IUD, arm implant, ect)* forms of bc, not just pills.

Edit 4: Yes, the teens are responsible for their actions. But if a teen comes to you and asks for bc then they are trying to be responsible. Getting on bc *is responsible*, they could go out and fuck with no protection, but instead they are taking appropriate steps to prevent accidents. And if a parent denies their child that safety then it's on them too.People should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. My first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven’t done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

Edit: A couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn’t be proud of your family. That doesn’t apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. This extends to your community. What I am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

Another point I’d like to make is if you agree that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn’t be proud either. Current Mongols don’t need to feel ashamed of Ghengis Khan. I don’t think modern Germans should be held responsible for Hitler. That also means they shouldn’t get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

Edit2: Because there is some confusion, I’m not white. I actually made this post with white nationalism and Stefan Molyneux in mind. This logic should still apply to any race, gene, or whatever pre birth lottery you won/lostYou can be mad, and I can be mad, and we can just go to sleep angry. Or we can talk about it and find a resolution. But either way I’m sleeping in my bed, in MY house that I pay for. Fuck this expectation that the guy has to give up the bed or fucking *move out* indefinitely until things “settle down.” The day I’m kicked out of my own bedroom/house is the day Ben Shapiro admits gender is a social construct.

Edit: LOL to everyone saying “he’s probably never been in a relationship.” Nope, I’m happily married. Suck it you bitter, miserable, lonely peasants. 😂

Edit 2: Mega lol at the people still throwing salt and getting their comments removed before I can even respond. GG clowns. 😂😭😂I just see people using airpods or whatever other brand with those long stems sticking out of their ears and it looks so damn stupid and ugly. No offence to airpods users but thosr things look kinda dumb.

Then there are kids who have them in but aren't actually listening to anything but they're just kids so who cares but I've seen adults, full grown ass adults having them in just sitting there with them in like some sort of fashion statements when they're at clubs, or gatherings or dinners and such. Who tf puts in earphones at the dinner table with people you haven't seen in a while let alone a club or setting where theres music in the back. It's never some random brand of wireless earphones. It's always airpods. I just find it so immature and rude to be having earphones or headphones in at a gathering. 

Lastly they sound like shit. The pros are not so bad but the price negates that. The long shower head ones sound like shit and cost an arm. Plenty of good wireless earphones that actually look decent 

Edit : Airpods and the copies look ugly compared to other wireless earphones. Wired in ear earphones hardly exist now. Also I'm talking about regular airpods. The pros are not as horrible

Theres that percentage of people who use airpods as a status symbol or a hyped item like a supreme box logo t shirt that I hate.

EDIT 2 : LMAOOO to those of you mentioning the hair gel scene in there's something about Mary. I've just watched it

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mbFx0CbaIlY&ab_channel=MovieclipsI love seeing a comment piled with downvotes when they don’t delete it. It makes me respect them, even if what they originally said was what Reddit considers dumb. It embodies are refusal to comply with the status quo and societal norms. Badass. Everytime I see it I upvote it.

Edit: tHaNk YoU fOr ThE gOlD KiNd StrAnGeR!!!!!

Edit: and while I’m in hot just want to throw it out there that Reddit isn’t liberal it’s full of libertarian right wingsI’m about to turn 21 and I’m the only one in my friend group who’s still a virgin. My mom always taught me about having free will over my body. Due to me always being super aware of who made me comfortable I just never felt at ease enough to cross that boundary with any of my past relationships. It’s honestly weird when people are grossed out by the fact that I’m not interested in casual sex. 

I have a guy friend who’s celibate but his friend group bullied him, called him (gay slurs) until he caved in to the peer pressure. He wasn’t the same after that and I can tell he feels bad about breaking that promise to himself. There’s nothing wrong with sex it’s your choice. I just don’t understand why being a virgin especially as an adult or waiting is  “weird”.

Edit:: Thank you for the rewards I can die in peace. One thing..I can see some people assumed I was a guy and said comments along the lines of “you can’t get laid”. It’s honestly sad that people who feel like this are apart of the problem. You can’t preach that sex is a choice but shun people who choose not to have it. I’m a woman but I can only imagine how much pressure men must go through to have sex to uphold their masculinity. I’m really grateful for all the positive comments!!

Edit 2: I hate that I have to edit this again but woah I did not expect all the feedback. I’m trying to respond to every comment. I notice the people saying, “this isn’t an unpopular opinion” probably aren’t virgins. Having sex is GREAT, and not having it is great as well. The comments judging people or even me about what I do with my body is the PERFECT example of why my opinion is so unpopular. You’re free to have your opinion but by the comments you see there are so many people who have been nervous to open up about this topic. Be respectful.Seriously, if Kanye’s name and all the memes weren’t attached to the shoe, same Kanye nuthuggers would laugh at anyone that wore them. If you wear yeezys that tell me you have zero taste and don’t think twice about what you wear and only follow the trend like the mindless drone that you are. In the US, immediately after someone is arrested, a booking photo is taken and immediately available to the general public. These photos are available on local and state government police websites, in daily arrest tabloid newspapers (for sale in gas stations). 

Now this is before a suspect has been tried and found to be innocent or guilty. In America we are supposed to treat suspects as “innocent until proven guilty”. 

This practice only contributes to the public perception that only the guilty are arrestedI absolutely HATE summer. It is incredibly hot and sticky outside. It also makes it hard to breathe outside. Depending on where you are, there’s also a ton of pests. 
Even winter is better. It’s the holidays and lights but also snow is gorgeous. It’s nice to just bundle up when it’s cold and have some hot chocolate or coffee. I’m more inclined to leave the house in the winter time than the summer time.

It baffles me when people say “oh yeah I LOVE it when it’s hot. I love it when it’s in the 90’s.” For those of you using Celsius, it’s between 33 and 38. Like what is wrong with you???? People talk about going to the beach and then when you go the beach you also get sunburned. Nothing fun about that.

Edit: wow thanks for the gold! I did not expect this opinion to blow up like this!Every time I hear of fertility struggles online, or see posts about people going through rounds of IVF and the ensuing emotional trauma of miscarriages, It kind of disgusts me.



I also work for a major insurer and know that fertility treatments are driving up everyone else's premiums because they're considered necessary care. Sorry, but I disagree.



It's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system.
I think it's completely entitled and self-absorbed to think that somehow your miracle baby is worth more or deserves more love than any one of those infants. 



I know adoption can be hard, and that it should be made easier for the sake of children finding good homes, but you can't tell me adopting is harder than 4 rounds of IVF and multiple miscarriages. I've seen friends go through that mess and at the end they are different people.




Tldr: adoption may not be easy, but it's far better than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to perpetuate your genes.It's extremely creepy that we make kids recite the Pledge of Allegiance every single day in the USA.  The whole point is to instill a kind of nationalism and uncritical reverence for the state.  That's why it's repetitive, you have to train kids into it.  Most of the time, kids don't even understand the significance, and they are routinized into it.  It's an authoritarian ritual, which is about making kids respect the government and internalize a rosy national narrative that erases all the horrible things it has done (imperialism, slavery, genocide).  The Pledge of Allegiance needs to go.It gives me a brief look into someone’s day and I just think it’s cool to hear what different people like to listen to. I was on a drive with the windows down today and heard so many songs playing at once, it gave me intense La La Land intro vibes and I just really loved it. 

I especially love matches you wouldn’t expect, like an older woman listening to rap or a cool looking youngin playing some classical or instrumental music. 

I dunno, I think it’s nice and I like to observe and appreciate little bits of people’s everyday lives.I've been trying to post for a while now, but every time I submit something, the bot calls my post "low quality". Every. Fucking. Post. I'm pretty sick of this stupid website, and it's so much easier to lurk than it is to post / create content just for it to be taken down. I'm not sure, maybe I'm just an idiot, but I'm beginning to think that Reddit is only for a certain mind of people that just don't think like me.

If you gave me gold or silver, please donate to a charity, not to this fucking website.

My name is Kevin. I wake up at exactly 7:00 each day in the direct center of my bed. I put my milk in the microwave for 7 seconds - exactly like the number of the hour I wake up at each day. I wash my hands for 21 seconds - for good luck, because the CDC says only 20 seconds are necessary. When I go onto my favorite website, https://www.reddit.com, I IMMEDIATELY look at all the rules, regulations, and stipulations that are asked of me. It is important to be a rule-following member of the community to promote safety while online. 

/s fuck off with this already.



Shameless promotion of other people's tools: check out www.reveddit.com/ made by /u/rhaksw. Cool tool for reviewing removed content on reddit.I have always slept in jeans and a t-shirt. Whenever it's cold I'll wear a jacket too. If it's hot I just shower in the morning. I have tried pjs but I didn't like them, nor do I even like sleeping in shorts or boxers. Jeans are the way to go.

Edit: answering some common questions. I shower once every other day and that is also when I change jeans. I wash my sheets whenever I can washing clothes is pretty expensive. No I do not have special sleep jeans. Also I do not wear skinny jeans because I'm not an animal.In my few years on Reddit, I can't begin to count the times I've seen posts where men say how rarely they get complimented and how much they like it.  They write how much their self-esteem suffers because they never get complimented on their physical appearance. It's either bluntly stated or at least implied that women are lucky because we get complimented more.

Here's the thing though, at least my my own personal experiences and that of my female friends and coworkers over the years:  Women usually prefer compliments from other women more than ones from men (unless of course they already have a relationship with that man).  When a man compliments you, you don't know if he did so with any expectations.  It can awkward as F if a male coworker says you look good, and can sometimes make all future interactions with them uncomfortable.  Maybe this is unfair, but every woman I know well enough to have serious talks with has had experiences where they or someone they know had compliments turn into harassment.  When female coworkers compliment each other though, the (presumed) lack of any romantic subtext makes it much friendlier and positive.  And since we like getting compliments from women, we therefore compliment other women.  If my husband and I go over to a friend's house, I'll tell her that her hair looks amazing.  When a coworker comes to work in a new dress, I'll tell her it looks great on her.  And no, I'm not going to compliment a male coworker in the same way.  I might say "I like that colour" or "New suit?  It's nice!" or something similar to the guys I'm friends with, but that's about it.  It's not my or any other random woman's responsibility to compliment you just because you need it to boost your self esteem.

If you think men don't get enough compliments, start complimenting other guys.  Maybe it will start a culture shift in your environment that results in you getting the compliments you want.  If you think that it would be awkward, then you're acknowledging that compliments to or from people of the opposite gender have romantic or sexual subtexts- why else would you find it awkward to tell a male coworker he looks great in a certain outfit or with a certain haircut?

ETA- first of all, thanks so much for all the awards!  

2- For the guys who say they already do this- that's awesome and I hope I don't come across as condescending!

3- For the ones who say they can't do this without being seen as gay, well, a) that's not an insult, and b) the guys in point 2 prove that it's not always true.

&#x200B;There’s nothing more annoying than to ask a genuine question and be met with replies stating to ‘mind your business’ or to ‘stop being so judgemental and rude’.

At university, I learned to ask diverse questions and share what I know to help in the search for truth. However, the Karens and Chads of the internet always dump on you, pick on your question or be outright rude because they know oh so much better than you do.

Why is asking a question such a fucking challenge these days?

Edit: I would like to change ‘the uneducated’ to ‘narrow-minded people’.Now this isn’t saying that every time your boyfriend see’s another guy talking to you he has the right to be upset, this isn’t condoning abusive and controlling relationships by a long mark. There are certain situations where the other guy could be a longtime friend, or be with another person, or just have no interest in that sense, and it doesn’t mean that being overly jealous is a healthy behavior. What it is about is if a guy suddenly comes into the girls life and is very flirty, always demeans the boyfriend on the littlest things in hopes to cause a fight, and is overly nice and affectionate to the point it’s weird and if it’s at that point that “friend” is not trying to just be friends. There’s a difference between “Hey I hope you’re having a good day” and “Hey cutie how’s it going you wanna hangout at my place?” Most guys think alike and we can see when a guy is obviously trying to shoot his shot. If you’re letting someone talk to you like that and just let them proceed while your significant other has stated they don’t feel comfortable with they talk to you, you’re the one causing the problem and being toxic. Just respect your significant others feelings and emotions by understanding their point of view and tell that person they can’t flirt with you like that. My ex always had guy friends acting like this and she always insisted they didn’t like her that way, and unsurprisingly the week we broke up they all confessed their feelings for her and that they’ve liked her all along. As much as it sucks to say many guys are vultures at the chance of getting laid when the opportunity arises.it's rather frustrating being blithely told 'they're friendly' as if taking the precaution is an insult to them and their pet. i have no problem with people letting their dogs off for a run - do it often myself - but when you see someone approaching with theirs on a lead/ your own dog approaching them, at least make an effort to gain control of your pet. don't just assume every dog is as sociable as your own or that its behaviour towards you is completely indicative of its potential reaction to unfamiliar people/animals.I say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems. 

He's under no obligation to be your friend just like you're under no obligation to date him. This also applies to men who friendzone their female friends.I love watching movies, especially with friends. We go out and enjoy new movies and talk about stuff and just overall have a great time, but over the last few years I have been thinking about what movies were the most memorable to me. 

(Potential Spoilers Ahead) Some of the movies I found most memorable are movies like No Country For Old Men, Avengers Infinity War, Se7en, Fight Club, Hannibal etc etc. These movies are all super memorable to me not only because they're good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end. Now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything, I just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it. When I watch an action thriller I want to really worry for the heroes, I want to be attached to them and sit at the edge of my seat because I'm not really sure if they will actually make it out alive.

 I find myself getting invested much much more often when uncertainty is part of the movie. I want to worry. I want my heart to race. I want to cry. I want to get mad. I believe that if a movie is capable of making you feel true emotion, it succeeded in what it set out to do. If you cry at the end of a movie you were most certainly invested in the story, and right now I feel like many studios are just too afraid to break the mold in that way. I can understand, I mean money is on the line and lots of it at that. It is definitely a gamble to try to ignore the standard movie structure because many people are so used to it that if a movie doesn't follow that structure, it can feel off or confusing to the viewers, but those movies that do successfully break free of it are often very very memorable because of it.

TLDR: Movies that break the mold and try something unique adds uncertainty to the movie. That uncertainty causes the viewer to become invested in the movie as they never truly know what could happen in the end. If you think the protagonist truly could die or lose, you feel the same emotions they do, and if a movie is able to get you to feel emotion it definitely succeeded in my opinion.Getting into your bed to lay all over the sheets and soak in your sweat and oils from the day is gross. You should be showering at the end of the day to get all the dirt and stuff off your body from being out and about.Movies, shows and books are created at a certain time and place that cannot be changed. So calling them "problematic" is like looking at a picture of yourself when you were young and saying how bad your clothes look by today's standards, when at the time you were "stylish". People calling something problematic is just virtue signaling. I think many older pieces of media are racist, homphobic or misogynistic, but they can't be changed and they can't be held to today's standards.So many people associate rain with sadness yet all I associate it with is excitement and happiness. I love the way everything cools off, I love that I don’t constantly have to squint cause the sun is in my eyes, I love the smell, and I love the colors, they’re so much easier on the eyes. A rainy day is such a special day to me, seems like the perfect type of day for an adventure. I love to go out in the rain and walk around, maybe have lunch, go see a movie, or go hiking.I absolutely hate jeans, every thing about them, they’re uncomfortable, impossible to find the correct size, stiff, too long, too short. Just, everything about them, the material is uncomfortable too.
#I
##Hate
#JeansI've been married to my wife for 16 years. We've had 3 children together and we (she) homeschools them. We both are on our first marriage. 

Putting your spouse before your children, as a natural byproduct, enhances your children's lives and enhances the lives of the married couple. 

The married couple has a better relationship, thereby every aspect of their lives, that are in their control, is bettered. 

The children's lives are bettered by having a better example of what a healthy relationship looks like and living in a more stable and loving home.

The statistics don't lie. Complete nuclear families are basically a cheat code for success in growing children and on into the rest of their lives.

Love your kids more by loving your spouse first.

Edit: wow my first awards on reddit. Thanks! I just wanted to share this in hopes that it would help someone out there in their marriage. There's too many negative feelings out there and we can start with the person you love across from you in your own home.Sour Cream and onion chips have a light, smooth, creamy yet slightly sour and tangy taste to them that makes them irresistible.

Barbecue chips, on the other hand, have a disgusting flavor that is hard to explain. They are either too spicy or less spicy, and more often than not they have this charred texture to them that make me feel like I'm eating burned chicken. At least not as bad as vinegar though.This is just something that has puzzled me for a while. I'm Asian-American. Growing up as a kid, I watched and enjoyed plenty of movies and entertainment that featured main characters that were not my race. I don't remember once thinking "well, I wish I could be invested in and inspired by Luke Skywalker/Harry Potter/Elliot in ET/Spiderman, but well dang he's a different color, so I guess I can't." I didn't see differing race as an obstacle to me engaging or empathizing with a character. When I watch Finn in Star Wars 7, I don't feel like I am inherently less invested in his character because he's not Asian. Yet we act like kids of a specific race are just starved for applicable entertainment with no fictional characters to look up to until there's some Marvel movie with an Asian superhero, or whatever. And we act like this is not only normal, but healthy? I don't know. Doubt many will agree, but that's what the sub is for, right?The posts I see on here every day are fucking horrible. 

Grown ass people writing everything in one long, unreadable sentence. Don't ever use a comma or make paragraphs.

You can make mistakes. Especially if it's not your native language, but for the sake of the reader at least try to make it *readable*.

Not to mention that it makes you look like you've never opened a book in your entire life, else you'd know that walls of text are not only uncommon, but actively disuade people from reading what you wrote.

Edit. : There are already over a hundred posts saying that nobody cares... I guess that's why we're here, at r/unpopularopinion.

Edit 2. : "You can make mistakes. Especially if it's not your native language, but for the sake of the reader at least try to make it *readable*."

If you think making something "readable" is an extreme ask, then I'm sorry for you. 

I also never claimed that nobody can make mistakes. Heck I even wrote that everyone makes them. Thanks to some nice redditors here I had my own mistakes pointed out, which I'm happy for. 

It appears many of you take it really personal and get aggressive or defensive. If you're that fragile, the internet and especially reddit is not for you.

Edit 3.: You know you've got yourself an unpopular opinion when more than half the commenters are here to insult you... I love it. Do your thing reddit! Sticks and stones my friends. Sticks and stones.

Edit 4. : Some of you here seem to imply that I hate people for not writing the way I deem fit. I don't hate strangers for not writing coherently. It's a fragment of sadness, that they don't deem their own thoughts and opinions important enough, to put them into words properly, so they can be understood to the best of our abilities. People don't *have* time, they *take* time to do things. 

If your thoughts are not worth your own time to write them down properly, why would they be worth anyone else's time to read?edit: thank you so much for this amount of interest in my post. I genuinely appreciate it. But it speaks volumes on how you only appreciate the posts you agree with.  This isn't the point. I have posted some real unpopular opinions here and it died in new while 4-5 comments insulting me and my opinion. Also, this subject has been posted many times before on this sub. Even though I didn't know it while I was posting this entry, this opinion is really really popular. And you guys made it trend regardless. This sub really needs a reform .

also, for the geniuses who tell me to get a chrome add-on or google things with "-pinterest" every 5 minutes, there are 50 comments about it already. And I don't want to work around Google's algorithm mistakes(?). It genuinely needs to be fixed at this point

end of edit, below is the original post:

lm literally sick and tired of it. I google a thing, proceed to look at images, click on it for better resolution, boom! it's a low res pinterest post that doesn't even let me see the full of it if I dont sign up.

I google a text for it's full context, google matches me 10+ pinterest posts about it. I can't even see the whole article.

pinterest is a shit social media platform that wastes a bunch of time of my life every day. We must stop this hate crimeI understand many kids are fussy eaters and the last thing you want to do is argue with them in public. 

But there’s plenty of options on the main menu and  it’s hard to get them to try other food when nuggets and fries or pizza are always on the menu.I feel we already have enough population. And it's not doing any good! Like lets be practical here. More than 70% of the world is struggling to meet their basic needs. 

I'm sure Our DNA is not that amazing that we need to preserve and pass on from generation to generation. It's not like if you don't pass on your genetics, world will loose something valuable. (grammar)

Not reproducing but adopting can bring a huge change in this world! 

Edit1: well this went out of proportion. Rip my inbox. 

Some clarification about my opinion. No I am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

Geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. And now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. So stop saying, hey I'm from Norway and I don't want to adopt an African child. Your country have zero orphanage?
It's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from African countries.

No I'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
I'm pro "can't feed em, don't breed em"! 
But if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man! 

Edit 2: Getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted. 
You guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. But a lot of them are positive as well. We can always look on the brighter side. Love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.
Keep them stories coming, I'll reply to everyone of you!



Every time I see a post with a dog or any animal really you always see the comment with a couple thousand upvotes saying how much animals are great and humans ruin the earth or some bs. I think people who treat animals like gods are just people with no social skills and blame others for hating them so they resort to things who cant talk and love you just because you feed them.I’ve traveled everywhere. The UK, Germany, France, India, Bangladesh, about half of the US (including California, Las Vegas, New York, Minneapolis, Tennessee, Hawaii, you get the idea) 

Not once have I ever felt “yeah, I’m experiencing something I couldn’t back at home”

When you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

I’ve hiked on mountains, I’ve swam in oceans, Ive been on the London eye, I’ve run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have I felt “yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away”

And I’m not some anti social weirdo, I go out of my way to interact with other people. Nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. Yeah sure there are differences, but they aren’t interesting. A quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major “””””””””culture shocks””””””””””” anyway. 

You wanna know my favorite part of traveling? The fucking trip. The plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. Unironically this is my favorite part because I get to fucking sleep

Whenever someone says they love traveling I immediately think they either haven’t traveled much or they are just so god damn boring they find entertainment by fucking moving the ground under their feetIt's disgusting that children, who need sleep the most out of anyone, are required to wake up at such ridiculous hours for school. Often times they have to get up even earlier then they would for a job. Do we seriously think this is good for a child's development or that this will set them up for success?Its so true that history is written by the winners. If germany was won by hitler, they would treat holocaust EXACTLY the same as how people treat native american killing now

 It bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as "good" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

Seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in "reserves" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land? 

People say japanese are adamant about not apologizing for what happened in wwii; what about americans to native americans?

People say there arent many female millonaires/leaders. What about native americans?

People say there are lack of black lead movies. What about native americans?

People say slavery was bad. They admit it because black people have voice in todays society. What about massive genocide native americans went through? You didnt even have a chance to work, you just fucking died.

I feel like native america  genocide is getting wayyyyyyyyyy to less of an aknowledgement for what happened, and its because noone cares to represent the native americans. 
You can get an amazing body naturally. But you can't do it in 6 months. These actors going on talk shows saying they gained 25 pounds in 5 months by eating chicken rice and broccoli sets unbelievably unrealistic expectations. People hear this and think they can do it too, and when they gain about 6 pounds of muscle in 5 months they get discouraged and give up. The open secret of steroid use in the film industry is turning people away from fitness and setting unachievable standards.

EDIT: There seem to be a lot of comments stating this is possible with personal chefs and trainers. It isn’t. This is the lie Hollywood has decided to offer up to the public about why they can’t get their results. They can’t exactly say they took steroids can they? Maximizing muscle growth takes a lot less than you might think. About an hour a day of focused lifting and eating in a slight surplus. They feed us this lie though because most of us can’t afford trainers and chefs, so it’s somewhat believable.

EDIT 2: There’s some people commenting on here about how they know someone or they personally have gained this much muscle in this time frame. No, you haven’t. Getting shredded and gaining lean muscle tissue are very different things. It’s definitely possible to lose lots of weight in a short time.

EDIT 3: Guys thank you so much for my first gold. Definitely did not expect this post to blow up like it did. Love you all <3I just got 3 hard tacos instead of the soft that I ordered and I’m not driving back to fix it but I am increasingly bothered by each bite. Why do people choose this for themselves??

Think about it, plebs. 

No average human can fit a full hard taco shell into their mouths, which mean close to half the bites are just chips and toppings- not to mention that’s only IF you get at least halfway through the taco without it crumbling into a sad Mexican shame salad in the wrapper. Am I supposed to funnel into my mouth like a freaking savage? Or do I get up off the couch(which I was too lazy to leave to get the dang tacos in the first place) to get a bowl or plate to hold  so I can eat it like nachos without embarrassing myself or spilling it. At least with a soft taco I have a CHANCE to get an equal amount of fillings in one bite. 

Why? 
Just why? 



JUST WHY?!

Edit: some things to mention:
1- I see you haters saying it’s not an unpopular opinion but I read you, and you’re wrong.
2- as much as I would love to hand form a hard tortilla, wrap it in a soft taco, toast the shells in the oven, or otherwise doctor this taco, I’m exhausted as HELL and that’s why I ordered freaking Taco Bell in the first place. Don’t gutter palette shame me, guys- a bitch is tired and nothing good is close or open

3- it’s unreal the amount of people that think I’m just a messy eater. If I was a messy eater, then the fact that the tacos make a mess wouldn’t bother me- instead it’s really hard to eat messy food holding a baby, which is how I eat 90% of my meals.I’ve read that in early hunter-gatherer civilizations, people would work & sleep in shifts. Some were awake during the day, some at night, and some in between. This was to ensure the safety of the group, and likely to maximize productivity as well. This seems to be why humans have evolved to be either “morning larks” or “night owls”. 

Since these traits still exist in humans, our societies should reflect this. Many people I know are total night owls, and find it very difficult to get out of bed & function at the hours that society demands. Yet they are full of creativity, energy & drive at night, firing on all cylinders & getting some fantastic work done. I believe that if society were to operate in shifts, many of these types of people would choose to work at night & sleep in during the day. There are some jobs that offer night shifts but there are not many, and there are basically no options for dining/shopping/activities/etc late at night. 

If this system was put into place, of course it wouldn’t be binding. You would be allowed to switch between working during the day or during the night, or somewhere in between, you’d just have to work it out with your employer. I believe this would also lower the crime rate, as those who choose to commit crimes in the nearly empty & quiet streets of nighttime would find it a lot harder to go unnoticed. 

I’ve considered the potential costs of businesses staying open 24/7, and while I haven’t really calculated the specifics on this one yet (someone smarter than me can chime in on this in the comments) I think it could work. Not every business would be obligated to stay open 24/7, but I believe that employers will be able to find many night-inclined people who would choose to work odd hours if given the option over waking up at the ass crack of dawn. There could be “day divisions” and “night divisions” of companies, which would be able to work parallel to each other & collaborate through meetings at in-between times that can work for all. 

There are other interpersonal factors that I haven’t quite worked out (what if a day person falls in love with a night person? What about schools, should they offer this option too? What would this do to families?) because honestly this is just a hypothetical system I thought of while moaning about how I really really don’t want to wake up early tomorrow. But I do see many potential benefits if all the details are ironed out correctly. Again, if anyone smarter than me is reading this and wants to give their take on this system’s economic/interpersonal/political impacts, I’d love to hear it.

Maybe the nighttime world wouldn’t be quite as active as the daytime one, but it would be a lot more active than it is now. And maybe, through giving people the chance to work & live in a way that is best suited for their individual biology, societies will be able to increase productivity as well as overall quality of life.

Edit: thank you all for these awards, especially my first platinum! Didn’t expect this post to gain this much traction or support. Happy to see it’s resonating with y’all. Your support is definitely making this early morning easier for my night owl heart :)Although I have personally never ranted online, I have said that exact line to many people dealing with problems and really horrible things that they don't deserve, and to be honest, if I put it in their perspective, it wouldn't mean THAT much to me because my life will remain the same, but now I acknowledge someone online feels bad for me. I know I'm thinking negatively but this is just an opinion I've had for a while.

Edit: grammarCan we all just accept the fact that climate change is real? It’s not about which political side you are on, it’s about the real scientific data that shows it is real and is currently affecting us. Look at the extreme weather stories lately, from the huge fires in california and Australia,  or the massive typhoon that just went through the Philippines. You don’t have to be Left or Right to see it. It’s a huge problem that needs to be fixed by all of us.

Edit: As many people have pointed out, I guess I should have put *partisan* thing instead of political thing. Politics are needed to decide further steps into climate change, it’s just that there are strong opinions holding us back from that now. I apologize for any confusions and thank everyone for pointing this out.

Also, the thread of comments below has turned into a shitstorm of political debates, which is exactly what my post is saying needs to stop happening. If you are going to go down there and argue your opinion, I first ask you to please not. This was supposed to be an unpopular opinion, not a political battle. But if you are going down there to fight, good luck soldier, may the power of the earth be with you :/Nothing more annoying than opening a Youtube video about a topic and the Youtuber spends the first five minutes profusely apologizing for an upload schedule I don't even pay attention to.

Just fulfill the expectation you created with the title and thumbnail - I don't give a shit about anything else.I hate seeing this everywhere. So called snitching being talked about like it's morally wrong when in reality its the only way to get justice and keep people safe. People covering up for murders, corruption, abuse etc, its disgusting, yet claiming the police and authorities are slow to act when you want them to help you. Smh.

Edit: apparently you all need clarification, by communities i mean groups, be they socioeconomic communities, political parties, police etc. This is not targeted at one specific group.In Australia, feral cats are cats that have been introduced to the ecosystem by humans. They're not domesticated so they breed and eat in the wild. Because they're also not native to the ecosystem, they're decimating native animals, especially marsupials and bird species. Feral cats are even bringing some native animals to extinction. That's the main reason why Aussies hunt and kill them.

As awful as it is to kill a cat (and it's awful), protecting the native ecosystem takes highest priority and without a stable ecosystem there can be no wildlife in Australia. Period.Some movies are really bad but have genius premises. unfortunately those premises have been wasted since the movie turned out to be boring and everyone forgot about it.   
An example I recently thought of was "Vanishing on seventh street". A movie that I think has a genius premise (you die unless you are in light areas and days get shorter until all light vanishes). But the plot turned out to be really average horror stuff.   
There are other bad movies with great premises. It would make much more sense to remake them but hire better writers and directors.   
The good ones already have used all their potential and no one really needs a new version of them. It's mostly just milking what already worked instead of doing something original.A lot of people I've talked to think, that they are owed by their children for raising them. Most folks don't even raise their children well, yet they expect the children to pay them back for all the trouble they had with them(?!). For pity's sake it was your choice to have children! If you consider that choice as an investment into YOUR future, just don't have children because you are obviously a trashbag of a person for thinking that way. And even if the child was an "accident", it's not their goddamn mistake, it's YOURS! There is a ton of things you can do to prevent it. Even an abortion is a 100 times better solution than raising someone just to make them feel miserable.For those who don’t know: she went after a 13 year old for saying “guacamole n**ga penis” and doxxed him and his family, ~~leading to his apparent expulsion from school and his parents getting fired.~~. <- apparently the expulsion and firings were just rumors and aren’t true, which is good. And she doxxed the wrong person too. Sorry for the misinformation there


This is why racism isn’t getting solved. People keep on doing meaningless things that end up harming others instead of actually changing the system. Protesting the racism of the US will change things, going after people for something they said that means nothing isn’t doing anything at all. Stop acting like you’re saving the world by attacking people for joking around, it is ridiculous and gets us nowhereYou just have to go in crescent order, first you write the day, then you write the month and finally you write the year. Why swap the day and month, it makes no sense. I guess you guys pronounce it like that in English but this should be a universal way to write dates, not one that is specific to English, and putting the day first just makes way more sense.

So today's date, October 8th 2021 should be written as 08/10/2021, not 10/08/2021 cuz that would be 10th of August.

Edit: fun fact, I was born on 9th November 2001 and that confuses Americans a lot cause I write it as 9/11/2001. *"Your mom sure does remember where she was that day huh?" "lol why"*

Edit 2: Canadian people keep saying yyyy/mm/dd is even better cause you can continue it and specify the time, and how could I disagree.

Edit3: American people keep saying "yOu sHouLd wRiTe iT hOw yOu pRoNoUnCe iT" guys I get you pronounce it that way but NOBODY ELSE DOES. That's something very specific to English, for example I'm from Italy and we simply say "Eight October 2021". Idk if other languages put the month first too, but it doesn't matter, what I'm saying is that if this is a universal way to write dates we should decide an order for the three numbers that is independent from the language you're using to read em, and the ones that make more sense are crescent order (dd/mm/yyyy) and decrescent order (yyyy/mm/dd).

EDIT: NO I DO NOT WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. This is something that happened 4 years ago and has happened to several other people I know as well. I simply hate it.

Additional edit: a lot of people keep saying this isn’t an unpopular opinion... that’s genuinely baffling to me. Almost everyone in my life has said it’s the price somebody should have to pay for trying to take away their own life. Kind of with this “you made the mess, now clean it up” attitude. 


Somebody is so willing to die, they are genuinely  that miserable and psychologically tormented in their lives that they will attempt to harm themselves to the point that it will kill them, and not only do they have to stay alive and spend 3 days locked in a ward with other people with varying degrees of mental illness (some get violent).... they have to fucking pay for it!?!? This person has to pay these absolutely insane medical bills on top of continuing to pay to support themselves, a person who didn’t even want to be alive. That’s disgusting to me. That’s so fucking disgusting. After finally telling themselves, “my life isn’t worth living, I’m in agony. I can’t take this anymore.”, saying their final goodbye to the world, they now have to wake up in a hospital to find that their attempt failed and they have to continue living in agony, stay there against their will for hours, told they’re going to be sent to the psychiatric ward, have a police officer sitting at their bedside, get sent to this absolutely atrocious little box of a ward with people who are screaming, backing them into corners and trying to hit them, STAY THERE FOR 3 FUCKING DAYS, only to find when they get home that they’re being billed +$10,000 for the ambulance ride alone. Yeah, that’s a great way to make somebody not want to kill themselves, put them through hell and stick them with a huge bill that makes them feel even more like they’re stuck in a massive pit. That garbage doesn’t stop people from killing themselves, it makes them look for other ways to do it later where they won’t get caught. The experience in and of itself makes you worlds more suicidal than you’ve ever been in your life.It doesn’t even taste like bacon at all! I’ve had bacon ritz crackers, and bacon cheez its. And MULTIPLES of other things. It just doesn’t taste right. It tastes terrible.Just basic stuff like sewing, how to properly and safely install shelves and furniture, fixing basic plumbing issues, how to safely use power tools and regular tools, and most of all, how to troubleshoot problems. It's so often that people I know have an object or item break and instead of trying to determine themselves what broke it and how they could go about fixing it up, they just see the item as worthless and will just buy a new one despite a fix being criminally simple. 

We should be taught to use our own intuition and plan out repairing things. It genuinely makes me feel confident and proud whenever I can fix something up, even if it's a simple task. We should also be taught when it's time to call in a professional. 

I know some of the things I've described were most likely in home ed classes way back, but nowadays at least at my high school in Canada, it's been split into food and nutrition and healthcare. There's also obviously much more that should be taught, I only gave a few examples.If the sex is bad, if your kinks don’t match up, if you don’t connect during it, if your not finishing, your relationship won’t last long. I think sex is a big reason why people feel insecure in a relationship, if you’re not getting taken care of in the bedroom that carries over into daily life.I’m seeing it more and more. Support your local business.  Women owned.  I could care less. The only thing that matters if you give good business and have a good product!  A local business ain’t a shit if the owners are pricks. A women owned business ain’t good if their cookies crumble!  The only thing that’s going to bring me back is if your friendly, give good service, and killing it with whatever you provide.Just to be clear, I'm a gun owner and a veteran. I also have an AR. I am not against responsible ownership of firearms. I am against stupid losers who use them as adornments.

Edit: Wow, this post just keeps on going. For those of you who commented that this wasn't an unpopular opinion and belongs elsewhere, my inbox would seem to disagree. There is apparently a very small, but vocal group who think that anything less than issuing an FA firearm to everyone upon birth is an affront to their human rights.

I found the 'gun grabber' accusations particularly hilarious. Under the right circumstances, guns can be fun, and cool, and useful. However, they are **always** potentially dangerous- there's no separating the two. There are some places they do not belong. Bringing a gun to a highly unpredictable and volatile situation like a protest, without an extremely good reason, would make me question anyone's judgement. Note: 'Because I want to' is not a good reason. 

Also, for those of you trying to get my goat by implying that I'm somehow not a veteran, you've failed miserably. Even if I cared enough to post a certified copy of my DD214, it wouldn't change my opinion, and arguing with random internet guy about my credentials is a truly fruitless endeavor.

&#x200B;It’s just one day for Christ’s sake. I am absolutely peeved when I see people come to work and their cubicle is decorated with decor from Walmart and a bag of Swedish fish, it’s their birthday! Whoooo.. now get back to work and slave away….. NAH. Fuck that. Let them have the day off and enjoy time away from work! Let them enjoy their time with family, friends, video games, ANYTHING other than work. 

I often hear people say “it’s my birthday tomorrow!! But I have to work” or someone asks “hey what are you doing for your birthday!?” They respond “oh I’m not sure yet, just work” 

Let’s help people have the magic of their birthdays back.


Edit: how the fuck did this blow upI live in the UK and when we have hot weather, it’s horrible. Spend the whole day trying to cool down, buy a thousand fans, cold baths and sleeping fucking terrible. Being on holiday; hot weather is better, you can jump in the sea or the pool and be cool for the rest of the day.No matter how busy it uninterested you are, learning to cook should be one of the skills that every functioning adult should have. It's not too difficult if you commit to it. Cooking isn't just for people with family or the women in the household, but very universal. Not only does it give you control over what you put in your food and reduce expenditure, it's fun and empowering.

EDIT: Judging by the response, this doesn't seem like an unpopular opinion. But at least a quarter of American adults don't know how to cook and I think it's a important skill everyone should have.Imagine.

Capes. Once restricted solely to those of royal lineage, and supernatural beings (or of course your rare rich guy),should  become the fashion accessory of 2020. Although capes are not A) readily accessible in a variety of styles and colors and B) Socially acceptable to wear any time other than Halloween, we should make them happen.

Capes are not only a way to keep warm in the dead of winter, but also they make you feel truly badass. Also capes can be considered casual OR  formal. We can have sheer capes for summer and spring, wool and velvet for fall and winter. Capes can spread to each and every corner of the globe. I mean, you could have one for every outfit. Different patterns, colors, shapes, sizes etc.

Edit: Since everyone seems pretty on board... [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCapeRevolution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCapeRevolution/) lets do this shitThere’s this idea that everytime someone asks a question about anything they expect some form of answer. 

I think there’s 2 reasons: 

1. The world today let’s people have an opinion on anything whether they know about the subject or not. While there’s a ton of information it’s all watered down and bias for the most part. Even when talking to people it’s not their opinion it’s them regurgitating an opinion someone else has

2. When you don’t have an opinion it’s seen as a negative thing as if you don’t care about what’s happening in the world or you’re stupid or something.

One of the most underrated skills is knowing when to shut up especially for us USA-ers. It’s perfect to tell someone I’m not educated in the subject or even idgaf!A plain solid colored shirt is aesthetically pleasing. It makes you look clean and nice and usually you can find them made well. Some logos can pass if they aren’t too out there but most of the time a shirt looks a lot worse when branded or with a graphic design. In my opinion a solid color looks so much better on any person than some of the ridiculous looking branded/graphic design shirts people find to wear. The only good exception is collegiate wear.

Edit: If you are offended by the fact I used the word superior, go dry your tears with your inferior shirts.I work as a CNC machinist, I make a decent good living and love what I do. I have had people tell me that I can do better and make more money but I don't want those high paying careers cause I wouldn't be happy doing it and it's way to stressful for me. Why can't people just accept that not everyone is going to want those types of careers but they can be still earn a good living doing what they want to do. Why is it if you aren't a doctor or engineer you aren't considered 
"successful". Side note I'm a female CNC machinistThe current system is awful for any kind of non-hivemind discussions, as having a different opinion to the majority of users hides your post in "controversial" and slaps "0 votes" on it. It's ridiciolous, such thing should not take place in such a diverse site as reddit, people should see if people actually agree with them and they are just the minority, instead of being bombed to oblivion with downvotes, basically hiding their comment. Such a mechanic would also allow to sort by "most upvoted" and "most downvoted" not making people feel like they just stepped on a land mine by making a unpopular comment. The current system is basically a supression tool to hide any unpopular content only to please the masses.It’s literally so easy, the standards have dropped because of how bad other dudes have been fucking up. Think about it: At this point women just want someone that isn’t 1.)A man child 2.)Clean 3.)In a somewhat decent shape (and not even all of them want that!). In college I heard so many horror stories about Nice Guys. If you can’t be better than thinking someone owes you a relationship because you had basic human decency, then you really shouldn’t be in a relationship anyway.

Have a job, have a personality and your own interest, have a goal, have a spine, and you’ll have an easy time. Also dating apps are trash just go talk to her.

Also, uninstall Instagram. A lot of guys I know struggling to find a relationship are the same dudes spending all their free time scroll through Photoshopped Instagram models and expecting all women to look like that. Dumb dumbs, those women’s entire livelihood depends on how they look. Are you putting in that same degree of effort into how you look? We both know the answer.

Edit: There is a grammatical error. Do be clean and be in shape (or not, dad bods are in.) Do be willing to acknowledge your mistakes.

Edit: A lot of you guys have defeatist minds sets, you’ll find any reason why you’re alone and perpetuate it in your every action and you won’t even know it. Yes if you are on the Spectrum this post does nothing for you, it will be more difficult for you. And I will concede, location does matter. But for 90% of you, you just don’t understand that women are actually just men but with vaginas (sometimes, not everyone’s the same… It’s tricky you’ll understand when you’re older.)It’s gross, if you must take a photo of your child eating (which you no doubt have thousands of already), clean their damn face! Makes me almost queasy when I see parents posting these kinds of photos on social media, or sending them in to “adorable videos compilations” etc. The worst are those Facebook pages of businesses who do food or desserts, the parents will just outright post a photo of their kid with said businesses’ product mushed all over them as if it’s supposed to be enjoyable in some way. 

Newsflash - it isn’t.A lot of people like to say that they could never racist if they lived 100 years ago, and that is almost certainly not true. The vast majority of people are products of their environments, and they might be completely different people if they were born somewhere else. People are shaped by their environment in so many different ways at a such an early age that if the prevailing thought is that minorities are intellectually inferior you would probably go right along with it without even questioning it because that's how people used to be. 
      I'm not at all saying that any of this acceptable behavior but a lot of the reasons why people thought this was because really thats just how it was. There are obviously exceptions for people who really went against the norm and didn't think these things but these people were a minority. Most people causally thought these things and you would too if you grew up in the 1800s. I'm really sick of people saying that they couldn't because that's just their 21st century mindset working but if you lived 100 years ago you would be just like everyone else.

Edit: Perhaps some of my points are being overlooked so I'll try to be more clear

1. Obviously if you're not white then this does not apply to you as much. If you're black and born in 1820 you aren't really in the same boat (poor choice of words I know) than a white male

2. I am NOT condoning the behavior of the people who lived then and had their own way of thinking. Racism and other forms of intolerance are not acceptable my point is that I might have thought just like them if I was white and living 100+ years ago. 

3. Yes I am American and most of my knowledge and my post stems from that. Non Americans of reddit if things apply to you differently then it may be true but I cannot argue upon something in which I have no legs upon. 

4. To all those who have given examples as to how they broke away from the social norms of their homes maybe you are the few exceptions but at the same time there are a myriad of other people who are unable to be as open minded as you were especially those who lived centuries in the past.I find it endlessly hilarious that we have a word for “suddenly chucking something as hard as you can in a random direction”. It fills me with pure joy and mirth every time I see it used. I love it so fucking much. Most slang is often treated with derision and has an expiration date, but I really hope it sticks around.Ugly people exist and usually, know they're ugly. As do average people. Fake platitudes about how certain people are "beautiful in their own special way" don't really benefit anyone. The goal should be to make it ok to be ugly, and be proud of yourself regardless, and to treat ugly people with the same kindness and respect as beautiful or average people rather than whatever it is we're currently doing, on the contrary, it's degrading, in the same way "special needs" is degrading.Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc. Allow any person in the world to have a platform to communicate with the rest of the world, something that wasn't possible last century.When I grew up, we could bring anything to school. I would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a lot, or bring nut based products to school. I did this for my entire school life. If a kid had an allergy, they dealt with it, or they didn't go to my school.

Fast forward to me being a dad and sending my kid to school, camp, daycare, etc.

No products with nuts are allowed because some kid might have an allergy. WTF? This became a thing that we were inconveniencing the majority because someone *might* have an allergy. And with nuts, the allergy levels are from nothing to almost death. If a nut is going to kill you, you definitely shouldn't be out in public because eventually, you are going to get hit with some nuts.

Then there are certain years where someone might have a specific allergy and the class teacher will send a letter home saying the kids aren't to have any of THAT product in the food they bring to school.

Some letters home over the years had: shrimp, peaches, and fish. I am sure there were a couple more, but I can't remember them. I'm not saying I would send my kid to school with shrimp or fish, but peaches? When they are in season, why wouldn't I? Or maybe she might have a fruit salad thing...nope, can't do it, the teacher will confiscate it, and call me on it, and I look like the dick.

I get accessibility and all that, but your allergies shouldn't be my problem, and do you know how hard it is to pack up a lunch for your kid (or for yourself even) when your whole life is based on foods that someone *might* be allergic to?

I remember spending HOURS of my time finding snacks for my kid to take to school that had absolutely no nuts, but was still healthy. I'm sorry, I'm not sending her with fruit rollups and other sugary shit. Nuts are actually a really healthy snack, and really kid friendly.

Finally, are you parents with kids with allergies going to pay for all the parents of the kids that have to buy alternative foods to what they normally would send their kid to school with? I doubt it, so why make YOUR problem into OUR problem?

Kids with allergies who prohibit my kid from eating what they want shouldn't go to public school.Granted, not guilty is not necessarily the same thing as innocent. But even so, if the government is bringing a case against a private citizen, they are forcing them to spend thousands in legal fees, they limit their employment options and freedom pre-trial. Those who are not guilty of a crime but put through this ordeal should be compensated accordingly. Especially those who are convicted but later exonerated.

Edit: For those who say “what about people who get off on a technicality?”, yes, they should be compensated, too. For one, there is no such thing as a “technicality”; it is called constitutional due process. And if one’s constitutional due process is violated by the government in the course of their arrest and prosecution, them walking is the price the government pays for breaking its own rules. A guilty person walking is a more preferable outcome than an innocent person being incarcerated.I see so many posts about how dumb Americans are. How all of us treated Covid recklessly, our values are nationalistic, and we have no idea how the rest of the world operates. America, by definition, has a very diverse landscape. We are essentially several countries wrapped under one federal government. We are not a one size fits all society. To approach America with a mindset of we are all the same, is irresponsible, ignorant, and lazy. Our spectrum of human beings is wide, which makes it a unique country. It’s not perfect, will never be, and has so much room for improvement. The American experiment has worked and will continue to work, even through trying times that are well document today.

Edit: SORRY, I meant the United States of America. The USA. Didn’t mean to offend our neighbors to the South.

Edit 2: Name calling is mean.

Edit 3: CA NA DA

Final Edit: It’s sad how many people personally attacked me and the US for this post. Humanity has something thinking to do IMO. So much hate; I am saddened.If dating apps are going to let you filter someone out based on something people cannot control, you should be able to filter out by things they can control such as weightCall me disgusting but hear me out, mayo has a ton of fat content and it's all just flavour. The savoury taste of mayo goes perfectly with the sweet hot chocolate. It has an added benefit of not triggering any lactose intolerances. 

For anyone wondering, the only way to make watered down mayo without it being just a bunch of globules of mayo. You have to put the mayo in a food processor and slowly add water, essentially emulsifying it with the water.

Edit: From the thousands of replies that I've gotten, I've learnt many things. 

1. There's something called Viennese Hot Chocolate which uses egg yolk in the drink to make it thick, and uses the same emulsifying technique that I use. 

2. Mayo is a common ingredient in chocolate cakes and brownies. Major names like Portillo's swear by it for their chocolate cakes. 

3. Oil is a great emulsifying agent. 

4. Acidity(mayo has vinegar) is a great addition to chocolate.

Edit 2: I can't keep up with all the recipe demands so I'm just gonna post it here. 

Nearly equal parts of mayo and water, a little less water than mayo. Water has to be hot, but not boiling hot or the mayo turns into a bunch of globules. 

You start blending the mayo in a food processor/blender and start adding the water slowly, and once you've emulsified all the water, add your preferred hot chocolate mix(mine is Cadbury). 

I've only tried it with Heinz and Kraft, someone tried it with Hellmann's but apparently it didn't turn out right. I didn't get details on how it went wrong though.I've been on Reddit with 2 different accounts. The first one, I was truly myself. I typed comments with the same tone that I speak, and it *did not* go well with any redditors at all. Even when I was just joking, or being sarcastic, or just poking fun at something, I got heavily downvoted. If I shared something personal without that tone which establishes that I'm a happy, positive, nice person, it always became content for other subs. I deleted that, went off Reddit for a while, came back.

In the last few weeks, I've acted like a redditor. When I'm posting comments in a happy go lucky, positive, 'hey look at me I'm a chill down to earth dude who's also thankful for what he has and is not braggy and is funny without trying too hard', then I'm getting upvoted like crazy. Even trivial comments which don't add much to the conversation get upvoted, so do posts which don't have any opinions whatsoever. If you're posting about a game or a tv show and you establish right from the beginning that you absolutely LOVE it, followed by a tiny critique, you get upvoted.

The minute you post your whole opinion, without *trying* to hard to be super positive and just sharing your thoughts about it, how maybe you didn't find that game or movie or tv show too good, or maybe point out the flaws or loopholes, or anything that is even remotely off the path from the general *fans* of the content, you get super downvoted.

You don't even need to post something hateful or offensive. Just disagree with the general opinion on a thread filled with only positives about something, without being rude or hateful or sarcastic, you'll be downvoted.

Redditors only love others who type in the exact manner that they want Reddit to be. They don't want this to turn into Facebook or Instagram or Tumblr, and they know how they want Reddit to be, so they force you to turn into *The perfect* redditor, who says things in a particular way, always justifies their thoughts or opinions if they want to even slightly go against the general opinion. 

Biggest example is the emoji use. If you use an emoji, just one, even though your comment makes sense 100% and is factually correct and is the best thing that anyone has every typed on the internet, you're gonna get downvoted. 

If you type about your achievement, but without the obligatory, 'I'm not much of an artist' or 'I only have been practicing for 3 weeks and I'm not really good at it, but here is my...', then you're judged as being braggy, instantly, and you'll be screenshotted and posted on other subs (hasn't happened to be, but I've seen it happen). 

All in all. Too much judgment on this app. I love the content, but I hate the unspoken "rules".It always pisses me off when I see someone mocking a foreigner speaking broken English or with a heavy accent.  I always wanna say:  motherfucker, the mere fact that they can put together enough words from one of the most difficult languages on earth to learn and be understood is borderline genius.  

So their grammar is a little off.  So they're stressing weird parts of the word.  Who cares?  How much Mandarin do *you* speak, Billy?  How's *your* Farsi sound, John?  Do you even know a single fucking word in German, Jenny?

Immigrants who speak even a little bit of broken English have already put forth more effort than your monolingual ass ever will and I respect the hell out of them.I'm a mid 30s father of 2 and work 6-7 days a week every week, starting at 0615. On my rare days off I like to sleep in until 0900 or 1000. When some people hear this I get almost mocked with things like "why do you waste your day like that?" And "sounds like someone is still trying to be in high school"  In reality I'm just tired! People should just let people sleep how ever long they like

Edit: holy shit you guys! Thanks for the awards, I was not expecting this to blow up. Just to clarify, yes my gf works and gets up with the kids....she enjoys the alone time with them so it's a win win! I also get some just daddy kids time. We feel that they need a balance of alone time with each of us in order to form a closer bond individually. And I'm saying 0900-1000 is sleeping in only in comparison to my normal 0500 alarmTinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are "height fishing" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? "You go girl!", "Girl power!", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? "Asshole!", "So misogynistic!", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200B;

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9"** 

&#x200B;

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off. 

EDIT: Thanks to u/Maito_Guy for giving me the heads up that DailyMailUK wrote an article all about this thread!I find it abhorrent that anyone would ever have to pay child support for a child that's not theirs, but I also understand that the child's needs come first and that the payments are in the child's best interest.

My proposed solution is that, once the child reaches 18, the father can provide evidence that the child is not his (usually through a DNA test) and sue the mother for all the payments he made. That way, the child still gets a fair start in life, but the burden of financing that ultimately falls on the party who lied/cheated.I’ve been to therapy. Wasn’t covered by my health insurance, didn’t help me in any way, I tried 4 different therapists before I gave the fuck up. If your kid is struggling, I commend you for attempting to get therapy for them. If you’re struggling, I commend you for seeking help. I’m not against therapy or seeing a psychiatrist in any way. But to pretend that everyone has access (financially or otherwise) to a therapist, let alone a DECENT one with life experience, is disingenuous at best. Every advice sub is just “Oh go to therapy! Everyone needs therapy!” It isn’t that fucking simple, and therapy/therapists are not always as helpful as people claim.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who gave their input and awards. This is obviously something people feel very strongly about and I appreciate reading everyone’s comments. It’s given me a lot to think about.People will hold your opinions you had earlier in life against you and if you change your mind you are a hypocrite. 

Holding something against someone that they believed in 5, 10, 20 years ago is ridiculous. 

We should be encouraging growth and healthy change in people. If you were a shitty person and you decide you want to turn your life around or change your mind, this should be celebrated-not condemned. 

Obviously this doesn’t apply to everything but most things. (i.e. if you’re a murderer I feel that you CAN change your lifestyle and the way you think, but you must always be held accountable for what you have done.)

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I expected it to. For context, I have just seen a lot of people in my hometown changing their opinions about the current state of the world with COVID-19 and many people I know are getting berated for what they said about the pandemic before it came to the US and changing their mind now that they are being affected by it to a greater degree. I live in the south where the term “hypocrite” is thrown around pretty regularly.

EDIT 2: Fucking hell I understand a ton of you agree with me and a lot of you don’t think this is an unpopular opinion. I was posting this not in context of Reddit’s echo chamber of opinions, but based on the opinions of people outside our corner of the internet who I’ve been dealing with on social media for the past two weeks. People will never forget and hold shit against you until the day you die.Saying "Yeah well at least you weren't a jew during WWII" or something like that is pure bullshit. Idgaf if some people in history got burned at stake, idgaf if some people in history had to escape their country and walk for hundreds of kilometers to safety. Based on my own experiences that lead me to this state I am sad and just because it's not cause my entire family died in war doesn't make it any less a valid human emotion.I live in Florida and there are beautiful women all over the beaches but I can’t tell you how incredibly unattractive I think it is to spend the entire day taking pictures of yourselves just to put on social media.  A friend of a friend who I just unfollowed on Instagram is physically gorgeous and she’s been trying to get me to take her out and date her but she’s constantly posting pics of herself with stupid duck lips and when I told her it’s not my thing she got really offended probably because no one ever tells her no.  There’s a difference between loving yourself and being a narcissist.  Figure it out.  And it’s not just women. Men do it too.  Social media is absolutely ruining society.  Now Zuckerturd wants a 13 and under Instagram...we’re screwedAs a uni history student, I absolutely adore history, and love it with a passion. However, many people, when I’m talking to them about it, claim to ‘hate history’ because it’s ‘boring and has no relevance’. 

However, different ways of teaching it make it much more interesting - take Horrible Histories (UK TV Series, specifically series 1-5, as well as the books), which is a fantastic series, and makes history interesting, especially some of the songs. Also, films (such as 1917, Hitler Rise of Evi, The Iron Lady) can also make history fun

As for not being relevant, the opposite is most definitely true - especially this year, with how the virus has been dealt with, politicians could benefit from watching some horrible historiesI am a special needs parent whose son's disorder is so rare that they couldn't detect it in utero. He was diagnosed at almost 1 after, in addition to the many other problems he was having, he began to have seizures and thus genetic testing. 

I am currently pregnant and on a parent forum where so many parents post about not knowing if they would do the early genetic screening and it's followed by even more parents saying it would matter what the results are they wouldn't do anything about it. 

Life is hard. Life as a special needs parent is even harder. I've lived both ways and I hate the naivety and toxic positivity that dwells among these communities.

I hate that my son was born with his issues. It has taken a toll on every aspect in my life. There is no real specials needs child care. The amount of procedures, doctors appointments, surgeries, extensive therapies, equipment is ungodly expensive and exhuasting. He suffers in ways that I can't do anything about. My relationship has gravely suffered, we never get to spend time without him and when we do it's brief. 

There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish this wasn't my life. I see too many people on instagram etc. Posting in matching clothes with inspirational quotes and nobody is being honest. It sucks. It's not fair to me or my family.

It's isolating as hell. People act like you're an amazing parent just because you're going through this when half the time I'm falling apart.  

Does any of this mean I don't love and cherish my son? No. But, If faced with results of another genetic disorder or something similar, I would absolutely terminate.

Edit: I feel like people need to understand something which I've commented to another user:

This post specifically highlights the hardships I face. Which is relevant to the point I'm making. It doesn't mean I don't love my son. Loving him and treating him well is not mutually exclusive to the struggles his disorder causes myself and my family. 

Being honest and candid about how hard it is instead of fairy taling myself as some noble hero and smiling my way through it all allows a space for other parents or be able to feel safe in their own challenges. Many of these parents desperately need that. Many people need to understand that it is willfully ignorant to not consider the genuine challenges they will face forever with a special needs child. 

If you can't separate the fact that if I were given a crossroads choice of being a special needs parent or not, knowing what I know, that I would always chose not to be and thinking that it means I don't love my son, then you do not understand, at all. 

If you could chose one way or the other I guarantee you would never chose this life. You would always chose the 'normal' way, which is hard enough as it is.Some clothes, like tight dresses, give higher contrast, and help maintain a nice looking shape to them.
Also some clothes, like bikinis, hold them up which makes them stand more, and sometimes be less droopyTitle says it all. When my parents accused me of doing something wrong that I didn’t do I would get defensive and say no you’re wrong. Somehow they used that as evidence that I did indeed do whatever they accused me of. I would just be like ????? What do they think I would say when I’m not guilty? Did they think I would confess? Did they think people would be calm and rational when accused of doing something they didn’t do, especially if it’s a serious allegation???In many ways, I think this was an inevitable conclusion of the internet and progression of technology. It is now impossible for the average person to know "the truth" about *anything*. As "deepfake" style videos continue to become more and more believable, I think we are quickly approach -- or may have already arrived -- to a point in which nothing you believe about anything holds any sort of validity.

"Video evidence" is becoming increasingly dubious, it is incredibly easy for different news sources to spin up competing narratives on political or social events, and there is really no way for an average person to discern a difference.

In essence, this will have set us back by 500 years. No longer can you trust anything you read, hear, or even witness video footage of. Now, unless you *see things happen with your own eyes*, your entire reality can be shaped by a handful of new organizations.

It's honestly pretty scary to think about.Men get upset and stressed to; stop making fun or thinking less of a man just because he breaks into tears.

Now if he's getting into tears because he lost at call of duty then that's different.

But the actual act of a man crying shouldn't be treated as this pathetic thing. We should respond sympathetically like if it were a woman or child.

EDIT:
Thank you all for the awards!
They aren't nessecary, but are very appreciated.

Nice to know that there are in fact many who (even if they don't agree with the second point; I meant more there are things worth crying over, but some dissagree and that's fine) agree.I am a female, but I still dislike how acceptable it is to make jokes about small penises or degrade other people by saying "they must be compensating" and what not. I think it's harmful and should be just as frowned upon as other types of body shaming.Of course I don't mean like pray for me because I'm going to Hell for being an atheist or gay or anything like that. I also realize this is a little different coming from a stranger versus from someone you know well. Also this excludes the bullshit "thoughts and prayers" that lazy Karens say when a national tragedy has occurred. 

My mom has been recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and a few friends, all who know I'm atheist, have said they will or have been praying for me and my family. I hear a lot of atheists say they hate that, but I think it's so sweet. 

If you love me enough to ask your all powerful diety to help me out, that's truly an honor. Will it do anything? Nope. But a friend saying they'll pray for me means I'm in their heart, and I feel cared for, even if I don't believe what they believe.Title says it all. I think fried chicken has little to no taste and I can barely eat any of it without having the need to gag. I'd rather stick to other options.

EDIT (11 24 2020): Thank you all for the suggestions and awards. I shall now go on a quest to find some good chicken.Friendships often end with time and distance, you cannot do anything about it and it’s nobody’s fault. Sometimes even the ones you thought will remain forever, don’t. That connection you had for years disappears and you find yourself searching for something to talk about because it doesn’t come naturally like it use to. You’re use to the idea that relationships come and go, and if you ended one there was probably a good reason. Whereas friendships suppose to last and usually end without a specific reason or willingness. 
They’re worse than breakups, especially those that were extremely strong and long... 
The only thing that remains is the memories you had over the years while you thought you could laugh at them together when you’ll be 80.
But well, it’s just life I guess.

Edit: I was talking about your most valuable friendships, your closest friends that you have spent your years with and felt inseparable

Edit 2: when I said we are use to the idea of relationships come and go, I meant that we know that it is a very real possibility even though not a necessity especially if you’re not married. As someone said, you have tons of movies, books and songs about it, it’s the most shared, common story. Whereas the loss of a bestfriend hits different, especially in the long run.

Edit 3: omg thank you for the awards and upvotes I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up! 
Also yes, the worst case scenario might be dating your bestfriend then breaking up with them... Especially if you were bestfriends long before starting dating. Then yes you get the worst combo.I like the way the orange bits goes down my throat, and it gives me a sense that this juice hasn't been tinkered with as much as the other juice.. for the other juice, the people making it have to sift through the goodness, and the juice is no longer in its natural form. The idea of biting into a juicy orange evokes memories from when I tried to sneak orange juice from the fridge when I was younger. And a bit of orange rind and bits makes the juice a lot more interesting, rather than just a regular liquid.Wendy Williams has shown she is a horrible person. If a white male said even half the things she’s said over the last couple of weeks he would’ve been canceled and pretty much blacklisted.I’ve been thinking a lot recently about where I’m at in life and where it is going. 

I have recently bought my own home, 3/2 in a cute neighborhood in the hometown I grew up in. I have a nice job that pays 14 an hour in a job that I enjoy. I also have great friends and family that support me. 

I don’t make bank, I don’t go on crazy vacations, and I don’t have a variegated monstera. 

But I feel so honored to have everything I have and I don’t care if people think I’m lazy for not going after more. I’ve had people comment that “this is a cute starter house.” and it sounds like what I have is not good enough. 

I just wana work my nice job, hangout with my friends and family, and garden for the rest of my life and I don’t see anything wrong with that. 

You can be thriving and content with where you are at the same time.To begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular Coke? Sugar? It's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. All you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

With the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. The whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. Like, really well.

In fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange Coke (which just taste like regular Coke with fruits shoved in them).  

The only real downfall to vanilla Coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla Coke is. 

Thank you all for coming to my TedTalk. Now go buy some vanilla Coke.I don't even go on r/AmItheAsshole anymore because I'm tired of reading a post, then looking at the comments and seeing people type shit like: "Tbh NTA my SO told my BIL that KTYL FOTG SMB!!! TKKY UIC so your NTA but your SIL is def TA so IDKWETSA IHNC my HGSH is CALI NKSU VLI. GUTRB CUG LKHIO DSFT RYHN LOP SEDC my DRTYH good luck getting your UOLST to the hospital!" (Those are actual acronyms that I've seen being used on Reddit.) and I understand that you don't want to waste your time typing, but If someone has to google half of the shit you are saying to understand what you mean, You should probably just type it out with actual words.

TL;DR: So my NIL MAJ IHNMS OSHM ARFNI UKN likes to say shit to my HBNN JFN. HFMN OGN. OYUJHB. so he stabbed her twice and she died so OYJJHJH IOYHJN HFGT ET IG UFJH IUYI LOL IKR NILK UON DGU MN IO LOX SIL BUIL AITA?

Edit: I'm 21 years old. And I know these weren't actually acronyms to begin with, I just couldn't think of the word to describe then, and while yes it can be fun to learn new things, I'm not gonna spend 3/4 of my time on r/amitheasshole looking up what acronyms mean. ***This has gained some traction so I feel it is time fore some cleaning up, and clarification. The original post will remain at the bottom***

1. If you are using this thread to hate on women or think that is the point of this post you can kindly piss off. That is sad and embarrassing.

2. This post is about the disconnect of the majority of girls growing up without having many sources of information on how to communicate intimately with men in a relationship. Is this 100% true? Obviously not.... However, think back for at least a decade though and lets take a look at television specifically. This is also directly correlated with male fragility and how tv shows portrayed men and how they should act to "be manly, be attractive, or have some value in a relationship." The majority of the time "romantic" storylines are written about boys falling head over heels for some girl and then doing everything in their power to make things work. The most inclusive thing I've ever seen for female characters is the typical "I like this boy but I don't know what to do." and the obligatory "Just be yourself and if he likes you It'll work out."

3. The subservient topic and the early 1900s. Yeah, that was a time where women were basically house slaves made to serve men. That was terrible and not how relationships should work. Women were treated as objects and told what to do. Thing is folks, this post isn't about that. Trying to justify an overwhelming majority of women not knowing how to communicate intimately with a man by bringing up a subservient lifestyle of the past is just blatantly avoiding the point. I DO NOT WANT WOMEN TO SERVE MEN. What I am focusing on is what resources do most girls have growing up that teaches them to discuss a mans feelings and emotions? 

4. In case you are trying to make this a blame woman post you are completely wrong. The majority of this issue is derived from men protecting their status over the years. For a long time the media industry was dominated by males due to heavy sexist views from the past. Dear god has anyone seen a western before 1990. I'm just saying it would be cool to have movies or tv shows that can teach WOMEN AND MEN that men can be fragile and can cry, and get butterflies and flirt. We are barely scratching the surface of this and I think its awesome but we have a long way to go.

5. If you feel the need to argue this post try using the better argument that we need more shows and movies and media to teach men how to not be pieces of shit when acting towards women. We are still in that zone where men are written so poorly most of the time its a bit cringe to see how these scenes play out. Hell, half the time the shitty guy ends up with a girl anyways so some poor boys will think that it will actually work.

6. I'm getting a lot of messages about women being brought up to believe they need to "please men". That's exactly what I am talking about being the issue. That's a shitty mindset made by people of the past that's slowly fading out. It would be cool if it could change even faster.

7. I thought it would be fun to mention and with her permission I wanted others to know my girlfriend helped me make this post. While she doesn't agree 100% we have had discussions about this and her favorite example is hallmark movies. I didn't even consider that but she grew up watching hallmark movies and those things are just toxic examples of any relationship. Yeah in the end its all happy but really look at what happened to get that point. Get in one argument and leave your husband to marry a guy you lead on years ago from your home town you thought you'd never see again.

8. I'm going to add this again for all the hate mail I am getting. To the ladies out there talking about how they were raised to serve men. That is the problem. That is wrong. That does not teach women how to address men's feelings or emotions. It is a horrible ideology that needs to be eliminated. Everyone saying "I wAs RaIsEd bEinG ToLd tO SeRvE MeN sO YoU ArE WrOnG" are actually backing up my argument that there is very little taught on how to converse about men's emotions or feelings. You are agreeing with me that the teachings are shit and need to be changed. I don't get it, why does everyone feel like this was a personal attack.

Most young boys get advice from their parents on how women should be treated as they get older. However it doesn’t stop there for the boys. In social media, tv shows, advertisements, children shows, movies, even video games. Boys are shown many many ways to treat a woman in a relationship. Not all of these are good ways I might add. Regardless there is a steady stream of influential content that will shape a boy into making decisions on how to treat women. 

On the other hand, what is taught to young girls about how to treat a man when they get older? What source of media or family member is letting girls know how to talk to men. How to communicate with them. Almost every source for young girls focuses on vanity and self worth. Always setting a bar and rules that have to be met. It’s always about self rising up, and nobody else deserves your time unless you decide they are special. This is why most men will find affection in anything a girl does for them. It feels unique because women aren’t taught how to care for men so when they show kindness or affection without it being loving, it will always feel like so much more.Before the whining about "mansplaining" begins, I'm a woman, so don't waste your nail polish.

I hear too often how women "can't tell him" various things bothering her, because "he has a fragile ego." No, you can't tell him these things because you're attacking him and being hateful when you tell him.

You also can't tell him things because you only tell him negative things. You're ungrateful.

If you tell a man, "I like it when a guy gives me chocolates," he'll probably give you chocolates. If you snap at him that maybe you'd forgive him if his lazy ass got up off of the couch and got you some chocolates... You're likely to get only a big argument.

If he gets you the wrong kind of chocolates, and you tell him so with all the fury in your rotten little soul, you're to blame when you get no more chocolates.

If you tell him how much you appreciate how hard he tried, and actually, you know, appreciate that he DID try... And then say that your favorites are X type, but you will enjoy these today because being from him makes them special, you'll get your favorite next time for sure.

And before you stamp your entitled little foot and screech that he should just listen to you no matter how you say it, maybe you should consider the fact that that's the sort of thing a spoiled child would say, not an adult. If you can't be bothered to be thoughtful towards him, you're a spoiled, demanding brat, not a woman.

Appreciate him like loving adults appreciate each other. Consider his feelings, and stop demanding consideration you don't give. Cut the double standard. Don't abuse your partner. Don't talk to him in ways that you'd never tolerate *from* him.

Oh, and stop being prickly and refusing his help. Let him help; it's not "infantilism," it's partnership and caring. If you're an island, be single. Relationships are not all about you doing everything alone while demanding the other person magically read your mind to know when he's allowed to be a kind human and pitch in.

And if you're not like that, I'm not talking to you.Lurking on Reddit is the way to enjoy this website fully. You get to laugh, learn, be shocked, surprised and sometimes you get upset. Every now and then I make the mistake of commenting and/or posting. What happens next is I get stressed out that I'll get negative commentary. Even when just speaking my mind or pointing out something that's obvious in my mind, I'll get sweaty palms thinking about someone downvoting or commenting how I'm wrong.

Let me be clear: it's not about constructive criticism or anything of the sort, it's just way more stressful than just lurking and being a ghost.

And yes, this post stresses me out.

**Edit**: Wow, went to sleep and came back to a post with a lot of positive comments and now I know I'm not the only one experiencing this. Thank you guys for making my Reddit experience this nice and special thanks to the people who awarded the post! Hope you guys have a great day!

**Edit 2**: Someone posted this on Twitter, so now I have two mediums to worry about!While I'm not sure just how unpopular this opinion is, I'm putting it in this sub because I've seen it happen so many times recently.

Don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for "helping" and so they pull the "I'll pray" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

But that is why I added "with sincerity." If they can't help, if there's nothing they can do, all they can do is appeal to the highest power they know. If you don't believe in their god, or a god at all, that's totally fine. But don't be fucking rude about it.It amazes me how quickly we decided to crown Tesla as well made cars. They are riddled with problems. Have several very poor design issues and are consistently near the bottom of the reliable vehicle lists.Blowjob scenes are far too long in porn. I get it, some people get off on seeing a dick getting sucked. I don't understand it, but I get it. But they go on for FAR too long and are centered on too much. When I watch porn, I watch it for the girl, not some guys overly-sized dick. There's nothing sexy about watching some girl near choke on some dude's bacon-bazooka, doubly so, when all you see is her damn face for 10+ minutes. I don't even want to see the guy, to be honest. which is why I tend to go for girl on girl scenes.

Edit1: Great, one of my most up-voted posts is about blowjobs in porn movies. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Edit2: Apparently, I'm now very homophobic for not wanting to watch guys getting their dicks sucked on camera.

Edit3: Great, this is now my most up-voted post. Goddamit, Reddit?! (Hello front page)

ITT: I'm totally gay. I have a small penis. I'm homophobic. I'm wrong. I'm not satisfying my wife. I've just not looked hard enough.. Never change Reddit. Night, night. ;)This seems to be an extremely unpopular opinion, because all I ever hear are adults bashing kids for "not wanting to do anything but sit inside and play video games" or "all they do is stare at their phone". Some of this may be true, but it's almost entirely the fault of parents. As a millennial, I only feel it fair to point out that our generation has largely failed our kids when it comes to being active and just generally being helicopter parents. I come from a decent sized family, live in a place where the weather is generally pleasant year round and know a lot of kids in my neighborhood due to being social with neighbors. Of all the kids I know, all of them love being outside. 


Here's the biggest difference: when we were kids, we went outside and played no matter what our parents were doing. If our parents were outside, we were outside. If our parents were inside watching tv, we were probably still outside. The only reason things ever changed from this formula, is because so many millennials are only open to letting their kids play outside if they can sit there and watch them the entire time. To make it worse, my generation seems extremely divided. People are either very active and bring their kids along, or they are complete home bodies who spend the vast majority of their time inside, subsequently keeping their kids cooped up inside the majority of the time with them.   


Of all the kids I know (which is a lot) the ones who have active parents love and appreciate the outdoors. The kids I know who's parents are home bodies are tons of fun and very active on the rare occasion that they get to go outside, but because their parents keep them inside most of the time they naturally take on things like video games and internet surfing. 


This opinion is not meant to argue reasons why or why not my generation lets their kids play outside. I am not saying people should feel comfortable letting their kids wander the streets for hours on end. That's a different debate. My opinion is simply that adults of all generations need to stop giving kids a hard time over being home bodies because it's not their fault, and many (if not all of them) would prefer to be outside most of the time.Okay so I left out a key point: I don't mind paying $60+ but if I am, I don't want to wash it 3 times and it instantly turns into something worth $20. That's all I'm saying.

Don't get me wrong I love supporting new brands and my brands I've been with forever. I understand people need to make their money...but it's a hoodie. We went from hoodies being like $20-40 range and just shot straight up to like $60...for a Champion hoodie....CHAMPION...the brand we got made fun of for  like literally 10 years ago. Granted they have truly upped their quality. I won't deny that but still..it's just nuts. I'd be more apt and happy to spending like $30 on a hoodie as I'd want to buy more, but I don't wanna spend basically $40 away from 100 on a hoodie. I'm already aware someone's gonna be like "tHeN dOn'T". Okay look. I hate coats because they're so restrictive and suck to wear while driving. If all hoodies were like Carhartt warm, I'd shut up and wouldn't complain....but they're noooooot they're just overpriced and not half as warm.I'm using mine to get my bachelor's and master's degree for free by using the CalVet waiver in which I make <$13,000/yr to qualify for waived tuition.  

Even if I didn't have that waiver, the more time I spent living at home, the less student debt I would have. This whole independent living thing is a scam. I want an apartment too I just can't afford it hahaIt means I've tried to debate with you and you're clearly too closed minded (or stupid) to understand what I'm trying to communicate to you. I've given up on the basis that you will continue to argue pointlessly and never listen to what I have to say because you're too biased. I have better things to do than argue with someone who will never consider my opinion.I don’t understand why people say that fish is not meat. Meat is defined as “the flesh of an animal as food.” Why isn’t fish considered a meat then?! Why do religions act like it is not meat? Why is the flesh of a fish not considered meat? It literally makes no sense to me. I understand it is food from the sea, hence seafood, but seafood is just meat from the “sea.”Many bash those who waste a lot of money on materialistic goods or who like activities that are considered "shallow", like clubbing and partying. Meanwhile, "traveling" is often portrayed as the enlightened way to pass your time. Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with traveling, but I disagree that people who travel a lot are automatically any less shallow than those who go clubbing or buy a lot of stuff. 

First of all, "travel culture" is a form of flexing. It has become less acceptable to brag about owning expensive stuff, so people now brag about their trips. Especially on Instagram, it is obvious that many use their travels to flex and show us how "superior" they are. 

"Traveling" doesn't make you an enlightened intellectual in any way. I could maybe understand this argument 30 years ago but nowadays, anyone can find any information they want about any place they like. They can use the Internet to explore a country, without traveling there and contributing to its destruction. (tourism can be very bad for the environment)

Also, people have fun with different things. Maybe someone thinks that buying a PS5 is more fun to them than going on some stupid trip. That is their business and their choice is not inherently inferior.No it’s not a “dick move” to not want to be with someone who won’t get help but says they’re depressed or is trying to commit suicide on a regular basis. If you can’t handle it, then don’t; and stop feeling so bad about it.

Edit: I suffer from depression myself, however, I go to a therapist or sort through things if I can. I know not everyone can do that, but I wouldn’t expect my boyfriend to stay with me if I was so bad off. It would be great but I couldn’t expect that.I feel like the school system barely does anything to try and spark interest in learning and instead just beats in a fear of failure due to the grading system causing students to fear making mistakes and instead focus on just trying to get good scores. When a kid who might be a slow learner doesnt understand something but the class is already moving on to another topic their going to feel embarrassed and anxious and instead of trying to fully understand the topics their just going to try and memorize as much as they can for that week just to do well on that week's pop quiz or whatever and then forget that shit right after.And they’re just as good if not better than chips too. The different seasonings, sometimes even with different kinds of cheeses baked right into them as well (Parmesan, Asiago, etc). And they have just so much crunch and thickness to them. They’re not just for salads...they’re perfectly acceptable as a snack the way chips are.Title says it. Seeing more and more facebook and reddit posts of people with "I rescued this little guy today" add photo of the most adorable puppy or kitten. Comon... You just went out and bought yourself a new pet.Me (26 M) and my girlfriend (26 F) usually have conversations where we say things like, that guy/girl is beautiful, and when I tell my friends about it they think I'm crazy. Like how don't you feel bad knowing she finds a guy attractive or how can I tell her in her face I find a girl attractive.

Yeah people, being in a relationship does not mean you stop finding people beautiful, but to me at least it makes it so I have no sexual interest in them. Just like when I see a guy I can recognise he is attractive even though I'm straight, I can see a girl and find her attractive without thinking about sexual stuff.There is no reason other than wanting your ring to be more expensive to expect a *natural* diamond. There is nothing natural about abusing cheap labor and tearing up the planet just to get a molecularly identical rock. The forces that go into making the diamond are the same, and the forces are natural.  If the marketing machine was just as strong in the other direction, we’d all prefer lab grown because it perfectly displays man’s power over the elements.  

I know a lot of people are abandoning diamonds altogether In their engagement rings, which I totally respect, but I still think diamonds are a beautiful and worthy stone. If lab grown can make them cheaper and more ethically it’s literally just buying into the marketing that drives mined diamond sales.

A little disclaimer: I did buy my fiancé a lane grown diamond, and she loves it! I got her the ring of her dreams plus saved enough money to buy her the honeymoon of her dreams too, it’s great.A bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. For those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

Ps: I am not defending drug dealing, I am just COMPARING it to teachers.

Edit: I appreciate so much the work that passionate teachers make and the incredibly positive impact they've had on my life and the ones of billions of people. This post is about bad teachers, but I have to make it clear good teachers exist too.I wake up, shower, go to work (medical courier) enjoy audiobooks and music, come home, take care of my responsibilities, enjoy a tv show or movie, maybe play a video game for a bit, and go to bed satisfied.

I like hanging out with friends, and doing stuff, mainly that stuff revolves around relaxing activities. I am far from rich, and grew up poor.

I have no greater ambitions or desires really to speak of. I am a content person now and that seems to be a really hard thing for people to grapple with. 

That being said, being content with what you seems alien with so many people, because we are inundating with the notion that you have to achieve and strive for more/better at a very young age. 

I just tired of people thinking I'm depressed or something is wrong with me just because of my placid contentment.

EDIT:
I'd just like to say, I knew there would be like-minded people out here, but this was way more than I expected. 

With people in my everyday life (friends, family) harping at me about my lack of upward motivation, it was really getting at me. Seeing all you people sharing similar desires and outlooks solidifies the fact that I am not wrong for the choices I make/have made.

Thank you fellow satisfieds!For example, if you saw/heard a racist meme or joke and you found it funny, that doesn't mean that you're racist or you believe racism is ok/good. It's ok to find offensive jokes/memes funny. That's my opinion anyways.I will probably be downvoted for this since this sub is dominated by right wingers venting their opinions, but for the record I am conservative myself.

I constantly hear talk about trigger culture where sjw's and feminist are sensitive to the point where any little thing they disagree with triggers them. It has become an internet meme and something that right wingers seem to throw around quite a lot. Yet these same right wingers go into an absolute trigger meltdown due to a silly Gillette commercial. The backlash to that commercial has pretty much been as big as the backlash to that "black kid in a monkey sweater" H&M picture. I just find it funny that many of the same people who talk about triggered SJW's can't handle a fucking Gillette commercial.Yeah it kinda sucks that no games are on. Sucks that the concert you got tickets for is now cancelled...but in the grand scheme of things it’s a minor inconvenience at best, and nobody (unless your job is reliant on those industries) is really suffering because of it. Basically pro sports and movies could disappear and it would be no more than a glitch. Now...imagine if all the nurses couldn’t work. What if the people who run the power plants all disappeared? Chaos. I really hope this whole situation will make people rethink their values and priorities when it comes to role models and idols.It honestly just makes you sound like an unashamed bitch/bastard every time. I lose any and all interest in you at that point, as i have now learned everything i need to know about how this relationship is going to go. 

It honestly seems narcisisstic as hell.

ETA: JEEBERS! thanks folks, when i spotted this platitude in my feed as i made my morning brown, i never expected it to gain any traction when i voiced my distain to strangers on the internet

To touch on a couple notes, as i have now lost all track of the threads

1: i am not choosing the wrong women. My wife is my shieldmaiden, and we have been through hell and back together. Weve been at our worst and our best. This is about the people you simply cannot help but be surrounded by 

2: this isnt an unpopular opinion? Lucky you. The people in my city are THE WORST for this  and other examples of the cesspit of humanity. Your mileage will vary  and if you need to be reminded that the world is very big, then i dont know what to tell you other than the world is very big

3: morning brown is coffee, not poogaby zakyJust seen today that Kodak Black got sentenced to four years in jail and in every comment section I've looked at about it has been full of people just spamming "Free Kodak" or something along those lines. Do y'all not get that he's an actual criminal? Or do y'all think he and other rappers that have been incarcerated are just above the law? Either way it just makes you look so stupid! I'm not into rap personally but I don't have a problem with the music itself or the people who enjoy the music. Rap culture seems to be heavily based around casually breaking the law all the time so why can't people just accept that sometimes their favourite artists are going to get locked up? I don't get it.i don’t hate babies, they’re so cute, but i always see people laughing about videos where a baby is supposedly being funny. 
i don’t get it. there’s nothing funny about videos like that or babies in general. sure, sometimes funny stuff happens, but i always see babies doing the bare minimum and people laughing about it.Lets face it: every second woman on instagram pretends like their fanbase cares about what they're eatting this morning.

"Hey guys check out the smoothie I'm drinking"

"Hey guys swipe up for my code "DADDYISSUES15" to get 15% off *insert random item*"

I don't understand how oblivious they are? 90% of their pictures are flirty bikini pictures, some with less than a bikini. Each picture tries to show up as much skin as possible without breaking guidlines... but we're supposed to take these people seriously when they winge about their fanbase being filled with creeps???

Fair enough, it's not cool when you have guys constantly DMing you for more, but let's be honest; this is the image and type of attention you attract.

The people watching you don't care about you and your "fitness advise". Your progress photos aren't inspiring, they're jerk off material for guys. They just want to see your ass and nothing more.I grew up with parents that didn’t shy away from using correct bodily language, so maybe that’s why this irks or feels strange to me. You wouldn’t go to your doctor complaining about a problem with your “wee-wee”. So why would you teach that to your kid? 

Additionally, I sometimes hear grown ass adults use words like pi-pi (i guess out of some bizarre sense of propriety).. . Like I get that it’s an uncomfortable topic for some people, but I find it rather unsettling to listen to someone describe a penis using baby talk.It’s not uncommon to think of any excuse possible to get out of an unwanted conversation/phone call/meetup/etc. I personally have always been someone who feels the need to think of a perfect excuse as to not offend the other person. “Sorry I was working” when really, I was watching Netflix. “Oh sorry I missed your call! I don’t have good cell coverage where I am” etc.

However, saying something like “sorry I missed your call, I don’t feel like talking at the moment” is something that I know a lot of people would take personally. When I’ve responded like this to people, they also always assume something’s wrong, that I’m upset, angry at them, etc. when really I’m either just busy or not in the mood to talk to anyone cause I’m just doing my own thing.

**EDIT**: To the people saying, "Don't give any explanation, just say "sorry I missed your call" and leave it at that." My whole point is that sometimes, people will press to know why you were busy and why you missed their call or what you were doing. In this case, you should be able to say "sorry, just didn't feel like talking to anyone!" Even if you say "Sorry I can't talk, I'm busy" people will most likely try to call you back at a time when they think you won't be busy. So instead, you should just be able to say that you weren't in the mood to talk.

**EDIT 2:** To all the people saying, "That's a rude way to put it" I obviously wouldn't phrase it like how I did in the title lol. I wouldn't say "Nah I don't feel like it." I'd probably say, "Sorry I missed your call! It's been a long day so I'm not really feeling super talkative at the moment, let's catch up later!" or something.

**EDIT 3:** A lot of you are not reading this post correctly lol. I'm not saying that you should tell a person "I don't want to talk to **YOU.**" I'm saying that you should be able to say a general comment like "Sorry I'm not up for talking right now, (to ANYONE, not just one specific person) it's been a long day. Obviously it would be rude to tell someone that you specifically don't want to talk to *them.* Not sure where some of you are getting this from lol

**EDIT 4:** Nowhere in this post did I ever say "ignore people." Obviously don't ignore people. The ENTIRE POST is that you should be able to set boundaries for yourself and tell people the truth if you don't feel like talking instead of having to make up an excuse.Every children’s cartoon has brainwashed you all into thinking your veggies is a punishment and a “gross” food you only eat to be healthy. Fuck that and fuck you. 

Broccoli especially, what’s wrong with you? Broccoli tastes good even when raw, but frying it with some spices and butter??? It’s a great highlight of any meal.

People really out here thinking vegetables taste gross when in reality their uneducated asses only steam and boil them without even thinking about the repercussions.

Would you say all meat tastes bad because you only eat boiled unflavored steak? No? Then shut up. Veggies are an amazing and incredible diverse food group and I will plummet anyone who disagrees into the ground. 

I am slightly drunk right now and I fear no man. If you think that a nice veggie stir fry isn’t mouthwatering I will kill you and plant cauliflower on top of your grave. 

I’m tired of the bad reputation my beautiful greens get.

EDIT: I am now sober and woke up to this blown up, apparently it isn’t as unpopular as I thought and my veggie-hating-friends were wrong with their meathead views. Good. I swear if you guys don’t have at least one big serving of vegetables a day then I will cry on your corpse after you die of heart disease. And then I will gently place you into a nice vegetable garden to be used as fertilizer. I was very intense in this point but I stand by it.I heard a lot of people saying that chocolate is much better than vanilla. For me, vanilla got a much more sweet and soft taste. Chocolate is pretty good too, but not as much as vanilla.It's 2021. Seatbelts & airbags have been standard safety equipment, for decades.

Automobile manufacturers are investing billions of dollars in "self-driving" technology, but they are ignoring relatively inexpensive and proven technology that could make their vehicles safer for *all* drivers, today.

I am talking about dash cams/crash recorders, as standard, required safety equipment. 

Adding two cams and a data recorder that continuously records a 1-hour loop would add minimal cost to a new vehicle. This data would be useful for insurers, who should be the main force behind advancing legislation that would make this possible, as well as consumers, law enforcement and the manufacturers, themselves.Right now, Reddit is blowing up about Pewdiepie’s wedding and subscriber count, and I genuinely couldn’t care any less. A few years back when I was like 10 I enjoyed a few of his videos but I never understood why he had so many subscribers and fans. The guy really isn’t very funny, once you’re older than 12. I understand a lot of people rising up during the T-Series debacle, but I don’t understand why anyone still cares. I don’t think his wedding should be any form of news at all, but very much the opposite. I never really understood why people care so much about Pewdiepie’s everyday life, and I don’t think I ever will.Telling new couples either newly dating or married that they aren’t really happy, they are just in the “honeymoon” phase is being an asshole. Couples can be happy dating 1 day or 100 years. It’s about who they are as people and how they work together. It’s totally normal over time for couples to go through ups and downs, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be happy.

EDIT: HOLY MOLY thank you all for the upvotes and awards!! Never had a post get this much attention.It’s generally accepted that people’s political and social views can be heavily swayed by what media they take in, and from where it came from. The problem is misinformed people being fed news from Facebook, Instagram, or the constantly running biased news channel. 

I hate to break it to you, but wherever you lie on the political spectrum, whatever opinions you think are your own, people are being paid for you to think that. American news outlets constantly use language to portray any scenario in any different light. 

If the media outlets are that contradictory on the exact same topic or event, none can be trusted. This is becoming common knowledge, and the people’s response is that all the news is that it’s all bad news. 

Why not just make a news outlet that only airs good news? Now I know what you’re thinking; “what’s good news to one is bad news to another”. No, no, no. I mean *actual* good news around the world that in many cases would inherently be non-political. You know the kind I’m referring to that local news airs once per night and the waxy news casters laugh through their botox. Firefighter saves a kid and marries his mom or whatever. woo poor kid gets a scholarship. Family of ducks saved by mexicans. Hippie takes dog on roadtrip. I got tiredLike your not making them special or different your just making it harder for Everyone else to write down like when I look at someone named Charli instead of Charlie I don’t think WoW tHeY aRe So CoOl I think wow that is so useless and unnecessary so just why do it in the first place?If you have to point out how " big and strong" you are it just looks like you are a weak scared little person. If you are confident about yourself you wouldn't feel the need to point any thing like that out.You will either get banned permanently for no reason whatsoever by a power tripping mod, or you'll have a smartass in the comments section arguing with you just for the fuck of it. It's a total wastage of one's time and energy, not to mention that reddit is filled to the brim with assholes of every different type and shape. And here I am, posting on reddit, fuck me.
It's smarter to lurk, and let others do the hard work of finding quality material, because a virtual silver or gold or platinum doesn't mean shit in real life.Now, before I continue, I would like to say that I ain't American, but I have read about how tipping works there from reddit. Thus, according to Internet law, I'm an expert on the matter. (In all seriousness though, just correct me if I'm wrong)

- First of all, you guys say that tipping is necessary in order for workers to earn above minimum wage. However, isn't it a rule in most establishments that if the employee doesn't make enough through tips, their boss should cover the rest? What do you know, apparently untipped waiters aren't suffering from lack of cash. You might say that if tipping is abolished, the cost of food in restaurants will rise. So what? You are already paying extra through your bloody tips, just divert that cash to a higher price of a meal. Just make things a bit more simple. 

- Apparently, there is also cases of employers 'stealing' their workers tips or forcing them to 'share' it. Like how certain restaurants force their waiters to equally share their hard earned tips with their fellow workers. What the fuck is that? So if I work hard, treat my client extra super special awesome and received a glorious 50% percent tip for my hard work, I must share it with lazy Harry who sleeps in the storeroom every chance he get? And don't tell me that waiters have to share their tips with the cooks for the sake of 'fairness'. After all, don't cooks earn above the min wage? 

- Unlike most people apparently, I love maths. Damn, how I loved it, and I was pretty good at it. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that I want to do a freaking mental calculation everytime I finish a meal. Like wtf people, I wanna chill after I finish dinner. And don't you people start giving me pointers on simple ways to calculate how much to tip a person. I find it twisted that tipping is so ingrained in American culture that you guys make a literal rule for it. Japanese student bow to their teachers respectfully before starting class, but any American asshole who gives below 20% for a tip is the scum of the earth and is a reserved a special VIP room in hell. 

- Plus, tipping culture apparently breeds a sense of entitlement among some in the service industry. I've read stories about waiters and waitresses who turn their nose away from what they presume is a 'low' tip and even 'subtly' hint that they should get a higher amount. Like bitch, you are literally getting money from someone whom isn't entitled to pay you squat and you got the audacity to be choosy about it. 

- Why only waiters get to be tipped? Why not the janitors, the maids or the garbage men? Some of them have even tougher jobs then waiters. They don't get tipped. I mean, when have you guys even said thank you to the guys who scrubbed your toilet bowl squeaky clean? Not to mention how some waiter may be lucky enough to earn double or triple above the minimum wage if they work at a particularly affluent restaurant. A bit unfair isn't it?

- I feel like the easiest way to solve this problem is for the American legislation to get amended so that the workers in the service industry get paid according to the minimum wage. So why are you all so stupid that you can't figure out this simple solution? 

- Now, I'm not saying that tipping is bad. However, it should be used to show appreciation rather than being something mandatory. Hell, some restaurants even include tipping in the bill as a gratuitous fee. How presumptuous is that? Crap, I'm straying of point. Anyway, like I was saying, tipping should be a choice on the customer's behalf, to pay for some particularly outstanding service from their waiter. It shouldn't be freaking corrupted by being made socially compulsory. 


You guys might be wondering why the hell I decided to post this. I don't live in America, nor do I plan to. This has nothing to do with me whatsoever, so why am I being a busybody? Well, it's because this annoys me. It's really, really annoying on how this whole issue is so stupid and unnecessarily overcomplicated. Of course, this ain't the only time America decided to be 'different' in order to separate themselves from the rest of the world only to end up looking like idiots. Remember the imperial system crap? Similarly, this whole issue is such a big pain in the ass for everybody that I internally cringe everytime I think about. So, I decided to vent about it by bashing the Americans. That's all.







Edit 1: Most of you talk about how tipping is a good thing because servers get more money than if they totally depend on min wage. That working as a server is so horrible that nobody will do it if not for the tips. Well, guess what? There are other shitty jobs out there and they don't get tipped for it so this seems pretty unfair to me. Basically, servers want this culture to stay, despite they getting less than minimum, because its better for them compared to the customers.

Edit 2: What's up with Europe and shitty service? You guys keep talking about how tipping incentives servers in America and you use your experience with Europe to prove that. This is not a thing in Southeast Asia, where I actually live, cuz people provide good service here WITHOUT EXPECTING TIPS. You Westerners are seriously dissapointing me here.

Edit 3: My god, you servers are salty af clinging to your precious tips just because you want to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that other minimum wage workers don't enjoy. You guys are a bunch of whiny entitled crybabies.

Edit 4: One thing I feel like I have to remind you guys is that I'm not hating on tipping. Instead I feel that we should only tip when we get great service, not average service. Unfortunately, though its purely voluntary, Americans are socially pressured to tip, even for shitty service. This is what I dislike.No one cares about anybody, especially if they aren’t trying to date them. I am not talking about someone knows the other person for few years & then he falls into depression. I am referring to if you meet a depressed or damaged person for the first time you will probably just judge him/her & leave. If you are cute/hot people actually try to know you only if it’s maybe because they want to get in a relationship/sex.
Someone listens to you & is there for you.It's been a thought for a while but every time I see another panda video I am just awed by how fucking incompetent they are. Dumb as bricks, moving half as fast, and a survival instinct like a Happy Tree Friend. 

They're so dumb and useless I actually don't find them cute anymore. 

But my fellow humans feel differently, so they go ahead and spend Scrooge McDuck levels of resources basically begging these lumbering morons to have sex. For the survival of their species. 

Stakes are high, so humans get them like a special fuck-cave with candles and fresh cut bamboo all set before a roaring fire while Can't Get Enough Of Your Love plays gently in the background.

And how do God's-doodlings respond? Most of the time they still say no. Then one goes and crawls face-first into the fire while the other falls over, from a sitting position, and then starts to eat and choke on its own paw.

Edit: wow this blew up, I feel special. Thank you kind strangers for the cascade of silver and my first ever gold. It's been awesome reading comments especially because many of you disagree with me, still support my right to my opinion, and have taken the time to present information I can learn from. Thank you, people like you are the sunshine of a brighter tomorrow. And lastly, to the few who've wished me cancer and death - I invite you to unwind with a panda video.It’s just flattering. I can honestly say I’ve been hit on by more gay dudes than women in my life. 

I’ve been in a really happy relationship for 9 years now and there’s something about being straight and having a gay dude hit on me or complement me that feels so innocent and genuine. 

If it’s a women I instantly feel guilty because of my relationship and withdrawal immediately. Gay dudes, they feel like real bros, and my own bros don’t compliment me but I give them compliments all the time to try to boost there self esteem because I know they need it and it’s something I would want. 

Its just really cool.

Edit: whoa bros. Getting home from work and R.I.P my inbox! Also, assume what you want about my sexuality but I definitely know who and what I am. Sure this sounds gay and it probably is but I just don’t give af. It’s just an honest opinion.I get maybe back in the day it used to be a tradition to not value a woman’s worth because of her age, but times have changed and I think continuing that tradition is so dumb. A few months back I  said to one of my female coworkers, who’s not much older than me (I’m a 27 year old male, by the way), “May I ask your age?” She had absolutely NO problem telling me she was 31 while the rest of the room erupted in a “How dare you?” kind of tone. They were absolutely outraged, as if I called her some toxic slur. If the woman who I asked has no problem telling me, then who the hell are you to get offended? Anyway, that’s my rant. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Since people are asking why I even asked the question in the first place, we were talking about shows we watched as kids. Some were similar and some I had never heard of. That’s when SHE actually asked me how old I was, and I returned the question. That’s when everyone besides her lost their shit.

Edit 2: Just wanna add that the two of us were probably the youngest employees at the time. She was just as baffled at how outraged everyone else was. Maybe it’s just an older generation thing and it will die out with the younger generation?-Why is it that everyone on here is so insecure? I really don’t understand it. This site used to be fun and entertaining, now it’s full of self conscious, ugly men and angry women who both always try to prove themselves correct/superior just to make themselves feel better. Most of you get offended at the smallest things and it’s really quite sad. I am generalising here, I know not everyone’s sad and lonely. I do pity a lot of you.I absolutely hate the idea of living in a homogenized, cookie cutter world of Walmart and amazon but I literally can’t afford to support the little guy. There’s actually not many Walmarts in my area and I only recently started going. I’m living on a teachers salary and it’s not like we’re talking about an extra dollar or two, it’s a huge disparity in price compared to the competition. I don’t wanna be part of the problem but what choice do we have when shopping local is a luxury.

Edit: I’ve been repeatedly told this isn’t an unpopular opinion so I’ll call it an unpleasant fact. However I maintain that it’s my opinion that although I don’t like patronizing a particular establishment, it is foolish not to take advantage of the savings, even though it is “unpopular” to admit doing so.....in my opinion.No small talk required.

No finding / booking seats next to your friends / family.

Getting snacks just for yourself, no need for sharing because this is MY popcorn.

Want to watch the credits to catch that "post credit" scene? Go ahead!

Want to leave early? Go ahead, leave. No general concensus required.

Last film I saw was Knives Out, on my own, loved it. Don't knock it until you try it.

EDIT: Wow I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you for the awards, started going to the cinema alone because I was in a bad place, but now I love it.As someone who is skinny, I’ve been told to eat more to gain weight, or that I will, “grow out eventually”. I personally hate hearing these words, knowing that I most likely won’t gain weight.Okay, so I don't know if this is a thing for many people, but it has happened to me since I was, like 9.

For as long as I can remember being on this earth, but definitely since being 5 years old, I was and am passionate about cars. And even when my age still was in single digits, some people always thought it'd be a good idea to tell me that I'll lose interest in cars and all that stuff.

Guess what? I'm in my twenties now and I haven't. It rather got more since some of my friends are into cars as well.

Furthermore, from 16 years on (and especially since I actually started driving at 17), some people told me that I'll quickly get tired of driving when I have to drive to work every day.

Guess what? They're wrong with this, too and I don't see myself ever getting tired of it.

Yes, yes, some people do lose interest in stuff over the years. Of course they do. But telling people that they'll lose interest in whatever they are passionate about over and over again is just wrong. Why would you do that? Having a passion is (in 99% of cases) a good thing so why would you say them they'll lose it?


My theory is that a lot of people who say this don't really have a passion and subconsciously (!!!) envy the people that have one.


Again, this is just my experience. But I don't get why so many people talk against what other people are passionate about, when they hear of it.

Who, you ask? Well, for me it have been several not-too-close relatives.I just saw an interview with a woman (reality show) where she used her fingers to suggest her ex lover was not well endowed. The audience, mostly female, erupted in a round of applause and laughter. Yet no one would clap and cheer if a man gestured that his ex wife’s breasts droop down to her stomach. 

As a female, I’m tired of the hypocrisy. It’s still completely acceptable to speak about a man and his genitals. Dick size is such an easy go to when bashing a man, or, conversely, when praising a man. But to attack a woman for her weight or praise a woman for having nice breasts and/or buttocks is absolutely unacceptable.I am a straight guy and I enjoy eating out a girl more than I enjoy getting a BJ. And before the comments saying "oh you just haven't gotten a good BJ", trust me, I have. I DO enjoy them, just not as much as giving head to another girl. 

Its really just something about a girl getting off because of ME that really gets me going in more, and different ways that getting my knob slobbed.Every time I see the news it's always about a celebrity
or bad thing that's happening in the world. The
people who do real good to society never get thanked
or given the spotlight.

And even of you try to talk about discoveries or things
that could change the way we live for the better
people think you're a nerd and not interesting.I personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me I personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. I never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am I missing something ?

And before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends I doubt that since I have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. Hes probably part of the reason I dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

Im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something I couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.There are a bunch of people who will gladly shit on others who watch mindless TV like Keeping Up With The Kardashians but then slop up the meaningless youtube Drama that certain creators farm. 

It's all the same shit.Scrolling through reddit it’s full of ridiculous medical bills, companies like AT&T fleecing people for more money while providing rubbish service, out of control student debts and requiring degrees for entry level positions with rubbish pay, no good minimum wage and high taxes.  

It appears as though companies can do what they want to the “little people” as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care. 

What’s worse is a lot of Americans seem blind to this, they’ve been raised to see it as normal. They talk about how they are free and America is great but from my point of view it they’re spewing nothing different from the propaganda force fed to the people of communist countries.

Edit; thanks for the awards!Since the release of birds of prey did anyone actually not go see the movie because it has a female cast? seems like a large portion of females on twitter and women in the media blame men anytime a "female oriented" movie doesnt do well. Happened with oceans 8 and the new ghost busters, now birds of prey. Some of the best movies have had badass female leads (star wars, alien, terminator,kill bill, etc.) The real reason these movies seem to do horribly is because they are either made or marketed as cringy femenist man hating movies that "arent made for us" so why should we go an watch them?I do not understand why people brush their teeth before breakfast. What are you even brushing off?? (Assuming you didn’t eat after brushing the evening before, but even then, just wait until after breakfast?!) The weird sleepy taste in the mouth can be easily rinsed out, and thus is also not a reason, and even so, replacing the sleepy taste with toothpaste is just as bad.

Eidt: I know about the enamel that might be scratched off by brushing teeth right after eating specific foods. I did not say that people are supposed to brush RIGHT after breakfast, I just said that brushing before breakfast is redundant.

Edit 2: [good reason against my opinion](https://www.healthline.com/health/should-you-brush-your-teeth-before-or-after-breakfast)

Edit 3 (for people too lazy to read edit 2): There are valid reasons to brush teeth before breakfast, check the comments.

I guess it was posted before, you don’t have to tell me, sorry.

Edit since this got big: it is scientifically proven to be better to brush before eating, so I was wrong. PSA: brush your teeth before breakfast.I remember a scientific study that was done a while back, which concluded that human beings can only REALLY care about a certain number of people. That's similar to what I'm talking about. 

I really think it's ridiculous to expect someone to not only keep up with, but either care deeply about or take action against, every cause for concern in the world. It's just an illusion that the internet has created, this false sense that everything around the globe is happening right outside your window and you are obligated to protest it. 

For instance, all of the posts popping up about how BLM has overshadowed the Hong Kong protests. Bringing attention to the HK protests is a pretty worthy cause, but is that really your intention? With your meme with a cat in it? No, you just want everyone to upvote you for how much you "care."

I'm not advocating "ignorance is bliss," more like "acceptance is bliss." Do what you can, when you can, to a reasonable extent. Just accept that there is a limit to how much you can change the world, and don't let the stress kill you.Social media is shit. Everybody's always trying to get one up in each other, trying to top their achievements, get the most likes, post the sexiest photo, have the most followers. I think this is because people follow their freinds. By following people you know, you share your activity with them, which pretty much always (in my experience) ends up in some sort awkward conversation. I dont want my freinds to see that I post Lego MOCs, I dint want my freinds to see my crappy model builds, I dont want my freinds to see that I partake in academic discussion s about star wars. Social media and real life should be kept separate, to avoid arguments, confrontation, and upset. This is obviously just what I think :)

Edit: Having just read a lot of the comments, I want to apologise. I realise this might not be the most unpopular opinion on reddit, however I meant it from a whole of society point of view. I only know of 2 other people with reddit, so the vast majority if the people I know in real life do actually think this is unpopular. Sorry 🤣It's really starting to get irritating that a collection of anything that's interesting is called porn. Here's some beautiful pictures of the Grand Canyon at sunset - Earth porn!! Here's some pictures of delicious looking food - Food porn!! Here's some interesting photos of abandoned buildings - Abandoned porn!! Here look at these awesome vintage cars - Car porn!! Book porn! Map porn! Data porn! You get the idea. What are we like a perpetual 12 year old boy. Everything doesn't have to be compared to porn. It's annoying as freaking hell.The more i thought about it, the more i realized how it feels like we're living in a movie, seriously!? Putting spikes around where homeless people would normally sit to "make da place look prettier" instead of actually solving homelessness? What world do we live in thats so obsessed with flashiness and money that it tries to cover up homelessness?  


Here's my two cents, maybe instead of seeing homeless people as "disgusting" and "gross" you house them so they can live a life with basic human rights.I have gigantic boobs, they’re the first or second thing most people notice about me anyway. It is not a secret or a surprise that I have to wear bras every day to keep these babies hoisted and professional. They are performance wear. It’s not like I’m letting some lacy cleavage peek out, or wearing an outfit to be intentionally provocative. So idgaf if you see my bra strap peeking out from my professional, sleeveless dress when I’m at work. I wear them! Big fucking deal! It’s 100 degrees!

ETA: your “if you have big tiddies, prove it” comments aren’t cute or original. There’s plenty of tits on the internet for you to ogle.Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

&#x200B;

Edit: spelling.

Edit 2: I never imagined This would get so popular. Answering to the comments now seems an impossible task, anyway I’d like to clarify some points some of you must have not grasp:
- I’m not saying the death of a child is worthless. To those who told me I should kill myself because I’m advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can’t even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that’s why a put “generally”.
- it’s not a competition but it doesn’t mean things can’t be discussed 
- English is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit I’m sorry but couldn’t care less.
- thank you reddit for this unexpected (un)popularityAirPods are overrated. You have to charge them. You have to keep track of many components (both pods, case, charger). You can easily lose them or drop them into an endless abyss that is the subway grate in the sidewalk. Not wired headphones! You never have to worry about if they’re charged; they’ll never die mid-run! When you drop them, they’re not likely to fall somewhere to their death, and they’re harder to lose!! Maybe this is the poor grad student coming out on me- but wired headphones have my vote any day!!Pretty much the title. I'm so tired of having to be vigilant about sandwich ingredients everytime I order. Tomatoes make the bread soggy and the other ingredients slippery, which makes the sandwich more prone to fall apart. Not only does keeping sliced tomatoes fresh and on hand create a ton of waste, but the slices are never thin or consistent anyway because it is always the newest employee who is told to slice them. The flavour and texture are also not complimentary to anything else on most sandwichs, and usually they completely overpower the experience. Unless the tomato is the main ingredient of the sandwich, it should be left off completely and only added by request.You know the type. Those folks that say "I say what's on my mind" and "I can't keep my mouth shut" and other similar iterations.


First of all, they lack manners. They always say something rude, then act like they are either superior for doing so, or that not having a filter is some sort of flaw they're cursed with that everyone else has to accept.


Secondly, they lack respect. To be so blunt is disrespectful of the person or thing, and to others present.


Lastly, they lack intelligence. By no means do I think people should always remain silent. If you have an opinion, voice it! But there are ways to speak your opinion coherently and constructively. Just saying the first thing that pops into your mind will always make you appear less intelligent.After an incident regarding my two nephews Christmas gifts last night, I’ve noticed that I’m under no obligation to let kids win at video games. I think it would be equally stupid to let them win at board games, or arm wrestling, or whatever.   
Life sucks, there are people that are better at things than you are. I’m not a super great video game player myself, and you know what, that’s fine. There are players better than me and if I want to beat them I need to get better. That’s just something to know in life.   
I might be swayed on this if they were my own children, but seeing as I don’t have those I don’t think you can change my mind here.  
Edit because of the butthurt in this thread: if you’re going to make up stories about things that didn’t happen, at least be original with your insults. Kids had fun. Mother got pissed. Playing again next weekend and trust me I’m not throwing those games either.Moss in most media is depicted as a weak sludge that would've gone extinct if not for rocks to grow on. Moss is far more than that. It actually resembles a miniature of a simple herb. Moss is far more like a tiny flower than anything most people think of it as. Also, moss is not weak, and is often able to survive in soil alongside to 'more powerful' vascular plants.Chocolate liqueurs, champagne truffles, gin infused chocolates.... they're all disgusting. Chocolate is a sweet (sometimes bitter) treat that is absolutely ruined by the throat burn caused by the alcohol. If you want to taste alcohol, have a drink.

Edit: yes I'm aware I can buy different chocolates, or just not eat them. Have received them as gifts and tried them. Also been offered chocolate I didnt realise had alcohol in them.Everyone feels bad for Demi Lovato because she's had a lot of substance abuse problems that have lead to an overdose resulting in a ton of health issues. She recently released a documentary on Youtube about the OD and at first I felt bad for her but then she mentioned that she's done heroin after the OD that left her partially blind and almost killed her. Now she's releasing music videos re enacting her OD and her time at the hospital. This woman needs time off, maybe even give up this whole pop star lifestyle for good if she can't handle being sober. This is for her own good. She's made the money, millions of dollars. She doesn't need the pressure if it will put her life in jeopardy. It just seems like she can't have enough attention.Men have no real emotional support. Yet no one cares. If a woman is upset, she almost always has support. But for men, even at their wits end, nothing most of the time. People don’t care that men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than women. People just don’t care that men can have problems too, that they need support sometimes too. Why isn’t that ok?

Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their opinions on this thread. It’s made me see that there are a lot more people who care about this subject than I thought. I’m sorry for coming across as bitter but when I posted this I was upset and shocked after seeing the difference between successful suicides between men and women. I do not hate women, or blame women for anything, I just wanted to post this as I know there are a lot of lonely men out there right now. People have shown me that I’m not as educated on some matters as I thought I was, and I really need to get better at putting my thoughts into words so they aren’t misinterpreted. Thank you for the silver and gold whoever gave them, and thank you all again for this discussion, I hope it stays with us.A car hitting a bike will cause much worse injuries than a bike hitting a pedestrian. It is much easier for a bike to notice and avoid a pedestrian and a pedestrian to notice and avoid a bike than it is for a car to notice and avoid a bike.


Edit: Obviously this assumes there isn't a dedicated bike lane and there is a sidewalk.For the record I don’t mean bullying strangers is okay. I mean if someone is kinda toxic towards me online and I have time that day, I will happily engage in a bit of back and forth. It’s weird and probably unhealthy but I find it funny most of the time to just argue with people online.When kids are born, parents are responsible about what thoughts are being put inside kids heads. they ultimately control the type of person they become. A kid is more likely to absorb and retain information from people that are closer to them then strangers. Idk I just thought about thisI keep seeing these Reddit threads of "when did a man not get the hint you were interested in him". 

I don't think men are actually that oblivious. It's just that either:

1. It's happened before and they were told that the person was just being friendly

2. They don't want to make the other person feel uncomfortable

3. They dont want to get rejected and have everyone hear this story

Edit: Spellingnot fully sure how to describe it but i just like to itch them. they aren't extremely itchy like poison ivy, and are barely noticeable. when i want to stop itching them i have no problem ignoring it. they're fun in a sense lolWell, everything in the title.

We just pay too much attention to what others have to say. As long as two of you are happy, your relationship is valid and important.I feel like this would solve a hell of a lot of problems. I swear to god half the people I get into debates with online are 12-16 year olds reacting with their hormones. I need to know I’m speaking to an adult.

Just imagine, for example, what YouTube would be like if they didn’t have to worry that kids might be watching every single video. People other than Ryan the toy opener might still be able to make money on there. 

I know we would still have some adult babies online but please just imagine how much quieter Twitter would be.

Edit: I think the kids are mad at meIs it really any coincidence women are always complaining that the clothes they choose to buy don't have pockets and making fun of men for having too many pockets? I've decided if cargo pants aren't cool I'm taking things to the next level and so now I wear a ghostbusters jumpsuit everywhere.I’m Nigerian and this is something I think about a lot. For an example when Black Panther came out lots of African Americans started saying stuff like “for the culture” or “glad our culture is represented” or they wear African clothes (nothing wrong with wearing it for fun) to show that they identify with African culture despite their last African ancestor being alive centuries ago. African Americans are just that AMERICANS. We’re not connected at all. It’s just like a white American trying to claim they’re somehow Irish because they great great grandad was Irish. 

A lot of them also seem to make a big deal about it and say “oh but we were stripped of our identity and culture.” Yeah that’s true and it’s sad what happened to those African slaves but it happened and now you just aren’t African AT ALL. They most likely don’t even know where in Africa their ancestors came from. They should be proud of the African American culture that have built in America and stop trying to claim ours, especially when some only do it when it’s popular. (Like with the Black Panther example).

EDIT: You know this is a pretty unpopular opinion when it doesn’t get tons of upvotes and pushed to the hot section lmao

EDIT: Bruh nvm

EDIT: Wow thanks for the platinum. I only started using Reddit properly recently, anyone know what to do with it?

ANOTHER EDIT lmao: So some people don’t believe I’m black. It’s funny that I had to do this but here’s proof:

https://imgur.com/3guZ1sFIt drives me nuts when people who wake up early brag about it like it’s some accomplishment. These people usually go to bed early too! So why is it that people who go to bed late and get up late are seen as lazy? Some of my best ideas and work happen at night when everyone is asleep, my mind is more clear. I just enjoy night time more than day time, what is so wrong with that? It would be crazy to think that everyone can just have the same sleep schedule and thrive. People have different needs and different rhythms, that is perfectly fine. If you’re a functional person, it shouldn’t matter what time you go to sleep or wake up.

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this post to blow up. Thanks for the awards! I’ve always been a night owl since I can remember. I never wanted to go to bed as a kid or a teen. My parents ran/run a night business and are up all hours of the night. They didn’t make me stay up, but inevitably that’s why my brother and I ended up night owls. It’s hard sometimes but I make it work. I’m still a student, most of my papers get done from 8pm-1am. I’m fine with it.Like bruh, why you even playing if you're scared to be tagged? I don't care if you're tired. Don't make up something that was never established just cuz you don't wanna be tagged. No, that random pebble on the ground is not base. Even if it was, you couldn't just sit there like a punk ass bitch. Play a different game if your inferiority in running is such an issue.Silence is golden.

It is better to remain silent and be assumed to be a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.

People these days just talk and talk, and then wait their turn to talk some more while pretending to listen to what other people have to say.  Nobody listens.  

People also have a terrible habit of talking about things they don't know a goddamn thing about, just for the sake of having something to say.  People are too afraid to say "I don't know" like its some kind of vulgar phrase.  People talk before they think, and act before they think entirely too much.

If what you're about to say doesn't contribute meaningfully to the conversation around you -- why talk?  If what's being talked about doesn't apply to you, or doesn't provide you any benefit, why participate?

I really don't think that the whole "quiet kid" stereotype holds any value -- I think its symptomatic of a population that just flaps their gums way too much and never really has anything meaningful to say.  

You give a lot of yourself away when you talk, you show your hand -- you allow people to make their judgments about you, assess your weaknesses, and manipulate you.  People you don't even know exist probably think you're an asshole because of one thing you said out of turn one time like 5 years ago -- and you don't even know about it, because you probably never think about the things you say or who you say them to.  You just talk for the sake of talking.

Talk less.

Listen more.Yeah, I get it's kind of unsanitary (especially now) and childish (I'm 20), but picking your nose, especially when it's all clogged up with dry snot, is the MOST satisfying thing on this Earth. I literally look forward to when I get home from work/school and can go to town on my nose.I’m sure most of us have those parents or someone who will say “oh you’ll change your mind eventually” No, I don’t think I will. Certain people have the funds and patience to deal with kids and some don’t. But I on the other hand do not have the patience for kids. I’m sick of hearing “well we will see when you get older” Fuck no! Some people don’t have the time to deal with carrying a child for 9 months and having to push that baby out of your vagina or having to get a c-section that messes up your stomach. And don’t get me started on how raising a child is expensive especially in the working class. I rather live my life with no worries about children and that’s absolutely final .

Edit: Ok so there is some people in the comments telling me that “well you are gonna change your mind” and “your ending your bloodline” etc writing long paragraphs as to why humans need children. Uhm what the fuck? YOU are the reason I wrote this! ITS YOU PEOPLE! Who keep nagging about people’s preference. If I say something is final, that’s it unfortunately respect that. Remember this is unpopular opinion not “well I disagree and I’m gonna try and tell you many ways on how my opinion and beliefs are actually better and down vote your post” make it make sense people!I expect this to be not well received as it is an actual unpopular opinion; but math is actually extremely satisfying to do and learn about. In a world full of chaos, where everything you do affects your life and everything can change in a moment's notice, such as a car crash, cancer, job raise, job loss, kicked in the balls by random stranger, 1+1 will always equal 2. 45 degrees will always be half of 90, which will be half of 180 which will then be half of 360, making it a full circle, which is the center of the fibonacci sequence, which can be found in so many every day occurrences it is absolutely ridiculous. In a world of chaos, math is supreme, calculations will never change. Sure, maybe the US education system absolutely fucks over everyone's perception of math by making it insufferable. But what the teachers told us countless times is true, "math is in every day life, and you may be using y=mx+b without even knowing it one day". Maybe forcing us to learn advanced mathematics is what makes our perception of it so twisted, as does handing out sheets with 50 algebraic equations to solve at the start of class as a warmup for a new lesson when you just covered the subject of the 50 you're solving the day before. Math is extremely exciting, solving a complicated geometric problem and being able to confidently circle the right answer on a test is the absolute best feeling. In the words of Jaime Escalante of Stand and Deliver, "Math is the Great Equalizer"

EDIT: Wow my first post to surpass 10 upvotes!! Thank you all for the upvotes and awards.Okay. Please hear me out.

I am an 18 year old university student myself, and I have started to notice some patterns around me that really annoy me. One thing I absolutely hate is when people start to make competitions out of who has it worst. Who has the worst teacher? Who has to stay up the latest? You almost start to feel ashamed if you have a good teacher in a subject! And shame on you if you go to bed on time or wake up early. You are eating healthily as a student? Your study must be super easy! Lucky you!

What those people don't realize is that actually, you don't want to have to study 16 hours a day non-stop for every day. Yes, many claim they do cause it's cool, but most don't actually. Maybe they do work until 2 am, but you are not going to wake up again the next morning at 6 to continue your studies. And if you do run on 4 hours a sleep: that is not cool and nothing to show off with! It is super unhealthy for you, physically and mentally. So please, stop it. Promoting the stereotype of "college student running on four hours of sleep and instant ramen" and making a competition out of it is harmful for many.

Seriously, there are students all around the world who get mental breakdowns due to work overload. In some countries (I'm sorry for including a stereotype here but I'm going to say mostly in asian countries), students have so much pressure that they have increased rates of suicide and burn outs. In the "western world", making a competition out of who is the "unhealthiest" student staying up the latest is not good for anybody. Instead of doing so, people should be happy and thankful for  not being the case!!

(on another side note, I've noticed that

1. many of those who complain about staying up till 4am sleep till 11 am or later
2. many university students would have the money for "healthier" food if they spent less on alcohol

Thanks for hearing me out and good night! looking forward to reading your comments in the morning!

Edit:

Okay wow this blew up. Anyway I'll try going through the comments once I'm done preparing my classes! So bear with me if it might take some while:))

Also I deleted the music thing because I looked into it again and found I had just seen one sided studies before! sorry guys!

(Just for the people saying I can't be doing a hard study: I go to a technical university and my study is considered as one of the harder ones next to aerospace and applied physics. Still, even if it wasn't I don't think it would make my post any less valid.  Many of my fellow students are doing what I described in the post. Still, with proper time management this study is doable while maintaining a somewhat healthy lifestyle.)

On another note, I understand that there are some people who's situation may not allow them to live otherwise, however, I don't believe that that is a majority of university students, as some like to make it seem.Reasons teeth suck:
- you have to brush them 2-3 times a day just to make sure they don’t rot in your mouth
- if you let plaque build up on your teeth and/or get gum disease, the bacteria has been found in arterial plaque meaning not brushing/flossing can lead to heart attacks
- for some reason, teeth are plaque magnets
- They’re entirely misleading because they look like bones but they aren’t bones mainly because they *can’t fucking regenerate*. The one part of my body that looks like a bone and feels like a bone, and would be really handy if it had the ability to regenerate like a bone, *isn’t a bone and can’t regenerate*.
- You’re basically guaranteed to have to get your wisdom teeth removed
- teeth often just don’t come in right at all and it sometimes requires surgery
- the shapes of our teeth creates confusion over whether humans are supposed to eat meat or not
- bonus: ruins blowjobs


Edit: A lot of people are making some pretty valid points about other body parts that are just extremely poor in design so I’ll list them as honorable mentions:

- The dick (and/or balls)
- The spine

Or it would have been so much better if there were no "talking" animals, if it was just about Carl and that kid whose name I don't remember. It had so much potential to be the best adventure-drama animated film telling lessons about grief, growing up, or whatever the film was about but chose not to.

And the death of the wife was clearly an attempt to make the characters/film more ~~tragic~~ Pixar. Gotta give it to them cause it worked. Still let's stop pretending it's a masterpiece. It's no Ratatouille, Incredibles, or TS1/2/3.

But hey, I gave it 3.5/5.0 on Letterboxd. :)

Edit: At least we can all agree Inside Out was a mediocre movie disguising itself as a masterpiece, right? Right?

Edit II: There are a lot of people saying I don't get the movie. Trust me, I do. I've watched countless video essays and read so many articles about it. I've only seen it once but I believe I now know what the film is all about (and for some reason I still can't pinpoint who's who). Maybe it's the way I said it but what I was trying to say is it WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER without the animals. The message can still remain if it was executed differently. But knowing Disney/Pixar, mech comes first. And you guys, you missed the part where I gave it 3.5 that's above average.

Edit III: Would love to accept all your message requests and make friends but I want to live.So I read this thread just now and was shocked! How could Netflix make a tv show about 11 year olds twerking. It’s appalling. Like most others, I read the title and made my mind up. Popular comments included “paedos running Hollywood” and “funded by Epstein”.

Then I decided to actually check out the story. So I watched the trailer. Firstly you noticed it’s a movie, not a show. Secondly it’s french so Hollywood has nothing to do with it. Thirdly, it seems to be about a Mislim girl, forced to act in traditional ways, who becomes interested In dancing. According to reviews, The film CRITICISES the hyper sexualisation of girls and contrasts it with How girls are treated in traditional cultures. Hint - neither is promoted.

It is also a semi autobiographical comedy written and directed by a Senegalese woman! My goodness, I know you Americans have a puritanical streak but this is pretty ridiculous. If you all get this film by an up and coming minority banned before you even watch it then shame on you. It may suck as a film but at least watch it first.Whenever I see a blonde with a tab I think about how much hotter she'd be without it and so far every redheaded woman I've met or seen had been hot AF. Be it natural or dyed the combo of red with fair skin never fails to catch my attention and while there are other great combos like pink and black hair going great with both dark and fair skin. I always seem to notice that redheads are always absent from the conversation and lots of people still lose it for the tan blondes.

PS: thick girls are amazingI know it’s not like this in a lot of place but in the US a lot of people seem to wear shoes inside their house and I cannot help but despise it. Whenever someone walks into my house with shoes I literally can’t stand it, especially if they are walking on a rug or carpet. Shoes are filthy, probably one of the filthiest things we own and I don’t want that filth on my floors. I want to be able to walk around with no shoes and not get dirt on my feet. It’s also just a sign of respect, take your shoes off before you enter someone’s home.Before Apple could make a public statement, they were already given a defense strategy by fanboys. Tech reviewers made videos about the no charger rumor. And soon enough everyone was repeating the same E-waste counter argument. " Why would they include it. Everyone already has a charger. Apple is probably doing it to help the environment". 

While it may be true everyone has a power adapter. Only the people with an 11 pro have the USB-C power adapter. You know, the power adapter for the charging cable included with the phone. Most of the iPhone 12 sells will come from people who don't have an 11 pro. So how much E-waste is really being reduced?

If they truly cared about reducing E-waste why don't they offer some type of recycling program for your old power adapter? That power adapter is basically useless now. New chargers could be made with the help of old ones. Wait... Because it was never about reducing E-waste. Apple will ship nearly the same amount of power adapters. The difference being the amount of money they will make by not including it.This technique seems to be spreading like wildfire. It really doesn’t elicit a feeling of empathy in someone to see your staged photo of when you were just so “beat down by motherhood” (as an example). People will absolutely relate to your message—yes—but the crying photo is such a huge turnoff for me. We don’t need to see you in that real/raw moment even if we’ve been there ourselves. It comes across as if you are desperately starved for attention if your first thought is “let me grab my phone and capture this for the ‘gram.” Please stop.Most of the time, emoji use comes off as fake. Using emotes just seems to have a more endearing and personal touch to texting convos. Not really much to it other than I feel that emotes are better. We are seeing people work longer and longer in society. Some people who are in their 60s or 70s still need to work to pay the bills. I think we are obsessed with working as a society and while I think it’s important to be busy and work, people shouldn’t have to work for pay, in order to survive. We should strive for society to be self sufficient by machines.I think I’m extra sensitive to heat or something and during those 90+ degree muggy days in the summer I literally walk outside and start sweating. It’s miserable. I much prefer freezing cold days where I just have to bundle up a lot to stay warm.Title pretty much says it all. Despite now being in my 30s I’m still shocked at how many people view genuine feedback (even when presented sensitively) as a personal attack. 

A real friend will not be afraid to call you out on your BS. Surrounding ourselves with sycophants just delays personal growth.

Edit: Apparently this opinion isn’t unpopular enough for some of you which is fine but you can quit commenting it now. Y’all are blowing up my inbox.I’m not sure how unpopular this is but I personally hate taking pictures. 

A big pet peeve is when I’m on vacation with my family or girlfriends family and everyone wants to stop every 5 minutes to take some fuck ass picture in front of something that looks cool. Why can’t we just enjoy it for what it is and cherish that memory in idk?! OUR MEMORY?!

It’s also such a waste. My grandmother has probably a TON of photos and i mean that in weight. They just sit in a box collecting dust. 

I also hate portraying a fake smile when I’m having a mediocre time. Yes I’m having a good time but i’m not ecstatic and jumping in joy about it.

Hopefully I don’t sound like a party pooper but it is genuinely annoying.

edit: i didn’t really think this was unpopular. apologies to the triggered.I'm not talking about musicals. I'm talking about regular shows like Greys Anatomy that have a random musical episode every now and then. I don't think that I can adequately express how irritated I get when I settle down to watch an episode of a series I'm really into, and then they start bursting into song every 5 minutes. It's annoying and it's cringey. I mean they're either changing the lyrics of well known songs to fit the script, or they're singing songs that vaguely relate to what's going on in the show. Whats worse is that you can't skip the episode because often big things happen in that episode that affect the rest of the season, so I end up having to torture myself and watch it.To me, theres nothing worse than seeing "non-broadway" actors trying to sing and dance and look natural. Usually their singing is terrible, or they're dubbed over and it's obvious and their dancing is just awkward. Also, if I wanted to watch a musical, I would.

Edit: for clarification, I'm not only talking about Greys Anatomy, it was just the first example that came to mind.

Also, a lot of people are saying that "this isn't an unpopular opinion", I think that it is because everyone agrees that musical episodes suck and then says "except for..." Granted, I haven't watched every example listed but I've watched Scrubs, House, HIMYM, Lucifer, Riverdale, The Office, Psych, The Good Fight and I have not enjoyed ANY of their musical episodes. You don't look cool when you comment on a Rage Against The Machine song saying, "Ooh, none of my friends listen to ***REAL*** music like this," or on a Nirvana song other than Teen Spirit saying, "Like this comment if you listen to the ACTUAL music from Nirvana!" Sure, you listen to these bands, and that's great, but you're not better than someone who likes more mainstream pop and hip-hop. Real fans of bands listen to what they want. Going to a show because you liked 2 songs is weird, but that's your choice.

I despise rap, but i'm not better because I like hardcore punk. Rap is music too, because it has a technical aspect.While I agree that it’s not the business of random people whether you shave your pubic hair, your sexual partner or significant other should be allowed an opinion on it. No, they shouldn’t be rude or forceful about their opinion, but you should care at least a little about your partner’s grooming preferences. If you expect them to go down on you, don’t act like your pubic hair isn’t their business.The reason for this is that women are MORE SELECTIVE.

Think about it. Whenever there is a group of people deciding what to do, it's more efficient to have the most picky person decide, since their choice is most likely to be accepted by the other members. Otherwise everyone else has to work to find something the picky person will accept, and that's excess work.

Well that's EXACTLY what happens in the dating world. Women are more picky, but rather than take in upon themselves to decide who they want to date and act upon it, they more often expect the men to come to them, creating more work overall.

Let's use numbers to illustrate. Let's say (hypothetically) that a man will agree to date 20% of women, and women will agree to date 10% of men.

In this case, if a woman is looking to date, we would expect a match after she asks out 5 men she approves of.

If instead she makes the men do all the work, we would expect a match after 10 men ask her out.

Even a hybrid is more efficient than this. If the woman asks out 2 men, 6 men asking her out in addition are then required for there to be an expected match. That's 8 attempts, which is less than 10.

Clearly, in a world where women are more selective, allocating the work to men just complicates the process. Since women are the ones who have a narrower selection of potential mates, let them decide who they want, since they have a worse chance of being turned down.Truth and transparency in advertising.  Even a broad salary range would be better than nothing and would leave room open for negotiation, salary depending on experience, etc.  Otherwise, you're just wasting everyone's time.  How would the applicant know for sure if this job is a step up or down, or if applying is even worth their time?I myself included. 

From a young age we are literally taught not to question authority, to sit quiet and not ask questions - which is like great for creating workers, but terrible for members of a democracy. 

I considered myself a super-duper smart man, but for a long time, I really didn't know how to think critically. I would know the who, what, where, when, and how (which is like 20% of the thought process).

The why however (the other 80%) - was always underdeveloped as even though I thought I knew concepts, I had trouble linking them and synthesizing new opinions of my own. 

Too many of us hear an opinion, choose it as our own, and defend it without objectively trying to understand why we do so. And how it connects to our other opinions for that matter (does it conflict, disprove, support, etc.)

I really think critical thinking should be as mandatory as English or Math on it's own.

Edit: some people were offended by my 'above average' intelligence comment so I changed it for clarityEveryone always talks about actual breakups with a partner but nobody ever talks about how much a friendship breakup can be the worst kind of heart break and can be harder to move on from. Everyone can expect a romantic relationship to come to an end, and even when they do, you will find someone new....

Unlike friendship breakups, you never expect the person you’ve probably have grown up with, known longer than any romantic partner who’s been with you through thick and thin to ever become a stranger.

You’ll never be able to find someone who understands and vibes with you so well either if they walk out. 

There. That’s my unpopular opinion.

TL;DR: Friendship heart breaks are worse than any romantic heart break. You don’t ever expect it and it can be harder to move on from than a romantic heart break.I’m sorry but whose fucking idea was it to make a straw out of paper! Any buffoon knows that paper and liquids do not go well together. 

Look, I’m totally for not using single-use plastic products! That’s fine, and it’s better for the environment if we do so. However, plastic straws make up 0.025% of the total plastic waste currently in the ocean. The way I see it, focusing so heavily on straws simplifies the real problem too much and prevents real change from happening. From my research, recent plastic straw bans haven’t even made any noticeable difference, likely because the entire straw problem is relatively negligible. 

Also, compost straws exist. They are actually way sturdier than plastic straws and I feel better using them for obvious reasons. 

Fuck paper straws.Devices

Growing up I didn't have my own phone or tablet til I could pay for it with my own money. I got a job as a dishwasher when I was 14 and paid for my first phone and it felt great. Now I take a look around me and take a look at my family and see that a lot of children have their own devices. My younger sister recently got my mom's old phone and my younger brothers use my dad's iPad constantly. I understand times are changing and a new generation is growing but I still don't think kids should be allowed to have their own devices til they can responsibly pay for it or take care of it. The devices they use are constantly needing to be cleaned and in bad condition. Personally when I have kids of my own, they won't be on mobile devices til they are at least 10.

Social media

Social media can ruin the idea of growing up in a split second. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook etc can all have a positive impact on young minds teaching them things and all that, but it will mostly be negative if they use it. They will get addicted and want to watch YouTube all day and one wrong search can lead to uncomfortable conversations and things they shouldn't know until they are older. My younger brothers and cousins are watching YouTube constantly and the stuff they watch is extremely weird and in some cases scary. I worry that it's taking away from their child hood and just mind numbing them.
Thanks for reading if you got this far.

Edit: I have seen a lot of people who got a device at a younger age around ages nine through eleven for communication with their parents I do not have an issue with this. However it is when a parent just gives their child a device wether it be a mobile phone or tablet that is fully paid for is when I start to disagree with the parents decision.You think we are racist? 

Try living in an Asian country.

You think we’ve done terrible thing to our own people?

Look up the Saami people of Norway.

You think we are too strict on border control?

Try crossing the border illegally in the Middle East.

You think our laws on pot are too strict?

Try getting caught with weed in China.

My point is everywhere has been through some shit. There is bad shit everywhere. And pointing the finger at one country makes you look foolish.Seriously, what other drug can you DIE from withdrawal? How often do you hear the latest car crash due to alcohol intoxication? It's a mind altering substance that frequently makes people aggressive, unaware (Which people use to get others very drunk just to use as a grounds of rape), uncoordinated, ect.

Even if I also enjoy a beer or two once in a while, and I don't shame people for enjoying what they enjoy. You do you.

But the fact that society as a whole is constantly shoving it into media, advertising, and stores without recognizing the very real dangers of it is bewildering to me.

Edit: Wow! This blew up, thanks for my first silvers!

Edit 2: Sorry for not being aware of the lethal withdrawal of benzo's I will keep that in mind, thanks guys!

Edit 3: Thanks for the gold kind stranger <3This is so common and I never see anyone talk about it. People love to claim that they will support friends and family members through their mental illness, but as soon as they exhibit a symptom, it’s blaming and abandonment. Here’s an example I’ve seen: your parent claims to be supportive when you get diagnosed with depression, says they are there for you, you fall into a depressive episode and stay in bed all day, suddenly you’re just lazy, ungrateful, and unmotivated. When you tell them your depressed, you get met with eye rolls and sighs. This is extremely common. You go into a relationship and the other person knows you have a panic disorder. One day, you’re having an episode and snap at them while in an agitated state, and it leads to them complaining about how that was uncalled for and you’re just being a moody bitch. No, I’m not saying anyone is obligated to be supportive or be your therapist, but do not pretend to be supportive towards someone with a mental illness when you will jump ship at the first symptomatic occurrence. Don’t claim to support friends/family members with mental illnesses, and then get mad at them when they show symptoms and make them feel even worse. (Disclaimer: I AM NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT SOMEONE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS I AM SAYING PEOPLE PRETEND TO AND THEN DO THE OPPOSITE OF BEING SUPPORTIVE)I'm not talking about running sportively, I'm talking about running just to get somewhere faster. Why can't I do it without people judging me? I have the body condition and energy to do so and I don't want to spend 15min walking. 

Everytime an adult is seen running, people automatically think that he is late, or that he is running from something dangerous, or that something is wrong in general. People are limited to walking.



Edit: To people saying that I should just ignore the judgment because no one cares: I'm kinda known in this part of the city, since it's mainly a student's neighborhood, so yeah, people care

Edit 2: But I love those comments of people saying how they ignore the socially accepted, you guys are inspiring me

Edit 3: Looks like we should start a revolution

Thank you for the silver! That's my first; 
Aaand first goldI play video games to explore and get invested in the story line. I hate when games get tedious and you get stuck for hours or days on one single part because the difficulty level is set so high. I hate dying over and over again just to get to the next scene. I just want to see what happens next and advance through the game and see what perks I can earn by completing objectives and discovering things.

\*EDIT - This is the most attention a post of mine has ever gotten. I received awards that I don't even know what they mean. Thank you for the upvotes, downvotes, awards, gold, and comments everyone!That's right, I said it. As a guy who likes girls, IG "models" are creepy as hell. Their profile is only pictures of themselves. They have nothing going on in their lives. They have no intrest or hobbies. Only selfies. No matter how attractive they seem at first, I see 1000 pictures of just them and feel nauseated. 1000 pictures of them in different environments but it's all about them. The subject matter of the photo is always focused on them. To me it looks like all they think about is themselves. If you talked to someone who could only hold a conversation about themselves, it would be off putting. I view social media pages the same way. What are you expressing? A picture is worth a thousand words but a million selfies is worth nothing.

Edit: took someone's adviceYou can control your weight, but you cannot control your height. If you have weight problems you should try and help them. I can’t tell you how to live your life but you shouldn’t accept something that could greatly shorten your life if you can use hard work and determination to solve it. I’ve learned to accept my height. I can’t change it, so why stress about it? I just have to live with it because there’s nothing I can do about it. Weight, that’s a different story


EDIT: a lot of people are saying “why not both”, but the answer is in the post. Being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so I feel like it shouldn’t be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

Also I would like to add that pretty much anything you can’t change like your skin color and face should be a part of it too.A proper hamburger or cheeseburger should never have ketchup. It dominates the flavor and all you taste is shit. If I want to get the tomato profile, I will put a fucking tomato on my burger and not some pasty, corn syrup, sugary sissy bullshit. Every burger place puts ketchup on the burger by default, so I have to always ask for no ketchup and have the chance of them fucking it up. You ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

Putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

It's fat dumb people sauce. Its the keystone or natty light of sauce. Its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. You can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume. Ketchup kills more people in America then terrorism and drugs, yet we don't have a War on Tomatoes. The world would be better without ketchup.The Josh battle was funny. However, copying the original Josh war by scheduling a Nathan/John/Tyler/etc. battle for next year is super unoriginal and basically destroys the entire joke. It aint funny.I worked one year in fast food and by far the best and most patient customers were teenagers. If there was a long wait they'd just be on their phone or ask for an update respectfully. The adults on the other hand came in with an entitled attitude, and if there was a wait (because the drive thru was packed and so was lobby) they'd ask where there quarter ponder meal was? The special orders needed to be inspected right at the drive thru window, each and every burger while holding uo a line of cars. Teens on the other hand grab their food and leave. 

Adults need to start taking some lessons on manners from the youthBeing obese is unhealthy. To love something is to want what is best for that thing. Being obese is not best for your body. Being healthy is best for your body. 

*Being thicc, or 'big boned', or having a large stature is befferent then being obese, or fat.

**Also, something like a thyroid disorder is different. Obviously 'taking care of yourself' means something different in those kind of cases.

***This is specifically pointed at a lack of self control and discipline in regards to food, and will power and discipline towards a healthy lifestyle.I said it. I enjoy a coffee drink once in a while, but not to the level of the ones who NEED their fix first thing in the morning even before brushing their teeth. Then they need it in their to go cups, and one for that afternoon surge. What’s worse is the fact that these are the same folks who will need another hit later and then blame the fact that they didn’t have their coffee when they were pissed off or not optimally functioning. All excuses. 

This is an extreme case, but in all due honesty, even the ones that need their morning coffee... I low key judge them. I think you can totally function without it.

Edit 1. I tried to respond to as many people as I could but this is hard. First of all, thank you all for comments. I had some great revealing conversations and a lot of people agreed and disagreed. I learned a ton of reasons why people drink coffee besides the obvious few. It opened my eyes. Thank you all. To the ones that were triggered because of some of my language but chose to converse. I apologize. 

Edit 2. To some of the weird hypocrites that were reporting, dming me separately, and just taking this coffee rant emotionally. You know you’re behaving exactly like people who haven’t had their coffee. I was laughing at it all. Thanks for that. 

Edit 3. This is an unpopular opinion sub. What the hell did you expect on here?I don’t care anymore. I hate chihuahuas. They’re so small and stupid looking it pisses me off to no end. I’ve known a lot of people have own/owned one, and I hated every single one of them. 

The “clickity clack” of their ugly little uncut nails, how small their fucking heads are; you can’t even pet them on their heads because instead you’re petting their nasty, watery eyes. The fact that they’re smaller than my cat in itself is an abomination. My ex has one of those critters and loves it to pieces, I don’t even miss the relationship solely for the fact that I never have to see that mf again.

And they are so aggressive. Why??? They have so much nothing going on in their life they have to bark like a constant squeak toy and literally attack every person that comes to the door. What are you gonna do? Rip my leg off? Doubt. Thats my rant.I got kicked out the day I turned 18. Why? My parents think that should be the culture.

I had just a few thousand saved and went off to college! Nearly got broke due to the mass of bills I had, and not being able to support myself on working while at university. I nearly went homeless. I really wanted to go home and save up for a few months.

I asked, and nope. The words of my father was “be a man” k dad. 

So I started working 40 hours a week and going to uni. Long story short I failed some classes. 


This culture is dumb. Rarely any 18-19 year old can fully support themselves. The internet is fucked up dude and I mean really fucked up. Not to mention half their childhood is not even gonna be memorable because it's just gonna be in front of a screen.I've only experienced this once myself. It wasn't the only reason we never were together again, but I did think it was a crazy thing for a woman to say to me. Even if you were able to get past the incestual overtones -- I can't.  It is just a bizarre phraseology; it is neither affectionate nor playful.

My assumption is women (or men) who say this, think it turns their partner on, more than getting anything from it themselves.  But that's just an uneducated guessIs it me, or are Instagram and Facebook absolutely filled to the brim with people saying you need a side hustle or to get up at 4 am and work till 8 pm to get anywhere in life? Even Linked in has nonsense about starting your own small business from home in the evening. 

6 Months ago these same platforms were all about self care and putting yourself first every now and then, can we go back to that?

I assume this is an unpopular opinion given the number of shares/likes/comments and tbh the sheer number of posts!

Edit: 4am to 8pm

Edit 2: response to a few common comments

Yes this may be popular on reddit but it's unpopular in the wider world as grind culture has set in post pandemic

No, I am not influenced by these people and never have been. But I volunteer with young people who are very interested in what this idiots have to say and that's where the problem lies

I follow dogs and warhammer on insta and that's it, I see this through the discovery page which is 50% relevant content 50% utter nonsense

Edit 3: can people try and be a little more civil, getting a bit tired of reading how I'm am idiot. Disagree please, but remeber there is some one on the other sideSince I know some of you will inevitably say it, this may be a “popular opinion” to **you** but based on comments I’ve seen all over Reddit for nearly a decade it is not a universally popular opinion by any means. 

Anyway, if you find out someone has been having an affair with you, it should be a no brainer to expose that person. 

I’m not sure where this whole idea of “it’s none of my business” comes from when someone directly involved you and made you complicit in their lies. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

If you are someone who wouldn’t say anything, you’re part of the problem. 

As that famous quote by apparently a number of people  says:

“There are two kinds of evil people in this world. People who do evil stuff and people who see evil stuff being done and don’t try to stop it.”

Don’t be that person. 

Edit: Some of you seem to be missing that the situation I’m talking about here is where *you* are the person that the person is cheating with. I’m not talking about inserting yourself into a situation involving infidelity you had nothing to do with.

Also, it is entirely possible the person you tell may get upset with you and if that’s the case just block them and move on with your life or if you’re worried about your own safety don’t say anything. 

It helps to remember that their anger has nothing to do with you personally and is a projection because their worldview has been upended. Try not to personalize it.

Lastly, those of you proudly talking about how you don’t/wouldn’t say anything are assholes. You’d want it done for you but won’t give the same courtesy? Congratulations on being the worst kind of person and making this world just a little shittier.Seriously I'm tired of AAA and other games being like 150gb for unnoticeable increases in graphics quality. We're at the point where it doesn't really mater bc the graphics are so good. Game developers should try to focus on making their games smaller (storage wise) and getting them to require less powerful equipment. I and most other people don't want to or can't spend 5k+ on a gaming pc to experience their games at 4k 512 fps. I'd like to be able to play nice games on my laptop without it sounding like a plane or turning into a heater. And it's ridiculous that on a 500 Gb device I could have like 3 or 4 modern AAA games.

Edit: to everyone saying this isn't an unpopular opinion, please look at one of the several hundred comments calling me an idiot. To those calling me an idiot, this is my ***opinion*** based on what I, someone not in the industry, has seen and experienced. I'm saying that developers should focus less on graphics and more on optimization and building better stories or making their maps actually playable and not 90% inaccessible, or physics engines that work. There are other more important factors in a game than trying to achieve an unachievable dream of perfect graphics. 

And to everyone calling me a poor person, just- stop? I'm not and that wasn't the point of this post. You're just making yourself look like a dick biscuit.

Okay because apparently I have to explain this to some people like they're 5, good or bad graphics do not nessasarily mean other aspects are good or bad. But development has limited resources and I feel that if studios were to focus on other more important aspects of the games they make it would lead to a better game and experience. It doesn't matter how good your graphics are if everything else suffers from it. I got tired of playing AC Valhalla because I spent more time in loading screens than the actual game play. And that's with having the entire game loaded on M.2 ssd, which the game took up a massive portion of the storage.I'll make it clear I don't hate every online game Splatoon 2 being an example of one I like but it pales in comparison to offline games here why.

1. You are very limited what's their games you can play when's the last time you played an online 3D platformer probably never I don't want to just play shooters all day I want variety.

2. There is a much better immersion in single player games in a single player game you can have a good story with beginning middle and end with a great story excellent voice acting and amazing world's to venture on your own in. I know mmos sometimes do this but other people being in my game ruin it for me.

3. I like the control if I want to go to the bathroom I can easily spot in a single player game go I can't do that online.

4. The NPCs are great many single player games have colourful NPCs you can interact with.

5. I do not want to play online games with my friends I'd much rather have them physically with me and do couch multiplayer.Idk how much you guys see this but every time I go on Snapchat or Instagram there’s hella people who only post videos of themselves lip syncing to shitty trap or whatever kind of music. UNLESS THE PERSON WHO POSTS IT IS HOT, Who actually sits through a whole video of that? It’s so cringe worthy and painful to see. Like what’s the point? Do you think it’s attractive or some shit? I’m not saying that everyone who does it is bad. I’m talking about those who just half ass it for a quick compliment from their friends. Also keep your damn tiktoks off of Instagram and Snapchat. If I wanted to stoop to that level I would go to the app. Post a selfie with your friend or a video of your dog. We all do that kind of shit. But seriously? Why do we need to see a 40 second video of you lip syncing to some shitty mumble rap or pop or other kind of song?

Edit: there are people saying this isn’t an unpopular opinion. I’ve never heard anyone express this before so I don’t know exactly how unpopular it is. I guess while it isn’t unpopular, it isn’t talked about so that’s why I kept it here. And also, I’m not trying to hate on people. It’s just that most of the times it’s very awkward and cringeworthy. And I know, their story, their content and rules but that doesn’t mean we have to like it. There are times where it’s actually good but most of what I see are people who barely know the lyrics and just look dumbTitle says it all. Usually if I’m eating a hotdog or burger the water just soaks up into the bread to give it a fuller taste. Never has ever been a problem to meFor the past four years or so, every time someone asks me to go to the theatre they will inevitably suggests we go see the new marvel movie. Which marvel movie? Doesn't matter, because they shit out one a week and there is literally always some running. 

I remember the first time I noticed the excitement. It was for the one with Loki in it (no idea the actual title) and I thought: Wow! Looks pretty good, maybe I'll check it out. And then another one came out. And then another. And another. Each time everyone tells me that THIS is the superhero movie to see, because xyz character makes an appearance or whatever the fuck.

I'm so bored. My beloved theatre has been eaten up by Captain America and Black Panther. No originality, no attempt to divert the formula, nothing. I can't be the only person who is not entertained, but everyone I know loves them and goes to watch them religiously. ENT resident here. For those who don't know, children born deaf can typically qualify for FDA-approved cochlear implantation around 12 months of age. The results are astonishing, and I have met many children 3-5 years of age who were born deaf, had cochlear implants placed, and now show no evidence of ever having had a hearing disorder. 

The deaf community believes that by treating one of their deaf children in this way, you deny that child the chance to be a part of their community. Fine, maybe that's the case, but this then assumes that these people prefer a child be hindered for the rest of his/her life for the deaf community's selfishness. 

The idea that anyone would be ok with letting a child have a handicap go uncorrected for selfish reasons is evil, and I refuse to see it any other way.In talks with my friends, I mention the skin color or ethnicity of the person I'm talking about. It's just a descriptor, like height, hair color, etc. You're just making it easier to picture what the person looks like. There's nothing offensive about it. And if you do think that it's offensive, you're implying that the person's skin color is an insult.Tired of seeing dumb people say "I'm not a dude! I'm a girl".

That's cool, dude. But I say dude a lot, dude. So I'm not about to change 25% of my sentence structure because I found out you have no balls. Dude.It's trashy af

And it's EVERYWHERE. So many artists glorify stealing "someone's man" or "getting with your girl" and it's so toxic.
If someone nonchalantly said this in a conversation, assuming your a decent person, you'd probably be thrown off by it. Why is it different when it sounds nice?

Breakup with your girlfriend, because I'm bored

You can GPS your man if you're looking for me

If he got a big dick, he won't get his bitch back

And these are popular songs. 
I'm sure you guys can think of more.
I love some of those artists, but i can't even bring myself to enjoy these songs. I don't think these things should get attention, especially if it's positive.Pretty much title. 

I think it’s been at a point where Christmas is a cultural holiday and not a religious one at this point. And most of my non-Christian and immigrant friends agree that Christmas is an American holiday, not a Christian one, despite its origins.Its so much more stressful and unnerving, it'd be so much easier to just throw up with out knowing it was going to happen (like 20 minutes before). Idk thats just what I think.People on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

Sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. And you just have to give credit where credits due. But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything. 

I used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately I've been really turned off by it. Maybe I just need a break.


Edit: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD AND SILVER!  Wow. This blew up... I just wanna add something to this. I'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. One of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. I agree. I'm saying that when I'm intrigued by a post sometimes I really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. But a lot of the time all I see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. Sometimes I really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

Edit: I never talked about acceptance speeches being annoying. I also never gave one. I said thank you. I'm learning real quick that a lot of people don't actually read your posts before commenting. LmaoNow don't downvote this because you disagree, I know its an unpopular opinion, but I am genuinely uncomfortable by people watching porn while they're in a relationship with me. It honestly feels like cheating. Why would you need to get sexual gratification somewhere else when I am literally right here willing to give you all the material you could ever want? Why do you need to get that from another woman? 

I'm currently in a serious relationship and I've talked this through with my partner and he is ok with it and respects my boundaries. I am completely committed to the person I'm dating and I will only go to them for things that I deem exclusive to a romantic relationship, therefore I expect the same from them. When I masturbate I only masturbate to them and I expect the same. When I feel genuine romantic emotions, I only feel them toward them, and I expect the same. The reason being is that I am very, very serious about long term relationships and I'd feel like I was doing something very wrong if I thought of anyone else in this way.

If you've discussed it with your partner and you're both ok with porn, thats cool, but I've been pressured by multiple people in the past to act like I'm ok with it, but I just never have been. Porn is something I'm highly uncomfortable with, it makes me feel jealous and betrayed and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough. Those should be valid emotions to feel, but people try to make it seem like its irrational to feel that way when I truly believe it isn't. 

I know a lot of people feel the same way as me, just know that its ok to set boundaries in your relationship because your feelings are just as valid as your partner's. That goes for anything, really.

Edit: How I sleep knowing that I have a healthy relationship with someone I love and respect. 😴😴😴I am a teacher and years ago at a high school graduation the keynote speaker finished his big long winded talkathon with a declarative "and kids... PUT AWAY THE PHONES!"

And the parents in this crowd erupted like this dweeb was Bruce Springsteen counting down Born in the USA. Meanwhile these numbskulls had THEIR phones out the whole time. 

&#x200B;

1. Kids do not NEED cell phones. They want them. In the end you WANT them to have it or they wouldn't. (I'm dog dirt old and found a phone anytime I had a problem as a kid.)
2. There is nothing WRONG with buying kids a phone but acting like they're a defective generation because YOU gave them an incredibly addictive device and then stopped paying attention to it is shitty parenting. 
3. ALMOST ALL of those parents are just as addicted to their stupid phones, it's how the tech sector has molded society.

ALL I'm asking is for a little intellectual honesty here people.Why can the Jews forgive Germany and the Germans so much, but black Americans seem like they won't be letting go of the grudge, and are telling their children to carry the torch of that grudge to further generations?

I'm metis so I hate myself and kind of get it, but it feels like it's ingrained culturally at this point and is more a point of racial pride instead of an actual gripe about the past.

Edit: Taiwan is a beautiful country and China can fuck off.

(Unrelated but it’s whatever)Now this isn't about anyone who was assaulted by many men, this is for those that brought their own pain.


Women that say this usually love the bad boy type, the cold and disassociated, and yet complain about how all men are trash because that's the kind of men they go for. They brought their own pain and gotta lay in their own bed now that they made.


I know this'll be brought up, but the men that say all women are trash go for the hoes and the cheaters and then complain they get cheated on.


Edit: holy shit that's a lot of upvotes, thanks for the rewards kind strangers!


Edit number 2: Can y'all stop calling me a nice guy I don't wanna reply *I'm a asshole* to every one of y'all lmaoI am a minimum wage worker ffs, I'm not sure YouTube realises that a majority of its viewers simply cannot afford to add another item to their list of bills and expenses. And them targeting everyone who doesn't have Premium with unskippable ads to try and get us to cave is pretty shameful.  

*During a pandemic that requires most of us to remain indoors, no less.*  

A better and more effective strategy would have been to give YouTube users Premium *for free* for the duration of the pandemic. This way, YouTube gets props for being a Chad and understanding that nobody wants to be stuck inside with nothing to do but game and watch internet videos, and they would probably get a bunch of people to say "you know what? Maybe YouTube isn't so scummy after all, I think I *will* buy Premium when the pandemic is over!"  

Sure, a lot of people would go back to their vanilla ad-filled YouTube when it's over because, again, an unnecessary expense, but they would definitely win some people over with a gesture like that, or at least make people give it more consideration.  

The current strategy of "let's bombard our viewers with as many double unskippable ads as possible" just makes me want to watch plain old TV instead. At least TV has *some* variety with their commercials...  

Edit: alright, *alright*, I'll check out this "vanced" y'all keep recommendingAlcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I’ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don’t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify I don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly. 

TLDR: alcohol will basically negativity effect every aspect of your life if you drink regularly.I’ve heard so many people say rain is depressing. Or like puts them in a bad mood. 
RAIN IS AMAZING 
I love rain and cold more than I love sun and warmth. 
I feel like exploring and walking outside and it reminds me of shopping and highway drives home. Rain is like not sad at all. Plus staying inside is a vibe :3There are too many movies where the good guys prevail, everyone gets what they want and live happily ever after, the end. And if it’s not all rainbows and unicorns at the end, you know there’s a sequel coming, and then they will get the happy end of the story with a ribbon on top. I WANT a movie ending where EVERYBODY is miserable so it can at least be not predictable, and maybe a lil more realistic.This may get a lot of backlash but think about it. If you were to ask any single mother who the #1 person in her life is, she would, without a doubt, say her child/children. And you would never take that #1 spot. I am looking for my #1, not my #2.

EDIT: A lot of people are saying this isn't an unpopular opinion but I catch a lot of flak for this stance. 

I also dont believe this preference is equal to someone who decides not to date someone based on height.There's been a couple movies I've been looking forward to this year; Tenet & Dune. Sadly, Tenet didn't do as well as it could have upon its release due to COVID and hence Dune has been pushed back a year.

I get that the superhero genre is approachable for all age groups. But its probably the most cookie cutter genre ever. All the good superhero flicks like Push (2009) and Blade (1998) are so overlooked.

Edit: For those saying "superheroes are fantasy" I mean fantasy *other* than superheroes. >_>

Edit 2: Man, some salty dudes here. Like I get it, you might not consider my taste in "Push" or "Blade" to be good. But this is unpopular opinions. I happen to like Push because it's a superhero heist flick, it's brilliant. And I like Blade because he's the OG Buffy.  So please chiiiiillll. 🥰A fancy, decadent burger these days is super tall with lots of layers that you can’t hope to fit in your mouth easily. Burgers are a finger food, the bun means that you can hold it but some of these things need deconstructing or to use a knife and fork. One of the few requirements for food is that it fits in your mouth, why not make it easier by making it shorter. If you want more, just have 2 normal burgers. Applies to other foods too. I would even go a step further and say I would love for all food to come in bite size pieces, but then I would probably be happy with a “one a day” food pill so....

Edit: Wow, my first ever “this blew up”. Thanks so much for the awards kind redditors

Edit 2: A lot of comments that this isn’t unpopular, seems now like that’s a fair point, so why all the tall burgers. No restaurant owners on this sub? Well, it was fun while it lasted. Sorry

Edit 3: Unsure why so many people are saying “you just described a sub/Subway”. A sub style burger would be one option to get more food in a shorter format, sure. Not really advocating that as the one and only solution though. I’ve seen that subway do the rectangular beef slabs which is a guess what you’re talking about? Hardly a replacement for a burger though, particularly when you aren’t in subwayMayonnaise significantly enhances the taste of pears. My favorite type of pear to eat with mayo is slices pear from a can, with a fresh pear bring the second choice. There is no better way to eat pears and I will die on this hill.

Edit: I don’t have the stuff for it right now, but [here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/QlvKkQr.jpg) from google to show it’s actually a thing people doThere's something nauseating about 'wholesome' stuff. Mybe I'm a cynic, but to me it's clearly shallow and feels like a condescending pat on the back.

For example, I make a lot of chilled-out Lofi music - and It's a pretty wholesome environment, as you can imagine. A lot of the people who make it are super nice, and if there's one thing you need to know to understand my argument it's that I DON'T HATE KIND PEOPLE. The issue is when ridiculously wholesome comments are given for no reason, with no context, in the middle of conversations.

Picture the scene: I'm chilling in a discord server talking to a friend about chords or something, when some guy I've never met randomly pipes up with 'Hey, I don't know who needs to hear this, but whoever you are, wherever you are, you mean a lot to a lot of people. Suicide is never the answer, stay positive and do what you love 🙏' or something along those lines.

I agree with his message, but it means absolutely nothing if there's no context or reasoning behind it. I also understand that this message could have a profoundly positive impact on someone going through tough times. And that's amazing, I'm glad there are people in this world who dedicate time to helping to motivate and help out people in need. But there's a seperate text channel in that specific discord server for mental-health-related topics, this guy just chucked it into general in the middle of a conversation and left. It's things like that that makes me think they don't mean it - that makes these comments feel shallow. 

But yeah feel free to flame me in the comments for being a hateful cynic or somethingI see a lot a registered news sources pushing stories that are plain out wrong or misleading. When I was younger I would just be live that because they were considered a news source, they were right. I had to learn that many of these sources are wrong but sometimes it's hard to actually know what happens because everyone is selling a different story. I feel like companies that are news sources should be held accountable if they get facts wrong and or are biased. If a person wants to share their opinion on a topic it's fine but I hate when news sources do it just to get more clicks. I feel like it is at a point where it should be considered a crime or there should be a punishment. I want to make clean, news organizations should be held accountable, if individual people want to, it's fine.People should stop proposing on public, the pressure and stress experienced by people who were proposed to in public makes some people just say yes because they don't want to embarrass the other party.Both the left and right wings of politics do this, and Reddit is especially guilty. Reddit tends to have a very set group of acceptable opinions, e.g. fortnite bad, Instagram bad, etc, and are utterly uncompromising and will beat people to shit for having opposing views. it's a cancerous mentality and it's poisoning the community.The black and white looked good with the rest of the apps on my home screen and the red just looks kinda ugly and tacky. 

I know that it was changed for political reasons, but I wish they had just kept it or given the option to change the app icon back to it like some other apps did.Every time I see it, it makes me want to gag. Watching people cut open their egg and have it get over all their food ruins my appetite. If you enjoy runny egg yolk, I bet you enjoy eating boogers too.

Edit: I want to start a fight with each of you individuals that like runny egg yolk.

Edit 2: For all those I’ve picked a fight with, fuck each and every one of you. Pick a Denny’s parking lot, or any parking lot for that matter, and let’s fight. If you all choose the same parking lot, I don’t care, I’ll die for this.

Edit 3: You think I’m scared caused I haven’t been replying to comments? No. I’ve been taking names and compiling a list of all of you that are getting an ass beating. So far, you horny egg yolk lovers are all tied for 1st place. (I’m also at work, so like priorities, but still fuck you)I'm a social worker and, so far, every grandparent I've met has been horrible and I can absolutely see why their kids turned to drugs, violence, are mentally unstable, etc. There are tiny children in the world who want to commit suicide because their grandparents' ability to parent is so poor that they think beating their asses over a small slight is reasonable (obviously I report this but it still happened). There are kids whose grandparents are racist toward them because their children dated outside of their race. There are grandparents who talk about their grandchildren and children like they're the scum of the earth...in front of those kids. In front of 6 year olds. Don't even get me started in their horrific worldviews that all seem to be "everyone in poverty is just not trying hard enough/no one should receive public help except for me." This stuff is not uncommon. In fact, I haven't met a single GOOD guardian who  was a grandparent. I'm sure there are many, but maybe let's consider more than finances and immediate safety while placing kids so these awful grandparents can't mess up ANOTHER generation of humans.Don't get me wrong, I like dogs; I have 2 of them. But they're not these selfless, perfect heroes who live only to serve the greater good.

They're individuals with individual personalities. Some are friendly and loving, some are more stand-offish and don't like people or other dogs very much, and some, like some people, are fucking assholes.

Some dogs will rescue kids from rubble, some will help stop seizures, and some will bite your feet in the middle of the night because you dared to roll over and rustle the covers.

Some dogs want to play with everyone and every dog they meet. Some will attach themselves to the pants legs of your nice neighbor who was just trying to bring in the groceries, then bark their stupid little heads off at every single person, car, dog, squirrel, or leaf that goes past the window, so you move all the furniture away from the window so she can't see out anymore but it doesn't matter because she can still *hear* the cars and the little fucker just Won't. Stop. Barking.

Sometimes they're lovable friends who want to play all the time. Sometimes they try to bite you every time you sit on the fucking couch. It's been 12 years, I'm allowed on the couch. Get it through your stupid, grapefruit-sized dog head already!

Anyway, yes, we deserve dogs. Dogs are just people. Some are cool, some suck.Everyone wants to make it a commonality to thank soldiers and first responders for their service as it is some unspoken American custom. Yet no one else is afforded this gratitude for the very important service they provide in their daily job duties like truck drivers for example. 

How would the goods we purchase at markets even get there if it weren’t for the truck drivers transporting it? With the most recent pandemic we see how quickly goods can disappear off the shelf that the public isn’t even going to use before the pandemic has passed. There are some people who won’t have to buy toilet paper for months, they will have plenty of potatoes they will have to throw out because they will run out of ideas of how to make use of them after having gone crazy buying up too many while in their panicked state of mind. The same would happen in a matter of days if all trucks stop running. No one thanks the truck drivers though. They certainly complain about them being on the roadways when they are running late and getting stuck behind them. 

If we are going to thank soldiers and first responders for their service then why not the truck drivers also after seeing just how important a role they play for each and everyone of us?Title. The fact that Reddit still doesn’t have a hide post history option is unbelievable. Too many fuckin internet detectives searching for anything they can find to bring you downThey don’t use sex in advertisement and exposed bodies of both male and female to attract views, potential customers, ad revenue etc. because it DOESN’T get attention. 

Do you really think that almost 100 years of “sex sells” brainwashing that I’m not going to look at a pair of exposed breasts getting sucked on in public...

Can we get real?So many people defend scalping in-demand items because “sUpLy aNd DeMaNd” or “nOt iLlEgAl”. But as we all have surly noticed, scalpers are now buying things like movie tickets,sporting events, snacks, children toys and so much more. If people continue to be stupid enough to buy these products at outrageous prices and regulations and procedures aren’t put into place this will slowly become the norm and will completely change how we purchase the things we desire.

Only edit: 

1. I don’t give a fuck if it’s legal, logical or personally beneficial. If you scalp you’re actual cabbage. It’s all fun and money until it becomes a problem and negatively affects you 


2. A lot of people don’t mind or support scalping so I thought it fit the sub. Down vote me and piss off.Basically the title. You should be able to bully bullies back and beat them up. I was bullied in elementary school and I got in trouble when I beat the shit out of my bully. It's complete bullshit.I just wrapped up a session of breaking the spirits of two little girls in super smash brothers.  Their father tried to avenge them and failed, their mother frowned with disdain and perhaps disappointment.  I recall similar experiences, like when my 7 year old cousin thought he could defeat me, a 25 year old man at the time, in a wrestling match.  Kid thought he was John Cena when he entered the ring with me, but he soon learned that he had a long way to go before he became the greatest.

Children need to be humbled in the presence of real ultimate power, not coddled and patronized.  Children need to learn that you can't be good at something by just trying it once without any practice or dedication.  I live in a generation of people who want instant gratification and are instantly discouraged from trying new things when they aren't immediately good at them.  Nobody is.  That's an important lesson to learn while growing up.

Children need to learn to admire others instead of unjustly having their egos inflated by those around them who tell them they are geniuses, kings, queens, princesses, future Kobe Bryants.  If they admire people better than they are, they will have role models.  They will learn respect, diligence, patience and to be humble in their pursuits of improvement.  Be kind, be encouraging, but be mindful.Nuclear is the best, cleanest, and most sustainable option that we have at the moment to power the world. Entire countries cannot run on solar and wind alone. People just don’t like the name “nuclear energy”, and I feel like if it had a different name then a lot more people would be strongly pro-nuclear.4 years ago I weighed 290 pounds. I needed to loose about 100 pounds to be a healthy weight. People started noticing I was losing weight after about 20 pounds. 

By the time I lost 30 pounds people started getting annoyed I wasn't eating the donuts people would bring in to the office, or that I wouldn't participate in a pot luck lunch. "You can afford to eat a donut." "You are going to lose too much weight." (Both were actual comments I heard when I still weighed over 250 pounds.) 

I had lost 80 pounds before covid, and gained some back, but I'm starting to lose again. I just know I have to not let other people know I'm trying to lose, because screw those people.

Edit: thank you all for the kind words and awards. I never expected that people with addictions would relate to this and I'm sorry that you do. I always assumed that people with drug addictions would have more support throughout their recovery. I thought people would be understanding of sobriety at least. I guess not. Well if this helped anyone else realize they aren't alone in struggling trying to improve themselves then I'm glad I posted it.Why should anyone give an employer two weeks to replace them when an employer can fire them and not give them two weeks notice to find another job? Some employers simply do not deserve it especially if they’re very shitty people. I don’t see what the issue is about not giving employers two weeks when they can literally snatch your living from underneath you without any regard to how you’re going to pay bills, but oh yeah let’s give the employer two weeks cause they need to hire someone else, no fuck them.

EDIT: we ALL know that yes we are free to leave, when I say “obligated” I’m referring to the customary nature of two week notices. I still stand by what I say though, fuck customs if it doesn’t go both ways.For some reason a 9-5 schedule is seen as the best work schedule that a person can have. I believe 7-3 is better because while you still wake up early, you end your day earlier and can have most of your afternoon free. You can also give yourself more time to have a second job if you want to

It can also give you a chance to go back home nap and then do something else in the evening

EDIT: very ignorant here suggesting European countries have 4 hr day weeks 
I apologize for my ignorance

EDIT: what I meant to say was that Spain tried to experiment with a 4 day weekday

EDIT: That 11-7 sounds nice now that I’m reading your responses Hmmmm

EDIT: the core hour shift sounds really interesting too

EDIT: there’s a lot of jobs where you can’t just pick your schedule, well at least from personal experience

EDIT: working on the weekends is a no no for me. Been there, done thatAITA for punching my stepmother in the face because she told me I was grounded for staying out late and helping the HOMELESS?

"NTA. Omg you were totally doing something nice. What a bitch"

AITA for kicking my girlfriend out of the house for never doing her fair share of chores , also she cheated on me with my dog?

NTA! WOW I cant believe she wouldn't vacuum and raping your dog is icing on the cake!

AITA for keeping the engagement ring after calling off the wedding because my ex fiance forgot to feed my cat?

NTA. Forgetting to feed you cat is LITERALLY abuse. Imagine if he forgot to feed your kid! Keep that ring SLAAAAAAY QUEEEEN

EDIT: r/AmItheAsshole has banned me.

Basically women lie about being on birth control all the time and then end up pregnant and boom, the man is trapped and has to pay her 17% of his paycheck for 18 years. Yet if you poke a hole in your condom you go to prison. Absurd!I love cooking just as much as the next two guys, but I hate doing dishes. It's not hard or tedious yet I still hate it. But it has dawn on me cook time should also factor in cleaning time. I for one don't feel like I'm done cooking until all the dishes are clean and don't have to worry about anything in the kitchen.
Also recipes should include cleaning time, they already add prep time, why not cleaning.Had this lady the other day just straight up ignored me all because I accidentally called her ma’am a few times instead of her real name which to me is weird specially to a stranger Why do people feel the need to turn a conversation into a little game?  IF you have something to tell me, then tell me. Don't make me try to  figure out you terrible signals or whatever you're trying to do. If I  have to search up what crappy signal you're doing to try and make me figure out what you want to tell me, I just assume it's not important  and leave. Another thing, if you want someone to know something, don't  tell them to "guess". It's information, not a little game, or whatever.  Life's not a movie where you need to build a little suspense, nor is it a Romcom, if you're giving hints that you like someone.It feels like my skin and meat are baking kinda, that shit about to slide off the bone ya know? Very relaxing. Is this why people like saunas? Hot seatbelt still sucks thoI know it sounds like I’m hating but it’s just kinda unfair that some people have to work extremely hard to even gain a fraction of what people on OnlyFans will make in a month. Blac Chyna is earning close to $15,000,000 a month on the website. For what? Having a nice body? Taking provocative photos? All the highest earning TikTokers are very attractive(except Charli D’amelio and anyone else under the age of 18). How many Instagram influencers, earning 6 figures a year, are attractive females? A lot. It just goes to show that talent and hard work don’t mean as much as it used when it comes to achieving success.She straight admitted to drugging and robbing men. She may have changed since then, or maybe she hasnt idk or care. She might have apologized and “righted her wrongs” but All I know is this.

If a man (especially one of Cardi B’s status) were to come on video - and go onto explain how he lured women into his hotel room - drugged them - robbed them and left. He would be locked up for life

So why isn’t Cardi getting the exact same treatment? Why isn’t anything happening? Why is she just getting a free pass?

It’s bullshit and she deserves equal treatment for her actions.

Edit:

To make more clear. I understand u can’t incriminilaize someone without any actual evidence. But for example

Drake

He gets on camera and admits to drugging and robbing multiple women. What do u think would happen to his career or life? It would be completely ruined. He would probably end up having an investigation on him as well. 

But Cardi?

Oh no no no - this woman is perfectly clean and can get away with literally anything

Edit 2:

People seem to think I want her in jail - not necessarily. 

I understand that just because she said she did it - does not make her automatically guilty but again and maybe the title is a bit misleading on this but-

She should be TREATED appropriately. Or at the very least it should be more achknowledged and not just glossed over by her fan base and a large sum of people. 

I don’t really give a shit about her in terms of getting arrested or put in jail. I just want her to experience the same reapercussions that a male or maybe even another female would get from going on camera in 2018/2019 whenever it was - and then stating how u drugged and robbed men/women. 

Maybe 15 years ago u could get away with this - but with 2019’s cancel culture insanity I find it insane that this hasn’t been brought up when discussing Cardi - all that is brought up is 

“Omg queeeeen okrrrrrrrrrrrrr such a racial role model and figure!!!!!”

Like no. It would be different if she was singing about it jokingly - or even if she said it in a more joking manner but no she was serious (for her) in the video

I just think for 2019 - she should be treated a lot differently than she is now

Edit 3:

I’d say thank you for the gold and silver but I don’t want to be that annoying poster

Also ya’ll gotta stop taking this so serious in the threads like damn

Also whoever gave me platinum thx lmaoI love that feeling of the cold sheets hitting my skin and the couple of seconds of shivering as my body acclimatises. It start to feel so much nicer as you begin to warm up. Getting into a warm bed is just stuffy and doesn't feel as nice on naked skin.

Edit: People who are saying cold bed in summer, warm in winter : Not me I like it cold all year round even in the height of winter.It probably sounds dumb and maybe a bit biased considering I've worked as a waitress a lot in the past.

But I honestly cannot stand it when managers practically hand you a cake (handed in by the customers) and expect you to sort out the candles, light them, awkwardly waddle over to the table whilst making sure the candles don't blow out and start singing 'happy birthday.' I personally find it embarrassing and nowhere does it say that this is a task you should have to perform. Not only that, if you don't do it, you get treated like you're not a team player and get bitched at by your managers. If they want to offer this type of service, then maybe they should be the ones embarrassing themselves.

I see it as 'I don't know this person, I'm just here to do a job, I'm not a part of this celebration.' It's just, I don't know man, it doesn't sit right with me.

Does anyone else see this as pointless?

Edit: Thanks for the awards and comments. I'm having a blast reading through them all.Voluntary, consensual sexual transactions have been around for thousands of years. Just because it is considered unsavory now doesn’t mean it should be- Sex workers are valid and important. We should celebrate and support people’s right to choose how they want to use their own bodies- not shut it down. 

We should bring back brothels and implement protective measures such as STI testing, fair hours and expectations of workers, guards, and clear communication. Instead of forcing people to sneak around, risking their health and their lives, why not provide a clean, safe, and welcome place to work?Okay so I know right away people are gonna start name calling and assuming. hear me out.

They're so many people out there where "gay" is their ENTIRE personality. if you're gay thats completely fine good for you but I don't think anyone should know your sexuality UNLESS the topic comes ups ex. "dude how are you still single? i could set you up with a girl right now!" "oh actually i'm gay." "oh cool." or someone plainly asks "what is your sexuality?" or you are in a relationship with that person etc.

I don't think ANY sexuality should be your ONLY personality trait, there are toxic straight people, toxic gay people, toxic bi people, just toxic people in general. that have to prove to you how gay/straight/bi they are at ALL times. I don't care what who or what you are have a personality, not just a sexuality.Unless you get absolutely covered in dirt or whatever there’s no reason to changes entire outfits everyday. you waste money buying clothes  so you have enough clothes to have a new outfit everyday and you waste money constantly doing laundry. people shouldn’t judge you for wearing the same clothes you had on yesterday if you aren’t even dirtyEverybody needs a good fuck once in a while. Men, women, and everybody in between. Even celibates get horny. It can be easy to offend someone by using the wrong pronoun, but how can you offend someone by acknowledging their primal desire for intercourse?

For example:

Person 1: Do you know Blake?

Person 2: Blake? Of course! That fucker used to play football with me.

Person 1: Really?

Person 2: Yeah! We're actually shopping for sundresses later today.

Person 1: Cool, can I come with you fuckers?

Person 2: No, but you can meet us at the strip club later for some wings.If your post is too long, I am less likely to scroll all the way to the bottom to read the small tldr. Wouldn’t it make more sense to put it at the top especially since most people are just browsin’.I love hearing people talk enthusiastically about things they’re interested in, no matter how nerdy, obscure, or useless. Tell me about the new spreadsheet you made! The formulas you learned in biochemistry, the story you know about the modernization of the canned goods industry! I love people’s passions - never stop talking about itAmericans are deprived of any serious training in rhetoric or critical thought and it shows. Our K - 12 schools offer no mandatory classes. Our colleges offer little more than philosophical indoctrination. Ultimately, the development of our personal codes and values are left to the propaganda of groups (business, government, media/press) with agendas that do not have our best interest in mind.

We are therefore easily manipulated. We have no defense against logical fallacies. The worst of which is the straw man. No wonder we are so angry and violent.  Instead of nuance and understanding we are basically told to choose a cause and let them do the thinking for us.This is gonna sound arrogant at first but hear me out. From kindergarten to early high school I've always had a very easy time. In English, my writing skills were always better than other kids. In math I never struggled to comprehend new concepts and was always getting ahead of the material. Even in band I somehow got the "best of class" rating, despite barely ever practicing my instrument. So the whole time I wasn't having to work hard at all, never studying, and barely doing homework because I knew I could just ace tests. But of course it didn't stay like this forever. In the last couple years of high school and now in college, I've reached my limits and now am having to actually work hard to be successful. And as a result of early schooling, my study skills are terrible, I suck at budgeting my time and getting work done efficiently, and I always procrastinate horribly. These are arguably the most important things to learn in school, as they apply to basically anything in life, and I completely skipped over them.

TLDR: Higher knowledge/comprehension is good in the short term, but it'll eventually plateau and leave you with poor work ethic and study skills.

Edit: wow I didn't think this would get alot of attention, thanks for the awards and stuff!

Edit 2: Most negative comments are people saying that me and everyone who relates to this are just covertly bragging about ourselves, and that we shouldn't be shifting blame onto the education system. I'm not saying I'm better than everyone. If anything, the takeaway of this post is that success in early schooling means nothing and effort is more important in the long run. I'm also not saying that my predicament isn't my fault. I'm just pointing out a problem I see in the education system.Smoke has that ability of lingering, even when in an open space. If someone wishes to smoke, that is their own choice however I don’t think they should get to do it in public as many people have chosen not to smoke. Cigarette butts befoul pavements; smokey tendrils reach out for nostrils and hair; and often someone will be smoking outside and you will have to walk through their toxic cloud as there may not be enough space to create suitable distance. Due to lockdown, I have waited in queues to get into shops and this is a time when I truly think people should not be allowed to smoke as one person’s selfish choice will affect many people around them and I don’t think this is fair.Dude, if you’re waking up and reaching for your fucking bowl, you need to reflect on what the hell is going on with you internally. 

You shouldn’t need to be high to start your day. You shouldn’t be craving ~~a mind altering drug~~ weed(that you are not prescribed) right as you wake up. You shouldn’t be that averse to sobriety. 

You have a problem. Address it.

Edit: I should have clarified that waking up on your day off or whatever is different and am focusing more so on the people who wake and bake before say... going to work, for example— the people who seemingly need weed just to live their basic everyday lives. 

Edit 2: I also don’t hold the opinion that it’s *ALWAYS* bad, but habitually doing it more than say, once, maybe twice a week, or staying high all day often, is most likely indicative of a deeper rooted problem.

Edit 3: I smoke weed, about once a week, after I get off work. I still hold this opinion. Even daily smoking is likely indicative of a problem.

Edit 4: To you guys comparing THC to caffeine, I really think that’s an unfair comparison. I can’t respond to all of you, so I’m going to say it, here. CAFFEINE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THC. It is NOT a good comparison. Weed is notoriously used as an ESCAPE. Wake and Baking is often just escaping, thus why sobriety is mentioned. I understand the need to escape, but first thing in the morning? That is an issue.Steven Speilberg said he would not subtitle the Spanish parts of West Side Story as he did not want to take power away from Spanish speakers. WTF does this even mean... It makes absolutetly no sense and unnecesarily will make the majority of viewers miss parts of the dialogue. If anything, subtitles empower the Spanish speakers as it allows non-Spanish speakers to understand Spanish characters better. The lack of subtitles simply alienates both sides.

Also, this is a movie. The whole point is for it to be understandable. Why is it that if you watch this movie in other countries the English is subtitled but not the Spanish. It makes no sense and Speilberg should stop being applauded for this ridiculous decisionIf I don't have my hand raised, I don't know or don't want to respond. Simple. Besides, if I'm constantly getting chosen, it makes me want to be or silent during class or just not do anything, not make me want to participate. Not to mention the 'You don't know???" bull. Yeah, I DON'T know. The hint is no hand in the air.

&#x200B;

Edit: Jesus Christ I get it. It's to get socialized, I mean when a person raises their hands, doesn't get picked, then doesn't raise their hand for the next and gets picked. Maybe I should've put that in, but that's what I meant. I also understand this might be 'popular' to some but I've never seen it on here. If you're truly hurt by this post, downvote and ignore.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled "*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.The average time the ball is in play is only about 11 minutes for the whole game. Then each play lasts about 5-7 seconds. Then you just wait FOREVER for the ball to be back in play. Seriously, how boring could it get? The average NFL game is over 3 hours which means nearly 84% of the time you sit and watch people doing nothing.Morality codes are bullshit. You hired someone to do a job. Doing porn on the side has no affect on their ability to make phone calls. Joining a cult has no affect on their ability keep track of billing. Being the dungeon master at a kink club has no impact on their ability to teach kids.

Employees are there to do tasks for you in exchange for money. They shouldn't have to sell their ability to live their life to do that. If you don't like their personal life then don't inquire about their personal life.

EDIT: illegal activity is different from just regular other things and should absolutely still be grounds for termination.Nothing much to say here, but adding little twists ruins the flow of the song. It annoys the crap outta me when that one annoying person just has to put their little input into it. Just sing the song and cut the cake.UPDATE 6/12- the children have been removed from the apartment. To everyone calling me a “male Karen” and accused me of being a bad person for calling CPS; fuck you. Those kids **were** being abused, and are living with a different person (can’t give away any more info than that. All that matters is that they’re gone and safe).

The parents were arrested as well, since they were using hard drugs and giving them to their kids. Their lease has been dropped, and the landlord let my wife and I move into their old unit since it’s on the top floor. Now that we’ve actually caught up on our sleep, we aren’t snapping at each other constantly and can enjoy the view from our new unit. 

This was a very interesting post, and the replies went everywhere from “This isn’t unpopular” to “this is the 20th time I’ve seen this concept in a week” to “you are a terrible person who wants all babies to die” to “I made terrible choices and now they’ve come back to haunt me and it’s your fault for discriminating against people with children”. I didn’t knock you up, I didn’t force you to keep it, go find some mommy club to complain to or whatever the hell it is you do- just don’t do it around me. 

To those of you with children, teach them to use their inside voices, and understand that the world won’t stop turning because little Timmy’s having a tantrum. You and you alone are responsible for your offspring, try to raise them into decent people. Also, don’t bring your kid to adults only places. Or post them on the internet. There are dangerous creepers online, and putting photos and videos of them up is dangerous. The entire world doesn’t need to see little “K8lynn” singing into a hairbrush. Nobody except for you and your family is interested in seeing that. 


ORIGINAL POST

MSTOP TELLING ME ABOUT SENIOR RETIREMENT VILLAGES. I AM 34, NOT 50. I CANNOT MOVE INTO ONE FOR ANOTHER 16 YEARS. WE CANNOT AFFORD A HOUSE. WE’RE SAVING FOR ONE. WE HAVE REPORTED THE FAMILY TO THE LANDLORD AND CPS. 

My wife and I got some new upstairs neighbors recently. They were a bit loud moving in, but we figured that they were just trying to unpack as quickly as possible to get settled in. We brought them a basket of baked goods- and were promptly told by the lady of the house “I hope you guys are good with noise. We have 6 kids under the age of 8.” 

They’ve been here for a month. We have not slept for a month. They scream at one another all hours of the day and night, run and jump super loudly, and are just generally annoying. Evidently, they like the sound of our doorbell and will press it repeatedly to the point where we decided to take the batteries out. 

We’ve filed several noise complaints, only to be told “They’re kids. What do you expect?” Considering that we’re paying nearly $2000 in rent per month, we were expecting at least some peace and quiet. 

If there were an adults only apartment building with no children allowed, that would be amazing.

Edit to add: No one under the age of 18 would be allowed to move in. Should any resident get pregnant and decide to have the child, they will be moved to a child friendly complex owned by the same company. (Original wording was vague) It’s literally one building for people without kids, and one for people with them. They would have 3 months to vacate their current apartment and move into the child friendly block. 

This is a hypothetical situation. 

And yes, I know retirement communities exist. My wife and I are in our 30’s. We don’t qualify yet. We actually like kids- it’s the fact that kids are very poorly behaved now and we want to have at least *some* peace and quiet. For those of you with children, good for you- just raise them to be aware of the noise they make and try to shape them into respectful and kind little humans. 

Last edit: I can’t believe this tiny germ of an unpopular opinion managed to make it on the front page. Whether or not you agree, the point is moot. My wife and I have decided to spend the weekend at my parents house to get some space from our neighbors. The stress that we’ve been going through with these neighbors is intense. 

We’re planning to move out once our lease is up and will be looking into getting a top-floor unit. We live in America, so this child free building couldn’t exist here. I know that and I wanted to see if people were interested in something like that. We called CPS because we think the kids are being abused, not because of the noise. They show a lot of signs of neglect, despite the fact that the parents are home nearly all the time. 
Thank you all for the advice awards and debates! 
May all of you be safe and have a Memorial Day.If you don’t like bread crust, you were taught not to. No baby popped out the womb ready to hate the slightly browner edge of a slice of bread. Pickiness is a learned trait, and if you don’t eat the crust your children will grow up even weaker than you already are. Pickiness breeds discontentment, lowers your adaptability by forcing reliance on fewer foods, and will ultimately be the demise of western society. By not eating that crust, you’re missing out on key nutrients and failing your great great grandmother who survived two world wars and the Great Depression to give you access to that Wonder Bread with its delightfully soft crust. You dishonor her memory. 

This isn’t medieval Europe where the crust was like iron, this is the 21st century, and modern bread crust would be like manna from heaven to a serf. So eat the fucking crust. Think of the fucking Pilgrims, they would have killed to have a bread crust instead of sour acorns and mealy mush. Next time you turn your nose up at a sandwich that has the crust still attached, I hope that a pigeon shits in your drink. 

C’mon. Eat the crust. It’s that simple.I don’t understand why in every cartoon, rain is associated with sadness. There’s always that sad kid that has the little rain cloud above his head. Rain is a break from the norm. It’s fun and unpredictable. It makes everything a few degrees cooler. Some of my best memories as a kid is running from the store to the car in the rain with the cold wind in my face.

Edit: I’m from Arizona and we don’t get much rain here so I’m pretty biased.No one needs no one to live a life, but having someone is nice. Saying that you don’t need anyone just makes you look hurt. 

Just to be clear: There is nothing wrong with being single.Recently people have been saying how fucked up it is if you have a celebrity crush while others have said that being attracted to such people is 100% normal. 

While I agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this. Obviously I don’t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don’t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won’t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn’t compare to that celebrity do? 

There’s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they’d get jealous or not. If you don’t get jealous by that stuff that’s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there’s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself. 

TL;DR - it’s 100% natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move.

Edit- I thought this was unpopular due to the amount of people saying “they won’t meet the celebrity anyways so it doesn’t matter” In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/htwlkc/its_lowkey_rude_af_to_be_so_blatantly_in_love/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Edit 2- I find it funny how many people are angry at how “this isn’t unpopular at all” but I’m getting a very large amount of comments about how childish and somehow controlling this viewpoint is. Which one is it?

Monkey cock sounding pretty good rnThis is one of my greatest pet peeves. Its so lazy, just give your kid their own fucking name. The only time I can understand you doing this is if you have a cool family name or at the very least a really unique name, (think Stanley Yelnats or something like that) but most people who do it end up naming their kids like John or something. You could've given them a cool unique name but you were like "lETs jUSt NaMe THeM AftEr MEeeE".

Edit: Wow this blew up, thanks for the awards and up votes lol

A couple common questions to answer:

By "unique name" I mostly meant something unique to the family, not something like 14 other people share, it doesn't NEED to be super out there.

Stanley Yelnats is a palindrome so that's why I said it was cool, its from Holes, so yall can stop with "YoU ThInK stAnLey iS a UniQue NamE???"More meat. Tasty breading. Less likely to be dry and stringy. No worries about cracking a tooth on a bone, or chewing cartilage on accident. It's also more socially acceptable to eat with a fork than regular bone in - you'll look like a lunatic if you put a wing on the end of your fork like that. Which means no sticky, smelly fingers. You'll be free to touch other parts of the table without having to take a wet napkin to your hand every time!

Overall, though God may not have intended them, boneless wings have no flaws and I shall die on this hill.I’m a highschooler, and coming into highschool I constantly saw youtube videos claiming that you should “do whatever the fuck you want”, party every weekend, get crazy because this will apparently be the only time to have fun. I have strict parents, so I never get to do what the teenagers in movies and tv shows do, and this has impacted my mental health severely. 

Social media tells me that I’m meant to get drunk every weekend and lose my virginity at 16 as a teenager and this has been set into my mind for a long time and when I couldn’t get it, I felt like my life is not how it’s supposed to be 

Highschool shouldn’t be so romanticized as it sets unrealistic expectations for those who come from low income backgrounds or have strict parents. Stop telling people how their highschool experience should be. Everyone’s lives bloom at different points

Edit : grammar

Edit : These are past experiences I had coming into highschool as a freshmanHad to listen to a gamer guy bragging about how a computer science degree would be easy for him because he 'built' his own computer when he was 15.


It's really not rocket (or computer) science to order the components of a PC, and then assemble them according to some instructions. 


Like, I'm glad you have a hobby, and you could definitely channel that into something bigger, but stop acting like you're Alan fucking Turing because you plugged a few components together and added flashing lights.


Edit: To all the boomers saying they built their PC in 1989 out of semiconductors and spare lawnmower parts, yes, that is in fact very impressive, and this wasn't really aimed at you.I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion "dumb", "detached from reality", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian. If you don't want to use scientists as an example, James Madison, who wrote the Bill of Rights that is idolized by many, was also Christian. The conclusion I am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.Or waste tons of money to fly an helicopter for days  hoping to find your dead body in a cave at 7000 m of altitude because you thought going there was cool and something went wrong. If there is 0% chance to find you alive no one should search for you. If there is a chance and you get rescued you should pay for the costs of the rescue operation and for putting other lives in danger. No one asked you to put your life at risk for no fucking reason.Yes, losing weight is extremely difficult and will take a really, really long time for an individual to notice substantial results. However, it is possible — unlike changing your height. 

Whether it's a short guy or a tall girl, it is physically impossible to change your height. 

Therefore, making fun of someone's height should be viewed as something more offensive than making fun of someone's weight.You don’t have to be a genius to get 80s/90s or even go to university/college. I’m tired of hearing people say they are just not born smart when in reality school is an effort based system. If you put in the effort and become driven with getting high grades I guarantee you can get them. 

Everyone rather make up excuses as to why they did crap in school. People will blame the teachers, their parents, say they were not born smart or even just say it’s the schools fault as to why they failed. But in reality the school never failed the students… the students failed themselves.

If you treated school like a chore and just put in the bare minimum and failed there’s no one to blame but your self.

And getting 90s also doesn’t mean you’re smart it means you just put in more effort than the person next you.

If you have some sort of learning disability or any other disability/medical condition I can understand as to why you may have not done as well.

Also if you were born into a wealthy family, were privileged, went to a good school, never dealt with bullying or family matters and never had any disabilities or medical condition and still failed you should be disappointed in your self. You let your self down, you had all the tricks and benefits, but still managed to f up.

Edit#1: YES being gifted does help and there are some people who will put in the bare minimum and some how always be at the top, but for the far majority of people that that’s not the case. For most it’s going to take a lot more time, effort, blood, sweat and tears.Going to be quick and concise about this, cuddling is the worst. It’s boring, it’s too warm, it’s incredibly physically uncomfortable 99% of the time due to them being on your arm or you being twisted in a weird way. All you can do is either talk to the person, sleep, or try to have sex with them which sex being the only good part of the entire thing. And did I mention it’s so boring just laying there holding someone, playing with their hair or rubbing them or doing whatever. Cuddling is up there in terms of top 5 worst parts of a relationship easily.


*Edit: wow this got a lot more attention than I was expecting: first of all sex is not the only important thing in a relationship to me at all, it was 4am when I typed this out and I was not thinking straight. Second of all I do 100% cuddle my current gf cause I know she loves it and it makes her happy. Third of all I don’t think I need therapy just because I can’t sit still for more than 10 minutes. I see the appeal of cuddling it is just so not for me and I can’t handle how god damn boring it is.Instead of, a big blue "I'm over 18" button, porn sites should add a few questions about sex education to give access. They can be basic, and if they fail, they should redirect to some online Sex Ed Wiki, or host their own informative page. I believe it would be an effective way to judge if a person is allowed to watch porn or not.


Edit: It would still serve the purpose if people can just google the answers. if they didn't know before, it's good that they know now.I mean i get it's just trying to show support but most of the people on my feed posting a black screen will do nothing else to help the cause and some of them i am almost certain are only doing it for attention. All in all it's exactly the same thing as saying thoughts and prayers after a mass shooting an we all know that that doesn't prevent future shootings from happening or bring about real changeI will absolutely never understand adults who don’t eat their crusts. It’s wasteful - money and food - and it’s literally just bread. Like please grow up already!!

Edit: felt the need to say that this only applies to edible crusts! I understand if the crust is too burnt/hard but in that case you should probably just get a better pizza...It's hard to explain but liquid shit shooting out my ass like a super soaker is unmatched. In fact I'm doing it right now while posting this and God damn its great.
EDIT: I'm trying to reply to everyone this is extremely entertaining. EDIT 2: Believe it or not I don't give a fuck I'm a fucked individual and I don't care what you think. People that get real butthurt in the comments need to look in the mirror and reevaluate their shitty attitudes. I made this post because I believe it and figured its fucked enough to get some chuckles. EDIT 3: Thanks for all the awards I'm surprised this shit got any at all.When I'm eating, I'm trying to enjoy myself and relax. Relaxing your posture a bit to eat shouldn't be considered rude. And it's not like having your elbows on the table even looks THAT bad anyway.Like damn, I'm spending my money here, is it really that AWFUL to know the prices of what I'm ordering?!  For one thing, I'm not made of money, so in order to be able to have any semblance of comfortable living, I have to watch my spending closely. If you're that afraid that putting your prices on a menu are going to drive people away from your establishment, maybe the problem is within. I'll be glad to be called cheap. Much rather be cheap than to spend money I don't have recklessly and then have to deal with debt stress. Alcohol menus are obviously the ones where this occurs the most, but some restaurants do it too. Ridiculous.Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered "average" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that "women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people." While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one "leading the charge" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. "r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about." I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.I see this all the time and it infuriates me. The latest is Greta Thunberg. I don’t have anything against her or any other teen “activists”. But I hate it when people catch flack for arguing with a “child”. If you enter yourself in the conversation, then anyone has the right to say what they want about your opinion.I dislike it. I wish ill upon it. There is no reason that a number as unremarkable as 10 should be given such a high stature. 


"But 10 is a cool number and is essential for almost everything" you might say. Absolute bollocks. I can write an essay about how bad 10 is but to keep it relatively short, the only reason 10 is considered special is because we follow the base 10 decimal number system. It has just this one thing going on for it. But guess what, base 10 is a horrendous way to count, there are many superior versions like base 12 and base 6 that are easy to learn and more viable, especially when doing division. Also finger counting is better in base 6, so please don't spread your humans have ten fingers propaganda.


Yes, I know. The metric system and all existing documentation are in base 10. But that's just one of the ways Big Decimal shills are manipulating you. Do you really want to use a bad number system just because "It has always been like that"? What is this if not Stockholm Syndrome? If you don't want to become a mere statistic it's high time you stand up for yourself.



TL;DR - I loathe how the number 10 is glorified and admired by people.



Edit: Yes I know it is not intuitive to count in other bases, but thats just because you have been accustomed to decimal. Analogous to language, it is hard to pick up a new one.


Also, I am aware the metric system will get destroyed if we change the base. That's not the point. If we had chosen a different base at inception then metric system, math and day to day life would have evolved with it, making that version of counting just as intuitive as decimal.With recent news that the UK government are introducing new immigration rules and being able to speak/read/write English being a requirement. I see people on Twitter (what a surprise) making a big stinker out of it saying it's racist, anyone should have the rights to come over and speak in their native language etc. If you move to the UK and your native language is not English then the home office should have every right to reject your application. How do you expect to "survive" social interactions with other people if you are not able to communicate in that language? I find it mega disrespectful when people approach me and try to communicate with their lack of vocabulary in English.

If you are learning whenever if it's done by self taught or studying at school, college etc then fair play to you!

Edit:

Thank you for the unexpected gold whoever you are! I admit that I have used some poor choice of wording on this post but I won't edit it. I'll leave it as it and let you come to your own conclusion. You are welcome agree, disagree, explain your side of things. Using buzzwords such as racist, bigot, facist or nazi is only making your statement/argument weaker. If you don't agree, then say it. No need to use buzzword. 

I've been asked about other way around Brits that have lived in Span or France etc for many years and not learned how to speak Spanish/French and my opinion on that hasn't changed either. Just as annoying for the natives.

I don't have a problem with people coming over for whatever means if you want to work, live a better life then at least learn! Don't just come over and not put any effort into learning. Adapt yourself!

Thank you for all the response, it's interesting to read it all from different perspectives.I checked youtube and one of the first videos I saw was from CBC news talking about if Canada day should be cancelled or not. As a Canadian this pissed me right off straight away because im pretty proud of Canada as a country and im proud to be a Canadian. Went to post a comment and.... comments disabled. I think this is a trend of CBC specifically because a lot of their videos get a huge amount of dislikes, moreso even than likes. I feel as a major source of news its unethical for them to deny the ability for people to talk about these things on their videos. This is just with CBC as well, I dont know if anybody else does this at all.Every time someone posts about the Hong Kong protests someone comments "wow its so great to see these people embracing american values". Theyre not american or even western ideas, theyre universal and not endemic to the USA. Give the protesters some credit,  they are not just copying some foreign idea, theyre fighting for what is right.I have to admit that when the YouTube video game/twitch fad started, I was a little weirded out. I didn't understand why someone would watch someone else play a video game instead of just getting the game themselves. But then I realized "why do I watch people play golf when I could be outside doing it myself?" I know it's not exactly the same, but we need to stop giving people a hard time for watching others play games, and realize that avid sports fans are probably the biggest nerds out there.I always see the trope that bullies are actually sad people living unfulfilled lives. From my encounters it's usually the opposite. The assholes have great lives and sucessful careers. Hell I would say many of them are probably successful because they are assholes and have strong armed their way up.

Now I am not saying they don't have their insecurities or their own issues, who doesn't. But this idea I see repeatedly on TV and social media that bullies actually hate themselves and are dicks to feel better about themselves, just doesnt ring true. Most of the true assholes I've met ( I meet alot in my field) love themselves and live great lives and genuinely seem to enjoy being assholes to others.Enough said. Genitals are odd-looking and kind of ugly. Ladies, have you ever seen a limp dick? It looks like a sad, floppy noodle. Tits usually look better in bras, I've seen a lot of weird nipples. I find men and women in underwear/lingerie a lot more attractive than completely naked, I guess it leaves everything to the imagination?

(For context, I'm a bisexual male)

Edit: I woke up to a flooded inbox and now my most upvoted post is about genitals lmao. I guess this isn't as unpopular as I thoughtLiterally what the title says. I hear far too often from people how their wife/husband is not happy with their ring, and insists on taking it back for one they themselves pick out(bigger diamond, more shiny, overall “prettier”.) Mind you 90% of the rings they “Love” cost upwards of $10,000 and leads to having to finance something as silly and minuscule as a ring which could be spent on something far more important. You could have simply had just as good if not better of a ring for 1/10th the price. Especially considering a $1,000 ring is a hell of lot cheaper to replace if lost or stolen!

Edit: Just as clarification this post is NOT based on personal experience, however is based on the current crowd of people/area I live in. Many people are telling me to just find someone else, I assure you this does not pertain to me as my wife told me, and I quote “Just go to JC Penny when they have their sale.” Thank you for the concern however lolImagine if alcohol wasn't with us in culture and society since ages, and the drug was invented today.

Alcohol causes more deaths and injuries than all other drugs together, combined. The "accidents" on the roads due to alcohol worldwide, the number of domestic violence cases, fights in bars and on the street in places where you can go out. 

Suicides, shortening of life span for those who use it, liver problems, brain problems, problem problems

&#x200B;

This is one hell of a hard drug, deaths and problems everywhere but because it's culture, we are fine with it.

If it was invented now, it would be on the prohibited substance list very soon after.People often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about "kids these days" spending all their time with their phones, consoles, and so on. But I don't think videogames and Youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment. They're great and I love them, sure, but I don't think they're that addictive or "special" to get all of a kid's interest by themselves (after all, kids get bored by everything really soon, don't they?)

Let's look at alternative, more "traditional" forms of entertainment. I'm only 28 and I can already see how much they've changed. I used to ride my bike all day long since I was 6 or 7 years old, now it's too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching. Same for going to the pool or river for a swim. Feel like playing some football? Well, a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way! Even just for going to the park! There used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old. Now there are more parents that children! And there's yet another problem. In some areas, there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres!

The most drastic example: I used to have play fights with my siblings, cousins, friends and classmates all the time, sometimes even in front of my parents! Sometimes even the parents were cheering!! I'm not saying that's necessarely a good thing, but it's unthinkable only a couple of decades later. And don't even get me started on fighting in the water (which I've probably done like a million times)!

But these are just examples... I have a few reasons to believe I'm right about this "helicopter-parenting" being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much:

\- First, in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldn't even dream of not that long ago, you'd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing. Well, chess is stronger than eve. Whether in my town, my country or my planet, the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow.

\- Also, at least in my experience, this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream. Already by the time I was 12 or so I noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching TV (and I wasn't the only one)

\- And finally, just compare different types of parents, the rules they put, and what their children do. Think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner. If parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet, they'll be on the tablet, but what if they are allowed to leave?

**NOTE:** The points I'm making here are strongly region-dependent and may not apply to your particular country or society. I'll use my own as a reference and if the situation in yours is wildly different, I'd love to hear about that contrast in the comments.

**ANOTHER NOTE**: I wanted the title to say "we've fucked up" rather than "you've". I was going to copy/paste, rewrite the title and post again but there were already some comments so I'll leave it as it is so you can see that I'm dumbFirst: I'm not saying one HAS TO text back fast all of the time. If you're busy, you're busy and if you don't want to text, you don't want to and all that is perfectly fine.

But it's ridiculous when people say "hey, now I gotta wait 100 years so he/she doesn't think I'm thirsty" or whatever. You get what I mean. That's ridiculous. If you're texting and you want to answer, just do it. If you're busy, you don't. 

I have never met someone who, nor thought myself "oh, a fast response, he/she must be texting me because he/she is so boring and has nothing else to do." Instead, I understand when it takes time but am sure happy about a fast reply.

It's something different if it's a forced conversation. Then, no answer might be better than immediately writing some pointless stuff.

But...yeah.They’re painful, distracting, uncontrollable, and hinders people’s performance. It’s just the same as someone in your family dying, as you’re losing a loved one. I have all these exams that I need to study for and assignments to submit that i mentally can’t handle but i still have to push through it because break ups are not considered valid excuses.I really don't get why people hate it. It actually tastes good, it has a nice subtle taste and goes well will many other foods. And of course it's extremely healthy.

 For some reason I avoided broccoli for the longest time but now I eat it at least a couple times a week.

Edit: wow thanks for the likes and the awards, I'm glad its not *as* unpopular as I thoughtBefore the downvotes roll in, I’m not talking about autism or other mental disabilities, allergies, celiac, or counting macros for fitness. 3 of those you can’t control, the last serves a purpose. I’m talking about able bodied people who are picky.

I actually get angry when I see someone picking/ordering half the stuff out of a dish at a restaurant, or pushing things off to the side at the dinner table. Even worse if someone wont eat food because of one thing they don’t like. 

That food was made for you that way, and now you’re bastardizing someone’s recipe because “oh I don’t like onions” or some shit. Get over yourself.

The only reason you even have the luxury of being picky is because we live in a first world society where they throw food out for no fucking reason, and now I’m wishing I had just given your work provided meal to the homeless guy 2 blocks down because he would have appreciated it as made. 

You are weak if you’re a picky eater, and when times get tough, and you’re just trying to get enough calories to not waste away, I hope you realize how much luxury you used to abuse by not eating what you have in front of you. 

Stop being weak. The onions won’t kill you. Eat what you order.

EDIT: Wow congratulations guys, we did it. You absolute mad lads managed to crash Reddit on my phone with all the replies! Sorry if I cant respond to you, my inbox is actually dead 💀They're loud as all get out, and extremely dangerous. There are used for them, but imo the public roads is not the place for that. They're hard to see from a car. Biker clubs are pointless and a waste of gas and very disruptive. I understand that their gas efficient but it isn't worth it.I don’t even know why. I know that I hate how it can sometimes hurt my gums biting into an apple, but I love a thick skinned apple. Me and my partner were just laying in bed discussing this. Don’t judge 😅Fatherless boys are at a greater risk of alcohol and other forms of substance abuse

Fatherless boys often grow up lacking all masculinity and maturity

Fatherless boys have many development problems, in school and in the mind, often having adults still chew on their nails like little kids.

Fatherless boys will be worse off in life, having noone to properly understand their manhood

Fatherless boys make up a disproportionate amount of suicides, homelessness and criminals.

80% of all incarcerated males grew up fatherless iirc, and looking at school/mass shooters, they're all almost exclusively from single mother households.Babies don’t turn cute until they’re toddler age like 1-3 years old. Newborn babies just look like they crawled out of hell, don’t understand how people go “awwwww” when the parents post their newborn baby. And don’t get me started on those newborn photoshoots, not cute. Wait till they’re toddlers. 

Stop feeding the parents lies.I mean it's not necessarily crap. I'd say it s pretty wholesome but its humour is forced and its approach to how to teach social issues is preachy and childish to say the least. 

Holt gets quite a few funny moments I admit and he definitely makes the show watchable, but overall I feel that the humour falls flat like 90% of the time.

I know this is totally subjective and I could just "wAtcH sOMetHIng ElSe tHeN" but I just think the hype around it is undeserved.As a 23 year old, its been around a decade since I've been able to make a good "that's what she said" joke and not get eye rolls. This upsets me because I feel that my that's what she said jokes are classic and should be appreciated. I don't mean to toot my own horn here but I get quite creative with them and it frustrates me that nobody laughs. 

If you're unfamiliar with what a "that's what she said" joke is, its essentially calling someone out for saying something in casual sentence that could be said in a sexual setting. For example, say you notice new buildings on your block that seem to have been built over night and you say "it's like they're finishing quicker and quicker these days" I would then pop out of a bush and say "that's what she said!" and you would fall on the ground laughing and we would become great friends. 

So, people of Reddit, lets start laughing at that's what she said jokes again. With all the seriousness in the world, especially this year, we deserve a little immature comedy.I personally don’t get why people like it, it sounds like they record anything he says when he sleeps. I’m fine with drake as a person, but I can’t stand his music. Thanks for reading!

Edit: after reading some of the comments I am no longer ok with drake as a person.(once again thanks for reading)I’ve been applying left and right for jobs. I have a master’s degree but even that doesn’t seem to be helping. I quit my job in 2019 and since then I haven’t found fucking anything. And the longer I stay unemployed the lower I feel my chances are of ever getting a job again. Fuck this entire system and fuck every single employer who looks at a gap on a resume and says “this person is qualified, but nah”.

Edit: For those asking, I have a dual BA in economics and earth science and a MA in economics (as well as several licenses related to finance)I've seen so many parents crying out about how hard their lifes are now with their kids being all around rn, and it really annoyes the shit out of me.
 If you cant handle your kids being around then YES maybe you shouldnt have brought some into this world.

Edit: For all the people saying i am not allowed an opinion because i have no kids and don't know how hard it is that's not the point im making. I TRULY believe how hard it is however: Welcome to Parenthood. Now you are actually in charge of RAISING your kids instead of letting someone else do the job in daycare. Noone forced you to have kids, your choice your life, bye.I can not stand pepper. Every time I see someone cooking, it looks really good, then they ruin it by adding pepper. I don’t understand the appeal of it. There are so many better options for seasoning that pepper. I’m not talking about bell peppers or chili’s or habaneros, I’m talking about black pepper or powdered pepper or whatever kind of disgusting pepper people think go with salt.

EDIT: Can’t believe how offended everyone is over pepper. I know how to cook and my friends know how to cook, yet I still believe pepper ruins the meal. I don’t care if Gordon Ramsay himself cooks an amazing steak or burger. If he seasons it with pepper the meal has been ruined.As per the title. I hear a lot of people going through the loss of a pet and not being able to take a vacation for a few days so they can properly grief. 

You spend years of your life with your pets, they're closer to you than most family members and still, some bosses would not give a vacation for the fact that "The death of your pet is not an important enough event for which you would not be able to work." 

I know for certain that when and hopefully not soon my dog will die, I would be devastated. Going to work would be the last thing I would like to do in that case.

Edit: Thank you for all the awards! 

Also, there's a ton of people talking about pets that die quickly. Nothing stops you from buying 50 hamsters. But this applies more to pets that you actually share a bond with, small rodents have a rather quick lifespan and is not as devastating as losing a dog, cat, rabbits, reptiles and other pets that are for years by your side.Nobody gives a fuck about what your child may or may not see online when not under your supervision and the adults amongst us aren't gonna stop behaving a certain way simply because your children are watching. If you let your child roam around a movie theater while you're sitting at the bar and they make their way into an R-rated movie, then that is nobody's fault but your own. The amount of entitled irresponsible parents who allow their child to roam the internet undeterred and get upset when their child sees a nipple is truly baffling.

Instead of calling for sweeping online reforms that nobody wants or demanding updates to websites that nobody wants, how about you do your jobs as parents and supervise your kids online? We're not your damn babysitters.Whenever I go to any video game store, or any comic convention, one thing I always know I'm going to see are the endless walls of Funko Pops. What do people find so appealing about them? Not only have they reused the same basic design literally over 100,000 times, they're all universally hideous. Big black dots for eyes (even when it doesn't make sense on the character), rectangular head, rounded features, little facial detail, not to mention the huge heads that use more material than their entire bodies. One that sticks out in my mind is the SpongeBob Funko Pop, which I'm pretty sure is the ugliest licensed figure I've ever seen in my life.

I've been to peoples' houses and seen shelves covered in Funko Pops, rarely ever taken out of the box. All I can think is, "why"? Why do people spend all this money on this stuff just to stick it on a shelf and never open it? Is it for the investment, like Beanie Babies were? If so, I can't wait for the bubble to burst so they can all go to the clearance bins and stop wasting so much floor space. They're a perfect example of how you can get people to give you boatloads of cash for worthless crap if you market that worthless crap hard enough.Sure, if math is not your thing then there is no need to go into advanced math classes such as calculus in high school, but to say that you will never use math in your life just isn’t accurate. Are you ever going to use the quadratic formula in the future? 99% the answer to this question is a no. However, mathematics is not about applying specifically what you learn in the class, but more so about applying the problem solving abilities that you develop through solving math problems. You have A,B, and C... now how can you get to D? It’s all about critical thinking. This type of critical thinking is important to develop so that later on in life when you need to think hard about a problem and derive a solution, you’re not completely inexperienced with this type of thinking.

Edit: some of you still don’t get it. “When will I factor polynomials by hand” - YOU WONT. But the process of solving difficult math problems, thinking in new ways, and making this a habit of yours is what will help to increase your critical thinking skills - just something to constantly engage your head in so you don’t spend an entire child hood staring at a screen and growing up to become useless and achieve nothing because you have fucked your brain up from a very apparent underwhelming use of it during its development stage.

Edit 2: It is obvious 90% of you aren’t taking the time to read this before forming a response. “WHEN WILL I USE ARBITRARY SUBJECT X”

Edit 3: If you think agreeing with this makes you superior and that people who disagree with this idea are losers... you’re part of the issue here

Edit 4: I know there are other ways to improve critical thinking skills, but each core subject approaches it through a different avenue. When you’re reading the classics, which people also hate to do in school, you’re taking the time to understand the archaic prose that was used in these books, you are recognizing the characters motivations, you are trying to figure out what emotions they are feeling - all subconsciously. This type of critical thinking is different from the type used in math where it is a more strict use of logical statements to get from point A to point B. Training your brain to do well in each arena is well worth it. 

If you’re a STEM major and you think you’re superior because you can solve fancy math equations or write a cool program... you’re not. So many programmers are totally inadequate at for example describing their vision for a future project, selling their idea, etc. - reading some books would help with that!

Edit 5: Why are people getting all worked up over these numerous edits? This is called an exchange of ideas and it is how a conversation works. Jesus Christ some of you people get offended so easily. Grow up.Inclusiveness is becoming toxic. Brands like Brandy Melville with their “one size fits small” sizing option allows people on the slimmer end to have clothes that flatter and fit their body type. They should be allowed to cater to that market alone without any flack, just like Torrid only markets to plus sized women. Same with Victoria Secret. They keep expanding their sizing options, but are getting shit on for not being inclusive enough. Society really needs to shop shaming companies for catering to one body type. Not everything is equal, and skinny people deserve options specifically designed for their body too!Mods are basically unpaid mall cops for reddit... except even mall cops know they are a joke.  I think Reddit counts on the fact there are enough lonely losers out there who will moderate the site for free in exchange for the illusion of authority.  These are shameful, powerless, and deeply troubled people looking to exert a measure of power anyway they can-- the same kind of people who would become abusive police officers and border agents if they weren't already so monstrously overweight.

EDIT: I apologize for the bit about mall cops.  They are just trying to make a living.  Comparing them to Reddit Mods is a slur that I regret.



I know most people do not agree with this, which is why I think it’s a fitting post for this page.  Not only is the weather more comfortable, but the cold time of the year is simply better all around.  

I believe people strengthen their relationships in cold weather.  You’re more likely to sit together on the couch with your spouse or children to watch a good movie under a blanket.  I believe winter vacations are amazing.  Going skiing/snowboarding in beautiful locations in so much fun.  The holidays are during this part of the year which brings you together with your family more often and reminds you about the important things in life. 

Just a better time of year in my opinion.Taking a year off to focus on yourself, take care of a loved one, or simply think about your future shouldn’t be the business of somebody interviewing you. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a break from work culture. If you can afford to do so, and it’s what you want, I encourage it. Take a break, find yourself, sleep longer than you usually can, pick up a hobby, and enjoy your damn life.I say this as someone who's worked in retail and the food service industry for roughly 5 years now. 

This is based on how upset people got on things that weren't my fault. For example: customers not being allowed to use the company's bathroom, not accepting expired coupons, the kitchen messing up their order, not refunding a product they didn't buy at our store, not giving a discount that doesn't apply to them. 

I'm good at my job, I treat every customer with respect, it doesn't happen often that someone throws a shit fit. But when it does, more often than not, it's a boomer.

Edit: Yes, every generation can be rude. I'm not denying that.

Edit 2: I'm not sure why people are assuming this, but I'm not an American, or male.

Edit: I thought this was unpopular, whenever I posted or talked about this the reaction often was "do your job right if you don't want people yelling at you" or "if you don't like it find another job." I didn't think many people would agree.I'm tired of getting into series only for them never to finish. Imagine if J.K. Rowling just stopped at Book 4, we would all have blue balIs from not being able to finish. In this world of 1000 online series it's happening more and more, where a show will get 2 seasons and get cancelled out of nowhere and still have massive questions never answered.When I hear child abuse I usually think of molestation or like beating up your children. 

I have seen people say they were victims just because they were slapped or their parents called them a fucking asshole, and that's just cringe to me

Edit: Obligatory LMAO this blew upI have seen a few overly dramatic people on Twitter and Reddit going on about how they are "literally shaking" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

While those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

Like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. If it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

It just really annoys the shit out of me. Like I may like guns, BUT at least I respect anyone calling for action against guns. That's action. You're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

You saying "omg, I'm literally shaking" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone. 

Get a grip.

Edit: So far I have been DMed and called a "cunt" and a "dumpster faggot"
Very classy. You're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent Orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? Is that irony lost on you when calling me a "faggot"? 

Otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. Only a few people grossly misunderstood me. I also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but I don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

Also shoutout to those people dropping peer reviewed statistics on all of this.

Edit 2: I've had 2 people DM me hoping I one day get empathy lol. How do you go outside everyday without having an emotional breakdown? Good god haha.

Edit 3: One more DM telling me to kill myself. Oof.

Edit 4: 5 days later, and still getting harassed with DMs. Had a friendly guy call me a "fucking retard who deserves to eat shit and die" and kindly said "Glad Karma catched up with you and you default on your loans." Someone made a burner account to tell me to die, yet I "don't have empathy" and I'm the "psycho"? The irony is so thick, I could scoop it up and spread it on a peice of bread. Also, hypothetically speaking, what if I was a nutbar with no empathy and ready to go off. Wouldn't harassing me with nasty messages just confirm my delusional bias with society at large? Oh wait, that's right, the people harassing me are too fucking stupid to process any of that.You get there and expect to have this great time but once you get there it’s really just:

Hard to park and costly 

Getting sunburnt 

Sitting uncomfortably with nothing to do

Getting sand everywhere 

Not having great access to the bathroom 

Not having great access to food (kind of quick camping?)

Being surrounded by rambunctious kids, or creepy guys, or some frisbee amateurs

Don’t recommendBecause they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. They are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

Edit #2: Holy hell, that's a lot of Reddit stickers. Thanks lads.Ive seen a lot of people say that "most bullies come from a broken home" or "they're just jealous because you have what they don't. However that is far from the case. They're not victims of abuse, they're spoiled little shits who think they can get away with everything. Most bullies have tons of friends, relationship success, possessions and parents that spoil them. They don't pick on people because they're troubled and broken inside, they pick on people because it's funny to them, plain and simple. Thats why you should never be friends with a bully.

Edit: holy fuck this blew up, I was gone for a couple hours and then I come back to this

Edit2: okay, 16k upvotes for this.......honestly surprisedWhen scientific jargon is adopted by people who use it to push a narrative, it becomes almost indistinguishable from actual science to the general public.

For example, take the idea that an increase in solar output is the main cause of climate change. This is psuedo-science nonsense that has no basis in scientific reality yet to the naked eye, non peer reivewed studies claiming this to be the case can be very convincing. 

I have no idea how lies that use scientific jargon can actually be combated due to just how many people don't have time in their day to fact check what they hear.

For another instance, I know multiple people that became convinced that 1 volcano eruption put more co2 into the atmosphere than all of man made emissions combined just a couple years ago.

That's not even jargon, that's a basic ass meme and it had an effect on people I knew. 

The information age is truly a scary place because not only is correct information more accessible than ever but also misinformation.

Religion runs counter to observable truths, psuedo-science pretends it is the observable truth.We spend all our life trying to stay the fu*k away from feces.

 But when it's time for sex, well, let's just dig right into it like it's french cousine. I think butts are attractive and cute. But getting into the shitter just does not do it for me. 

 I'm not trying to kink shame here. My own personal fetish is odd enough as it is. But when people want to get their tongue in there. Thats top shelf "NoahGetTheBoat" material for me. 

P.S I'm still traumatized just by the idea of TGOC. Forget watching it, just the knowledge that it happened traumatized me.




EDIT: To all my gay bros, guys you can clearly tell this post was only intended for the straight dudes and ladies. Zero shade towards any of you beautiful bastards. 

Also hey, the male g-spot is in the anal cavity, so it's actually a complete no-brainer to even consider it disgusting from your perspective.



EDIT 2: I realized three hours later that I wrote , "cousine" instead of "cuisine".

 Its the best part of this post by now.  So no I'm not changing it. I hope the tide remains still in me.



EDIT 3: Im just glad to find a large majority on the same side. Also about my thing I can't judge without also being open about my thing

Well it's tummies and belly button/navel, lol. I was young when I found a belly-dancing video. And my young mind just got stuck there. Now yeah. When my girl wears a crop-top or a Saree(traditional indian attire) that just slays it for me. 

It's just what starts the engine for me. Well, fu*k, now you all know.I just watched a video about a teacher proposing to another teacher in front of their students. That teacher is under immense social pressure to give a positive response (i.e., accepting) due to pressure from the students and potential fiance. It is straight up manipulating a person and perhaps would their public image if the proposal did not go as planned.

Edit: I would like to disclose that I am currently engaged and proposed in private. I agree that many people do and should discuss how the proposal should go beforehand. My post is about people who have not discussed it yet.Basically what the title says. Society exists because many of us can't make it on our own and we are better together. If you're having a hard time and need to take more than you give, society exists for you. Or at least that's how it is supposed to be. If everyone was at all times capable of supporting themselves without assistance, then we never would've evolved to be social animals and we'd still be off wandering the savannah alone.Let’s see if this sub is actually about unpopular opinions. 

My SO is a waitress at a local diner. She gets her tables that tip well, and some that don’t (or not at all). I see posts on Reddit every single day complaining about people who don’t tip or tip smaller than the regular 15% (or what I’m seeing lately is that “standard tip” trending more towards 20%). I don’t advocate for not tipping your waitress. He/she is providing a service to you: they deserve compensation. But 20%? 

When it’s all said and done, my SO makes more money than I do as a waitress and I work in a very specialized field with several years training. This isn’t me complaining about my salary, cause I do pretty well myself. And don’t get me wrong, when she comes home with $200+ in just tips after a short shift, I’m super happy for her. 

Here’s where my unpopular opinion comes in. No waitress at a regular restaurant should be expecting 20%, even 15% from their tables unless they’re giving us damn back rubs while serving. A 4 person table at a reasonably priced restaurant can run you $70-$100. I don’t feel that they earn their $20 tip (ie 20%) by simply bringing drinks at the beginning, slapping plates on the table, and bringing my bill. 

Downvote me.today our physics teacher had to do a 10 minute recap of how magnets work

in the end she showed us this Mspaint drake meme of how magnets work (only opposite signs) . most girls were confused for 20 seconds , some girls chuckled and us guys just did the eyeroll . one of us even did a sudden and short **HA** to mock it

but if you ever had a physics class you KNOW that shit is boring . and for an old woman to spend time making/looking for a meme ,  she is dwelving in a vast part of modern students lives and *trying as hard as she could* to connect with them . but why?

they do that extra work for a cool , entertaining class 

so if your teacher shows you a meme , don't post it on r/fellowkids . take your time too and appreciate their efforts

THEN you can post it on r/fellowkids lmao those meme are so bad it hurts

EDIT : spellingIt's so big you can't even take a bite out of the whole thing, and if you try you'll make a mess and if you try to pick it up its falls apart and it can't even support itself without a wooden skewer. Like what it the point?

*edit

I know you can eat it with a knife and fork, but that's like antithetical to the whole concept of burgers.I swear most girls I see on the street are hotter than your average pornstar. And every porn video plays out the same way with the same sex positions and camera angles. Not to mention the awful OH, OH FUCK YEA, OOOOOOH SHIT, UH YES, UUUUUUH! Why do so many people watch this shit?So many romance movies involve some creepy shit, and it’s glamourised and made out to be “sweet” or “romantic”, even though it would never stand up if it happened irl. Edward watches Bella sleep. Noah threatens to jump off a Ferris wheel unless Allie goes out with him. There are countless examples, I just don’t watch many romance movies. This sort of shit isn’t what love should look like.I think, that no matter how ugly you are and how much you don't fit in my preferences, you can still be attractive or hot (at lest somewhat) by just smelling really fucking good.

The right smell (especially men's smell) can change someones whole presence. You meet someone and if they smell good you automatically *think* that they have great hygiene ect. Also, who doesn't like to be arround good smelling ppl, right? 

So, no matter how low of a self-esteem you have, go buy a nice and ***long smelling*** perfume and maybe that helps. Btw, I don't really think ppl are ugly, no matter how you look, there's still something about you that's attractive and handsome, but if you personally think that you are ugly (trust me I know how that feels), maybe try to boost yourself by being extra picky when it comes to your own hygiene/smell and maybe you will recieve some compliments
 (compliments about your smell is the best type of compliments, bc you can affect it, but you can't change your appearance)


Btw, I'm not talking about any Pheromones, I'm talking about like a good Cologne or you know, a smell that makes you want to be arround that person. Also, I'm not saying that it's either smelling bad or smelling good, it's just most of the time ppl smell like nothing, dont worry, that's ok too ¯\_༼ •́ ͜ʖ •̀ ༽_/¯I grew up on welfare as a kid and it was one of the most shameful aspects of my life.

If someone came up to me in front of all my classmates holding a camera and “gifting” me a pair of shoes I’d be mortified. Blasting my poverty across the entire school, then posting it on the internet, all to garner the praise of their peers and internet strangers  should be discouraged.

I get it, people like feel good stories, but this ain’t it people. They’re doing it to gain clout and be seen as such a great person by sacrificing a classmate who’s already in a tough situation. If you’re really trying to make a positive impact on someone in that situation, help them in private - at least spare their pride.Do you know the feeling when you're just sitting at the restaurant with your significant other and the two of you just want to enjoy your food and each other's company, and out comes running a little kid screaming their head off? Most of the time the parents don't bother to properly even address their kids' behaviours. They just laugh it off at the distance or say "Oh, so cute!" and start filming their lousy ass kid? Or when you're visiting the spa at a hotel, just bubbling away in a jacuzzi and in jumps a little kid who starts splattering around? Or when you're at the cinema, focused on a really interesting scene and some kid starts talking all over the place "Daddy, look at that!" multiple times throughout the movie. 

It should be more normalized for kids not to be taken everywhere. There should be more places for adults who specifically don't have kids for a reason. The obsession around "kids are cute and should be with everyone 24/7" is disgusting.My cat died yesterday. I made a little rant post about it but got mostly indifferent and even hurtful replies. Some people accused me of killing my own cat because I let it go outside from time to time.

I told my sister we were going to bury our furry friend on Wednesday and she asked me ‘why?’

When my coworker’s dog died, he got a day off.

Pets are pets and life is life. Cats can be family members just as much as dogs can but they don’t get nearly as much love. It pisses me off.

Edit:
Little backstory:

My wife and I can’t have a second child due to complications during the first pregnancy.

Our son, now five, was really sad he couldn’t have a brother or sister when he was about three. He kept asking for a cat, so thats what we got for our family.

We found Mellow, a fully grey (blue) ragdoll. We took him home when he was seven weeks old. He became instant friends with our son and was basically his protector. When we were outside at the playground, Mellow was there to keep watch. He slept on the rug by his bed or on the covers. When my son would take out the trash, Mellow would escort him. When our son went to a friends house to play, Mellow would wait for at least half an hour by the friends’ door.

He got hit by a car on Saturday. Without going in too much detail: the street is still covered in blood.

He wasn’t even two years old.

I made a post on r/rant condemning the driver that hit Mellow. I got a lot of negative and personal responses which I couldn’t handle anymore so I deleted the post.

Thanks to everyone for their heartwarming replies.Took another stroll through r/popular and I feel gross. The most upvoted posts around certain current events seem to be incapable of any perspective. There's a reason why watching too much news can be depressing and I try not to pay too much attention at the best of times. But now? There's pretty much no genuine discussion to be found, which can be fine when people aren't taking themselves too seriously. But there's a lot of hate, in response to real hate and perceived hate, and no matter what 'side' you're on it isn't good for anyone.

I used to think Reddit was fun, but the fun is now limited to niche corners of the site. I may come back when this all blows over, but I doubt it.Be prepared for multiple opinions:

You have a moral obligation to fix your mental/physical issues and childhood traumas before you bring children into this world. Trauma and abuse is passed down through generations unless someone breaks the wheel. Having a kid because you think it might fix you is completely f*cked up. Human beings are not objects or tools. Stop having kids to get your SO to stay, or because you're lonely, or because you feel pressured to do so by society. Have them if YOU are READY. If not, you contribute exponentially to the problems of the world today.

 Too many people talk about having "rights" without thinking about the consequences of those rights. 

Yeah you can have 22 kids if you wanted, but that doesnt mean you should. Too many broken adults out there raising equally as broken children and the whole world suffers because of this. Get it together people. Stop procreating like this.

BC should be free, abortions should be legal EVERYWHERE and I almost daresay encouraged.

EDIT: If you had kids before you thought you were ready, I dont intend to make you feel badly. Just do better by you and do better by your kids.

EDIT EDIT: Cheers for the gold! I appreciate you. Time to spread the wealth to others (:Like, for real, does anybody actually enjoy it? I get that people get off on things "taboo", but there must be better way to achieve that than to imagine having sex with your sister/uncle/mom/grandpa etc.

Can't porn producers just be content with making people bang their bosses or best friends sister? And you can't even filter it out! Half-way through a decent POV-flick and suddenly the girl says something like "Yeah, you like fucking your sister huh?" and the whole thing is ruined. Instant boiled noodle.

I am in no way a prude, but damn it if I don't draw the line at "Family Funtime".Like, I know you want to support me but you’re making me seem like I am the strong one. I cry every day. Cancer sucks. Calling me a super hero isn’t helping. It makes me feel like a weak victim. 

I have been thinking about this for a while and I understand it's not easy to discuss about it.

Whenever a kid dies everyone says "poor angel, he/she had a whole life in front of him/her" while what I think is "it's sure terrible for someone to die at such a young age, but every serial killer, dictator, murderer, drug dealer, abusive parent, pedophile and so on has been a kid too, maybe he/she would have become one too and we have been """lucky""" with his/her death" .

When a 40/50 years old dies you don't hear the same thing by the people while we already knew if he/she was a good person or not.

I know this is complicated to understand and is also hard for me to explain it in english, probably I'm the only one to think in this way and is this to make it really unpopular.

I also want to add that this is just my thought and by thinking it I'm not hurting anyone.

Edit. Something I have considered but forgot to clarify is that I was thinking about the death of people that are strangers to me. Of course the loss of a loved one is different.Ever since I can remember I have found acne attractive. By acne I dont mean just one or two zits, I mean a full face. I dont know why, but I see them the same way I see freckles. Its really adorable to me. I'm attracted to both men and women so this applies to everyone. In the past I have had mini crushes on people and the main thing I found attractive was their acne.

So if you have bad acne, dont worry! There will be people like me who find it very cute.

Edit: Adding some things to answer some of the reoccuring comments :) 
Apparently similar posts have been made on this topic before, I didnt realise this. I dont care for karma and was just talking about this acne topic with my boyfriend recently. He said before I told him that he never really thought about it but after he did he realised he also found it cute. This surprised me as I hadnt heard this from anyone before apart from myself.

I had acne when I was younger and it made me feel really insecure, so I had the idea of posting my opinion here to let people struggling with acne know that theyre beautiful :) 

I do have a bad memory though, so maybe I saw one of these posts in passing and got reminded of it after the conversation with my partner. Either way, I dont really care for karma, so this is not fake. 

Also clarifying that this isnt fetish! I find people with acne attractive, but its not a sexual thing. Like I said, I find acne similar to freckles. I think theyre cute details :) 

I am glad I made some people happy, even if it were only for a moment, so thank you to all those comments :) Your comments made my day too!Sometimes my younger sister will ask me to do something with her, and I just don't feel like it. There isn't a particular reason for why I don't want to do it, I just don't. I might not be in the mood or maybe I just don't feel like it. But if I tell her no, and she asks why, she won't accept the answer 'because I don't want to'. She tells me that I have to have a reason because otherwise I don't have an excuse for not doing it. I feel like this is unfair because sometimes I just really do not want to do something but I can't form a coherent reason as to why.

So, yeah. I think 'because I don't want to' is a perfectly fine reason to give for not wanting to do something. Sometimes you just don't have a reason.I (5'11") stand just a few inches taller than the average guy. A standard bathtub length is apx **5 feet** and thats not even counting the hangover shelf or the slope. The **actual** length of your bathtub is just **4 feet**. Odd you'd find it difficult to find that number on any search engine but go get a measuring tape and give it a go.

As I've gotten older, I've been fortunate enough to have continuously upgraded my living conditions. I have found that bathtubs directly correlate w/ social class!!!! What the absolute fuck, I dont remember being any shorter when I was broke and its not like adding a foot of length to a tub wouldn't be a welcomed trade *even* if it meant a foot taken from a closet or towel rack. 

 I know this will seem like I'm cracked *and maybe I am* but its this sort of shit that makes me want to turn this "social class cold war" into something far less passive. Been oppressed my whole life and thats fine, in a lot of ways I'm better for it but when the simplest of pleasantries like this are so smugly withheld...it doesn't make me want to "Hustler harder to get what I want", it makes me want to teach high society how short they are when tipped over.

 Anyways, bathtubs *em I rite*???

Edit: Seems like a lot of people hate their tubs too! Follow up question for my fellow 'miniature tub' owners...if a bigger tub wasn't an option, would or wouldn't you rather the standard to just be a stand in shower, with that bulky tub removed for optimal space?

Edit 2: I don't get out much so imma reply to all 600 comments, so don't get all fussy when I respond a week from now on "a dead post". If thats "so *cringe*", then maybe you shouldn't talk to strangers...cuz they might just be a weirdo

Edit 2.5 A: For the love of God, stop 'following me'. You dont want this. This train goes nowhere *really* fast, makes disappointing whistles and the conductor is just 3 trench coats in a child suit. Seriously, just look at my history, half the time I'm rambling like a mad man and the other half is symmetricalI've always loved the dentist! The chair, the sounds, the cleaning and everything about it just makes me feel good. That feeling of cleanliness once you leave and the satisfaction of having a clean mouth is just unreal. I would honestly go to the dentist every day if I could

Edit: Well this got more attention than I anticipated

Edit #2: just got home from work, flossed, pouring a bourbon and fantasizing about that point hook thing scraping my teeth

Edit #3: Last one...yes I've had braces, yes I've had other dental work done, yes I've had my wisdom teeth ripped out, yes I still fucking love the dentistIf you call someone, especially a male, a skeleton or a stick, that is 100% as rude and disrespectful as calling someone a fat ass etc. 

If you think other wise, think again. There is no logical reason why it’s less offensive. And if you call someone a skeleton etc, you absolutely cannot get upset if they call you a whale.

Edit: I’m about to take a lot of down votes for this but I don’t care: Why are so many people talking to me like I’m a huge body positivity person? I’m not. I do not think all bodies are beautiful. It’s an illogical thing to say? I don’t “celebrate” being skinny. It’s a FLAW. I don’t celebrate or encourage it, the same way I don’t celebrate being fat. The world isn’t out to get us lmao. It’s a FLAW, the same as having a pimple.

I’m simply saying those two things, are equal insultsI've seen people say that wearing jeans to sleep is weird and uncomfortable but I like it. I honestly think it's better than wearing actual pajamas to bed. I wear jeans to sleep almost every night and it's great.I mean, you already dragged me into it against my will, mine as well let me hear the entire story. There are some people who would rather not hear you arguing with your spouse about what kind of laundry detergent you should get.

But for me, if I just hear you blabbing on the phone in public, I get curious, and I think we as humans are curious beings. I want to know what the other side of the party has to say. For example, what if the person in public on the phone arguing is wanting to purchase beer instead of diapers for their kid and the person they're speaking to is against that? It's something that drives me insane, I NEED to know what the other side is saying.Entitled parents should not expect pre teens/teens to share parental duties. Don’t have additional kids if you do not have the resources to hire childcare. Older children can learn responsibility in other ways that enriches their life. They should not be saddled with the burden of parenthood.**TLDR** : You should be able to straightforwardly AND respectfully express to your SO if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body IF you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship.

**Edit - before anything else PLEASE READ:** 

\- So, let me start by saying I deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. They were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- The other thing is: I have to admit that this post was rushed. And yes, I am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). The funny thing is that while I might think some commenters are oversensitive I have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and I can also get oversensitive. I don't regret what I wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. Some of you made the assumption that I must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. That's right. And sometimes I turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw I'm female for those who thought otherwise). The reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. I can understand that what I said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). And at the end I'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. I should have considered more factors. I want to apologize about that honestly. So thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now I'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. I'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. So thank you for offering the experience. I appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. I'll try and digest them properly in the following days. I'm still think that I'm right about SOME aspects but not anymore do I believe my reasoning is flawless. I wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**Content:**

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don’t mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn’t put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can’t take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can’t just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too “soft”) - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn’t have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it’s a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it’s so sensitive…

Looks does matter. We have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.When you swim in denim jeans it’s like you’re an armored aquatic creature. The way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. Feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they’re soaking wet. 

Also, when your jeans are soaked, they’re heavier. It’s always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

If you haven’t tried swimming in baggy jeans I suggest doing so. It will change your life.

And anyone who tells you this doesn't have your best interest at heart. 

Complacency is death, and we should strive to be better than what we were yesterday. Nevermind that no one can actually be perfect.

Edit: To clarify, I'd extend this to all similar "you're amazing/great/awesome/other just the way you are" statements. It implicates complacency and stagnation, which is antithetical to growth and self-improvement.As the title suggests I like a good set of knees on a woman more than boobs, I’m a leg guy in general but there is something aesthetically appealing about a good set of knees. I think on some level it’s a good indicator of overall physical health but I haven’t really dug into this.It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.Yeah that’s right, I said it… I’ve been lurking on Reddit for far too long and always hid my guilty pleasure, but today I come out the closet. Buttered popcorn drizzled with ketchup is absolutely delicious and surpasses not only all popcorn types, but ALL SNACKS. Caramel popcorn? Forget about it. Fruit snacks? Disgusting. Barbecue-flavored chips? Average at best. Show me the aisle in the grocery store with the popcorn and Heinz ketchup and I’ll be there.Basically title. They just look so much worse than what they did before. Especially Lip Jobs. Most Men hate Lip Jobs, it is really not appealing and very ugly. All people who get unnecessary plastic surgery look worse than they did before and are out 10K. Please don’t get Plastic Surgery, it’s ugly and very expensive.You see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, “There are still good people in this world. She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen.” or “Star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate”. Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something “nice” for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the “good deed” of course. Most of the time it seems like they don’t give a damn about the person who they did something “nice” for, instead it’s about “Look what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!” It’s all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it’s almost never about the person it should be about. It’s not sweet and heartwarming, it’s almost sort of heartbreaking because I’ve seen instances where people will do “nice things” for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody’s looking and don’t accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a “nice thing to do” and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it’s a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren’t mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don’t like to feel pitied or patronized. Especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. I’m not saying “Don’t ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives” I am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. Also if you’re gonna do something nice for someone make sure you’re being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don’t be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that’s not my main issue here. The motive isn’t the issue either, it’s the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one “nice” thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. I really don’t give that much of a shit about “prom queen” or shit like that anyway, I’m using it as an example. I’m almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow. Another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. Instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. That way he won’t feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. Make him feel like he’s not a helpless invalid.Look, not everyone likes/wants kids. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. Some people want to live in a neighborhood without kids screaming outside, or live in an apartment without a baby crying next door, or eat at a restaurant without kids making a fuss at the table behind them, etc, etc.

It's not fair for childless people to have to deal with other people's kids and all the annoying things they do. Not only childless people, but parents that want a break from their own kids shouldn't have to deal with them either. There are "pet-free" apartment buildings, and restaurants, and beaches, so why not "child-free?" Children can be just as gross, loud, and smelly as a pet.

People have so, SO many fun places to take their kids. Adults deserve more fun places to go where they don't have to be around Karen and her 5 little hellions.

Edit: You all are acting like I'm trying to ban kids from existence lol. Calm yourselves. I'm just saying a couple hundred "adult-only" arcades, movie theaters, restaurants, etc would be nice. It's not much to ask especially since there are thousands and thousands of those that are kid friendly. So far "go to a bar" is the biggest argument you guys can think of. That's pretty sad. Not everyone likes the bar scene or drinks.

Edit: By the way, many of you are being very rude for no reason. This is a post on Reddit on a sub for unpopular opinions. If you don't agree, that's the point. You don't have to be keyboard warriors and straight up assholes.I get it. I do.
I grew up when there was no internet. We didn't even know what other countries looked like except from pictures in books in school and magazines, but we knew those were curated. You kids today are bombarded with cold reality consistently. It makes sense that you all feel such anguish over the state of everything because so much of what you all see is awful. We never saw that stuff growing up. We heard about it. So I understand how you can be so outraged. This is all much worse than we thought when we grew up. You get no buffer but you get my respect.> The lawsuit accuses Zobayan, Bryant’s longtime pilot, of several acts of negligence including failing to abort the flight, failing to monitor and assess the weather, and failure to keep a safe distance between natural obstacles and the helicopter.

Vanessa Bryant's net worth is estimated to be at least $600 million, if not significantly more. She obviously doesn't need the money and is just extending the grieving process for both families. I can't think of any possible reason for her to do this, outside of a need to get "revenge" against the man who caused the crash by taking money from his wife/kids.I've lived in the suburbs and in a city. In both places, parallel parking is what's used the most. I've met so many who "don't like" parallel parking, which basically means they can't do it and avoid it at all costs. I literally know someone who has a family member drop them off whenever they have to go somewhere just to avoid the parallel parking. I understand that this person can drive a car, but why should they have a license if they can't do one of the basic requirements of getting to and from places.That kid can’t even sing. She only got a Grammy because her mommy and daddy are rich and famous. The Weeknd wasn’t even nominated and you’re talking time this kid who had less talent than the baby shark kids gets a Grammy! There are people who worked 10x harder and can sing 10x better who didn’t get anything and this rich kid gets one of the biggest music awards ever just for having a famous mommy. This was ridiculous and I hope it never happens again. I’m tired of rich kids getting everything handed to them for doing nothing.

Edit: how about you guys stop spreading biased and untrue crap about me. This is for unpopular opinions. For you to disagree with me is the point.

Edit 2: you people think you’re so smart trying to make me seem like I lied when I said I didn’t watch the Grammy’s. What loser would make that up about a person? “Oooooh he watched the Grammy’s omggggggggggggggg!!!” I didn’t. I didn’t try to trick anybody either. You are the one doing the tricking of you want to say that. When I call you people out for lying I get downvoted. Y’all need to pull your heads out of your butts.

Yeah all you people who want to make stuff up about me don’t deserve an apology. In the end, I’m the one with the 20k+ upvotes and 50+ awards.People talk about how russia meddles in elections and china as well.  There is a foreign nation, with people of dual citizenship holding office in the US, large lobbyist groups and if you say a word about that you're seemingly instantly branded an anti-semite.  What is going on with this picture?  I should feel free to criticize israel for their non-signing of the nuke proliferation treaty, poor treatment of palestine, the stolen land of the Palestinians, etc, etc etc, without being labeled an alt right bigot.
I am not alt right, I am not even on the right at all but I hold these views.
*Edit for spelling and thank you for the gold and platinum!  It's my very first.As you probably know, Dr. Seuss is in the process of being [unpersonned and erased from childrens' literature](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/books/dr-seuss-mulberry-street.amp.html). The reason is some allegedly racist drawings of Japanese people (more excuses have been brought forth, but I'm focusing in the Japanese issue). 

What the sanctimonious cancelmob is ignorant of is that Seuss belonged to the WWII generation, where many Americans were anti-Japanese (*not* anti-Asian) and many if not most Japanese were anti-American. Virulently so. This was entirely expected, as the two countries were at war with each other. And in fact, both governments actively encouraged such attitudes -- the enemy must be dehumanized in war, as we all know.

Yes, Seuss drew a few propaganda caricatures of the Japanese. And in the same period, the Japanese committed heinous war crimes against American POWs, including [murdering 40% of American prisoners of war](https://time.com/3334677/pow-world-war-two-usa-japan/) in violation of Japanese law and the Geneva Conventions. For reference, less than 1% of American POWs died at the hands of the *Nazis*. 

Now they're chill, but in WWII the Japanese were bloodthirsty, monstrous mass murderers of POWs and civilians alike. They murdered 40 times more American prisoners of war than the fucking *Nazis*. And they refuse to apologize for it to this day. 

**This is the world in which Seuss drew a few tacky caricatures of the Japanese.** 

To cancel him for this would be like canceling Hogan's Heroes for their undeniably bigoted depiction of Germans.As a small business owner, and someone uncertain about whether I can whether the storm of a serious recession, I’m much more worried about the economy spiraling out of control than catching the virus. Watching the economy continue to sink truly scares me more than anything.I’m someone who likes themselves some dick every once in a while. And let me tell ya, average dick size is the average for a reason. Ain’t nobody tryna get skewered by Vlad the Impaler with his 12+ inch tube of meat. I just want some nice stimulation, not a reconstruction of my internal organs.

And when it comes to oral sex, small dicks are where it’s at. Have you ever tried to eat a piece of steak that won’t cut, then you end up choking and almost dying? That’s what sucking a big dick is like.

It’s really true. It’s not about the size of the boat. It’s about the motion of the ocean.I'm 33, was 29-30 when I became aware of it. It's a shame that this particular move has been relegated to "annoying teens" or "doing it but ironically".

It snaps your entire upper body into a very pronounced, expressive shape. It's a perfect fit for a pop after getting some sort of win, or to punctuate a brag. It also brings a nice punch as a dance move, with minimal physical effort. These types of teachers will always try to make you aware that their subject is the king of all subjects and should be taken most seriously. They don't care whatever amount of work you got in other subjects or how difficult they are. In spite of trying to make their subject interesting, they constantly warn you about how important their subject is and how many students don't get good grades in it. Sometimes they deliberately try to make their subject more difficult by giving more assignments and hard grading. They are worse than a teacher who teaches badly.I've never understood why people take offense to that? Sometimes age is crucial to know in terms of legality, and in other times it's good to know just in case. I've always been sorta blunt and oblivious, but I don't see why it's that big of a deal? Like it's just how long you've been on this Earth, why is it such a forbidden thing to ask for?

Edit: rip my inbox lolFor example, it is not cultural appropriation for me to wear kimono, it's something that everyone wears, and you don't really have to earn something to wear it. Wearing it is cultural appreciation.

On the other hand I would never wear a headdress, in many native American cultures, a headdress is something you have to earn to wear, wearing it will be cultural appropriation.

Double Edit: Bug Chingus
I think I should reiterate, I'm not saying you can or can't do certain things that are associated with culture, I think that's  it's all about respect. You can do anything as long as it's respectful to a culture and its people.Disclaimer: I am gay and my husband feels the same way
In recent media I feel that in order to keep overly offended children from screaming at them tv shows and movies have been shoving in gay characters as token characters. This to me feels the same as putting a black character in to show we aren’t racist. It’s a thinly veiled ploy at capturing an audience that will watch a show because “hey look we have a gay!”
It’s ridiculous and we should in courage having characters that are natural to the story you want to tell. If them being gay enhances the story then by all means but don’t shove it in just cause you do t want an angry letter.I just feel more at peace when I brush my teeth after eating breakfast. When I try brushing them as soon as I wake up, the thought of brushing them again after breakfast will linger in my mind.  I also think it is more efficient and basically a two-in-one cleaning of the bacteria from both sleeping and eating.Everyone is acting like the world is such a worse place now than it was 50+ years ago. I actually think the world has always been this bad (probably even worse in the past) but the internet and media makes it possible for us to see more of these problems on an everyday basis.People have become so pragmatic on that sub that it has actually become quite toxic. People try to tackle every scenario with a logical structure that really doesn't reflect real life at all, because real life is not black and white. Let me say it loud for the world to hear:

IF YOU HAVE TO EXERT NO/LITTLE ENERGY TO MAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE EASIER, AND YOU DON'T DO IT, YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE!

I swear to god that the AITA sub is full of teenagers with very little life experience (that in fairness may be trying to think about a scenario logically) who deliver awful advice. It doesn't matter if you "don't owe that person shit" or whatever. There are very few examples I can think of where not doing some small gesture to help someone doesn't make you an asshole.

I just read a thread on someone who was bullied by a girl who now has terminal cancer. She asked for forgiveness and the poster said no. I can't imagine any bullying that wouldn't warrant a fake "it's okay" in that situation. Do the people replying to these posts not live normal lives? Do they have no empathy.

If you want to live your life in a way that makes you not an asshole: do good for others and expect nothing back. It really is that simple.It’s just mean and can ruin someone’s birthday. Plus, if someone takes away the cake at the last second, or if the cake isn’t that tall, you can actually hurt someone by slamming their face too hard on a table.When I'm scrolling down through instagram and I see a really bad meme or stupid post, for me to just keep scrolling or unfollow the account is not enough. I want to make sure they know how bad, stupid and boring their content is, but without a dislike button the only thing i can do is either nothing or comment some hater shit, which still isn't the same because I'm sure a lot of people would dislike too if there was a button, but not all of them are willing to comment. 

Is worth mentioning that this isn't only about hating on the internet, is also about giving a feedback to awful content makers so they know their shit is boring and can make something about it to improve.

Same goes with tiktok, wich I downloaded for a week and then uninstalled it becasue of people making shit content and me not being able to make them know how bad they are. Also because there are almost none original videos there. 

Notice that im exclusively talking about all those post of social media that, although they have 10k likes, they would for sure get the doble or triple of dislikes in case there was the option

Edit: Thanks a lot for the awards and first gold :DIf you are just watching, this does not apply. Only for videos and photos. 


Idc if you think their performance is shitty, laughable, embarrassing, or amazing. Once you decide to take a photo or video, you have measurably gained and taken something from their performance for however you plan to use it in the future. 


Whether you kept it for viewing in the future for your own entertainment & memories or If you share it with your friends... you now have something to use in the future for your own gain and those you share it with (this is a good thing, just tip the source)


Especially ppl that post these to their Instagram, you’re getting them dopamine hits off all the likes that performer earned you, but you couldn’t give them a few cents, a dollar? And that’s basically the whole reason they’re out there ... if you want to act like you are a “righteous” person, don’t cheap out here.Cigarettes used to be considered normal in the late 1900s until people started to realize cigarettes can cause lung issues. We need to be doing the same with alcohol. Alcohol is helps contributes to DUIs, assaults, rapes, and a whole host of other issues. Alcohol is the reason why college parties are so dangerous. Alcohol has destroyed and ripped apart families. We need a public campaign against alcohol like we have against smoking and vaping.I know you’re not supposed to care, but it’s like contributing to a conversation IRL then being told to fuck off. It’s like a shot to your ego/self esteem because nobody cares about your opinion until it eventually becomes hidden. Same way getting upvotes makes you fell good about yourself and is an ego boost.

Imagine if there were was a dislike button on Instagram, people would be committing suicide.Tricks like the "very tiny close button" so it'll be hard for you to click it and when not clicked properly, and not accurately, the ad will divert you to the Store to show their app installation; the "short demo" where you will be able to play for seconds then will eventually, and surprisingly, redirect you to the Store; and the sorts.

Any application every user is using is private. If an ad automatically and suddenly puts you in any private account of yours, including the App Store and Play Store of course, without you consenting it, it should be considered a violation. Therefore, the tricks have to stop.

That being said, I'd add that it is indeed frustrating and undeniably irritating too.

Edit: Whoa! I wasn't expecting this to blow up. Thank you so very much! And to the people who keep saying this to be not "unpopular" at all, I'm truly sorry I disappointed you. I didn't know.I love the swings and monkey bars but there are few that are actually tall enough for me to use. I'm pretty short 5'2 but I still can't use the monkey bars at the park near my house. Plus if there were adult playgrounds they could make the slides and climby things bigger and more challenging. I miss using those metal Zipline things that you had to hold onto to go from platform to platform. I don't want to get in the way of children playing or get weird looks being an adult on the slide so we need adult playgrounds. Why can't adults have a fun place to unleash their inner child and get some exercise while we're at it.I currently own an iPhone 12 Pro and I recently found my old iPhone 6 and set it back up. Using the Touch ID on it was so refreshing. While Face ID is an amazing technology it can be unreliable sometimes and requires you to be looking at your phone for it to work. Also in the currently world of wearing masks it makes it virtually useless.

Touch ID at least for me works 99% of the time and you don’t need to be looking at it to work. And of course wearing a mask isn’t an issue for it.

No this isn’t an earth shattering statement just thought I’d share.I hate listening to singing. I think it’s crazy that everybody loves to hear people sing. I can’t stand it. I think it is the worst part of music by far and it often ruins what would be great music. I know it’s crazy but I actually feel offended that singers think that their art is so breathtaking that I would want to listen to their voice. Who do they think they are? It just all feels so choreographed and predictable and it makes me cringe. There are some exceptions I guess, but in general if the song is focused on the singer instead of the music, I do not like it. Thanks for reading friends.I hate whenever I am watching a show or movie and an unnecessary sex scene comes on. Especially if there are multiple sex scenes that aren’t needed. Sometimes I’m watching something with a family member and a scene like that comes on and it makes everything so awkward and some of those scenes are so long and dragged out. I just feel like those scenes are being added into shows more often because they think it’ll get more viewers (kind of like horror movies who use too many jump scares to try to make things more creepy, but it just becomes annoying)Don't get me wrong. I love dogs. I love animals. But dogs are just that. Animals. They take a piss, lick themselves clean then lick us. I know that their saliva helps them clean their mouths, but they clean it for themselves, not to make it clean for us. It's like nails on a chalkboard for me when I see pictures of people ~~(mostly women)~~ puckering their lips for their dog to lick them.

My dog has been trained to sniff my face as much as he wants but never lick it. He can lick my hand or arm a couple of times before I discourage him and wash myself off. I don't let him lick my face for the same reason I don't let strangers lick me: I don't know where TF his tongue has been.

At the end of the day, to each their own, it's just not my cup of tea.

&#x200B;

EDIT: The number of people comparing being licked in the face by a dog to having sex with another human being is astounding. To be clear, I'm not saying we're pristine, clean creatures. I'm saying that we have the intelligence (hopefully) to 1) clean ourselves up after partaking in whatever consensual sex act we find enjoyable and 2) not lick other people once we've eaten their ass. If either of those options are foreign to you, well... you do you. Just... not around me.There are plenty of women who would be offended if their partner asked for a paternity test. A lot of men become trapped by this and only discover a child is not theirs many years after the fact. 

When a woman gives birth, there is also bound to be a man in the equation who now has to decide if he is going to raise this child or not. When making this decision, it should be a man's right to know without a shadow of a doubt whether he is the biological father of the child or not.

You wouldn't buy a car before requesting the Carfax, would you?

EDIT: after reading through many of these comments I've changed my position.I just think it’d be funny if it went completely silent after a public speaker tried it. It’s super annoying to have to say “good morning” or anything like that anyway, especially if you already didn’t wanna be there.
Regardless of the tool or method they use any person who hunts for their meat is acting exceedingly more ethical than a person who buys their meat prepackaged in a grocery store. The life that deer/bird/animal lived up to the point of uts death was 100x better than the life of any factory farmed animal.

In some cases if argue that it's more ethical to consume some hunted meat over massive farm produced vegetables that causes deforestation and harm to the local populations (i.e. avocados). 

I'd even argue that controlled and regulated trophy hunting is one of the largest reasons many of these species are able to sustain and even grow in a way that wouldnt exist. Most specifically rhinos and lions.Okay, I get that you don't want students or pupils to write notes instead of focus on the course. However, it might be something private that they need to share with a friend. Maybe it's family problems or personal health. A teacher has NO right to share this with the whole class.Hear me out. Think of all the space we would save. 
I'm talking about doubling, possibly tripling the amount of dead people room in cemeteries. If capitalism isn't what sells you. Think of the environment.

Edit: For Christians. When the rapture comes you're already in missile silo mode to bust out of there.Sex sells. It's a common marketing thing and, guess what? Its successful because its true. But there's now been such an over saturation of sex being used to sell that it's everywhere.

Adverts - those perfume adverts for one. Why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off? Another example, in the UK, an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the Underground for being too sexy. It was on a massive wall on the station platform.

TV - Too Hot to Handle is my bugbear for this one right now. A bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Also, reality tv in general has become about sexiness. The Kardashians, for one.

Music - The sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary, not to mention the performances on stage.

The extent of sexualisation is profound. So much so that I think we as a Western culture have become used to it. I have a friend from Sri Lanka. When he came to the UK, he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere.

I really hope that in the future, we realise that we've exploited ourselves and our youth. I hope there's time to change.

Edit: Holy shit this blew up, and holy shit my first awards! Thanks Redditors!

Wow, this one is divisive. A couple of points.

1. Yes, genocide, war, slavery are definitely worse then this. But as a modern Western generation, we did not perpetuate these things. I am speaking as someone who has seen a buildup of these factors.

2. Calling me prude or boomer doesn't give an actual point.First, before anyone gets too upset, I have no problem with what the rainbow has come to represent and I have no problem wearing rainbow items in support of marginalized communities that identify by whatever acronym they want (which I have done and will continue to do). That said, I wish sometimes I could wear a rainbow without making a statement. I love rainbows and I’m fine sharing it with whoever, I just wish that it wasn’t monopolized by one community over another.One example that made me think of this are from the office, such as when Michael and Jan are in the bathroom at a party, and Jan is forcing Michael to do sexual acts- however no one ever talks about this, and people still talk about how Jan had good qualities and was even sometimes likeable. What it seems like to me is that they put this into the show as something meant to be funny, however if it was a man doing it to a woman, it would’ve been recognized as disturbing, as it should be recognized.I do this often. I’ve found it to be quite cozy. In fact, I believe wearing jeans to bed is far more comfortable than sweatpants. Or any other pant for that matter.It's the parents responsibility to protect their children from the internet. I say a lot of fucked up shit while gaming and if you don't block voice chat on games your eight year old plays that is your fault not mine.People post videos that are 3 minutes long and you want to see a specific part but you can't, because it is a gif and now you have to watch the whole 3 minutes again to sit through everything to see that specific detail. Oh, you blinked? Sit there and wait for it. Wanna show your friend or SO? Sit there in front of them and say "hey, I wanna show something really cool" and just sit there for 2 minutes waiting for the gif to finish and hiding your phone so it doesn't spoil it.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for the responses and a special thank you for:        
My 1st Platinum!! Thank you so much!    
My first ever award!    
My first (and 2nd and 3rd) silver!    
My first "Bless up"!    
My first "I'd like to thank..." award!    
    
Thank you guys for the awards and appreciation. I appreciate it.I know it's customary to wait three to five business days to get a refund whenever you purchase something but all I'm saying is if they can take the money out of my account under 2 minutes they should be able to put it back in the same amount of time. 
They have the money just give it back to me! 



I had to take my son to the doctor 2 days ago to get another covid test and check up because he's 6 months old and we're just getting over Coronavirus.

The clinic charged me my copay twice so now I'm negative $80 in my bank. This could have completely been avoided if they hadn't charged me twice or if they just refunded me within the day like I asked them to! 

Supposedly it takes them 2 weeks to issue a refund. I'm sorry it took you 2 seconds to take it out of my bank account why does it take you two weeks to refund it???

My opinion is a company should be able to refund you just as quickly as they take funds from you. There is no reason why they can't they have the funds.There is enough money in the world to easily feed and house every single person on Earth. With all of the wealth currently being hoarded, the haves could *very easily* provide for the have-nots.

So why don't they? The most common answer I see is something along the lines of "handouts will make people lazy and the no one will want to work." I wholeheartedly believe that anyone who says this has never experienced poverty a day in their life. To believe that the *majority of poor people* would be content to scrape by on the bare minimum for the rest of their lives is absurd. The underlying message to this argument is essentially saying that the answer to poverty is for poor people to just "stop being poor."

It's as if some people think being poor is a choice. They absolve themselves of guilt by saying that poor people can stop being poor whenever they want if they just stop being lazy. Yes, they can just manifest mental health, a support system of friends and family, clean clothes, access to proper hygiene, a balanced diet, and reliable transportation--they just have to want it bad enough! Absolutely asinine.

The truth is we HAVE the money. We just collectively choose not to help because most of us have decided that it's not our problem.

"It doesn't affect me personally so who cares."

"Those people made their choice."

"They're probably criminals/addicts anyway."

Sentiments like this go against the very point of society: to collectively benefit from co-existence. Ten people living together in a community will thrive exponentially better than if they lived individually. This is because each person has something they can contribute to the overall good of the collective. So it is worth it for the other 9 to occasionally help out the 1 who is facing temporary adversity. The problem is that, at some point, we all decided that homeless people were worthless and that it wasn't worth it to help them. We decided that society would go on just fine without the poorest among us, so why bother wasting resources on helping them?

We've dehumanized poor people to the point that we are no more concerned about their well-being than we are about wild animals. In fact, I'd say most people are more likely to care about abandoned cats & dogs than they are about the homeless. Because those people "chose" to be homeless, but stray animals are merely innocent victims.Should men put the seat down when they're done? Certainly. 

Should you trust us enough to assume that the seat is always down and simply sit without looking? No more than we should assume that there will be any gas left in the car by the time you give it back to us.It seems like it's becoming more and more of a trend these days for people to make their cars loud enough to be heard half a mile away or so. I really don't understand why, especially considering most of them end up sounding like popcorn machines or toy cars. Most newer cars don't even naturally have that "roar" to them, so you're basically trying to squeeze water from a stone when you try to make them sound like an older car.

Motorcycles are especially bad, as it honestly just sounds like ear-splitting flatulence, and the only good use for that is when those bands of motorcycle riders went to military funerals and revved their motors to drown out the hateful chants of Westboro Baptist Church. Other than that, it's just a grating way of saying "hey, look at me" that doesn't end up making you look cool so much as it just makes you a nuisance. Don't act surprised if someone gives you a dirty look or yells "shut up" at you or something like that, cause you really deserve it if you go around revving your overly-loud noise bike just for the heck of it.

Obviously emergency vehicles are an exception, but that's so you can hear them coming and get out of the way. If your vehicle sounds cool by nature, you don't need to make them super loud to make yourself look cool. In the process of doing that second thing, you just end up making yourself into a nuisance.  


EDIT: Welp, this certainly blew up more than I thought it would. Thanks for the awards and karma, and thanks for bringing up how noise can be a safety feature out on the open road when it comes to motorcycles (something I didn't exactly consider before posting). I may have come off as a bit heavy-handed in how I stated certain things here, so for that part I apologize if anyone was put off by it. I currently work at a grocery store, though, and constantly hearing these loud vehicles in the parking lot drives me crazy and has made me hate the phenomenon all the more.Originally removed due to lack of explanation.

What I mean is when you get home from work before your day off, you typically have plans for that day off. But that time inbtween post-work/errands and that "day off" are the best. The few hours you are truly "off".Your religion - faith, belief - it's your choice. If someone chooses to believe differently, or to examine the world of belief outside of what they have been taught, let them. If, instead, your religion traps them, abuses them for having doubts, forces them to be re-educated, or strips them of their livelihood and possessions when they try to leave, then it's no more legitimate than a cult.I'm just as fucking scared as the rest of y'all.



I *hate* when people say that because I'm a guy I'll "never know" what it's like to walk down the street at night in fear. To me that's just the most idiotic thing - just about EVERYONE has that fear to some degree. It's just my fear is about dying or ending up in the hospital while women's fears are more likely to be about sexual assault. That's all the difference there is. 



I'm not a fighter by any means. I'm not trained, qualified, or confident in my ability to fight off someone who is being violent for whatever reason. Me being a man doesn't mean I'm imbued with crazy hulk-strength automatically, much less know how to use it.



So yeah, I walk down the street at night clutching the knife I carry with me, or my phone unlocked and on the call screen. Stop acting like men never know this fear because they are men. It's unempathetic and makes you look like you struggle to care about other people.



Edit: this is NOT a discussion about one side being worse or not. This isn't saying what men experience is often equal to women, just that it's *shared*. Be civil in the comments, please. All I'm saying is that guys don't live in a bubble of protection and I've been told that we do. Someone said it well - we just don't want to be written off as a footnote because we can be vulnerable TOO. Also, of course things are different if you're a guy or a girl, I don't deny that. I don't want to dismiss any fears that women have. It's just invalidating to portray guys as having nothing to fear, or holding them to a standard that makes them seem pathetic if they have fears.I think cursing is an element of language that is extremely valuable.

Expressing emotion is one of the biggest factors of language, and sometimes your emotions are so big, regular words just don’t do it. I don’t promote constantly using them, but the fact that these words are taboo make them very influential. I think there should be words like that, so when we use them, there’s emphasis.

For example, saying “get over here!” Simply doesn’t hold up to “get the fuck over here”. It communicates a sense of urgency which would be difficult to express otherwise in a quick and concise phrase.

Of course, there’s always tone of voice to convey the same things that cursing does. But some of us don’t have that ability. 

Personally, I struggle with tone of voice. My voice is flat and monotone, and my facial expressions aren’t very expressive either. My voice is naturally quiet and it gets no ones attention. So cursing, when used sparingly, is a powerful element

Edit- thank you for all of the responses and rewards! I appreciate it all :)Hear me out. Rich, creamy, airy vanilla bean goodness. Pairs perfecty with any dessert. A perfect pallet clenser to a large meal. The best kind has this strong vanilla bean flavor that just makes it shine.

Chocolate to me feels like its always trying to be something complex but always fails on its own. It always needs something else in it to make an impression.

Similar to a modern day piece of art, less can be more. Vanilla is so much better.I was just looking at a post on instagram of Rihanna in her shear, sparkly dress that didn't leave much to the imagination. I was going through the comments and so many people were complaing about how she shouldn't be dressing like this because young girls look up to her. 

But I mean, people, it's Rihanna. Her songs talk about sex, drugs, money, relationships. You know, things that *aren't* for children. She *does not* make music for children, therefore she should not be a rolemodel for children. 

If you have such a problem with the way she conducts herself then maybe your children shouldn't be listening or looking up to her anyway. You are the parents if you want your child to have a good role model send them in the direction of someone you want them to be like. And if that person isn't someone like Rihanna, then don't let them listen to Rihanna!I mean, has The United States of America ever needed math and science more in its history than right now? Telling students this ingrains, for the rest of their life, complacency and disregard for the world around them. 

Math and science classes don’t always have direct application, no, but calling them useless because of that is a naive oversimplification. These classes teach critical thinking. These classes teach problem solving. These classes teach our students *how* to think about things. 

I understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that he/she is not destined to be a failure because of it. But that is totally separate from “bragging” (especially around young people) that you don’t use math in your career (even though you probably do even if you don’t realize it). That is being a bad influence on a very easily influenced population of people. 

Math is money. Science is life. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist for these things to be important. And just because you fix air conditioners or sell cars for a living doesn’t mean you are absolved of them. In fact, that ignorance makes you way more prone to someone who does not share it taking advantage of you in life. 

Tl;dr: “I never use math in my job” and similar school-is-useless narratives are the last thing students need to be hearing, especially right now.

Edit: 

I did not mean to imply that *only* Americans face this problem. I was just speaking on what I know and didn’t want to generalize. 

Also, I feel like most people in the comments are missing the point. I’m not arguing that you do or don’t need the literal skill of math. I’m arguing that you should not give students and young people reason to have distrust in maths and sciences just because you don’t need to know how to graph a line at your day job. I know that the intended message is not harmful but the interpretation of it deeeefinitely can be.

Edit 2: 

Is it common practice in these parts to comment your opinion without actually reading the source post? Seriously seems like 75% of the comments aren’t even on the same page.Between the unearned level of confidence, the whole "you gotta give respect to get respect" demeanor, and the general lack of listening skills has led me to believe most teens are just dumb children with longer limbs.

This is obviously a generalization, but if another 16 year old tries to tell me how the government "actually" works, Imma slap'em.

EDIT: My original opinion was "teens can't be taken seriously" in a broad sense. But it seems more people are debating my opinion of "respect". I guess either way it's seemingly unpopular.

EDIT 2: Woke up today being slapped with notifications. I'll spend some time reading other people's opinions. I respect everyone's opinions, just some of yours I won't take very seriously.Dabbing? Nah that shit was outright dumb.

Stanky leg? No that was just a boring dance move.

Yeet? This motherfucker can be used in any (un)imaginable way possible and it instantly makes it funnier regardless of implication or meaning.I feel like with a lot of things I see online, you have to abandon your interests at the drop of a hat because someone involved in it is a horrible person or has done or said something that's just not socially acceptable. The message I'm getting from the world today is if you wanna have an interest, it has to be completely related to your social/political views, and they better be the right views.It has an impact on social acceptance, romantic interest, business opportunity, day to day interaction. The shape of your skull essentially impacts your entire life in invaluable ways, but it’s not labeled as a disease or illness. There are tons of papers on benefits garnered from being attractive. It’s annoying that in 2021 plastic surgery still doesn’t help the vast majority of the time and makes things worse a lot. Does anyone else agree?

Edit: apparently this is a very unpopular opinion which means I should be getting upvoted instead of downvoted lol

Edit 2: Yea, "terminal" wasn’t the right word to use. I meant chronic conditions. Terminal cancer would definitely be worse than being ugly unless your ugliness makes life so unenjoyable you want to die anyway. If someone told me I could have Crohn’s disease if I was 10/10 attractive, I’d take the Crohns. 

Also, people keep talking about beauty being subjective. Okay, I guess you’re TECHNICALLY right but functionally wrong. 99/100 people will agree that Brad Pitt is good-looking. 2/100 people will think Shane Macgowan is good-looking. All of the benefits of attractiveness hinge on the opinion of others, so the larger percentage of the population that finds you attractive, the more benefits you garner.

Also, I know you can’t be diagnosed as ugly… I just didn’t think Redditors would stick on that one point so I didn’t bother putting more effort into typing to correct it.

Edit 3: A lot of people are mentioning chronic diseases that would inhibit you from even taking advantage of your attractiveness because you wouldn’t be able to function normally. I guess those are good counters to my post but not exactly what I had in mind. I mean obviously, if I’m paralyzed I can’t go hit on a chick lol.

Edit 4: to all the points about losing weight and getting a haircut making you attractive if you’re ugly. Tell that to this guy. [ugly guy](https://imgur.com/a/J55AyjS)

Edit 5: studies on attractiveness for y’all to look through lol [studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C19&q=benefits+of+being+attractive&btnG=)

Edit 6: everyone in this thread needs to watch this video before commenting. [my experience being ugly](https://youtu.be/1n5nOEJtrYA)

Edit 7: A pattern I’ve noticed in the comments is that all the people that have been both ugly and attractive are agreeing with me unanimously. Just food for thought.

Edit 8: I’m grouping in any diseases or illnesses that impact attractiveness. Any diseases used as examples can’t make you less physically attractive to the opposite sex for me to consider it. Crohn's is mostly invisible to others except when you’re blowing out a toilet lol. Blindness is a trait that makes you less physically attractive in the eyes of others even though it doesn't change your facial structure.

Edit 9: I've made a discovery that this topic is weirdly taboo. A lot of people are agreeing with me, but the people that don't almost seem in denial more than disagree and are uncomfortable with the thread.

Edit 10: To the tons of people in the comments that my post resonates with, I feel for you and the other commenters should let you know you’re FAR from alone in this. Hopefully one day we’ll have the technology to just grind our faces off and print a new one that people find appealing lol. For now, we do everything else the best we can! Keep on keeping on!

Edit 11: I have made a subreddit r/CuringUgly . I’m not sure what the subreddit will contain yet, but all the content will be centered around current evidence based treatments for those that are facially disadvantaged or current treatments that are in the pipeline of development. Feel free to join and spread the sub to other users. Thanks for your time.I'm a woman. Here's my reasoning.

I worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. Banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. The women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. Things in the toilet I can't even begin to describe. Toilet paper everywhere. Poop on the walls and the seats. Spit and make up on the mirrors. And blood on everything. All the time.

In ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing I saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. I worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. And had money, and the women DESTROYED their bathrooms. Sometimes I wasn't even sure the things I saw, came out of humans.

Secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms I've been in, were women's. In female friends homes I've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. Dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

I've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

Women are far nastier than men.I hate it when people compare being a spouse to someone deployed as making the same sacrifice as those who are actually putting their life at risk. 
Sure, its a sacrifice, but you’re not putting your life on the line. You are safe. You have friends and family (most of the time). Stop trying to seem like your doing the same for your country as your partner. 
ALSO quit trying to get free stuff because of your partners service.This came up while discussing movies with my sister. I asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. She said something like “I’m not sure if they got the roles cuz they’re good AND female or just because of the latter” and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn’t it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I’m digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn’t. 

Now I’m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

EDIT: To answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, I’m not making this up. Women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. Although this was challenged by Judit and now by Hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn’t getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.The ads for those horrible looking Chinese zombie/survival games where the footage isnt anything like the gameplay need to be called out. They're low-quality quickly pieced together scams to farm cash off people with addictions to those types of games with gems, gold bars, etc to gain an advantage. 

And it'd work the other way around too... Good products get good praise. 

The fact ads look like Reddit posts, but can't be interacted with is stupid. If you're gonna make it look like a post to lure people, at least give it the functionality of a post.I have a friend who is baffled why men don't enjoy movies or books in the "romance" genre. She says it's because men are often too insecure in themselves to feel like they can enjoy that sort of thing. 



In my opinion, it's a lot more simple and upsetting. Where women look at romance novels and see love and caring, men look at them and see *work*. 



To be fair, sometimes these movies and novels hide it pretty well. Maybe it starts with a happenstance encounter, a "meet cute." The relationship will progress - sometimes it will look like it's by accident. Loving glances are exchanged. Meaningful gestures of affection are performed. Eventually things reach a head and the characters begin ravishing each other, unable to keep their affection hidden any longer. 



What most women will see is a guy who is empathetic and open and aboundingly loving. 



What most men will see is a horrifying amount of work and luck. These novels and movies often treat the man as an almost omniscient entity. He does everything *perfectly* and knows *exactly* how to make someone swoon. He is expected to have boundless confidence (work), to continually push the relationship forward (work), to make gestures of affection (work), and to not want or need any affection in return (work). 


Basically, romance is *work* and a lot of people have been sold the idea that it's simply a natural thing you do if you love your partner. It's only partially true - you do it because you love your partner, but it's work nonetheless.



But there's absolutely a reason I don't like romance movies - it's not because they are feelsy or goofy or anything. It's because when I look at them I know I'm expected to feel loved by making someone else feel loved, and that doesn't really feel like romance to me.


Edit: this is about UNEQUAL work. So many times the guy goes incredibly far out of his way to "woo" the girl, but the guy never is "wooed" back. It's often treated like the woman continuing to say yes and allowing herself to be wooed is an equal amount of reciprocation, and I feel as if it's not. Good relationships are about mutual affection and ideally it SHOULDN'T feel like work. But it's easy for affection to turn into work if it's unfairly distributed or never reciprocated - because romantic gestures require *effort* even if they aren't "work". 


Edit 2: to all the comments that suggest these movies show men "actually putting in the effort most women do in their relationships", I would advise you to take a load off in your next relationship and hold yourself to the standards these movies portray men.


Last edit: God, the amount of people in the comments that are losing their minds at a man daring to desire to be romanced is truly saddening.She is alright, I do like some of her songs, however, she is worshipped and called a queen? I wouldn't go that far, but whenever I disagree with someone they are like "how dare you". I find her kind of annoying.Lemme set the scene. You're walking in the park with your SO, and a feathery football shaped ball of anger comes running up and squawking at you, when all you did was mind your own damn business. This little bastard is going out of his way to fuck with you, and that's not what mother nature intended. So you decide to remind this fluffy little shit where he stands on the food chain by punting that bastard like it was 55 yards to the goalposts, and bam. No more goose problem.

But what do we get instead? "Oh nooooo dont hit that goose it's just angryyyyyy" BITCH THAT MOTHERFUCKER FORGOT THAT WE USED TO COOK AND EAT HIM AMD HIS FAMILY. But at some point, we decided that they were gods gift to earth and whenever we saw them in a park or on the side of the road, you should just run away and leave it alone. Fuck. That. I wanna power bomb that bastard so hard that he'll feel like he got T-Boned by an aircraft carrier. If anything, I'm helping the rest of these shitbrained bendy straw neck ass birds to fear humans so they wont catch any more hands


TL;DR: Fuck geese, it should be socially acceptable to remind it where it lies on the food chain

EDIT: If one more person comments a letterkenny response I'm gonna hold a fucking goose hostage

#2: I'm not an animal abuser this was a shitpost and now too many people think I'm 100% serious

Just do what you need to get them away from youAttended a game and a fly puck went into my section. I caught that barehand 20 rows up. I'm 30 years old and this is a first time high for me. An unintentional treasure. A kid came up to me, maybe 10-12yr old, in the same row and asked me for the puck and the dad was blatantly watching. I said "No, I earned this little man. Keep trying." I literally got booed by my section. 

Never had this moment as a kid, finally as an adult. And I genuinely felt like a kid again, at least before the unwarranted booing. Why do I need to give up what I got fairly?

Please understand, if an athlete is intending to throw a puck or ball to a kid I would never intercept it knowing my size and ability. That's petty. But if a puck or ball was unintentionally lodged into the stands and someone was able to get it despite age that's a lifetime treasure and experience. It's truly luck really seeing the odds.If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Hollywood seems to be obsessed with making movies that were successful. I believe it's in an attempt to exploit nostalgia and make a half assed remake for a quick cash grab. It may work in some cases but nostalgia does not substitute good writing and acting.

A failed remake of an unsuccessful movie will most probably go unnoticed but a failed remake of a age old classic is going to be more disappointing to the fans and everyone is probably going to end up hating everyone involved with the movie (I'm looking at you Ghostbusters 2016).I'll preface this by just saying I work for a hospital so I'll keep it simple by giving an example; 

Guy smokes a pack a day religiously. Guy gets lung cancer. Guy has chemo and ends up having a lung removed. Guy **continues** to smoke a pack a day with no intention of stopping. I've also seen this in people who have chronic breathing issues because they smoked for many years. They bitch and moan that they can't breath, go to the hospital and use up oxygen tanks and everything else all while refusing to stop doing the thing that is killing them. If you don't wanna change to help your body heal then you shouldn't be allowed any treatment to keep your decrepit body going. This is just one of the simpler examples but that's it in a nutshell.Many at times when you text or ask someone how their day was, they'll just reply with "it was good/great". if i ask how your day was, give me a full fucking essay.I don’t know what it is but whenever I click on a post and go down to the comments it looks like a single person singlehandedly typed the comments. The comments vary from movie references to bad puns but they still all sound like one person typed them out.For example, when we’re talking about coronavirus, and the implications of the shutdowns and evictions, no news channel seems to really break it down and tell you what’s happening and what’s going to happen and the consequences of everything. 

What do we get?  Stories about local child Billy handing out masks or something not newsworthy.  

I recently discovered Hasan Minhaj on Netflix.  He has pretty decent analysis, but regular news?  Nope.Original post:
The article that prompted this post was about Mads Mikkelsen replacing Johnny Depp as Grindelwaldt in Fantastic Beasts 3. He says it's going to be tricky to balance tying the old role into the new while also making the character his own. To stay in the Harry Potter universe, this was exactly the issue with Michael Gambon's version of Dumbledore, he didn't read the books, he didn't base his version off of Richard Harris's performance, he made the character "his own" and it kinda ruined it. You're an actor, you're supposed to portray the character as it's meant to be portrayed based off of either an author or script writer's description, stop inflicting your own interpretation or acting style into the character.

[Article I was referring to](https://amp.cinemablend.com/news/2559629/fantastic-beasts-mads-mikkelsen-breaks-silence-on-replacing-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald)


Edit: Ok, let me clarify a little bit. I'm mostly talking about characters that have already been established. Particularly if you're replacing someone in a direct sequel, which is the case here (and with Dumbledore in Harry Potter as well). But also if your character is in a book for instance, most of the time the character's persona and mannerisms are described in detail, to me you should try to get it as close as possible to that description and not freely interpreting the character and put your own flair to it. That's my personal opinion on that. It's also not that serious, I read the article, that statement annoyed me in the context of this movie specifically so I made the post. Also, Richard Harris is the superior Dumbledore, fight me!


Edit 2: My first 1k+ post and it's because people don't agree with me, great, lol. I think the best counter argument I've seen is that we don't want Mads to play Johnny Depp playing Grindelwaldt, which could be a very easy thing to happen if he doesn't make the character his own, and would be quite cringy probably. So I get that for sure.

Anyway, my phone has never had this many notifications on it ever, and I just got to work so I can't chat with you guys anymore. Have fun!

Edit 3: RIP Phone. I enjoy the discussions people are having, some have changed my opinion slightly honestly. I still am pretty unpopular though.The CCP is a totalitarian government hellbent on control through murder, rape, extortion and kidnapping. They are the modern day equivalent of the Nazi party in Germany. 

Anyone who supports such a horrific regime should be ostracized from society and treated the same way we treat Neo-Nazis. 

Even if the person is Chinese and claims they're only supporting their country. You wouldn't give a Neo-Nazi a break just because they're German, right?

To hell with the CCP! To hell with its supporters, regardless of which country they're from!

Edit: an off-duty Pro-CCP Hong Kong police officer just shot a 14 year old boy in the leg with a live round. Just another example of CCP unaccountability and brutality.

Edit: Please stop posting saying "Err China isn't communist, it has billionaires, etc. Etc.". I know. And if you notice I didnt say anything about let's hate Communists right now. I said lets hate the CCP, which regardless of where they are on a left/right wing political/economics spectrum is what they call themselves.Okay, let me try this again. The last time I tried posting this, it posted 14 times.

The letter "q" could be replaced by the letter "k" and it would have no effect. "Q" is always followed by the letter "u" to make the "kw" sound. So why include it at all?

Queen becomes Kween

Question becomes Kwestion

Equation becomes Ekwation

..And so on. If the letter "Q" didn't exist, there would be 25 letters in the alphabet, which is a much more standard number (multiple of 5, easier to remember, etc).

Do you agree with this rekwest?The justification for Sex Education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge. The same holds true for firearms. Far too many people are shot with "unloaded" guns. Ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are, what they can do, and how to safely handle them.

EDIT:

1. Even if you believe that guns should be banned, the legal process for accomplishing this in the US would take decades. It's extremely difficult to alter our constitution, there's considerable opposition to changing it, and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it. Consequently, even if you want to ban all guns, it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution.
2. Teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school. Someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes, especially with movies, computer games, and Google as a guide. Firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible. Using them destructively is extremely easy. Consequently, handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training.
3. You don't need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you don't need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom.
4. For those who aren't from the US: To understand why the US is "obsessed" with guns, you have to understand US history. The US was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical. This is as true today as it was the day it was written. A reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government, should it become tyrannical. It's a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us.
5. Requiring gun safety training, background checks, and licenses at the point of sale simply doesn't work. There are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one. For example, I very vividly remember climbing into my parent's attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroom(which I'm certain they  didn't think I could do) and showing my friends, without the knowledge of their parents, one of my dad's rifles for no other reason than because I thought it was really cool. No one died but someone easily could have. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. There is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening.
6. Teaching kids to shoot guns isn't the point. The point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one.
7. Not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life. However, the problem is that we don't know which kids will encounter guns and which won't. Therefore, the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them.Right, so you got to the beach, where it's really hot and there's sand everywhere. Then you need to get semi naked in public, then you need to walk to the water on sand that's hotter than the depths of hell. You get in the water, and your feet are instantly stabbed by millions of sharp shells. What's that? You need to piss? Do it in the water like a fucking toddler. Ya need to shit? Well fuck right off and hold it in for several hours. But then, something brushes up against your leg: slimy, squishy vegetation, and it feels fucking disgusting. Then, after you get out of the water, you find that all your shit has been blown about by the wind or stolen by beach bums. Even if you still have all your stuff, you must make a choice: go home full of sand, or change in an out-house, that smells like someone died. Oh hahaha BTW your car is full of sand now.
 * Edit: apparently when I was a baby my parents took me to the beach, as soon as I touched sand I started to cry. I never really liked the beach.I criticize the United States frequently because I care about it. I want my country to be a true world leader in freedom. It’s not that currently, but it can be. Yet, whenever I bring this up I am told I’m unpatriotic. It’s not that I hate the country, it’s that I want better for it. I think that seeing faults in your country and not acknowledging them is more harmful than wanting flaws to be smoothed out.I would never actually eat one, because there’s only like six of the fuckin’ things left, but god damn if they don’t look tasty. 

They just sit there and eat bamboo all day, so they’re essentially grass-fed with very little exercise. It’s fucking bear veal and we all know it. 

Imagine just vast herds of these lazy, adorable, and delicious motherfuckers out in the countryside, just waiting to be made into a mouth-watering meal just for you. Panda tacos? Panda slices on your fucking Hand-Made Pan from Domino’s? Panda jerky? The sky is the limit. 

Again, I don’t want to eat one of our few remaining Pandas, I wanna make a fucking ton of them and just eat some. 

I look forward to my death threats, thank you for your time.It may just be my country, but I've been seeing so many stickers with the logo of a football team and the caption 'True Love'. I get that football can be a passion and it connects people, but how is it true love? How is watching people run after a ball more valid than a 14-year-old watching shows with their favourite actor and calling it true love? Football players don't know you exist. You're an insignificant part of their audience. It's not love and It's pointless to be so passionate about a game that's always the same.And im not talking about a flat stomach im talking abs of steel. Abs that are incredibly defined not just like a skinny person. And along with it girls on the muscular side is where its at. Ive recently found out that none of my friends share this opinion with me. And I know that it is much harder for women to obtain the ripped ab look but man when they do.It’s a ignorant mentality to have! Just because you’re mad and want to hurt your children’s father; you deny them a relationship with their father. It’s selfish! Later on in life when they’re having issues, you lie to them and tell them their father walked out on them. Instead of owning up to your decisions. NO! He walked out on you. This narcissistic selfish mentality is hurting generations to come.

Update:
But of course this is an unpopular opinion!
Pop culture is diligently working to obsolete the role of a father figure in the household.

Why do you think there are terms such as “toxic masculinity “, but no one ever talks about “toxic femininity”?There is no excuse in 2019 to not have one for males to change there child in the bathroom and having them either go into a seperate room or have to wait for the women's to possibly clear. I've even had to leave a building and go to my car and open the trunk to change my son.My entire feed the entire day has either been about how people got coins or didn't get coins. It's stupid, and it's all over subreddits that aren't relevant. I hope this doesn't carry on for too long.

I feel that either they should give EVERYONE who's been around for a while (maybe a year?) the coins and that's it, or not at all. It's just this new kind of reverse begging for gold, where everyone is trying to get others to upvote them under the guise of **FREE REDDIT GOLD*****!!!*** despite the chances being seemingly lower than getting struck by lightning.Whenever my phone is below 20% I get a small tingly feeling. When it's 10% it gets intense, and at 5% and below I need to charge it. I can't explain why. 

I hate having low battery on my laptop though, it doesn't make sense.

Merry Christmas

Edit:
Have inbox notifications on, thanks for making my battery drain faster! You're all great. 

https://imgur.com/a/aWoziRT6ix9ine is absolutely disgusting in the things he was convicted of and got away with, and I just don't think he deserves an ounce of popularity now that he's gotten away from all that. He confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13-year-old girl and yet... he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far?

A lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers, who I believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down, yet here we are. This guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if you're someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media.

I genuinely don't understand it, and I'm disgusted by it. I also just don't get how he has a likeable appearance either if we're going to the more shallow part of my opinion. He's fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasn't bathed in weeks. He is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldn't be, and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding.

I personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything he's gained in these past few months. I also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him. It's one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly & proudly working with the artist (looking at Nicki) makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the Gold! I never had it before and I really really appreciate it! Also I really have enjoyed reading everyones thoughts on him. Makes me feel like I'm less crazy and moreso it's just he has high numbers because people like the hype music more than they do him... but it still messes with me a bit that there's a little girl out there that has to see him all over the charts after what he did partook in doing to her. That's all I care about, not the people he snitched out (they probably had it coming if they had shit that needed to be snitched about to begin with). It just saddens me to think about her. 

I feel the same way for all other screwed up celebrities who's crimes went under the radar and they were never properly held accountable and still were able to thrive, I just have never seen a guy straight up *make* CP and then get a slap on the wrist and become more famous than he was before, it's bizzare.

I'll stop yapping, thanks again for the gold kind stranger, and thank you guys for giving me your opinions and what you think. It's been interesting to read.As the title says, I don't see any wrong in pirating content that isn't available to buy in your country. I think you are rather doing the content creator team a favor by doing so as you are in a way increasing the popularity of the show and the people who have access to the content and can afford to buy the dvd might be more inclined to buy something that is more popular. So you are kind of doing them a favor by pirating their content.

Moreover I think people should make it a habit to at least rate the movie or series that they watch. That way you'll be contributing to the popularity of the show.

So yeah that's my two cent. I can't write like most of the other people here as english is my second language. Anyway if it makes sense then that's pretty cool. If it doesn't then please don't downvote as downvoting would cause it to die in new without any interaction and I won't get to hear why my view isn't correct.

Edit:

I very well understand that piracy is not acceptable, but the current model of content delivery is broken. At the moment I have no qualms whatsoever ripping off the odd movie and TV show that isn't available to buy in my country and I see no reason to not experience something for a reason like not being available. There's so much infighting and lack of collaboration from TV and movie studios that no one service is good enough.

I go to the cinema plenty, and I buy movie dvds when I have the chance, so i pay my dues. But this experience is getting less and less pleasurable as it is struggling to compete with my 4k TV connected to my PC at home where I can easily download any movie or series and stream/play it easily. But I always make it an attempt to look for a possibility to watch it in a way that it contributes to the content creator. If it's not available then of course piracy is going to be my choice.

If you look at it then piracy is entirely a distribution problem. There will always be some people who pirate no matter what but majority of people might pirate for only easy access and not only for the sake of pirating. Let's take Netflix(subscribed to it) for example , it allows us to browse large numbers of movies , watching previews of them and then watch it on the spot. Most methods of piracy require you to download the complete movie first and then watch it. This is exactly why streaming platform like Netflix is so popular. Now if only if these studios would realize that the only thing Netflix needs is selection. If pretty much every movie and show go to netflix then piracy would take a huge hit.

Now about buying the DVDs. Here in India we don't have stores where you can just go and buy or rent the dvd. And most of the tv/series and movies are not even available to buy on amazon/prime video , even google play. Anime industry is another entire problem. The ease of access is absolutely non existent.According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying "colleges just want to make you well rounded" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

It honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.Not all women are toxic just like not all men are, but it seems like we turn a blind eye when women start behaving in toxic ways. Whether it’s uncontrollable bitching habits, or when they start judging women and men based on what they’re wearing and their aesthetics. Some women tend to be a lot more superficial when it comes to what they look for in appearances eg. Height, weight etc. It also seems to be accepted by society a lot more than when men start demanding women to look and act a certain way.  Another irritating thing, is that women tend to stick to the same topics, it’s like they’re so brainwashed with their priorities, the narrative that your worth is based on your appearance seems to be growing with the age of Instagram, which tends to be dominated by half naked women constantly seeking validation by how many likes they get. 

Disclaimer: I’m a woman who has a lot of girlfriends, maybe I just have shitty friends but it seems to be a growing trend on who can be more superficial and shallow these days.If you dye your hair bright colors, wear abnormal peices of clothing, act out in socially unacceptable ways, etc, you shouldn’t complain about having social anxiety. We all know the type I’m talking about, those kids in highschool who like wear tails or cat ears and inappropriate anime backpacks and say cringey internet things in real life. These same people are always the ones complaining about having social anxiety. Like, do you really expect to have short, bright purple hair and not get glanced at? I’m all for people doing this confidently, you do you bro. But if you have social anxiety maybe, I don’t know, don’t make yourself stand out in every way possible?Babies under the age of 1 maybe even 2 should be outright banned from movie theaters I mean why would you even take them in the first place. I've just been to see a pg13 film and a group walked in with 5 babies all ages between around 3 months too maybe a year. there was an audible grown from the rest of the crowd pretty much as soon as they walked in through the door. Why do the staff even let them take them in?

Edit: to all the people saying this is a popular opinion it appears you may be right judging by how much this blew up but there are still so many people who still bring babies to the cinema

Edit 2: alot of people talking about children at cinemas this I personally dont have a problem with. even 3 and 4 year olds if they can comprehend what's going on then fine. If they cause a disturbance it's up to the parents to sort them out or the stewards to throw them out. But when it's a literal baby there is no reason for them to be at any film in a cinema they have no comprehension of what's going on it's not their fault its loud and can cause damage to there ears. They almost guaranteed to cause a disturbance and all these people saying well I agree but have taken my baby to it because they are so well behaved. Your still damaging a babys hearing just so you can go and see a fucking film.In my anecdotal observation, many people who quickly escalate their outrage have done so to manipulate the core of discussion from one that revolves around facts and data to one that focuses solely on feelings and perceived virtue through victimhood. They perceive their outrage to be virtuous, and that the more outraged they are about said topic, the more virtue they hold over you. The argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent.

Masking disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible. Two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything - even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous, (Earth being flat, etc). To be open minded you must try to understand _why_ they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them, or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs. Maybe I’m too much of an optimist.

EDIT: To clarify, this is obviously a generalisation and doesn’t apply to all cases. It also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn’t is right. I could have the patience of a saint and still be wrong (and I often am). The key is that ones emotional state does not provide moral status, and should not be the _habitual_ basis through which you win arguments. There is nothing wrong with being an emotional person at heart for other reasonsSetting up a time and day to play video games online with friends should be considered plans. I’m tired of telling people that I have plans this weekend, them asking what they are, and then hearing how I’m wasting time playing video games. How is this any different than getting some buddies together to go to the mall? Or watching a movie?There are those people who use it and those who don't, yet people are waking up to the emotional scam it is.

The people who post the most are the emptiest cans, or have some commercial interest, and your family and friends are fake and boring af.

To combat this Facebook gives you more fake stuff to make you feel better.That Among Us game has really made everyone feel cool saying "Sus" all the time. "*Thats so sus bro*". Im not exactly sure why but it sounds extremely dumb and bugs the absolute crap out of me. That is all.I have my own apartment, I work 46hrs a week, I pay all my bills and I love it. People constantly saying stuff like "adulting sucks" and "I wish I could be a kid again without any responsibility". I don't. I love coming home and just looking and the few things I own and being proud that I own those things. I don't mind the responsibilities, I always take on more when I have the chance. Maybe it comes from growing up in homeless shelters and hotel rooms. Knowing I'm making the right choices to not end up there and being grateful I have what I have. I just love being an adult and paying my bills and having things.I really *hate* when people do this. Recently, I watched a documentary and one of the guys in it was named "Tristan" but he pronounced it "Tri-*stAHn."* Like, why make your kid go through that?

Sure, we all know some parents torture their kids and give them names like Thaddeus or Light Bulb or other weird shit, but I think it's infinitely worse to give your kid a common name but then try to make the pronunciation unique. Like "Hi, this is my daughter Jessica, but it's pronounced "Jeh-ZEE-kah. And this is my son Steve, but it's pronounced "*Steh*\-vay"

Why do people do this? I'd much rather have a name like "Wizard III" than be named James (pronounced "Hah-mez") or some shit and have to live my life constantly correcting people.

EDIT: I realize that my examples weren't the best, as some names obviously have different pronunciations in other languages. Like "Benjamin" in English versus "Benjamin" (pronounced like Ben-hah-meen" in Spanish. I'm talking about the names where it's clear that the parents gave their kid a weird pronunciation for the hell of it lol. Fuck Influencers. **Social Media Influencers**

We don't need the youth being influenced by these **dumb**, **narcissistic** **millennials/GenZ**, getting rich and famous, for being stupid, doing bullshit pranks, playing video games all day, and showing their ass & tits for views.

We need to stop awarding these influencers, or giving them a pass. It's tiny things that can create big impacts.

Young people are dedicating a lot of time watching these types of people. They need to held in check. Held accountable.

**Edit:** I know there are Influencers that are actually doing good things out there. I wish they get more attention.

We need Scientists, Engineers, Data Scientists, as the real influencers. The ones where young people can look up to and listen to.

What happened to the Science Kids shows we used to grow up on?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** The title is a bit too extreme yes. I'm not against freedom or anything like that, I'm saying that I wish the standards of what an influencer is, should be raised.

Also, I don't think Entertainment is bad. I don't think video games are bad. I don't think the creative fields and pursuits are bad in any way. Don't misunderstand the point.

I'm talking about Shitty Influencers, specifically.

**Edit: What's My Solution?**

1. **Change Public Opinion**
2. **Support Better Influencers**1. There isn't any shame in being old

2. You can't say "***I have worked here for 1/3 of my life***" and then think that it's weird that someone asks how old you are

3. If you respond with "you shouldn't ask that" you just stop the conversation (or attempt at such) to a grinding halt and everything becomes awkwardIt's pointless. They're never going to change their no mind no matter how much logic and evidence you use to prove your point. And when you're like "I don't want to argue anymore, go argue with yourself", they think they won and go on an whole rant about facts, how mentally superior they are, and how you weren't ready for an intellectual debate. That's another thing. They think they win everytime.

Especially in YouTube comment sections, they think they're so brilliant and whimsical.  Which is hilarious, since when you take the time to digest what they're saying and it's all whismically stupid. 

And these people are ACTIVELY looking for arguments. As if they're bitter that nobody gives a shit about their opinion in real life.Our school had a mandatory class on personal finance. Nobody cared. Not a single kid remembers a thing from that class, and I can almost guarantee that it would be the same way for most other schools. People just wouldn’t take it seriously.

Let’s edit this a bit because people have made some fairly good points. I would say the most of the time, the kid using this argument is the kid who wouldn’t pay attention. I hear it a lot from people who are bombing algebra and are just pissed because they don’t think it’s useful (it might not be but that’s not the point). Usually, what they’re saying is “I hate algebra” and trying to sound smart about it.Where i come from in the Middle East, many guys act innocent and clean, but when you become friends with them, they start bragging about their past (which is most certainly lies); that they slept with at least 3 girls (they met in university or the street) for fun; or that they used to get wasted on alcohol or drugs; and some of them starts talking about their past fights like they were a Roman Gladiator knocking out 4 people in one punch in one fight. They brag to both guys and girls (to girls especially about sleeping with other girls and beating up guys when they become comfortable and barriers are slowly going away)

***EDITS:***

1. ***NO, I'M NOT A TEEN, I'M 27, AND MOST OF THESE BRAGS COMES FROM GUYS 2-4 YRS YOUNGER THAN ME***
2. ***I GET IT, IT'S NOT UNPOPULAR, HONESTLY, I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THIS AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY ON IT, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT***Not swearing doesn't make you a gentlemen and swearing doesn't make you an uneducated person. It depends on the settings in which you are swearing. I just hate people noticing someone swearing and be like "oh that guy is so uneducated how could he swear". Just mind your own fucking business, it is totally acceptable to swear in a normal conversation or when you are pissed or emotional, only swearing at the wrong time or in the wrong place makes you impolite or look uneducated, eg in a conference, in the general public (loudly), in front of your clients or when talking to a complete stranger. And also criticizing someone for cursing in a completely acceptable and understandable situation doesn't make you nobler.Imagine rivalry, judgement and hate on bases of things like what operating system you prefer, what social media site is your favorite, color of your eyes.. Discrimination based of color of eyes/hair might seem laughable or by unintelligent species but keenly look at racism and you will feel the same.An old dog lives to be 15. They are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. We truly are not good enough for dogs. On the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. They don't understand medicine. They don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

All they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. They are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. The next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. And you, their human, are doing it for what? To squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

They don't understand and they can't consent. Let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. You're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

EDIT TIME!! Everything above this is the same as when I originally posted it. Below is my addendum. 

So, it has come to my attention that I was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. Thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. [For more information on pets and chemo I went to this site, seems reliable](https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

In keeping with the spirit of this sub I'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, "If your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person."

I know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. The reason I think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, ESPECIALLY in instances when the animal is suffering.

In closing, I get it. Putting your pet down is a VERY personal decision, but I still get to think you're a bad person if I think your reasons are shitty.I'm not saying superhero films shouldn't be shown. Films like that should always be shown if people enjoy them. But I miss the cinematic experience where you would think about the film's for days after. Films would teach you about cultural and historical events, showcase real emotions and struggles that real people went through. They were engaging and convincing. Now, when I go to the cinema there will typically only be superhero films, and about 10 animated kids films. Good films are still released, but are overshadowed by flying ant-men.


Edit: Thanks for the awards. Also, you all need to chill. I'm not trying to gatekeep, sorry if I'm giving off that vibe. Wasn't expecting it to get this popular. Glad it started a discussion :)It’s easy to hate on downvoted comments, but that wouldn’t even be possible if they had been deleted. And by leaving such comments up, it provides much needed context to the thread.I’m tired of this recent trend of people who brag about their kinks and sexuality. I’m all for sexual health, awareness, and positivity... but there’s a fine line between spreading acceptance and just using sex as a shock factor for attention.

Not saying you should hide your sexuality... you should be free to tell people how you identify. But don’t build your entire worth, personality, and existence around sexual preferences.

We all have certain things that we prefer in the bedroom. You’re not a prude if you don’t publicly broadcast your sexuality or kinks... it just means that you value and respect your sexual identity enough to keep it private.

IMO - It’s really no one else’s business at the end of the day except for me and my partner.



EDIT: I’m not sure why people in the comments are so adamant about forcing the conversation towards the LGBTQ or gay community.... Nowhere in my post did I directly target those communities. I used the term “sexuality” because it’s a blanket term that covers all sexual orientations. Straight, bi, gay, or trans - anyone from any sexual orientation can be guilty of attention whoring.All in the title really. I just happened to experience this a lot in school but I always fought back and took the punishment while my mother ripped the schools head off for punishing me for actually defending myself from little shits.This isn’t really an opinion but everyone seems to think so. I’m under the impression that people don’t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. 

Genetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There’s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn’t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn’t make it less healthy. 

Another way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it’s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. 

Another big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says “non GMO” it never would’ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn’t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said “non GMO” and I was like ???? This is totally just a marketing scheme. 

Hopefully this makes sense and doesn’t get removed!I don’t really care too much about any other piercings either but there’s just something about generic piercings that are nasty as fuck, make her nipples taste like spare change and that is a major turn off. Whenever a girl tells me her nipples are pierced when we’re flirting and she’s being all cute and cheeky about it I lowkey feel bad, because it’s such an unattractive thing. Idk why if it’s just cause odds are I think she’s been around or just sort of trashy. And before the bullshit “oH GiRls cAnt SleEp arOunD hUh?!”
Even if a guy has nipple piercings or sleeps around it’s gross.
Unpopular opinion, seems to be a major trend

Edit: thank you everyone for the awards!  🙏I don't care for breakfast foods. I want to be able to go somewhere in the morning and get lunch foods.

If I wake up and feel like eating a cheeseburger, what crime of the universe am I violating by doing so?There have been several times recently where I take my child into a public restroom for a diaper change, only to find out the men’s room has no changing station. At that point, I either have to awkwardly try to find a large enough flat spot to do it on the counter, or ask my wife to change him in the women’s room which does have a changing table.

This is not the flipping 1950’s where women solely take care of the children. Parents nowadays tend to share responsibilities, and there are also single fathers or fathers who just don’t happen to have the mother with them on the trip to the store. Put a damn changing table in the men’s restroom!

Edit: Since many have commented this is not unpopular, I will modify it to this. If the men’s room doesn’t have a changing table but the women’s does, it is completely acceptable for a dad to use the women’s room for changing a diaper.The entire basis of taking a gun owner's gun/license from them is absolutely asinine in its logic.  Lawmakers think that if you smoke pot you will be more likely to shoot someone with a firearm if you own it, yet they have no problem with Cooter owning 20 shotguns and rifles and drinking a 12 pack of beer every day after work because we all know that no one ever got angry while they were drunk at home or in public and got into a fight/went into a rage.  Quit the fucking double standard, if you are going to punish legal gun owners over smoking a plant then the same punishment should go for legal gun owners who keep Budweiser in business.The major news subreddits are all heavily biased. 

People are terrible at taking jokes. 

There are extremists on both the left and right that become radicalized because they chase positive karma on the subreddits they agree with.

Edit: Woah, silver? Gold? I turned off notifications during work and twelve hours later this is front page? Weird. Thanks for the response!For some context I live in Germany and sparkling water is so normal here that it's the classic flavour of water over natural. 

But, seriously though. How do people drink it so easily? It just tastes like the static your TV gives out when you're tuning channels or when you've lost feeling in your legs after sitting on a crappy chair for too long. 

Doesn't need to exist. There are plenty of other carbonated drinks that have taste that's worth existing. Water should be chuggable and fresh, not bland and fizzy.Whether in hotels or at homes, beds that are against a wall are much better to sleep in than those in the middle of the room, many people see it differently but i feel a big difference between these two different alternatives and the former is just better and the overally more comfortable!


Edit: yes I’m currently single as many guessed lol but my point still stands, I’ve slept with partners in both bed options and still think that the wall-bed is better!It’s also pretty ridiculous. Iv worked at a ton of restaurants over the last few years and I always ask what the pay is during the interview. I have had two or three companies straight up tell me that they aren’t going to hire me as they want someone who isn’t focused on making money. Umm excuse me?!?!? I don’t come to work to hang out. I come to work to make money. If you can’t accommodate that than I don’t need to be working for you.Games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, the Uncharted Franchise, The Last of Us (can include 2 if you want), the GTA franchise and many others support my point. They offer hundreds of hours of playability only from the single player modes thanks to rich open world's, rich narrative and great replay value. I have had Red Dead Redemption since launch day and still play it frequently to this day.

Now in some cases online multiplayer is fine but not in recent times. Take GTA online for example. In 2013 it was good but with the new updates and expansions it's not short of being unplayable with players flying across the maps and shooting you every time you spawn. Another issue is modders and tryhards who do their UTMOST best to ruin your and your friends game. I cannot walk in warzone without being sniped from the other side of the map or encountering campers. Single player is also more stable thanks to not requiring an internet connection and thus allows even people in Somalia to play without interruption. Also people are more peaceful as nobody in single player shouts or sings into a mic whilst you're playing. Believe me, we could all use some peace.

Lastly I would like to say this does not apply to all online games, but most. I'm not sure if this has been done before so if it has pls say and I'll delete.

Edit: some people are talking about co-op modes with friends. Co-op is great and I play it myself but playing with randoms is not so great most of the time as mentioned above. Co-op satisfies those who want story as well as those who want a social aspect in their games without the cons that associate with playing with randoms.Now I'm not talking about the things they cannot control. Such as Race, Gender, Nationality.

If I see some guy in a puffy jacket with tight jeans and ankles showing, eating sunflower seeds with music blasting from his '94 BMW. I believe it's safe to say he might be a massive douchebag.

Or when I see some perm undercut person with lots of piercings, dressing all in black, totally that kind of person telling you "they don't care what society thinks" while getting mad at the fact that society thinks a certain way about them.

Or to an extent fat people, no I don't believe the majority has a thyroid issue. There are too many making excuses when in reality they are lazy and eating a lot.

Or overly-makeup'd women. What do you have to hide? You slip while dancing in the club and print your whole face on my shirt.

Now there are exceptions, but that's what they are, exceptions, quite fewer.

In general I believe the way you present yourself tells a lot about your personality.

Edit: Holy shit some people really twist it to the extreme. The comments are a blast to read.

Edit 2: Yeah I guess using the word judgement really made a lot of people miss the point. I am not referring to judgement as in "these people suck and they shouldn't exist" I am talking about judge of character, people acting in a certain way tend to have patterns in the way they present themselves. That extends to posture, body language, tone in speech, etc.Happy Birthday is an annoying enough song already but when you have some over enthusiastic dork in the corner trying to get everyone even more hyped by saying "CHA CHA CHA" after every stanza, it makes it that much worse. No one wants to hear that, no one is joining in with you, so kindly, stop.I'm sick of people saying downvoting is only supposed to be for when you think a comment adds nothing to a discussion and not for when you disagree with someone.

Fuck that. Debates on Reddit are not high school civics. They're fucking Thunderdome.

I disagree with you, I’m downvoting you. Your disagreeing comment is the midget on your shoulders that I plan on stabbing in the face until the big mutant carrying your argument falls down.

Edit: Thank you all who recognized the paradox of this heavily upvoted unpopular opinion. I am now more confused than ever. Well played.  I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about "the feeling of being one with nature". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting "cute" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.Buzz feed is still shitting out the laziest stupidest bull shit content I’ve ever seen and I feel like people don’t criticize them enough for it. Obviously they have gotten criticized in the past but people have sort of moved on. I fucking hate buzzfeed and I would like to see them and their fucking company go down the drain.Being reminded of a bad day isn’t PTSD. Enjoying cleanliness like a normal person isn’t OCD. Being sad because you have 2 test tomorrow isn’t depression. Too many people use mental illness as an excuse for their own shortcomings. It’s like people brag about having a mental illness. “well as someone with [insert random mental illness]”. A lot of people just do this for attention.OK, so I’m not sure if this belongs in r/trueoffmychest or if this is an unpopular opinion.  However, judging by the positive responses to celebrities on social mediaI, I think this is unpopular.  

I consider myself an empathetic and compassionate person, but I don’t think I’ve ever abhorred messages of hope coming from celebrities so much.  I feel like I’m being talked down to, almost like I’m a toddler and they’re adults saying “stay inside, we need each other, we’ll be ok”.   It is SO easy for them to say things like that while they’re still making money from royalties and endorsements.  I dont think people are really able to conceive just how bad things are going to be going forward. 

I have no problem with artists/performers playing their music for us, but for fucks sake just don’t tell us how to feel better.  Also, what’s really grinding my gears are all the people sharing celebrity messages/videos on social media. My sisters and my mom are constantly sending group texts with links to messages of hope from emotional celebrities.  Listen, I love Tom Hanks.  Castaway.... fucking Castaway!!! Love that movie.  But if someone sent me a video of Tom Hanks trying to lift our spirits with words of encouragement, I think I’d rather shart to have a problem I had to deal with immediately.  We need to focus on our communities we’re apart of in order to help each other out, I 1000% agree with that.  I do not need Gwenyth or J.Lo guiding me on how to be thankful for what I have.I always thought this was true since I saw the movie and was recently made aware this isn't what most people think.

She uses Forrest when it is advantageous for her but will dip out regularly when he needs her. Forrest tries to do good his whole life but constantly has Jenny show up randomly to rock the boat.

Then at the end of the movie she leaves a kid with him that clearly isn't his, and if it is his how awful is it to hide a kid from his father for that long. He probably would have taken in the child out of his love for Jenny if she would have just told him the truth too.


Edit:wow people didn't like this one. Or maybe they do. I don't know.

I don't hate Jenny, I think she is a well done character. I was just think think she is the villain of the movie, which isn't a bad thing. I definitely don't care if she is a girl, that was not the point of the post. 

I did say worst to stir the pot a bit. There are clearly much more evil villains, obviously..Like I get that some demonstrations are completely peaceful and have no intention of becoming violent and if you want to bring a small child there to just be with you or hold a sign that I guess there's no harm in that.

But honestly, everyone knew what's been happening the past few nights across the country was always gonna end up turning violent, and you're either stupid or lying to yourself if you thought it was gonna remain 100% peaceful. 

A child, especially one too young to really understand what's going on shouldn't be exposed to this stuff, and when there's glass and bricks flying, fires being lit, etc it's way too dangerous for them anyways.

When someone near you and your kid start acting up and the police start throwing teargas or pepper spraying people and your kid gets caught in the middle of it or your kid gets kit or hurt by some demonstrator throwing something or lighting off fireworks, it's not the cops fault and it's not the protesters fault. It's your fault for even having them there to begin with.If you just sit back and think about it, honey is actually mind boggling and really crazy.
First of all, it is an all natural sweetener made by bees.  No other food is like this, and the process of honey making honey is truly amazing.
Secondly, it has been linked to many health benefits especially when being used as a sugar substitute.
Also, honey has no expiration date and can be stored and used forever.It's fine if you don't know what you want out of life, or if what you want out of life is just to be happy in your own little corner of the world. It doesn't make you any less worthy if you aren't constantly trying to hit some goal.


Edit because my sleepy brain last night wasn't super clear on phrasing: What I'm trying to say here is that small goals are no less important than the big goals that society likes to focus on. I personally (pre-covid) found a costuming job that I love, and have no desire to rise in the ranks because I'd no longer be doing the parts of the work I love most. But I constantly had people saying things like "when you're a famous designer" to me - they don't understand that I tried design and hated it because the stress was way more than the reward. It was awful for my mental health. Just taking care of your mental health is a worthy goal, but people act like you have to constantly be striving for bigger things in order to have any worth in society.

Edit 2: I love that there are people telling me that I'll never get wealthy or famous or have success in life with this attitude. Good job failing at reading comprehension; not all of us care about "making it" the way society thinks we should. I'm perfectly happy just making my own little corner of the world a better place by trying to be a decent human being.Just like refusing to call an ambulance when someone is in need is a crime, refusing to give organs because your family members want your body to keep them should be a crime as well

There's people dying from lack of organs and saying "no I want my son to not donate" is walking in the hospital room with the dying guy and his family and saying "no I'd rather let you fucking die ape"

My sister's father died 'cause the parents of his only potential heart donor were religious and said "nope you can't go to heaven without all your organs so yea he can die I want to go to heaven duh", how much I hope their cause of death implies losing an organ and be conscious long enough to realize they're not going to heaven

(Not actually hoping people to die or to die painfully, just hope that when the day comes that'll be their way out)

Can't think of a single real reason one would rather have his perfectly functional organ buried, it's a waste that kills people and religion should stay the fuck out of thisAs if they set out to prove Gervais' point, actresses are apparently now patting themselves on the backs for wearing the same dress twice ...before taking their private jets off to Davos to lecture us on climate change.For example, we had an appointment this morning at 9:30am.  We arrive at 9:22am and the receptionist tells us we’re late and may not be seen.  Not understanding how we are late, I ask.  She explains that all patients are expected to arrive 15 minutes prior to their appointment even if they completed check-in online.  This concept of mandatory early arrival for every appointment has made appointment times pointless.

Edit: This got more attention than I thought.  My apologies for not directly responding to everyone.  Ironically, I’m being asked by some why I posted it here.  The reason that is ironic is because the people who are asking then go on to post an opposing view to the other people who asked why I posted it here.  So at the very least we must agree, there is no unanimous opinion about this issue.  

For the record, my appointment time was 9:30.  They wanted us there by 9:15.  We arrived at 9:22.  They called us back at 10:45.

In regard to changing providers; in rural Ohio, choices of doctors are slim.  This is especially true when you must see a specialist.  The options for that is a long drive to the city or to wait till a provider visits your area, usually once per month.  When it come to dental and mental health, the options are even worse.  This is why so many Appalachia people have poor dental health and become recluse or are called crazy.Thousands of people die from alcohol every year. It’s a highly addictive drug, not to mention a pretty shitty drug compared to others. It’s completely overrated and damaging to the individual and society. I have no idea why it’s so popular worldwide.I’m latino and the amount of “woke” “progressive” people who aren’t latino at all but feel that it’s perfectly fine to demand the use of “latinx” is astonishing. The Spanish language is not offensive it’s the damn language and saying it should be changed because you don’t like it is kinda racist. I don’t like to play the “racism” card but if you’re going to sit there and hold everyone to an impossible standards you can be damn sure I’m going to do the same to you. *You wanna play the “everything is offensive” game than let’s play.* My culture, my language are *NOT* offensive and pushing for it to be changed because you don’t like it *IS* racist as hell. Spanish isn’t like English and it’s obvious that the people pushing for “latinx” have no idea what their talking about. I have not seen one other latino push for this, we don’t like it (and no your 0.00000321% doesn’t count). Honestly I don’t even care about the word using a different word isn’t hard what I don’t like are the people behind the word. I’m not going to bend over backwards because some gringo thinks my culture is wrong or shameful

Edit: I could just take this post down but I feel I should explain. I was just mad with a very few people who were behind this when I made this and I really shouldn’t have blamed everyone I apologize. That being said if you don’t like latino that’s fine I really don’t care about the word itself. It was never about the word itself. I just got really defensive because of some gringos who were talking out their arse trying to call Spanish offensive
P.S. people I’m calling like 5 people gringos not everyone that’s white. Hell gringo isn’t even offensive but anyways unless you are one of the 5 people I’m talking about I’m not calling you a gringo

Edit 2: people this isn’t about the lgbtq+ community I’m fine with them. This is about people who don’t know anything about the language or culture feeling they can antagonize it for existing. Central and south America have lost so much of the cultures that were once there the culture that is here now is what we have left so I apologize if I get mad because someone wants to shit on it. Again THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY OR NON-BINARY PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.Cooking has to be one of the most important skills you can learn, especially if you have a family. Not only is it cheaper and healthier to make food from fresh ingredients, it's a basic necessity to know how to feed yourself! Lately I've met so many people who just have absolutely no idea how to cook anything, and are too afraid of a mishap in the kitchen, or too lazy to even try and learn. If you are a parent and you're like this, then you are doubly shit than the rest of them, because not only are you eating like garbage, you're feeding your children garbage too. Learn to cook, it isn't hard. You have the entire Internet at your disposalThe title pretty much sums it up.  Look, I get it.  You want to have fun with other couples, or bond over your parenting experiences.  That's fine.  It sucks to be excluded from get-togethers when you're single or not a parent, but sometimes that's the group dynamic of the day, and I've never made a stink over it when it's happened to me.

But I've seen some frazzled parents of toddlers throw some epic tantrums because they found out that *they* weren't invited to a party or get-together due to the fact that there's a 50/50 chance they'll bring Little Johnny, and everyone there would then have to watch their language and entertain the kid instead of having fun.  I get it, Mommy needs a break and Daddy wants to have a beer with his buddies.  But *you* signed on for this when you chose to become parents.  How can some people be completely unapologetic about exuding some of their friends, then have such an utter lack of self awareness to cry foul when *they* aren't invited to something? 

"You didn't invite me because of the kids, didn't you?!"

Yes.  Because we wanted to drink and swear and watch a few horror movies while shooting the shit.  Just like you didn't invite your single, childfree friends because you wanted to chat with your mom friends while your kids had a play date.  In a nutshell, don't flip the table because it's been (unintentionally) turned on you and you don't like it.People feel the need to mention whether they’re introverted or extroverted and my response is always: okay??

Might I even add that extroverts are now shunned and introverts are now praised,

go outside and be very social or don’t. No one cares

Edit: actually, don’t go outside and be social. Corona is still a thing(if this is not as unpopular as i think delete it plz) but seriously ppl. I don't need screaming children at my wedding, SPECIALLY if I have no kids. I want an adult night, with adult drinks, a nice reception, and to be able to let lose.

I don't really care how "quiet and  polite" your kids are or how you'll keep him out of the way. I love kids, I want kids , but at a party I paid thousands for it to be perfect( not as in looks, i mean as in the atmosphere and the stress level) for me and my spouse? No thanks. Respect them, if people say no exceptions when they tell you no kids at their wedding, respect that!

Don't ask, don't say that's rude, no backhanded compliments. As long as they gave you time to plan for a sitter, it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Don't try and make ppl feel bad about it. And do not try to sneak your kids in by bringing them on the day. Personally I wont let you in( gosh that sounds mean) but if they do let you in, you're going to look TERRIBLE, and bratty.

&#x200B;

extra:

no i do not hate kids, i love them but you just dont bring them to places that are not kid friendly.

With me, its just a behavior issue so teens (13 and up) are fine. They have manners and know when to be quiet and what is appropriate.

No its not about getting drunk (someone mentioned drugs? wtf) It is about people being able to relax and have fun without worrying that little Timmy is gonna grab a butter knife or that 3 year old Amy is gonna get on the table or run into a waiter.

If Someone says no kids and you have a long time to get a sitter but just dont want to go due to this...that should be fine with you. it aint that big a deal, celebrate another time:)

My view of what a wedding is about may be different than yours..thats fine. I dont judge you for having kids there, your choice man, all i ask is that you dont get angry when i say no kids. imma be sad you can't go but im not gonna hate you over it and i hope it is vice versa.

No i am not asking for gifts at my wedding. I want to specify that.

So this isnt as unpopular as i originally thought. Again, delete if not allowed.

&#x200B;Just watched a random youtube video featuring every one being asked to rate their own physical appearance and was surprised to see so many below average or borderline ugly looking people rating themselves 10.

So I scroll through the comment section and I see every one praising them for it because "if you feel like a 10,you are a 10"...like what?

So I can just go to a Hollywood acting agent or modeling agency and just say "I say I'm a 10 therefore I am so cast me next to Brad Pitt in your next movie even though I am an average looking guy realistically"

It is bullshit and illustrates the problem many people have and everyone propagating it and that is that you can't be confident if you are ugly or better put consider yourself ugly.
Confidence is accepting your flaws and seeing your values in spite of your flaws not covering them up with your delusions.

Saying you are a 10 ( perfect,flawless, best model on the planet ) looking person when you are all but that is the opposite of what you should do if you are searching for true confidence.

Accept your appearance realistically without downplaying or deluding yourself and DON'T EQUATE LOOKS with confidence.

A confident person is the one that sees his/her value not in terms of looks but personal strengths and virtues known only to him/herself.

If you feel the need to convince yourself you are a "10" in order to be confident it doesn't make you confident it makes you delusional and insecure.Telling someone their acne is beautiful just to up their self-confidence is ludicrous, lol. You wouldn't call a black eye beautiful. So why is acne all of a sudden?
I love the idea of helping someone feel better about themselves. But lying is asinine.You unload your junk and now have to make the trek to the cart return because you chose the closer parking spot. Have small kids? Even worse. You don’t want to leave them in the car while you return the cart, so now you’re lugging the kids too. Such an unnecessary hassle. Just park next to the cart return!“Why do you want this job?” 


“You know why I want this job...because I need to feed my family and health insurance...” This is why anyone gets a job, so why ask the question? Most individuals would prefer not to spend half of their waking hours away from their friends and family. The US will never implement universal basic income and universal health care so here we are: applying to any job that will keep food on the table, a roof over our heads, and access to “affordable” health insurance. 


Sure, the hiring authority is asking to gauge the candidates interest in the company. A better way to phrase this question might be “What about this position and our company is appealing to you?”Seriously, it's pretty damn great. You get to watch the sun rise up, you have more time to get stuff done, and the world is quieter. Not to mention it's way easier to get to sleep when the night comes. 

Waking any later than like 8 makes me feel crappy and like I already wasted the day, and I end up feeling super frustrated when the day's already done and I haven't done anything. 

So yeah, waking up early is rad.Bar soap is superior to liquid soap in every way.

I live in a house with 3 other guys who all use liquid and maintain it's better. I just can't see how. Liquid is more expensive, doesn't last as long, feels slimey.

R/changemymindIt was incredibly frustrating taking required classes in college taught by a Dr.x or Prof y who had a plethora of degrees and accolades but I could only understand one out of every five words they spoke. How are students expected to succeed when the professor might as well have been speaking a different language?Seriously. How has this one book series managed to keep going for so many years? It’s good, whatever, but so are tons of other children’s series, and they haven’t become such a cult. It’s not THAT good.

UPDATE: Wow. Um, I’ve never really had a popular Reddit post before, so thanks to all of you who upvoted because you hate me. It means a lot. I’ve noticed a pretty big trend in the comments. About half agree with me that while yes, it is a good series of both books and movies, it isn’t so amazing that it makes sense for it to have lasted so long. The other half is vehemently against me. 

I want to point some things out: 
1. If you read through the comments you’ll learn that I’ve seen all the movies, but I’ve only read books one and two. This is what my entire opinion was based on. As a preteen I read all the time. I grew up in a tiny town where in the summer all I could do was read or play outside. I got so bored that I would read the farmer’s almanac... I went into Harry Potter thinking I would love it because, well, everyone does. I read the first two and was kinda disappointed. It WAS good, it just wasn’t get-a-lighting-bolt-tattoo kinda good. That’s my whole opinion. Harry Potter is a good series. In my opinion, it’s just not good enough to have lasted so long in popular media. To me it’s not good enough to want to talk about it all the time, make an Instagram account about it, get a bumper sticker about it, stuff like that. I respect people who do, I just don’t get it at all because to me they were fine, but not exceptional. I think they’re overrated, not bad, that’s the whole post. 


2. I’ve read in the comments that the books don’t really get good until later in the series, so I will take my 20 year old butt to the library and try them again. For realsies. 


3. I did not post this to karma farm. I have felt this way about Harry Potter for a long time, but after falling into a HP fandom rabbit hole last night, I felt the want to post this. I will also say that I’ve never seen this post before. So if I “reposted” I didn’t mean to. If you’re confused on why this post blew up, so am I so join the club. 


4. I’m not saying this just because “it’s cool so I won’t like it!1!1” because I do like things that are cool. I love the Marvel movies, but if someone told me they were overrated I’d be like yeah you’re right lol.Whether it is a boss getting upset with an employee for asking for a raise, or the recent "everyone takes a beating" controversy, it seems that as a society we have slowly started to villainize anyone that stands up for themselves. I am sure there are other examples as well.Yes I realize $250,000 and $100,000 are both technically six figures salaries. In the traditional sense however, most people saw making $100K as the ultimate goal as it allowed for a significantly higher standard of living, financial independence and freedom to do whatever you wanted in many day to day activities. But with inflation, sky rocketing costs of education, housing, and medicine, that same amount of freedom now costs closer to $250K. I'm not saying $100K salary wouldn't change a vast majority of people's lives, just that the cost of everything has gone up, so "six figures" = $100K doesn't hold as much weight as it used to.

Edit: 
$100K in 1990 = $213K in 2021

Edit 2:

People making less than $100K: You're crazy, if I made a $100K I'd be rich

People making more than $100K: I make six figures, live comfortably, but I don't feel rich.

This seems to be one of those things that's hard to understand until you experience it for yourself.

Edit 3:

If you live in a LCOL area then $100K is the new $50K

Edit 4:

3 out of 4 posters seem to disagree, so I guess I'm in the right subreddit

Edit 5:

ITT: people who think not struggling for basic necessities is “rich”.  -- u/happily_masculineWhenever we want to get a bite to eat, even if it’s in the midst of a rush, we just order from a restaurant and pick it up. Fast food prices have gone up to the point that I’d rather go get a plate from a decent restaurant for $10-12 than pay $8 for a Burger combo meal. Why even bother with fast food at all now? All they have left is convenience. And even that is being robbed from them by just calling in and picking up an order. I could go to McDonald’s or Carl’s Junior and get a combo meal for close to $8 or $9. Or I could go to my local bar and get a bomb-ass burger meal for $9.99 with larger portion sizes and better quality.

Edit: Didn’t even know I had to say this, but I guess I do. I’m NOT eating fast food everyday. 😑😑😑 I work out SIX days per week and wake up at 4 in the morning to go to the gym. My fast food visits are my weekend splurge. It’s mind-boggling how many people posted assuming I’m eating fast food everyday or that I have poor health. My health is fine. You don’t know me. You’re sitting behind a screen making assumptions. 😑 End of rant.I love the unique temperature contrasts that weakly microwaved food has.  Will the next bite be piping hot, freezing cold, or somewhere in the middle?  You never know!  It's a party in your mouth!

Inspired by the leftover pot roast I'm eating this morning :)Hear me out. If you shower in the morning, then go out and walk around, or sit down for a long period of time, or do anything really, you sweat or accumulate germs. If you've previously showered and gotten clean, that cleanliness you've achieved will be no more once you start your day because of this. Why waste a shower? If you shower at night your cleaning off all the crap from the day. Plus, if you wanna get busy with your SO you'll be freshly clean for that where as if you showered in the morning theres a possibility that by the time night time comes around you'll smell like a sewer down there. Nobody wants that, do we? So, just eliminate that possibility by showering at night, or right before that all goes down in other words.
And don't give me that oh I shower twice a day bullshit, that'll dry out your skin faster than a month in the cold winter of the Canadian suburbs..
Edit: Fixed the spelling on sewer, some guy pointed that out. I'm blind so didn't realize lmao shows how little braille I read now days but whatever.I see this as a disgruntled student who has school at 7:20 in the morning and has to wake up before 6 am just to make it to class in time.

We know TWO things about teenagers: (1) they need between 8-10 hours of sleep per night and (2) that their circadian rhythms, or the biological mechanism that regulates human sleep and wakeness patterns, operate in a way that, on average, they don't start producing melatonin until after 11 PM. 

Taking those two facts into consideration, the typical high class has class at around 7 am and most students have to wake up between an hour or two hours before their first class if they don't want to be late. So like at 5 or 6 am. Let's assume that teens fall asleep right on the dot at 11 pm (even though in reality they actually fall asleep much later since melatonin takes time to induce sleep), and have to wake up at 6 am. That's only 7 hours of sleep, which is already under the 8-10 hour requirement.

And in reality since most teens fall asleep at least 15 or so minutes after 11 PM, as well as how some students wake up for school even earlier than 6, you have students getting between 4 and 6 hours of sleep, and this situation gets worse for students with jobs, lots of family obligations, extracurriculars, or lots of homework. 

These earlier start times just DON'T work. We already have the data for why they're a terrible idea and even the CDC recommends that all high schools start no earlier than 8:30 am.

The reason I say 10 instead of 8:30 is because those same students who fall asleep at midnight and have to wake up two or so hours before school starts to make it on time would get 8 or 9 hours of sleep. You would have to fall asleep at 1 or 2 am to fall below the 8-10 number. That's way better than if you had school at 8:30 or even nine.

And I know what people are gonna say. But what about students with jobs? What about athletics or clubs? What if the school day is longer?

Well, for athletics or clubs you can either have them at 9 am or have them as part of the regular school day if we reduce instruction time (which we should do anyway), so that way people don't have to stay after school. You can also have tutorials and additional help during these times. 

And about students with jobs, well I'm sorry but the rest of the school body shouldn't have to suffer because a minority of students have jobs. What's more, with a later start time, people have more time to spend doing things in the evening so maybe try to adjust your hours with your boss? 

(I also think we shouldn't assign homework but that's a popular opinion lol) 


*TL; DR*, a 10 AM start time would allow students to get the recommended sleep more easily and more often, improve grades, attendence, and classroom participation, and also greatly benefit student health, both physically and mentally. Let's do it!

Edit:

I forgot to put this in the original:

Also we can shorten the school day so we get out at like 3:45 pm or something. Research shows that classes really shouldn't be longer than an hour anyway. Some of y'all literally have no imagination or problem solving skills lol.

Also I have a sleep condition so calling me lazy is really an ableist and uninformed thing to say so take that nonsense elsewhere.I feel like people think they’re a single mom just because they’re no longer with the dad.. To me a single mom is someone who raises and pays for the child alone. If you get child support and share custody, you’re not a single mom...The best way to have carrots is always having them cut up into sticks and eating them cold. Cooked carrots don’t have that same nice crunchiness as raw carrots and they don’t even taste as good. Also, cutting carrots into thin circles is an awful way to eat them.#FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE READ THE EDITS

Almost every subreddit seems to have some form of masturbation or porn joke. And if you can’t understand or relate to it, youre going to be downvoted to hell and given comments like “We all know you secretly masturbate at home. Stop trying to pretend to not understand it”. Same with Instagram and Twitter. Like alright, cool, guys like to wank one out and stuff, but people should realize that maybe watching stuff like that isn’t enjoyable for all. Im just saying, theres a good number of guys out there who don’t find interest in any of those (including me, but I have a different reason). Not saying that doing the aforementioned actions are bad, but like, it shouldnt be seen as part of the definition of a guy on the internet

EDIT: should say that I do not think that masturbation or watching porn is inherently bad. I know the former is actually healthy (idk about the latter), just that those who don’t do the two things I mentioned shouldnt feel bad for not doing them

EDIT: Ok so, half of the new comments apparently didn’t read my post. The other half pose great questions but uh, I have 1k comments to go through. I might try and get through all of these.

EDIT: Normalize was a poor choice of words on my end. Shouldve used something else

EDIT: Porn Sux. The only positive it brings are new jobs. Masturbation is healthy at least, in moderationI once tried dating a girl who smoked weed everyday all day, and quite frankly, it was a mess. She would always forget about hanging out, she was lazy, and she rarely if ever left her house (which was filled with junk).

Don't get me wrong, she seemed like an incredible person and probably was, but she was a shell of what she could've been because weed was basically her entire personality and way of life and she was completely fine with it. I do smoke occasionally at parties and whatever, but I think people who blaze all day are just super unattractive. It's as if they do not have any other serious hobbies or passions, and they rarely make time for anything else unless smoking is involved. It is super hard to be in a serious relationship with a stoner because they are just couch potatoes from what I've seen, and that is super unattractive.

I've tried to casually bring this up in a conversation with my friends before, and they think edgy stoner girls are hot and don't see a problem with dating them. I brought up these points in conversation and they just go with the classic, "nahhh I want a thicc stoner goth babe". I'm pretty sure quite a decent majority of people don't see a problem with this.

EDIT: I forget to mention that I am currently in high school, so I guess I kind of subconsciously took that into account when I formed my opinion on her. She is just way too young (in my opinion) to be so heavily reliant on weed. Like the title says, I think it should be mandatory to donate your organs if you die. There are always many people on waiting lists for life saving transplants and yet there are still people who would rather take their organs to the grave with them.
Once you are dead there is literally no reason to keep them. Even if people don't want it for religious reasons or what ever, why would we put the wishes of a dead person about the well-being of someone that is still alive?
I know there are already projects to encourage people to give their consent in the case of their death, but it should really just be required by law.

Maybe there is something I don't get about it, so if you disagree feel free to give your opinion.

Edit: I won't debate over religion with you I think human life should be always valued more than any religious beliefs.

Edit2: I know how it's handled in the UK now, that's defenetly a step in the right direction.

Edit3: Damn this escalated. I tryed to reply to everyone, but at 1,400 comments it's just not possible anymore. Thanks to everyone who commented their opinion.I’ve seen so many reviews on products that im looking to buy saying that the shipping took too long but the product is fine so it got a 1 star review. This isn’t useful to me because it’s not accurately representing the product itself when I’ve always thought the rating is based primarily on the product. It sort of hinders my research on the item and I can’t get a proper opinion on it. I don’t give a shit about shipping if it’s a good product! 

I don’t think people understand how ratings work, or they’re just trying to be assholes by slighting the company. Like sure, take a star or two off but don’t give it a one star rating just for shipping alone! Especially during COVID times. Stop doing this! Did you like the product or not?! 

Shipping should be a separate category.

Update: Wow I didn’t think this would be getting any traction. For those of you who say “how tf is this unpopular”, just remember....Just because you agree, doesn’t mean it’s popular. I wouldn’t have put this here if it was a popular opinion in my experience!Hear me out guys, anything happens, there's usually coverage over it from very different sides, I'm talking media coverage (if the event is significant enough), conversation between colleagues, discussion between friends, there's always a few people on one side and a few on another. But I usually, in most cases, find myself in between the arguments and taking best points of both the arguments and merging them while addressing the flaws in both sides' argument. 

While looking at this, it may sound like the best thing ever, to be able to evaluate any argument based on its merit, and it is, but it also is sometimes the worst. Worst as in, there will be people who are so fanatically invested in their side's argument that anyone pointing out any flaw in that argument is abused, and criticized relentlessly, and I cannot push back in the same way with the arguments that their opposing group provides because I know that the opposing group's argument isn't also good enough, then lo and behold, I'm criticised by both the parties, without almost anyone understanding what I meant to say.

So, yeah, this has been my rant, and I know it is a long one, but it can be sometimes tiring to be able to evaluate a situation/argument solely on its merits when fanatically supporting, sounds and is very easy. But that said, I would never want to trade it for anything. 

PS: I do not mean to sound boastful or arrogant, it's just what I have observed, and yeah not everyone is like that, but the number people willing to accept that their argument can be flawed is low.

Edit: Guys I may not be able to reply to you all, but thanks a lot to everyone for your comments, and the people that gave awards, thanks a lot. I did not try to come off as arrogant that I'm smart and people are dumb, so if I gave that impression, please know that that wasn't my intention.I admit, even I struggle with this mentality whenever I play video games and I am quite an avid gamer and I hate played video games for years.

What is the irony for me is that we have developed this cultural belief that video games are nothing but a waste of time and money and have no impact or value in human societies or within people's personal lives and hobbies.

But then again, we also have reinforced this idea that watching Netflix all day long or binge watching multiple episodes or marathons and watching on the couch and eating snacks all day long is considered a good thing or a healthy thing even.

Sure, binge watching every now and then is nothing wrong but the double standard is striking.Whenever I see old people try to connect with younger generations by trying to act like them, I usually cringe or feel uncomfortable but I believe that they deserve some respect because they are trying hard to connect with younger people, and I feel like that’s a really respectable thing to do. It saddens me how some people just make fun of them harshly when all they did not have any bad intentions. I am honestly thankful that these people from older generations are trying to connect with us.I don't get how people think they are cute.  They have curly HAIR.  I hate the curls, they look terrible.  And I don't like the crossbreeds either.  They don't look cute as puppies or adults.  They're just. So. Ugly.  Im not saying theyre a bad dog, but they are very ugly.  I know i will receive a lot of hate, but this is an unpopular opinion.
Edit: I don’t think they are bad dogs, they’re very smart and affectionate just ugly.  I’m sure they’re great dogs.I've heard a lot of people, and especially today, talk lackadaisically and even with joy at the prospect of Chauvin getting raped in prison as a consequence. I hold no love for Chauvin and I'm glad to see him convicted, but I find it alarming how many people normalize and even wish for it to happen to a convict. My comment isn't specific to today's events, but I hear this all the time. Is it actually just accepted among the American conscious that incarcerated people should be repeatedly sexually assaulted as part of their punishment? Doesn't this clearly constitute a cruel and unusual punishment? Why do we normalize this as an expectation of being incarcerated? What's perhaps more disturbing is that almost everyone knows this happens and just accepts it as a fact of life. It's really not acceptable or permissible and we should stop normalizing it.

Edit: To all the people who have been assaulted, I hope you found justice and I understand that you would want your perpetrator to feel the same level of violation, humiliation and trauma you did. To all the other people who are advocating rape for rapists, take a step back and ask yourself if you really think the best solution to rape is more rape.For those of you that think you're fighting for **all** the issues that the world has, you're not. You're just fighting for ones that are trending. Do you have any idea of how many issues humanity has? Most of them don't even get the attention they deserve. At the end of the day, you're just one person with your own problems. It's nice to show support for a better future. It's something that we all want, for everyone to be happy and live a better life. But you don't always have to be ready to fight for a better future 24/7. It's not "privileged" to mind your own business and to deal with the shit you got. You can't always care more about stuff that doesn't affect you vs stuff that does directly affect you.No, I don't have some cucking fetish. Here's my reasoning:

I think often in relationships, partners really hate when their SO gets hit on. But as long as you trust your SO, what's the problem?

Sometimes my bf and I will go to the mall, and I'll notice someone checking him out. I really hope he sees. Sometimes he'll go to the gym and a girl flirts a bit. Cool. I'm happy my SO is getting a confidence boost from someone other than me, and I think it's healthy.

IMO friends don't compliment friends enough, and even though you know your SO is being genuine when they compliment you, honestly it loses value. To know a stranger thinks you're attractive or have a good trait is a good feeling for everyone and I know my bf can sometimes have small self-image issues.

So thanks to the girls who hit on my boyfriend and make him smile and like looking at himself for a while. You're secretly a GRaw carrot is juicy and cool and it makes a satisfying crunch and you can munch on it as a snack as well as lunch. Boiled carrot on the other hand is disgusting and mushy, not to mention it looks like a depressing orange slushy. 

Boiled carrot is the bête noire of my life and IDGAF if it's healthier with more nutrients or whatever. It looks like something that Alfredo Linguini from Ratatouille made and he destroyed the laws of nature with a fricking soup.

Raw and juicy carrot is my favorite vegetable and even if boiled carrots give more of whatever I can just eat more raw carrot to make up for it.Title says it all. Men and women are different and there is nothing wrong with that. I believe that each side has different strengths and weaknesses and in order to make the most out of our abilities we need to acknowledge those differences.

I am by no means saying that men are better than women, or the opposite. I believe that we are equal, but different. I’m also going to add another disclaimer and say that there are outliers. We’re all people with different personality types and upbringings, and we all bring a unique perspective and abilities to the table. Part of that perspective and ability is based on gender, but that doesn’t make it a bad thing.Stop telling me "That's not going to happen" when I ask a What If? Question, I'm not trying to ask if it's going to happen or not, I want to know what will happen IF something like that happened. The whole point of a What If? question is to speculate what will happen if something went differently, not to theorize if it will happen or not.I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. I'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but I'm well inside the 'normal' BMI range (BMI of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. But hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) Yea you heard me. Oatmeal cookies with raisins are better.

I mean sure, I'd eat a chocolate chip cookie if I was offered. But If I had to choose between either. I'd choose the oatmeal cookie. They are always soft and chewy and not too sweet. While 80% of the time. the Chocolate chip is hard, way too sweet.

EDIT: too sweet\* not to sweet\*  


EDIT: Obligatory Thanks yall for the awards, **but please go spend money on charity. Or something nice for yourself <3**

EDIT: FRONT PAGE. HELL YEAH!!!! OATMEAL RAISIN SQUAD RISE UPDon’t get me wrong, I (21/f) support women loving their bodies and accepting flaws. But what about the men? Where is all this support for men that don’t fit the stereotypes of what a “real man” looks like? So many women I know support body positivity but will make fun of a man for his penis size openly and It makes my blood boil. The hypocrisy is so upsetting. Men are humans too, with emotions and insecurities and we should be validating their natural bodies as well.

Edit: essentially don’t be an ass about people’s bodies? Feel like it’s not that hard y’all.

Edit 2: if you haven’t encountered this in your friend groups, thats good! Keep in mind I am in my early 20s and as such, have many friends around the same age and have repeatedly witnessed a lot of crude and hurtful comments directed at previous sexual partners. I would hope that matured adults no longer talk like this. I really want the basis of body shaming to be addressed though and this idea that some bodies are less than others, especially regarding something so private.

Edit 3: I didn’t think this would blow up, thank you guys! I want to point out again that this isn’t just about genitals. Yes it’s in the title but body shaming can be attributed to height, acne, baldness (that’s to whoever brought this to my attention), body hair, etc. We have to learn to love ourselves and be unbothered but the basis of these societal expectations make it difficult for younger people to gain confidence and could struggle more than necessary into adulthood.Respecting the elderly is seen as a universally common social norm. Experience, wisdom, societal contribution, etc. are some of the reasons why the elderly are sometimes provided with a higher level of respect then the rest of the human age groups. 

That being said, I will not show someone respect just because of their age. Just because you are elderly/older, does not automatically grant you the right to be an entitled asshole. 

The other day my gym announced that someone had parked in the emergency lane. The owner of the car, an older gentlemen, refused to move it until he finished his workout. The gym proceeded to call the police and threaten to tow the car, and the man began throwing a tantrum at the gym employees, suggesting that they have no respect for their elders.As a college student I have had and heard of professors, during syllabus week, state some variation of "half of you in this room will fail this course." Bro, that's not something to brag about. That just tells me you suck at your job or are plain just a dick. To me its different if a professor states upfront that the class is hard, and genuinely teaches well and curves according to test scores, as compared to, "Sucks to suck, maybe try harder" when the average on an exam is a 40%. I wish colleges in general did more vetting of teachers to make sure they can actually teach their subject well.First, when you pull out your camera to call out someone and it’s just you running off a list of all the things they did that you don’t like, you look like a whiny, presumptuous complainer. We all know there’s two sides to every story. We also all know that retail jobs suck, pay crap, and the majority of retail managers may not always be the best, some can be the absolute worst. But if you think it’s cool to quit on a live stream or tik-tok to call out some bad manager who nobody else knows, and show to your fans how cool and edgy you think you are, you’re an idiot. No different than the clowns who film an argument to show the world ….thinking they’re right…… only to get shamed for their sheer stupidity and lack of self-awareness later. 

Sure your feelings may be real and reasons for quitting are legit, but it’s obvious as you read your prepared notes, your voice trembles and your hands shake, that you’re just showing off and doing this performance for tik tok and so your friends can high five you for sticking it to the “man-anger” later, and it’s painfully obvious they wouldn’t be putting on the same shit show while quitting if it weren’t for the camera.

What this narcissistic display shows the world is that from a professional employment standpoint, you aren’t able to process or handle your emotions very well under pressure, and that these folks have issues taking responsibility, and handling themselves in a mature way. 

That said most of these videos so far seem to be teens, or not always fully matured emotionally, while adults are usually the evil managers, which makes sense. So I give them some leeway for being teens, but if adults start doing this  petty crap God help us. 

All this is simply indulging in one's anger to make the person feel better about quitting. Trust, managers ain’t going home feeling bad or questioning themselves over losing you as an employee because you quit while making an ass out of yourself. You made this easy for them they didn’t need to fire you. 

It really just ends up looking like nothing more than a cheap shot. A punch to the back of the head as you walk away. The person doing it looks very weak. 

Be strong. Be mature and quit like an adult, and move on if you can’t take your job or manager. Everything in life doesn’t need to be a tik tok show for your friends.

This is by no means a defense for bad managers, bad employers, corporate America or horrible human beings in general.

They are constantly taught to say sorry for being disrespectful to grown ups and for doing something that isn't right but we ourselves are not aware of how much pain we inflict to them by not saying sorry when we hurt them a little too much. Yes, adults are always expected to be right but that doesn't make their mistakes invisible to children. 

I have a 6-year old nephew and we always say sorry to him when we exceed our limitations of giving discipline to him and I think it has helped him a lot to become a more upright individual who knows how to  apologize as well as to forgive.A popular "unpopular opinion" posted here is stuff along the lines of "Exercise is so easy and people just neef motivation." or "It's not hard to find something you like to do for fitness."

Bullshit. Exercising is literally the definition of forced torture. You push yourself to the point of stress on purpose. It causes aches and often injuries. You are also mindlessly doing pointless movements which are basically just wasting time when you could be doing more productive things like making art, cleaning, writing a book, or just producing something useful for society. It is the LAST thing I want to do to 'relax'.

Nothing about excess physial activity is appealing to me and I will never like it. Sports can be fun but they often feel unregulated and one-sided, unlike a tactical video game which uses algorithms to match you up with people actually on your skill level. I hate sweating and smelling gross, I hate wasting my already very little energy on some bullshit workout that gets me no results and just makes me instabtly tired. I hate stresing about what I eat all the time when I already have fairly healthy low-carb meals daily and are at a good weight. I just hate all of it. No amount of convincing can motivate me to work out- I am DEFINITELY not going to sacrifice my already fucked up sleep schedule to wake up early, it will ruin the tiny balance I have between my morning meds and staying awake for the entire day. I am NOT going to waste my afternoon time traveling all the way to a gym and back because I already feel like I have no time left for actual projects I want to work on.

Exercising sucks, it's boring and a waste of energy.A lot of people today talk about how "[X] is a human right" and I think this distorts the meaning of the word. I've always conceived of "rights" as something innate that you are born with, which we have rules to prevent the government from taking away from us (i.e. freedom of speech, right to life/liberty, etc.). 


I think the word "right" is mistaken when it gets applied to things like healthcare, housing, etc. I think it's a fine/noble thing to want society to provide these things for people, but they should be considered privileges and not "rights." 

I have a "right" to say what I want and not get thrown in prison; I have a "right" to live my life and not be killed by someone else/the government.

I do not have a "right" to have a service (healthcare, housing, etc.) provided to me by someone else/by the government. That is a privilege, not a right.I've seen way too many newborn baby posts on social media and most of the babies look ugly. They aren't even cute but their mum is touting them around as the next pope or some shit. They are so wrinkly, can't even act cute and their eyes are always closed because they look like someone squirted onion juice in their eyes. 

Newborn pics aren't cute, I rather see puppies or kittens. When babies turn into toddlers they turn into cute toddler or an ugly toddler. 

Mother's to be, get used to this fact.

Edit: need to make this clear, I don't hate babies or children. I just find newborn's ugly. Infants and toddlers can become cute.

Edit2: Thank you for all the awards but honestly save it for a better post. I am grateful for the awards so far but my newborn hating post is nothing compared to the creative minds on this site. Go show them love instead.There's nothing worse than driving 40 mph on the interstate/highway or someone brake checking the car in front of me. People who do this tend to be unpredictable and disrupt traffics in other ways such as late merge or not paying attention in duel turn lanes. Whereas people speeding or tailgating just want to go faster rather than because they are oblivious to their surroundings.What the title says. Because of all the minion memes Facebook tends to use, it gives the movie a bad name, and it deserves so much more than that. 

It has everything: 

Humor,
A unique protagonist, 
Good motives, 
Great villain,
Good character arc and development, 
Happy ending,
Great soundtrack,

“Despicable Me” deserves a lot more recognition than what it gets right now. 

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.It’s not fair when the kid has to a act like an interpreter and it only makes your daily interactions difficult. Whatever country you move to you should be able to communicate with people there.  
On the flip side when you don’t learn the language you can’t be upset if someone doesn’t understand you.

Edit:
Of course if you suddenly move somewhere like a refugee situation that’s understandable. It should be an effort to learn the language though.

I’m not expecting people to be fluent. I don’t care what language they want to speak at home with family or anything like that. I’m saying out in public when speaking to the general population.

It’s controversial that’s why I posted it hereWhy? Because it doesn’t fucking matter. Every race has done awful shit and have also been subjected to awful shit. ALL I see are people dwelling on the past instead of actually trying to progress and move forward. This victim mentality is fucking ridiculous and no race deserves to have their assess kissed. Shit happens. That’s human nature. Holding grudges and filling stereotypes is getting us nowhere. 

Let the shit storm begin. I’m just so tired of seeing all of this ridiculous shit on the news. Killing and hating each other over race and religion. Humanity is a fucking farce of what it could be. Is this all you get when you have intelligent beings? Hatred?

What we should be proud of is being human, but that will never happen because as intelligent as we are, we lack the ability to to simply just accept one another.Being large is an epidemic in America, but yet there is no “easy” way to exercise for free, besides running. That’s why I suggested we have public gyms like we have free libraries.

Just like knowledge from books, everyone should have free access to the ability to be fit and healthy. And with Gyms costing money (and often a decently hefty sum) most people don’t want to pay for it, especially those who need it most.

If we had public gyms to be sponsored we could make it A. Easier for people to have access to gyms and B. Cheaper for them as well.

That way we can have both and educated and fit population.I feel like I'm getting drier in a shorter amount of time compared to a soft/plush towel. It feels somewhat abrasive but in an exfoliating sort of way and really wakes me up more in the morning. Just an all round better experience.

Edit: So, this wasn't nearly as unpopular as I'd imagined. Apologies, as you were.A lot of people on Reddit don’t post, comment, upvote , or downvote  They just lurk. I have been one of them for sometime now. 
I decided to post something recently and apparently I missed the mark a bit, but hey! I tried. 
The Reddit community does not let that go quietly, they instantly pile on.  
This unwelcoming probably prevents a lot of people from posting ever again.People don't have to EARN respect. You should treat people with respect because that's the decent fucking thing to do. Sure people can lose your respect, but if you go into every encounter of your life thinking that other people need to EARN respect from you, then you're just a shitty person with a superiority complex.

Given the bullshit that usually gets posted here, maybe this concept will ACTUALLY be an unpopular opinion among all the edgelords.

Edit: I see a lot of people posting the definition of the word respect and arguing semantics. You must be a lot of fun at dinner parties.

Edit2: Last thing I’ll point out (and this may be the **truly**unpopular opinion), but I believe that if we as humans respected each other more (and yes, I mean exactly in the high-esteem/honorific sense), the world would be a MUCH better place.The reason there are more male comedians, and they seem "better" most of the time is because generations men have been told that what happens to them, and how they feel, is unimportant and even weak. 

More men gravitate towards self-deprecation and humor because it is one of the few socially acceptable ways for us to cope with our mental health issues. 

Men aren't given the same nurturing or support as women, and so we look to different means of processing what we are going through, or have gone through. It isn't about toughing it out, or manning up, or even being immature--it is about a centuries-long system of us not being emotionally important, often even to our loved ones. 

Humor is a faulty way of processing emotional occurrences that no other skills are present to address. Men gravitate towards it more because people genuinely don't want to hear our struggles or support us.Seriously. Like I get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. It’s fine to not like them, it’s fine to not want to be around them, and it’s certainly fine to not want to have them.

What some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. Constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. Even if you’re not saying it to their face, even if they’re too young to even understand you — you’re just an asshole. 

Also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. They have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. They are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. And just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

I’m just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren’t people yet, like they’re less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. It’s so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


Edit: Okay I need to clarify some stuff. I’m usually just a lurker on reddit, I’m not used to all this attention and I’m not completely sure how to deal with it.

I think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people’s throat are down right awful. People have every right in the world to not want kids and as I’ve mentioned in the comments, I totally get why so many people hate kids. You’re allowed to hate them! They can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. In this post I was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. I’m not trying to insult anyone’s lifestyle.

Also, I deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and I realized I wholeheartedly agree haha. Sorry about that! Like I said, I’m not used to my posts getting attention.

(One more edit: Since apparently it matters, I’m an 18 year old girl. I don’t have any kids, and I am only newly not one. Thanks.)So for this I have various points and don’t feel like writing an essay so going to just make a list. Know going into this that the appeal of Twitch for me is the sense of community.
1) The occasional failure of someone who isn’t great at video games humanizes them in a way. Seeing the failure that they sometimes have makes them seem real. Streamers who can destroy a game lobby seem like gods. An entity separate from humanity. Their caliber and constant success undermines the most interesting part of humanity. Failure. That’s why I don’t find them entertaining when they play video games. 
2) There are too many people watching those huge streamers and too many people in the chat. I know that this is kinda in the job description of being a huge streamer, but Twitch is supposed to be a platform to interact with the streamer. Instead, it feels like a constant gamble wether or not the streamer will even acknowledge your existence. There is constant spam which makes the chat even more overwhelming. You don’t get that with small streamers. Having ten people at any given time watching the stream makes you feel special. Nine out of ten times, the streamer will read your chat message. Sometimes it might turn into a full conversation. Hell, if you’re lucky, you might even get bumped up to VIP status. You feel significant. Appreciated. 
3) Kind of going off of the previous point, everything nice that you do matters to a small streamer. Wether it’s donating bits or subscribing or gifting a subscription, the small streamer will actually appreciate that. Not to say that all huge streamers are scumbags because a good amount aren’t, but there are a lot of big streamers where any monetary donation doesn’t really matter to them. I used to watch a streamer who had 65,000 subscribers. I’m sure they have more now, but in order to not call them out, I’m just going to to use 65,000 while doing math. A tier-1 subscription costs 5 dollars. Twitch partners get about half of the money from a subscription, the other half goes to Twitch itself. 65,000x2.5=162,500. That’s how much they earn in a month from tier-1 subscriptions alone. That doesn’t even take tier 2 or 3 subscriptions or bits into account. Now, to find how much they earn in a year let’s do 162,500x12=1,950,000. Do you really think ten bits matters to them? What about a small streamer with only 5 subscribers? 5x2.5x12=150. Ten bits matters a lot more to them.

This went on a lot longer than it thought it would.

If you agree with me, might I recommend a streamer named Smutav. Before you ask, it’s not me. Smutav is an art and video game streamer. https://m.twitch.tv/smutav. I am in fact an amateur Twitch streamer, but I started 2 weeks ago and had these views before. I didn’t include the fact that I stream because I didn’t want to make this seem like a self-advertisement.I am so tired of the "Weather man gets it wrong again" trope. I'm sorry, did it sprinkle when they said it would merely be a cloudy day? Did it only snow 4 inches when they predicted 8? Was it 80 and sunny instead of 65 and partly cloudy? People always complain and talk about how bad they are at their jobs when they get a forecast wrong but ignore the fact that they almost always get it right! 

These people make forecasts weeks in advance and can tell you if the week will be sunny or rainy or cloudy or snowy or humid or cold and you can usually count on that general forecast. When you flip on the TV and they say "Today it is going to rain 100%", it is going to rain! If they say "Today is going to rain 40%" and it doesn't rain, that doesn't mean they were wrong. Just means it MIGHT rain. 

Meteorologists do one of the most impressive jobs humans have learned how to do and they deserve credit for that. All I hear is Karen talking shit when its slightly colder than they predicted a week ago.Most people are stupid. This is even more prevalent on social media which breeds an unhealthy, toxic, self-absorbed environment. Most of these "voices" that want to be heard should not be, so they aren't allowed to spread their hatred or biased opinions. I also don't care what athletes or celebrities think, nor should they use their "platform" to lecture me when they can't and won't ever relate to the average Joe. 

I miss the days before social networks where information was slower to develop, which was able to be more trustworthy and accurately portrayed then Mr. Keyboard Warrior's opinion on what happened and why I should be outraged.

EDIT: Thanks for the love. BTW, this is my own personal opinion and I don't care if it's "heard" but I would think that would be obvious by now.the world is pretty great. it's literally the best it's ever been in all of history. quality of life is the best ever, we have a connected world where we all share knowledge and communicate with each other, we have access to technology that our grandparents think is magic, we're living longer, we're eradicating diseases one after the other, we're inventing insane treatments for disabilities and diseases that let people live better lives, we're more prosperous than ever before.

and most people are decent. crime rates are declining. wars and war deaths are declining. There's literally less people out there who are murdering others or robbing others or assaulting others than in the past.

edit 1: wow RIP my inbox.

some points: 1) maybe I should have said the world is "better" and people are "better". Obviously "great" and "good" are kinda meaningless, but the world and people are better than any point in history.
2) yeah, bad things still happen. duh. everyone posting "lol but what about Hong Kong/ISIS/pedophiles", yeah, obviously bad stuff still happens. I explicitly explained that. The existence of bad things doesn't mean the world isn't better than ever before.America is a stupid country with stupid people in it because America is made by people and people are flawed and stupid. Your country isn’t special nor the the exception to this rule. Your country is probably equally as stupid, flawed, with just as controversial a history as ours. But the reason why it just appears that we’re “”worse”” is because people in your countries have to care about what happens here and so you watch our over exaggerated news and that’s the only exposure you ever get to daily life here. And the reason you watch our news and not the other way around is because what we do has an impact on your life / country’s geopolitics while the average American doesn’t have to give two flying fcks about who the leader of Denmark or Peru or Cambodia is because those countries don’t influence the world like we do.Yeah I mean sex is cool, but have you ever had 10 hours of uninterrupted sleep? That shit is the best. Like yeah being able to cum and all that, well that ain’t bad, but not being tired the next day is truly legendary.I have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. However, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. Have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? I'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. To clarify, I am not talking about severe cystic acne. Painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. But people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. This kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. I can't really put my finger on it. It would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. And even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

Edit: 

Well this has never happened before. It’s been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: “you’re an absolutely disgusting vile human being” to “I 100% AGREE WITH YOU”. I’m also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! But I guess I put it in the right place lol. I’m not sure people should be thanking me either. I can be quite shallow as well. This is just one those subjective quirks I really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. But really if you read the comments some of the things YOU guys are into is pretty unconventional. Beyond all these superficial traits though, I think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. You don’t get to choose it. So stop worrying about who you’re gonna pick. And as a the great redditor u/Chief_Economist once said: Sit down, be humble. Or was that Kendrick Lamar? Anyway.I’m not talking about politics or the government. There is nothing wrong with having negative feelings towards American politics or the government. 

I’m talking about Americans who try to act like other Americans are the worst people in the world and that they are somehow the exception. It’s a running joke on the internet. Americans are ‘uneducated’, they’re ‘lazy’, they’re ‘uncultured’. I get it. We aren’t the best people in the world,  but we aren’t the worst. There are a lot of really great Americans out there and chances are you aren’t in the top 10% just because you like to shit on others. Usually when Americans start shitting on other Americans they’re doing it to try to look better than other Americans. That’s literally what the #notlikeothergirls girls do. 

Yet these Americans get praised for the same behavior. 

BeCaUsE AmErICaNs sUcKThese guys charge schools thousands of dollars, in some cases, tens of thousands. They make up lies and stories and play on the emotions of kids. Some of them are great, but most are fraudsters.Tomatoes are disgusting. Sure, I can give a little bit of a slide to ketchup and marinara sauce (to an extent. The chunks of tomatoes in the sauce is gross). 


The fact that they are a default on sandwiches is stupid. Everyone I know asks for no tomatoes or is disappointed if there are tomatoes on their food and they didn't realize it. But the fact that they are a default sandwich option shows me that either people are actually into it or the world just doesn't want to accept that it's gross.


A lot of people get ketchup on burgers already, so why do you need tomato slices? For the slippery wet texture? No thanks. Tomatoes even make their way into sandwiches that have no business having tomatoes in it! It's like the restaurant is like yeah let's add more, throw on a tomato! No rhyme or reason. The sandwich is delicious without that.


Maybe I'm missing something. But I truly don't believe that I am. Tomatoes can go away and the food world would be better for it. I only recently started to accept ketchup for just burgers, but honestly that can go too if it means no more tomatoes involved ever again.


Edit: fixed a typo

Edit 2: Okay, I didn't think this would actually gain any attention. I would just like to say some things now that it has:


1. I shouldn't have compared ketchup to tomatoes. That opened a whole other bag of worms I was not ready to face haha. I have learned from my slander!



2. I'm not sure why people keep calling me a child. Yeah, I didn't like tomatoes as a kid either, but I can't help that my taste buds never evolved with me! It is what it is. Maybe one day I'll grow to understand tomatoes, but today is not that day.



3. I appreciate all the tomato tips and I am glad so many of you like tomatoes. I just wish they weren't on every sandwich everywhere just as an automatic topping. And no, I'm not expecting the whole world to cater to my opinion, but I did want to vent about it. These damn tomatoes are everywhere, man. 



4. BLT's are excluded from this opinion lol. I don't like them, but tomato is in the name, it's not just put there willy nilly.Idk why I think this is so strange but why do people insist on using months of age instead of years after their kid has reached a year old?  Like why is it so common for parents to be like “oh his age? He’s 33 months :)))))” please ma’am he’s a toddler now he can speak words just say years.

Edit: so what I’m hearing is it’s about milestones, medically speaking at least.  But if it’s not in a medical setting? Why continue to say months instead of years after a certain point?  I completely understand if you’re going to a doctor or maybe actually having a conversation about milestones with someone else, but if you’re posting on Facebook about your “36 month old” or talking to me in person about your “25 month old” ... why not refer to them as a toddler? Them milestones have passed.I used to go out a lot in my younger years, but thinking about it,
1. That shit was expensive. Clubs and bars would be packed. If you didn’t pregame enough, you’re waiting at the bar for way too long and end up spending $$$
2. I was out really late. I’d start getting ready at 9 PM, pregame around 10, and be back home anywhere between 1 AM and 5 AM. 
3. The next day was ruined because I’d sleep in and be way too hungover or tired to do anything

Why boozy brunch is better?
1. At some places, you can get unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary’s, etc. AND a meal for a fixed price? Sign me the the heck up. 
2. You also get a table and are able to talk with your friends? You also have a waiter or waitress checking in to fill up your glass? SIGN ME UP TWICE. 
3. I’d be back home at a reasonable time. I’d work out at 8 AM, start getting ready at 10 AM, get to brunch anywhere from 11:00 AM to 2 PM, and be home anywhere from 3 PM - 6 PM? Amazing. 
4. Next day isn’t ruined at all and I get to have a full night’s sleep and be up at a reasonable time. I’d be well-rested and able to take on the next day. 

So unless we normalize going out at 7 PM, boozy brunch takes my vote.The social norm of alcohol is fairly sickening. The idea of fun like holidays or vacation or parties or birthdays is usually tied to drinking and alcohol dependency is crippling families across the world on a scale that no other drug competes with. Puking, drunk driving, loud obnoxious behavior, sexual harassment and down right embarrassing behavior is a normality that couples drinking.

Edit: People saying “Heroin is worse/coke is worse” I’ve seen addiction in all shapes and sizes between first hand witnessing heroin overdoses to living with a cocaine/crack addict to having a best friend addicted to meth, not a single one of those drugs is as widespread, popular and accessible as alcohol is nor are they socially acceptable. As a society as a whole no other drugs come close to the damage alcohol has caused. That’s a fact. Though I guess it wouldn’t be an unpopular opinion if people weren’t disagreeing with me.

Edit: To every alcoholic commenting about their hardships with drinking and overcoming them remember that you are not you when you drink and that being able to address that you in fact have a drinking problem is a giant step in the right direction to recovery! As someone who battled with addiction themselves I support each and every one of you in hopes that you make your goal a reality. Your loved ones will appreciate the time they can share with you sober more than any other gift you could give them this holiday season. But remember to be careful when trying to quit drinking and to seek medical advice when attempting to quit after being a long time binge drinker as shakes and seizures can be life threatening and you may need additional help to ween yourself off of the alcohol.My sister is engaged and her fiancé last name is not so great.. soooo he’s going to take my sisters last name. I think it’s awesome but there are lots of people who have made snarky comments to them I don’t get the big deal here.There’s nothing wrong with expressing love for your bro’s. Love is obviously not exclusive to romantic relationships, but guys seem weirded out by using it with there homies. I see women saying “I love you” often with other female friends in a completely non romantic way. Guys should be doing this more often and people should encourage it. I would take a bullet for my bro’s and if that’s not love idk what is.I see a lot of people who go to really competitive private schools that cost 70k+ per year but then complain about their debt afterwards. There are so many options to get a cheaper college education, and almost anyone who’s competitive enough to get into a T50 school can take advantage of them (except maybe international kids). There are state schools, community colleges, cheaper private schools, and other private schools that give general merit aid. When you make the conscious decision to go to a top private school that costs 70k a year (looking at you BU, NYU, UChicago, Ivies) and pass up the cheaper options, I don’t feel bad because that was a decision you made knowing the consequences.What's the difference between sleeping around outside your relationship and calling it "open" and being fuck buddies? Not much if you ask me. Both are void of any actual commitment so calling it a relationship seems to be a bit of stretch. You like to fuck said person, you also  like their company, but you don't *exactly* want to commit, but still want them around = friends with benefits.


Edit: This certainly blew up. This is an opinion on an unpopular opinion sub, I honestly expected an out roar. This is reddit, full of overly sensitive Sally's. 

My opinion still stands, I'm speaking for myself and how I feel. It does not come from a place of naivety, religion  or being hateful, ignorant. The list goes on. I could honestly give a shit less how many people you sleep with. Don't care if you're poly, asexual, swingers whatever. For me sex is important and to be shared with one person. (Hence this being unpopular, many of you made it clear that you don't view or value sex in that way and that's fine.)It’s disgusting that people treat an age old tradition as simple milestone in their disastrous lives.  Marriage is meant to be the everlasting and unbreaking bond between two people. It has been extended to societal and legal roles in the world which is not a problem. The problem is when people treat marriages as their casual relationships. Getting married into a situation they know is unstable or doing it for stupid reasons or impulse. Further problems come with divorce with the management of assets and children. None of this would have been a problem had they not been marked and there were obstacles to them completing it. These obstacles should mean that only people with a true intention to remain with their partner can be married.It would be cool to see what the true limits of human strength and endurance are, and probably reduce drug abuse in the regular Olympics because players who want to do that would mostly transfer into the unrestricted event. 

TBH I see nothing but upsides.I feel like such an asshole even typing that.

After becoming sober I have gone far, far out of my way to not make my addiction the problem of others. I sober cab for free. I bring beer to BBQ's. I have never asked anyone not to drink in front of me...

But that fucking Leinenkugel Beer commercial plays EVERY *GOD DAMNED* TIME THERE'S AN ADVERTISING PAUSE on Spotify. It is HOTTER THAN HELL out right now and a beer sounds **REALLY, REALLY GOOD.**

And it hurts to type this, I am not an entitled person, but the non-stop, incessant badgering me to buy alcohol every three songs is making me want to relapse.

You can still drown me in advertising, even the same ad over and over and over and over and over, just please give me the option to abstain from the alcohol ones.

Edit: I'm glad I'm not alone, and apparently not by a long shot.

Edit 2: For the record, I *do* have a Spotify Premium account for myself. However, the ads happen while I'm at work, and for reasons explained below I will ***not*** make a fuss about it.

I'm also floored by the amount of people offering to help me; both in the comments, and in my DMs. I'm sorry that I can't respond to you all, but I'm thankful all the same. If you're an addict reading this and struggling right now and think your totally alone, these people are proof you're not.

Edit 3: LOL, not everyone is happy with this:  "Lol how weak do you have to be to get affected by an ad? You alcoholic piece of shit" - u/Godliketing *in my DM's*  If you wake up hot it's so uncomfortable and you're all sweaty. When you wake up cold you feel fresher. It's horrible waking up with the radiators on max coverd in blankets.

Edit: Thankyou kind stranger for the silver :)

2nd Edit: :0 A gold. Thankyou!I just think it’s stupid that there are shows specifically for singing and yet on a talent show, a singer with a sob story will win almost every time when there are much cooler acts out there.

Singing acts should just go audition for an actual singing show and let the interesting acts compete without having the interruption of “oh look this 15 year old girl had all her family killed in a fire and she can sing let’s have her win”It's not your responsibility if your partner decides to do that, you have no business in that. They are trying to manipulate you into getting back to the same hell you were before but why would you like to come back? Would you like to be with the same cheating woman again? Or with a guy who beats you up everyday? Just because you feel guilty? No my friend don't do it. Cut all communication with them as soon as you cross the door.I almost immediately lose respect for someone every time I see them say this in a post. What kind of world would we live in without people having differing opinions? If you can only live in your own little think tank, and you’re too fragile to hear the other side, then how can you possibly expect the other side to listen and value your opinion? It’s extremely hypocritical.

I live in a household with people on both sides of the political spectrum, and I wouldn’t have it any other way because it improves my critical thinking skills. I don’t even know if this is an actual unpopular opinion, but it seems to be based on the microcosm that is my social media.

Edit: To all the people saying they would obviously unfollow or block “white supremacists”, obviously I’m not talking about anyone who outwardly says that they wish harm to or hate another race? All I’m saying is that people who make posts with common viewpoints (such as racism is bad) those people are pious, pretentious, and narrow minded. Its also ignorant to write off anyone who disagrees with any viewpoint as racist.

Edit: In the current political climate, I haven’t seen a single person anywhere say that police is brutality is good, that any race should be mistreated, or that they are against peaceful protesting. I believe that an open discourse is a better channel tor people to better understand your fellow human.

Final Edit: I’m really surprised about how many comments disagree with this. It kind of makes me sad. I read through just about every comment and I’m also surprised at how many of you have lost friends to this. 

With that being said, if any of you disagree with this post, please unfriend me.-Loosely connected stories
wooww guys check it out guy from other movie shows up and dances how deep and layered

-Crap humour
self explanatory

-Very little character development
Drax is a joke, tony took a lil sip of alcohol in IM2 and then is forgotten, civil war had no repercussions except ant man is stuck in his house haha so silly, etc

-forgettable music
you cannot name 1 song other than the avengers theme

Etc. These movies are fellated to hell and back despite being shallow and and forgettable. You watch them once and thats all there is to them. There is 0 detail to go back to its all as deep as a puddle and yet their rabid fanbase loves to pretend its Shakespeare and how you need a high IQ to understand them. PatheticUpdate two weeks later: Multiple new accounts keep posting discord links to what I assume is porn. On my post about being a recovering porn addict. What is wrong with people? 

I'll start off by saying that I'm a recovering porn addict, so maybe I'm a little more sensitive to this than most guys. 

And I'll say now that AFAIK I have never visited a sub on this account that is for porn or posting nudes or even lewds. I have never commented or so much as left an up or downvote on any of those subs. 

But I still end up with (so far only) female nsfw content creators following me on here for no other reason than to get me to look at their profile. 

When I click the notification I am immediately taken to their page with a feed full of their porn, I did not consent to see their porn and it's incredibly triggering for me. 

It hasn't caused a relapse so far, I'm 149 days clean today and I'm not about to throw it away. But it just gives me urges that are really fucking fatiguing to deal with and that I didn't need. 

I fully support sex work as real work, and have nothing against creators that don't send unsolicited links to their porn. 

This feels like another example of "men always want it", and it's really harmful.

Edit: all I am doing in order to have this material appear on my screen is to thing "oh cool I wonder who's followed me" and click on the notification, and it's right there. The nsfw filter does not work on brand new accounts who have only posted to their page. 

It's not OK to do this to anyone, but it's very clear with a glance at my post history than I'm a recovering addict and you probably shouldn't be linking me to their porn. Further more, if we assume that they dont check, they probably do this to minors too, without realising of course.While often high-school relationships don’t last long, it is not an unbreakable rule. Some relationships which start between two teenagers last longer than anyone would expect. Those relationships can also be more mature than relationships of people in their 30s. Not one relationship is the same as the other. Everyone is different and each relationship is unique. No one can know how it will work out or what goes on in the relationship. You can be 60 year old with 300 past relationships and tons of experience, but you are still in no place to judge whether the relationship is going to last or not. You can’t know, regardless of your age or number of relationships you’ve been in. 

There is a certain pattern and yes, teen relationships don’t on average last long. However, I am sick people telling teens that their relationship is not going to last. It’s simply something you don’t tell. It is rude. But older people usually think they have a right to comment on teen relationships and tell them about the outcome or assume they know anything about what’s going on between two people. Let me tell you, in most cases you don’t, because as I said, no matter how much experience you have, each relationship is unique regardless of the age of the partners. 

Any relationship, no matter partner’s age can work out or not work out and no one can possibly know.Short of them cheating on you or something similar that is a huge breach of your relationship, no one has the right to force someone else out of their own bed. It’s just as much theirs as it is yours. If you’re too pissed at them to sleep in the same bed then that’s on you and you should go to the couch.

This goes for guys too, but I’ve never heard a guy say he’s gonna make his wife sleep on the couch because he’s upset with her. I’ve heard it multiple times from women both in real life and on tv.

Edit: I really appreciate everyone’s concern, but I’m fortunately not posting from the couch. The issue was between two friends in a relationship and my wife and I both thought it was terrible.

Also, from reading the comments I think I was wrong about it usually being women who kick the dude out. It seems like there are just as many bitch dudes who try to pull this and you women deserve better.Advice-Reddit is filled with people being up in arms about how their SOs masturbate. Men who don’t want women to use dildos or vibrators; women who don’t want men to watch porn (or some specific kind of porn); people of all genders who feel somehow rejected or even cheated on when their partner masturbates.

When someone wants to control what their SO wears or their hobbies or social life, everyone is quick to proclaim how controlling, boundary-trampling, and potentially abusive this behavior is. But when it comes to people laying out rules for how/if their SO can masturbate, somehow this is treated as a normal and okay thing for a partner to have control over.

This is NOT normal or okay. 

Your insecurities about your SO masturbating are not your SO’s problem. 

Being in a monogamous sexual relationship doesn’t grant you dominion over the other person’s body and mind. 

People get to think and fantasize about whatever tf they want, watch whatever tf kind of porn they want, and masturbate however and with whatever tf kind of toys they want. Trying to police that because you are insecure is totally inappropriate and controlling behavior. You should neither do this to a partner nor tolerate a partner doing it to you. 

Exceptions where it’s okay for a partner to make requests / impose their opinions:
- Excessive masturbation/porn addiction negatively impacts the couple’s sex life
- Matters of basic courtesy (e.g., don’t leave porn out on the computer; don’t do it in the bed next to me, etc.)
- When it involves interactions with real people (e.g., virtual sex workers or sexting with internet strangers)
- Obviously if it involves anything dangerous or illegal (e.g., public masturbation or self-asphyxiation).Title pretty much covers it. Truckers are often easy to complain about. Some of them are terrible drivers and disgusting people, but just like society, you get the good and bad equally. 

During this outbreak there will be folks working 16-18 hours so that everyone can get necessities to survive this. However, there will be little to no recognition for what we do/did in this pandemic. First and foremost the medical field deserves the top spot of recognition. Hands down. The next most appreciated that I've seen has been those that work in the grocery stores and public markets. While I don't fully agree they are in as much risk now, with a lot of companies restructuring to minimize their risk, I'll concede that, due to dealing with the crazies and the Karen's, they should be given their recognition. Beyond that, first responders and emergency personnel, companies taking care of their employees, governments response to the pandemic, financial relief, easing of burdens in this crazy time. 


Oh... and truckers can work more in the industries we need. I haven't seen a thanks, a nod, even a smile for what we are doing for you. No thought that this pandemic has put an even bigger strain on an already burdened industry. No concept that our work has doubled an already overburdened infrastructure. No nod for those delivering the goods the hospitals and markets need to continue operate. Just an expectation that we'll handle it. An ignorance to the key role of distribution put on the industry to keep things running. Without half of us everything will collapse. So thank a trucker, be patient, and for the love of God be respectful.Dig into your brain and think of something, anything, to talk about that doesn’t revolve around work culture! I get that a minuscule amount of people have their dream job or managed to turn their hobbies into profitable means of employment, but the vast majority of the working class are not in that same boat! Stop immediately asking people what they do for a living when you meet them.”oh but I’m just trying to find something to relate to them on”
Nope you’re just a shit conversationalist or subconsciously trying to figure out how much respect you want to give a person after determining their space in society based off their career.

Edit: some of y’all need hobbies and a work/life balance. What would you do all day if you didn’t have to go to work? If you had all the time and money in the world, what would you pursue? I would much rather have someone ask me “what are your interests?” Than “what do you do for a living?” And that way if people’s interests truly do align with their career, they can talk about it. But otherwise they have the option to discuss the hobbies or activities they enjoy!

Edit 2: yes, I have had jobs I truly loved. Guess what? I still didn’t care to talk about them off the clock!I feel like God is a personal choice, whereas religion is something enforced on you either by your parents, the people you grew around with, or something else.

The problem is that religion is made by humans, whereas God is a central idea.

You can believe in Jesus Christ, and not take part in any religious activities.

You can believe in Allah, and not take part in Ramadan.

All the ideas from religion that are brought into culture come from humans themselves. If you truly believe in a God, then it should be alright for you to worship them without following any of the so called 'customs' a religion offers.

For instance, if you are a worshipper of Allah, you should not get mad when someone doesn't do the fast, nor should you be able to question their morals.Inspired by reading through this AskReddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/

Many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. Some of them I read and think, "I could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way."

Personally, I have an experience I think about often. A coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. When it came time to go to bed, I asked where I should sleep and she said "Well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me."

I elected for the bed.

However I wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so I didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. To this day I still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

My opinion: is it really "missed hints," or is it "fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?"Not a single dish has been made better by adding raisins to it. Yet I have seen raisins in carrot cake, rice puddling, coleslaw, cinnamon bagels etc.. 

Raisins are disgusting and every recipe they touch is destroyed. I can't think of a single dish with them that would be worse without them. Tbh getting rid of them might improve things.

People seriously need to top putting these grape corpses into otherwise good foods.The thing about marijuana is not that it's physically harmful. It's mentally and emotionally harmful. It encourages you to use it habitually. It might not be physically addicting but it's certainly highly psychologically addicting. How many people do you know who use marijuana casually? The problem is that people abuse it frequently, and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives, or they use it to cope with something else they're not willing to confront.

For me, I used weed as an excuse to not participate in society. Rather than see my friends I would just get stoned and turn off my phone. I wouldn't talk to anyone or go out. I was afraid to go out so I used weed as an excuse not to.

This caused me to have low self esteem. I thought of myself as a loser pothead - because I was. I think many potheads feel this way, but they would never admit it to anyone else.

But once I finally decided to drop it once and for all, my life has improved so drastically. I felt like a human again, like a member of society. And I realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway. It turned me into a stupid person. I'm not stupid.

I think the damage that marijuana does is complex, but significant. I think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a "safe" drug is extremely dangerous.

To quote the great and wise Randy Marsh:

>Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at *anything*.

edit: This thread really blew up so I would add on: if you feel you're in a similar situation to mine, my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities, skills, and talents. When I quit I focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy. I realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness I got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that I got from marijuana. I'm now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year.

A lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same. My question is: why use this drug at all? What does it help you with? And for whatever problem it is, is there another, more organic way you could solve this problem? For example if you have anxiety, maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure.

If you feel the need to get high every day, ask yourself: Do I enjoy life without this drug? And if not, try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it.It’s awkward when you’re trying to workout and have someone around you who is filming their own workouts and you’re trying to stay out of the picture. I feel like filming should only be used in a private settings or in a completely empty part of the gym. I’ve also seen people set their cameras up on a machine while working out on another, taking up 2 machines for your dumb workout videos which is annoying afMost teenagers these days understand they aren’t gonna be together forever and get married and shit. If they ask for advice and you tell them it doesn’t matter because they’re young you’re a prick. They deserve to be happy and they don’t doing anything harmfull.

Edit: I did not expect this to blow up so much, thank you kind stranger for the gold!

Edit 2: I know my original explanation is somewhat short so I’d like to clarify, teens need experience in order to have healthy relationships later in life. It’s an important part of growing up.Its crazy how many things people will call abuse nowadays. I was told I was "abusing" a girl because I told her she needs to study harder for a test, like wtf is that. This is detrimental to actual abuse victims, as in real sexual/verbal/physical abuse. No your mom taking your phone is not abuse. No your boyfriend not paying for your pizza is not abuse. No getting whistled on the street is not abuse. People have forgotten the difference between unwanted/annoying and abusive.As a former zookeeper, I have the opposite opinion: children under 6 should not be allowed in zoos for the sake of the animals.

Modern zoos (as opposed to the popular opinion) are meant for and aimed for conservation, research and education, and operate an the basis of "animal welfare before guests' ".

Young kids don't really understand what they are seeing and the importance of it, and they constantly bang on glasses, disturb and feed the animals, and cause a myriad of problems. 

If you go to the zoo to "see the funny monkey", you should watch youtube videos, not go to the zoo. The animal's enclosure is its home, and you wouldn't want people banging at your windows because you're "boring" or "don't move enough".Schools, in my area at least, have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness and becoming more strict on how and when those days are used. This is to encourage "perfect attendance" and it is harmful to the child in more than one way. 

1. The child is pressured into attending school even when sick, further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors. This can lead to a number of complications for the child, both short and long term, from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection, to the development of autoimmune disorders. If the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill, then they will be better off in both regards.
2. The child is being conditioned to work ill. The future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has. From a young age, American children are taught they must suck it up and work through it. Studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave, not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced. Workers can afford to stay home when they are sick. Our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary. By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to "shaking it off."
3. The financial burden that is placed on a family because of policy change requiring doctors notes when insurance is not widely affordable, nor is a visit to a local doctor exactly cheap. A same-day visit to a local urgent care can easily run two hundred to three hundred dollars. This is also coupled with the hit already being taken by a parent that is missing work and may or may not have paid leave to do so. If a note is not returned to the school from a local doctor, at the very least the absence is unexcused and counts against the child, affecting everything from grades to driver licenses. In more strict counties and municipalities, a child can be counted truant without the doctor's note. Policies like these are ill-guided and do not produce the results desired. They impact grades and performance in a negative manner and hurt the morale of both parent and student.

Unfortunately, in today's world, schools influence our children more than we can ever realize. They shape much of their rationale and critical thinking skills that will follow them for the rest of their lives. As parents, it is up to each of us, to be active in trying to shape the policy that governs the school system.Sometimes I'm walking by a playground and I get the urge to go down the slide or hang on the monkey bars, but I can't because I don't have any kids and it would look really strange to see a grown man at the playground by himself. It would be really cool if there were playgrounds just for adults so we can do all the fun things we did as kids. Also, all the playground equipment could be made larger so people know it's just for adults and maybe booze could be served.It's unfortunate to see so many people being laid off in the face of Corona. But its good to see that Disney is actually hurting. And they've lost a number of Disney Plus subscribers. 

Unfortunately Disney has been given a pass by a lot of people simply because of how happy it makes them. Disney has suffered qualitatively over the years and now relies on its acquisitions; Hulu, Marvel, Star Wars et al. to keep it afloat and relevant. Their business model is horribly outdated and they treat their employees like trash, but somehkw they're still a multi billion dollar corporation. 

I really despise the company because of the unrealistic expectations it places on young girls about romance. The repetitive one-parent, chosen one storylines. It's eerie how brain washed people are buying overpriced merchandise they don't need and the fact that if you criticize the company you're seen as abberant. 

All that said, meh. Its a company and there are bigger problems.
Y'all have a safe week. ❤

FINAL POST: Ha, wow this exploded and everyone including myself is really salty. I'm going to delete my account now though. Too much important shit to do in life. 

But everyone please have a fantastic day and take care of yourselves. Cheers! 🥰No, this isn't another 'haha Marvel is shit, guys, look, I said Marvel is shit, I'm really counter-culture, please give me upvotes' post. I enjoy Marvel movies.  
  
But, the amount of Marvel fans that I see, both on Reddit and elsewhere, who circlejerk about the amazing 'cinematography' of Marvel films, and then proceed to show the same 4 colourful stills from Guardians or Endgame, is ***exhausting***, especially as a Marvel fan myself. 
 
Listen, pretty sparkly rainbow pictures don't automatically make a film artful, or cinematically significant. This is *especially* true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times.
 
The reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all Marvel films are shot in the same cookie-cutter manner. The framing is acceptable, the symbolism of shots is very, **VERY** heavy-handed at *BEST* - oh my god guyz, look, the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them!!!! woaah!!!! good symbolism guyz!!!! - and a good 99% of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell. Marvel's movies are fun action flicks, and that's totally fine, but I see so many people trying to peg each new MCU film as a visionary piece of cinematic art, and they really just aren't.

 
It's annoying, because it's not even like the superhero format invalidates a film as a medium for art. Like, look at Into the Spiderverse. That movie is absolutely pornographic. So is The Dark Knight. So is Man of Steel, arguably. So is Joker. But Marvel movies? Sure, they're good films, **but people need to stop pretending like the MCU is artistically significant or visually exceptional, because none of it is.** In my opinion, anyways.
 
This is coming from someone who *likes* Marvel films and grew up with/watched the *entire* MCU. It's the grilled cheese of cinema - it's cheap, it's fun, it's easy, it's simple. But don't try to pretend that it's caviar, because it just isn't.A. They will be too young to remember their experience. 
B. They will most likely be too short to ride everything. 
It just seems like a waste of money and time if your kids can’t fully participate in everything that’s included in your stay and they’re not going to remember majority of it! So many parents enter these parks like they are staying for a week because of strollers, diaper bags, toys, etc. It just seems so stressful and exhausting. Not a vacation for them either. I feel lucky my parents waited until I was a teenager to go to these places because I appreciated it a lot more.I see some posts about people grinding to make it as rappers but it honestly seems like the less you try to “force” it the better your chances will be. It honestly comes down to if you have the right image for the time and if you got the talent to go with it that’s a bonus. There are lots of famous rappers who do have talent, but to me they’re not the same kind of famous as the ones who blow up in mainstream media and are stars.A lot of the body positivity/body acceptance/high self esteem movement focuses on how you look. Phrases like “every body is beautiful” and “still hot despite X” are kind but misses the point for me. 

I’d rather the movements be focused less on validating that everyone is “pretty” and more on focusing on the ways you’re awesome period. Not awesome “despite” how you look, but just awesome. 

I’m not a California dime, and hey I get that. But I’m pretty damn valuable regardless. I’m reasonably smart and very driven. I enjoy my dry sense of humor (and I hope others do too). Obviously there’s other things, but the point is that I hate it when people start doing the “nooo stop it you’re beautiful” kinda speech. They want to assure me that I’m pretty, but all I’m trying to say is that not being beautiful isn’t a problem to begin with. 

Let’s focus on who we are as a whole. I get that “beautiful” can mean more than just how you look and there’s a huge difference between saying “everybody is beautiful” and “every body is beautiful.” Nevertheless, beauty typically takes the context of looks more than soul and I think the message ends up becoming about liking how you look vice liking who you are.This recently happened to a cousin, he was lied to by his girlfriend about being on birth control, and she got pregnant and kept it against his will. Why should he have to pay if he never wanted the child, and was tricked into the baby. This includes lying about birth control, poking holes in condoms, etc.Whether it's a medical, legal, or any other success, it wasn't God that did it. It was researchers, doctors, and highly specialized lawyers that made it happen.  No doubt, you and your family are enormously grateful and relieved that you or they were cured or got justice. But God didn't bring that lawyer into your path--the lawyer did, by committing to the practice of law.I recently came across someone making fun of a neckbeards actual beard. I then clicked on their profile only to find them showing off their pit hair and talking about how it breaks society and patriarchy and that it's just natural hair and we shouldn't demonize women's hair. That's fine, I really don't care. But then you can't turn around and make fun of a neckbeard or say someone has a pube beard or whatever. I mean you can, but it's a bad faith argument, hypocritical, and ultimately it wouldn't stand up if you were trying to support your opinions in a phispophical debate of sorts.Whenever I take a shower in the morning, I have to stand under it and just turn it on. That way, you’re slammed by the freezing water and it jumps you awake and then it slowly warms up and you can enjoy the hot water even more.

Edit: for all those asking, it’s about -6C when I wake up in the morning.

Second edit: To everyone giving me gold, don’t fucking do that. Spend it on something worth it, not my shitty shower habits.A model who has a ton of work done is increasing their job opportunities compared to if they were natural.

PED’s increase an athlete’s prowess and increasing stats they might not get if they were fully natural.I was à German living in England for 7 years. Loved it. But whenever I had a an argument with people about politics or whatever people would "win" the argument simply because they delivered better than I did.

Me arguing in a foreign language obviously makes it much harder for me to get my point across. But even in my own language I struggle to explain well. However I don't think just because I don't talk well or don't use difficult words or studder here and there should ever take away from the argument I'm making. If people weren't so obsessed with showing off how clever they are they would let their counterpart finish what they have to say and listen  instead of seeing their insecurities or shortcomings as an apportunity to make them look stupid or overpower them and "win" the argument.

I mean what does that even mean "win" an argument. The point is to get to a consensus and not imposing your viewpoint.

If you talk to Somebody and they don't express themselves as nicely as you do, be the bigger person and let them talk and try and make their point. Your argument should rest only on the content and not on the delivery. And if you find that you can't win arguments if you don't use the trick of being super eloquent, maybe take it as an opportunity to learn and don't see it as defeat.As an outside observer of the USA I can assure you that a female candidate won't solve any problems. Across the common wealth, female leaders have produced mixed results, Theresa  May did not last long and was seemingly ineffective, while Margaret Thatcher crushed many a common worker over seeing economic reform that hurts many to this day. 

New Zealand has had a mixed bag, with Jenny Shipley being largely ineffective at everything a side from a knife in the back. Helen Clark a female leader led the average New Zealand family to economic dependency on the government, and has a mixed time as a leader economically. Jacinda Ardern has been fantastic as a face, but also has been a lot weaker on many policy issues than the media would have you know. 

Ultimately the problem lies beyond the leader, good, bad or incompetent, rather the problem is the system we love in where the interests of corporations and businesses are put a head of that of workers and individuals.Suing a company because their firearm was used in a shooting makes 0 sense. 

If someone gets murdered with a hammer are you going to sue the hammer company because their hammer was used to kill somebody ?  (hammer murders are actually common apparently) 

If someone drinks and drives and kills someone are you going to sue the alcohol company ? Or the maker of the car ?  

You can't help what some crazy person does. And everyone else shouldn't be punished for someone else's wrong doing. 

If I sell someone a pen and then they turn around and stab someone to death with that pen , am I at fault ?  

Do forks make people fat ? 

Do pencils misspell words ? 

No they don't.  So the company that makes said forks and pencils shouldn't be punished for it ,  nor should everyone else be prevented from owning those "forks" and "pencils" because someone else mis-uses them. 

EDIT : thanks for the silver and gold strangers.  Didn't expect this to go front page ,  I would have elaborated and typed it better if I knew that lol. Before I begin I want to explain why I believe this is unpopular: pop and rap music are so much more popular than metal just by looking at monthly listeners on Spotify. Pop artists and rappers can have up to 50 million monthly listeners meanwhile the biggest metal band in history has 16 million (which is still a lot obviously but in defense of my point, they hardly ever feature screaming in their music)

Ok with that out of the way, every time I see people hating on rock and metal, about 99% of people’s complaints are “they’re just screaming, it takes no talent, anyone can do it” which is just plain false. People who can do that shit with their voice are extremely talented, and the people who can do that at a live concert for up to like 2 hours straight are even more talented. It takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do it properly and many vocalists have to work their asses off for YEARS to learn to do it well enough to be in a band. 

I dare you right now to try to scream like they do in metal. Do either a really high deathcore scream or a really low death metal growl. Yeah sure you can try but I’d be willing to be all my money if you just tried for the first time, it sounds nothing like it does in the music. 

There’s a video on YouTube where a guy goes in public and asks a bunch of random people to “give him their best metal scream”. About 95% of people can’t do it. But when someone CAN do it, he then asks them how long they’ve been doing vocals, and the answer is always the same. Years. Many years.

TL:DR it seems to be a common conception that metal screaming doesn’t take talent however in reality it takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do properly.Assuming it's a hookup with someone you don't know well enough to be sure of their sexual health, this would encourage more people to actually get themselves tested and identified, reduce the amount of people feigning ignorance of their conditions to hook up, and overall have a positive effect on public health. Someone doesn't cough up the papers? Probably should pass on em.

&#x200B;

I get that it'd kinda kill the mood to ask the hot chick or guy for papers, but that's preferable to waking up with some kind of rash and burning sensation, right?

I've talked about it before with someone and they said it'd be an invasion of privacy but.. if you're trying to invade the privacy of someone's genitals you damn well better be safe.Literally, the same argument. You kill people on the streets in GTA, they you want to do it in real life. You see rape in porn, you go raping other people.

Even though there are tons of people who play GTA without committing mass shootings. As well as there are tons of BDSM fans who don't force people to have sex with them.

18+ people are capable of telling apart reality and fiction, and if they can't, they belong in an asylum. And our laws shouldn't be based on an assumption that citizens are incapable.

&#x200B;

EDIT: PLEASE stop mentioning that "porn is real and games are not". Most people who blame sexual assault on porn also are against Hentai and they think it promotes pedophilia. Well, Hentai isn't real. It's animated cartoons about tentacle sex monsters.

EDIT2: Okay, games aren't 'real people'. But there's violence in movies, with real actors and graphic gore scenes. Some people label sassy, brutally honest, edgy characters “queen” but honestly, most of those characters are jerks and straight up annoying. I tried imagining what they would be like in the real world and they have such a dislikable aura to them it’s scary.The idea that a fully grown adult completely refuses to incorporate fruit or vegetables into their diet is quite pathetic.   
It's the attitude I'd expect from a young child.You can't see everything the first time it

feeling reddit is going to shoot this down immediately. RIP meThink about it, everyone’s sex lives would benefit if no one faked pleasure during sex. It is seriously stupid that some people fake an orgasm and then bitch about that person later on when they’re completely oblivious and think they nailed it.

This goes for every relationship, one night stands, marriages and first times. Thinking you can pleasure someone effectively and then finding out you can’t is a huge blow to anyone.Posting an opinion that the majority of a sub would agree with doesn’t make you right. You pander to a group of people with your same ideologies, daring anyone to disagree knowing nobody will. It’s the ultimate form of karma whoring. Number of upvotes don’t matter and doesn’t validate what you say. And with the, the number of downvotes you get also doesn’t say you’re always in the wrong. Depends on the sub, depends on the people.All these "power mods" that moderate multiple big communities do so because they don't have a life. Removing posts and comments they don't agree with is all they have going for them. I just feel bad that nobody loves them so they have to come here and gain some fake sense of authority by silencing people that don't live in their mother's basement.Edit: Got a message saying I had to add more to the post, so here it is:

I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/NotTheOnion, r/TIFU, r/ELI5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. The admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda. For those who may be confused by the title, I live in the UK and as part of our countries social security there is a benefits system in place which essentially allows people who do not have jobs or any form of income to receive money from the government to get by, and do not have to pay taxes. and all of this money comes from taxes payed by everyone else in the country. 

Whilst I don’t have a huge issue with this system, I’m not particularly all for it, but I feel that there need to be stricter rules on what people receiving benefits can do with the money they get given. If I am paying tax, and my government is using some of my tax money to give to people who do not have their own source of income, I accept that that money is given to them for them to spend on basic necessities such as food and rent and such, and to keep them on their feet until they are able to find themselves a job and begin making their own money. I do not agree with this money being given to them only for them to spend it on things such as alcohol or cigarettes, because it does not help their situation, and encourages them to not seek work and fuel their addictions. 

Call me insensitive to their situation, but it’s simply not fair on actual taxpayers who are paying for these peoples livelyhoods for the money they are paying to go to pointless substances such as alcohol etc. when it is supposed to just keep them on their feet until they are able to support themselvesI don’t really know if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but I fucking hate when it happens. I’m watching a tv series right now on Netflix, and out of nowhere it becomes a musical episode. Fuck this shit. I guess it’s a sign to go asleep. Goodnight reddit.Alright so this is mostly elementary school focused, but it also applies to high schools. Essentially reading is great for everyone, so many benefits, but the education system discourages developing a healthy relationship with reading. If you’re not reading what your teachers want, you aren’t allowed. School doesn’t give you time to read, and systems such as AR points get rid of the intrinsic value of reading, and cause binge reading to be encourage instead of allowing you to read just enough each day. All grade levels should be given independent reading time each day, and students should be able to read what ever they want within reason. Obviously they’re has to be some content restrictions, but if a kid would rather read a self help book instead of the great gatsby, let them!It is not OK to be fat. It is a physical marker that shows weakness of character and lack of discipline. It literally kills you, and makes you look worse until you do. I am fat and I was in denial about it. People did not tell me how bad it was, maybe out of misplaced kindness, but it took me far too long to realize that I had let myself go, and now the change is harder. It is NOT OK to be fat, and society should actively let people know this.'family' doesn't mean you get anything unconditionally, I hate people who use that to get what they want or to just be a twat

Being related doesn't mean you can get away with whatever you want and not expect backlash

edit: thanks for the platinum broskiSocial media gets you high in 2 ways:

**1) you are liked and noticed by other people**

**2) you get to judge others constantly, and decide if you approve or disapprove of them and what they say**

These used to be things people had to work for. Social media lets you get them instantly, constantly. 

The social media companies have been completely unregulated. The effect of social media on our brains has not been investigated. It's been allowed to creep into every aspect of our lives: work, education, family, friendships, the media, and even the government: all of these now operate through social media.

I don't need a peer-reviewed, double-blind clinical trial to tell you the effect social media has on the brain:

**1) Trying to be liked and noticed online puts you in the habit of always being what others want you to be.** 

**2) Fear of being judged by others publicly puts you in the habit of avoiding being what you think others don't want you to be.**

**3) Making constant judgments of others - reducing all opinion to "like/dislike" - puts the brain in the habit of polarizing ALL issues.**

This is based in the science of behavior and addiction. 

As social media has dominated more aspects of our lives, our behavior has become more and more warped by it. This is happening to almost EVERYONE, all over the world. It's been happening to me. It's probably happening to you.

If you don't believe it's happening to you, try downloading your facebook or twitter or reddit history (whatever goes back ten-twelve  years or so). Try reading your posts, from as far back as they go. I did this, and noticed my own facebook posts changed dramatically in 2013. I had always made fun of people who only talked about politics online -  I used to post poetry I'd write, books I'd read, interesting thoughts I had, random stuff that happened to me that day. But suddenly in 2013, ALL my posts became about political issues I'd never cared about before. I remember spending hours typing angrily, being satisfied when I got likes, being upset when I didn't, feeling like nobody should disagree with me. It made me a more paranoid and judgmental person. It had nothing to do with my own personality or interests - it all had to do with what I thought I was *supposed* to be posting about. I stopped being myself.

You want to know why the country is so polarized? Because over the past decade or so, we have all been groomed into illogical, unnatural, dysfunctional patterns of seeing the world: 

We only like a thing, or dislike it. Nothing in between.

So why are we surprised when people start viewing politics through the same binary filter? Especially when our politicians are all on social media and we literally get to publicly display our approval and disapproval of them?Kinks and fetishes are just a lil too personal to be brought into pride in my opinion. I mean yes, it's a part of your sexuality but I think it's something that should be left in the bedroom. Pride has become WAYYY too sexualized, and frankly it's just not cool. Particularly for all the youths who participate in pride too. If I were a parent I would not want my child to be exposed to people blatantly flaunting what exactly they do with their partners in the bedroom. 

(Disclaimer: I, myself am pan and totally support pride and people being themselves)

Edit:

I feel like I need to make this edit so people understand what I mean when I say I'm against kink at pride. What I think is acceptable is waving your fetish flag and wearing something that is related to your kink but is still family friendly, what I think is NOT ok is people running around almost completely naked while sucking on dildos and whipping each other's asses. Children should have a healthy understanding of sex and sexuality, but exposing them to THAT is not the way to go about it.

Edit 2: since someone asked that I clarify, I've never been to a pride event, but I do often watch pride marches on the internetTitle says it all. I keep seeing posts on Reddit that start with that sentence and it just makes me roll my eyes back. It feels like such a cry for attention and validation. If you post something you’re proud of on Reddit, just post it and explain to us why it’s important to you. Starting with “you probably won’t care” just makes me lose all of the potential attention I would have given to your post because it feels like you are guilting me into liking your story, and I end up just ignoring it no matter how touching the story is. Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is. 

Just something I had to get off my chest, thanks. 

Cooking really is just common sense. I'm not talking about making a 5 Michelin stars tiramisu but people who can't even cook themself basic meals like spaghetti or meat and veggies must suffer from a serious lack of brain cellsThe DNA test says the connection is anywhere from 6-10 generations back, meaning she's anywhere from 1/64th to 1/1024th Native American.

This is like, maximum, 1% Native American.

Yet, the top posts in news, worldnews, politics, bestof  etc., are all acting as if this proves she is Native American.

This is absolutely insane.  

I want to take a DNA test, and I hope I am one of those people who have about 1% neanderthal DNA, because if I do, I am going to claim to be  neanderthal, which should get me some massive minority points, since we are extinct.There are people with some pretty dark kinks out there that have no outlet. I do not believe in an afterlife. Even if there were, I would doubt the physical body would matter. 

So have at me. Necrophilia? Sure. But more than that. Cut open my wounds. Shit in them. See if drinking my blood can give you powers. I don't care. 

These are people with fetishes so extreme that they either must suffer in silence or do something that would (rightly) land them in jail. Let me be your human Play-Doh. All I ask is that you do not share your work with others who may be traumatized by it (children, my loved ones).

Now, some would say, if you don't want a casket or cremation, you can always donate your body to science. I'm sure there are plenty of people who already do that. I am an organ donor, so sure let others have parts of my body that can save their life.

But after that? Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.I hate going to the womens section and seeing generic graphic tees with words like "love" written in cursive or covered in hearts , butterflies , roses or some generic ass quote like " I am sassy " why can't we have dope designs like the men's ones :// , with memes or tv show/movie references or even dope ass characters or just intricate and cool  designs. I know I sound whiny and I can literally just shop anywhere else but sorry just had to let this one out.Just to preface, my dad's entire side of the family is Jewish. I fully understand the persecution and troubles that have faced the Jewish people for thousands of years. Despite this, I do not fully support the state of Israel.

This is not to say that I agree or disagree with the nation's founding, as I am not an expert on the matter and I do not claim to be. Additionally, I recognize that during Israel's short existence, they have been attacked relentlessly from basically all sides. However, the way the country has treated Palestinians is entirely unacceptable. Innocent people are killed each and every day by Israeli forces as if it is nothing. Furthermore, the growing sense of nationalism around the world is alarmingly seen in Israel, as they are a wealthy and powerful nation, especially when compared to those around them. 

Ultimately, I feel as if religious states do not really work, and in no way am I excusing the wrongs that have been directed towards the Jewish people over many millennia. They will always lead to conflict among opposing sides, as it simply creates one more thing to argue about. However, the reality is that religious states do exist. I am not against a religious state for the Jewish people if there are to be nations represented by other religions. However, I find the way it is run to be overtly nationalistic and threatening, and I do not think that this view makes me anti-semetic.Edit: disclaimer: in this post I use this really rare and undiscovered thing called dramatic effect, in which I over exaggerate certain words and moods to create a more dramatic affect. So, to clarify, no this does not actually make my blood broil. It mildly annoys me for a brief period of time then I forget about it and move on from it. 

Every time I hear someone say they “can’t cook” it makes my blood broil. It’s not hard, just follow the fucking recipe. You didn’t fuck up your dessert because you can’t cook, you fucked it up because you decided to skip salt because “desserts should be sweet and not salty.” You fucked up your cookies because instead of leaving them in the oven for 30 minutes at 250, you decided to put them in there for 500 for 15 minutes to speed up the process. 

If you would just follow the recipe then the food will turn out fine. Will it be the best? No. Will it taste like your grandmas cooking? Of course not. But it will still be good. I understand that some people are naturally gifted and others aren’t, but if you’re not naturally gifted then stop trying to add ten goddamn seasonings because you think they sound cool and just add salt and pepper. 

Nobody is “bad” at cooking, they just refuse to follow the directions. 9/10 times the reason these people mess up their food is because they decided to do things their way and completely ruined everything. So no, you’re not bad at cooking, you just refuse to follow the detailed instructions left by whoever wrote the recipe.

Edit: When I say this, I’m talking about people who can cook but just don’t want to/ refuse to. If you’d rather eat out every night that’s fine, go ahead, but don’t tell me the reason you eat McDonalds every night instead of cooking something at home is because “you can’t cook.”

Edit 2: A lot of people are saying it depends on the recipe or they are too lazy so I’m going to address both right here. 

1. Of course the recipe has an effect on the dish. However if you know you aren’t the best chef then don’t go and try to make a recipe that has 27 steps and takes 3 days to prepare. That’s just common sense. I thought that staying in your skill range was implied, but since many people missed the point I’ll state it here. 

2. If you’re too lazy to cook that doesn’t mean you can’t cook. I don’t like cooking every night so my brother does the cooking most of the time. Does that mean that I can’t cook? No, because whenever I step into the kitchen with the intent to make something 9/10 times it turns out pretty good. Being too lazy to do something and not being able to do something are too different things entirely.If you genuinely can’t function in the morning until you’ve downed three cups of coffee, there’s something wrong with you. People put “don’t talk to me until I’ve had my coffee” on their cups, as if having total dependency on a drug is quirky and cute.It’s so simple. Just shove it down your mouth and bite it and you won’t choke. 

If you bite Pringle’s into smaller pieces you don’t deserve to eat them at all. 

Just shove it down your throat dammit 

(For everyone crying about only doing one I don’t only do one lmao I do more than one at a time!!!!)

Edit: if this makes it to the trending page please tell me!

I call copyright on my words so many times when I say the word dude in reference to a girl they’ll go on with “I’m not a dude I’m a girl” I don’t care the word dude is gender neutral, I’m going to keep saying it dude

Edit to clarify; I’m mostly referring to the second personI am so fucking sick and tired of being shamed because I'm not currently having sex with a female partner. It does not make me a fucking loser, or a weirdo just because I'm in my early 20's without a girlfriend. My friends constantly do one night stands, while I just kind of sit back and enjoy being around people. I do not want to have sex with strangers. There is NOTHING wrong with this, and the fact that people actually virgin-shame or celebate-shame now is ridiculous. Fuck you if you do this and let people live their own life. There's no such thing as "being cool" or "being a loser" when you're out of HIGH SCHOOL. **Some of you need to act your fucking age and take the head out of your asses.**

Edit: Post blew up, thanks for the awards. Wasn't expecting this. Also, if you are shit posting and insulting me in the comments I'm going to just assume this post hit your insecurities hard. Stop revolving your whole life around having meaningless sex for bragging rights and go accomplish something useful, lol.Cooked carrots require the extra effort to cook and come out like wet mush with little to no flavour. Whereas you can just take raw carrots out of the fridge and they make an amazing snack especially with a good dip to go with them. Cooked carrots don't even go well with any flavour enhancing food so you can't even add any flavour to the already flavourless substance.Driving at night with a dimly lit dash is the best. I don’t know about you guys, but I know my car well enough to change buttons without looking at them. 

The touchscreens require too much work, no matter how much I use a smartphone it’s always difficult to know exactly where a specific app is. This is even worse in most cars, the touchscreens they put out just can’t compete as well.Okay, I just got down watching a Reddit video around child abuse and neglect. A kid literally 15 years old got arrested and charged with distribution of child pronography. You know what he did? Sent a dick pick to a girl. That in my opinion shouldn't be a huge offense they are kids still and kid's do stupid things! 

I say give them a Stern talking to about the dangers of sending nudes through the internet. Then talk to there parents about online safety etc. Same with people who are like 19 and screw a chick who says they are 18 but really 16 years old. 

There was actually a case a few years ago. About a 19 year old. Who meet a 18 year old online. She turned out to be 14 years old. Now he's a sex offender for 20+ years. Thankfully, I believe that case got dropped after public outreach! 

Also in some states a individual can be put on the list for pissing on the side of the road or on a playground. There was actually a case of someone getting on the list because he took a piss at like 2 am in a park. It's just ridiculous! 

I only want the people who pose a honest to god risk to others on that list! Not a stupid teen or for pissing on the side of the road! It takes away resources from the people who pose real risk.

Edit 
Just found a articles of a 9 year old on the sex offender registry. 

https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/05/01/raised-registry/irreparable-harm-placing-children-sex-offender-registries-usWhen someone says “I think we should have an open relationship” what they mean is “I don’t want to have any sort of commitment so I’m going to see other people, and you can’t do anything about it”. Same with polygamy. Relationships are meant to be monogamous where both members show romantic affection to each other and no one else. An “open relationship” is the opposite of that. It’s nothing but an excuse used by people with commitment issues to cheat with no repercussions.It's pretty creepy that, every morning of the year, kids chant a pledge in unison, swearing their allegiance to their country. Most of the times, they don't even know what they are saying or what the meaning of it is, yet they are forced to recite it at the beginning of every day.

And yes, I am aware that many schools allow students to not stand and recite the pledge, but it's still kinda weird.Ever notice how the Hulk-like beast who benchpresses your Mom seems like he’s crawled out from a 90%-off rags bin from Target?
The better dressed you are at the gym, and the more you give off sad-influencer-wannabe vibes. I’m here to push and pull shit, sweat and look gross. Take that fashion show shit home.Honestly my opinion is extra biased due to a circulatory disorder but my point stands.

If you are cold, put the heating on, layer up, move around, have a hot drink, swaddle up in bed or even hug/cuddle your partner. All easy ways to warm up, and let's face it being cold just makes you numb and shiver unless you get to potentially deadly levels of cold.

On the other side you have too much heat. The only counter to that is cold water over the body, less clothes and in alot of countries just a fan to waft dry warm air over you. You can't even sleep when it's hot, it causes fatigue, headaches, sweating, burns, dehydration and makes you light headed. Being warm is literally hell, especially if you have any issues with circulation. 

It gets worse because hot weather brings bugs, pests, literring morons in public, gross sweaty people walking around half naked, longer days and overall brings literally no positive things with it except good for gardens but oh wait that means it's nigh impossible to keep on top of weeds and the grass etc. The only objectively good thing about summer is out door sports but event hat is ruined when it gets too hot.

We are tricked into wishing for summer our entire childhood when summer is awful. Cold weather is vastly superior in every single way.

Side note, doctors, I don't care that my bad circulation can cause frostbite. I'll just make sure to ask someone else how cold it is. However, you need to start warning people with circulatory issues that the biggest danger is heat stroke due to the complete inability to regulate body temperature meaning you turn into a green house as soon as its warm. 

TLDR: Being too hot is more uncomfortable and less rewarding than being cold and far far harder to counteract along with coming with a massive list of external drawbacks which cold weather doesn't bring to the individual.There are typically like 50 spots open in the back of any given parking lot, yet people (and a lot of people I ride with) would rather drive around the rows looking for one closer to the entrance of the store rather than just walk the extra 75 feet. What is the point?I understand the love for Keanu: his acting may not be incredible, but he sets a high example for how individuals in Hollywood should behave. He is humble, gives a lot to charity, and has made the best of an incredibly harsh life that has been handed to him, and for that he does deserve praise!

However, when it comes to Reddit, you guys actively treat him like some sort of deity; and, I'm not going to lie, it's really fucking weird. It's getting to a point where you wanted him to be the Times person of the year, for being a nice guy? And whenever he is just mentioned on Reddit a post gets a shit load of upvotes and a cult like circle jerk emerges within the comments.

It has got to a point now where seeing him in things, such as the SpongeBob movie, makes me actively cringe. I'm all for you liking an actor, but all the hero worship needs to stop, because it's honestly really strange. 

Or who knows, maybe I'm just getting old and out of touch. What’s the point of wasting your time making the bed only for you just to undo it all whenever you go to sleep. Does making the bed improve your quality of sleep? No.I would have never thought this could be an unpopular opinion bc it feels like a no brainer to me. That was until I myself got engaged and I would estimate about one in three people (outside of my closest circle) goes in for a “congratulations, let’s hope you beat the odds”. 

WHY DO PEOPLE SAY THIS? 
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO REPLY? 

Me too? 

It’s so unnecessary, uncomfortable and impersonal. Please stop it now!The over importance of a degree in recruiting is far beyond the pale. There is a major unspoken irony at play. Academia is really good at preparing people for more academics. That’s it. Employers see it clearly. We have brainwashed students to go to school full time, and then go right into an advanced degree. School tells you to do this because it’s in their best interest, only. 
Employers look at the full time student who earned multiple degrees in a row with only research experience with a collective eye roll.
They know the truth: the professional student has no clue with what they want to achieve. No goals other than “getting a job.” Employers don’t want to keep hiring drifters that will take any job, which is why they know to offer you the lowest salary possible. Because the professional student will take it. Very few people leave school with clear goals, dreams and skills. They have been taught to fill seats and pass tests. And the student doesn’t realize this because they have been lied to their entire life.
School doesn’t teach success anymore.We heard this a lot growing up, and it has some truth to it. But I believe that when you hear this as a kid you think it includes constructive criticism. So you don't offer any. Then the people who needed it don't hear it their entire life, then when they *do* start getting it, they can't handle it, and write it off as just being mean.I understand that you learn basic skills and such, but at the end of the day, everything you are taught, you are only taught because it’s what employers look want. They don’t even try to hide it anymore and students are willingly accepting it and rarely questioning it because we are all subject to it from an early age.

Edit: to clarify, I’m not necessarily saying it’s all bad, of course such qualities are needed in adult life, I’m just saying that the system could be doing so much more for us but it doesn’t.I once got banned from a  discord with a 'certain' sociological leaning for "debating" a woman about male circumcision. She favored it because of her beliefs in health effects and cleanliness. I told her that as a woman, it really wasn't up to her, and her opinion wasn't as valid as mine.

Alright, so my title might be a little strongly worded and clickbaity. Obviously that sentence isn't literally what I mean to the word. But I found it very annoying, especially as it was right after the women's march where I repeatedly saw signs saying "no vagina, no opinion." Fair enough...but why should the rules be different for you?

It's an issue that's not about women, nor should it be "up to women" to decide, and to decide on how men can talk about it.

——-
Edit:

Since it’s come up a lot, here is a write up I did [on the physical and sexual effects of circumcision](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/esfr3o/circumcisions_effects_on_sensitivity_and_sexual/)

ALSO- I am pro-choice when it comes to abortion. Only the pregnant woman should have a say.I’ve stopped reading the «Am I the asshole» subreddit for one fricking reason. It makes me cringe how teenage girls, or women in general (i’m going to assume they’re single/not married) comment that the wife should DIVORCE the husband for every minor inconvenience he does. Your husband doesn’t ask you how your day was after work? Divorce. Your husband wants to not invite you when he goes out with his friends? Divorce. Your husband forgot about your anniversary? Divorce. This is a reason for divorces being so high in recent years because we have become more and more irresponsible. Instead of talking about what bothers us with our SO and taking time and responsibility to try to find a solution for the problem, we’d rather initiate a divorce and tell random people on the internet for advice. I feel bad for you if you genuinely take the advice from those strangers and it is quite unfair to write a post from your personal point of view without the other person explaining themselves.
Sorry for the bad English. I’m not a native speaker. Hope I could formulate myself.I'm on YouTube quite a bit and the ads are so weird and bizarrely sexual, I'd never get the product.

The amount of times I've seen audible ads is ridiculous I must have seen mark "billy" billingham face 100 times at this point and I can say for certain it's still not working. 

I saw the kiss of war ones. Who watches those and thinks it will pan out the way they think...

Kind of a rant but you get my pointWe have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our "creations" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

Edit: I posted this very early in the morning, I know I wrote "car", but I did not mean that! I think I meant cat.

Thanks for commenting, I have read lots of them (Over 300, only got hundreds left!), and there are lots of informative comments about other breeds of cats and dogs, and different animals such as snakes! This has been very informative, thank you for commenting, liking, giving awards, etc!Down vote me into oblivion. I’m ready. 

The list of those who need organs and the list of readily available organs is grossly unmatched. 
It would reduce the amount of body parts selling for thousands on the back markets for those who can afford to skip UNOS. 

It would eradicate the fear of waiting and waiting for an organ and realizing it might never come.

You can decide in the comments about those who have damaged organs due to smoking and alcoholism. I’m not here to make the over all judgment. 

I’m saying : unless there is a medical reason why your organs can not be transplanted into another person’s body after death then I see no reason why you need them. 

Disclaimer : I have one kidney AND I’m on the organ donation list.

Edit : wow. I went to sleep thinking this would never get any traction but wow. I wish I could respond to everyone. I’m sorry if I can’t. Thank you for your participation in this topic !! Lots to think about !!!

Edit 2 : why is the go to comment “they’re mine fuck you” or “hell no , go fuck yourself”. Wut ? Like insulting me makes your argument valid.Watching people degrade their hard work and ability by giving the credit to religious figures is a weird, constant phenomenon, and I'm entirely unsure why it's considered normal.

From the bible: Matthew 6:5 "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others."

It's bothersome to me because it always feels like grandstanding and a show to the world broadcasting that they're righteous.

Edit: the amount of baseless personal insults being thrown at me shows that I'm probably on the right track.

Edit 2: I am not an atheist

Edit 3: I've had dozens of christians tell me I'm using this verse out of context, and yet, all their explanations to what it ACTUALLY means were all different. So when you and God get together to nail down the meaning, you can tell me I'm wrong.I know a lot of girls view Kylie as some sort of goddess, but she was literally very average looking before all the procedures she’s had done, and that still to me will always make her just that average looking girl.  Her butt (Kim’s too) are just ridiculous to look at IMO. Don’t look natural at all, just pathetic and strange looking. IDK, lol maybe im the minority. 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
Lets hear ya thoughts...Basically the title. I have a friend I've known for 6 years, and it's almost always me setting things up and waiting on replies. It's pretty clear that I am way more invested in the friendship than the other person.

And that honestly blows. I feel so underappreciated by it sometimes.I hate eating with people. I have to pretend I have table manners and food just doesn't go down right. I feel bloated and can't eat that much because the distractions make food taste much worse.

When I'm alone, I can savor each bite, actually enjoy it. I can be comfortable in my bed in the most comfortable position and watch my favorite show.

Edit: for people who don't know, they pee from a part above the vagina called the urethraJust joined a party full of racist white people making “black monkey” jokes. These are the type of people who peaked in highschool and are living on a minimum wage salary because they are too damn lazy and too stupid to get a degree. I don’t have time for childish racist shit that they believe to be “jokes”.  

Kiss my fat ass if you have a problem with this post because I don’t give a f*ck.So I was vibing in a roblox chat room, when someone says "they prefer white people" (as in dating) and a ton of people started calling him racist for not wanting to date a black person, so I piped up like, he isn't racist, it's just his preference. So then everyone started calling ME racist for some reason. So I said "If I don't date a man because I prefer women, does that make me a homophobe?" and they were like no, because it's "different" for some reason. So then I tried saying "If a White woman prefers Black men, is she racist." And these motherfuckers had the AUDACITY to say no, because you "can't be racist toward white people." LikeSO MY LAPTOP IS ACTUAL SHIT ITS SOME LENOVO THING I GOT WHEN I WAS 12 AND I ONLY USE IT FOR NETFLIX, DISNEY+ ECT

BUT

I GOOGLED SHIT LIKE ‘Barney the dinosaur rule 34’ ‘Ed sheeran fucks goat’ AS A JOKE AND SHE CAME IN AND SAID:

AND SHE JUST CAME IN AND SNATCHED IT, MID UMBRELLA ACADEMY, AND WENT AWAY TO SET UP TEAMS WHICH WONT FUCKING WORK BECAUSE ITS SHIT AND OLD AND WHATEVER

‘DONT WORRY I REPSRCT YOUR PRIVACY, I WONT LOOK AT ANYTHING’

(Spongebob narrator voice)

Thirty minutes later

*mum slowly walks in with the laptop and sits on the edge of my bed*
‘…I know what you’ve been looking up, I get that teenage curiosity and everything but some of this is… I mean really… rough tellytubby breeding?’

SO I TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HER THAT IT WAS A JOKE

‘Look I’m gonna have to tell your dad…(dad is a 53 year old brickie who thinks that kids should start work at 10 ‘like the good old days’)

I START SAYING ‘NO NO NO NO’ BECAUSE HED FUCKING DISOWN ME.

NOW MY MUM THINKS I HAVE A TELLYTUBBY KINK, SHES GONNA TELL MY DAD AND IDK IF MY BROTHER KNOWS OR NOT

ALSO THE LAPTOP DIDNT FUCKING WORK IT HAD NO SOUND AND SHE DIDNT EVEN GET THE JOB SO ITS ALL FOR FUCKING NOTHING

Edit 7: someone said villain origin story so I wrote the start of a villain origin story book ig so read this ig

The kids of the class 9H were on a field trip. A small group of teenagers clambered noisily down the cheap metal steps of the yellow school bus onto the cracked pavement, drained dry from the scorching summer sun.

‘Shit, I forgot my water,’ I heard someone mutter. I couldn’t care less, I was too busy trying to revive my legs from the cramped two hour journey to get to this… what is this place anyway?

‘Ah finally! We’re here!’ Mr Halloran, my science and drama teacher, exclaimed while he was adjusting his hat.

I whisper to my friend ‘he looks like he’s exploring the african plains,’ ‘hey! I like him!’ she retorts.

‘Whatever,’ I mutter before I tie my shoelace. ‘What is this place sir?’ Said Euan.

‘This! Ah this is the place where we learn!’ He sang out while clapping his hands excitedly. I can’t believe I actually thought this might be fun. ‘We will learn all about the glorious creatures of the oceans!!’ ‘Mate you could’ve just said an aquarium’ Joanna groaned.

‘Nevermind all that, let’s get inside before we all cook’ the assistant Mr Carlisle (although all the kids just called him Tony) spoke

The rest of the kids made their way inside, but I rounded the bus into the shade and took out my jacket to sit on to keep the dust from clinging to my legs and a book, The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. I opened the book and carefully peeled the sticky note I used to mark my pages off as I began to pick up where I left off.

Law 1| 7: Authority. Avoid outshining the master~

I eventually got bored and decided to walk inside to cool off with the life-saving breeze of the chilling aircon. As I rounded a corner past reception and towards the Coral Reefs exhibit, I heard my friend, Laura, quietly conversing with a bitch that goes by the name of Freya. Freya was beautiful on the outside, with her raven-black curls tumbling down her back, greatly contrasting her light skin and ghostly blue eyes, on the inside… not so much…

‘I’m not really her friend… never liked her anyways… my parents made me hang out with her… I’m only using her to pass maths…’ I’d heard enough from my friend, could I even call her that anymore?

(Uh to be continued I guess)

Top Catch Words: lgbt , sex , valid/invalid **repost coz i'm an idiot and used the serious flair**

So this sub is for 13-19 year olds but I'd argue anyone below 15 shouldn't even be here in its current state.

I mean take a good look at some of the hot posts rn and its full of "I just wanked for the first time", "Just found out where girls piss from" and tons of "girls/guys ask questions" full of sexual shit.

Like I'm not usually the "save the children" type but i mean come on, when I was 13 I was looking at minecraft videos, not answering "what makes a girl sexy" questions on redditThis is a sub about Teenagers. We are the new generation, WE are the ones who need to talk about the LGBTQ when they need to talk about something. WE need to educate ourselves about this issue because CLEARLY it isn't just a case closed that every teenager accepts it. 

A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET TO OPENLY SHARE THEIR SEXUALITY WITH OTHERS IN REAL LIFE AND NEED TO RANT. Because you don't care doesn't make it any less important. I don't give a crap about a lot of people here saying I'm depressed all the time, it's tired at this point. But you won't see me post "Stop posting about being depressed" because I get that it's an important topic that MUST be covered. 

Recently, a girl in my friend group admitted to being bisexual. And it pissed me off SO MUCH. Not because of her sexuality, but because she was SO SCARED about saying it she was shaking and put 100 disclaimers before admitting it so that we won't be mad at her or something. 

This SHOULDN'T happen. No one should feel this ashamed of who they are. Because we are in our little bubble of acceptance online doesn't mean this is the real world. Homophobia is rampant out there, we can't stop these people from posting about their experiences, issues or thoughts here, because as a community of teenagers with tons of different sexualities, interests, religions, countries of origin, walks of life and tons more different variables, we have a ton of input from experiences and thoughts that we need to share and discuss in order to understand each other and ACTUALLY improve society in an important way. 

Let's have some positivity and acceptance here, because God knows when we'll find some in real life.And I'm here on a Sunday afternoon, licking melted chocolate and feeling sorry for myself :D

Anyway how's life goingThe No Bitches AssociationYou are all 14 year olds. Even if you did have sex, why tf is your first instinct to post it on reddit. It’s obvious all these posts are written by creepy 45 year old men. Can we just ban discussions about sexual activity already? it’s getting tiring


edit: Just to clear up some stuff. No, this isn’t about jealousy, and no, i’m not a prude. But i understand that the intense discussion of sexual activity that happens on this sub is both inappropriate and dangerous. Talking about sexual issues a normal teen would face is fine, but some of the posts that are on here feel more like fantasies some pedo is jerking off too rather then actual discussions about safe and healthy sex.Im nonbinary by the way so don't go calling me a transphobe.It's becoming ridiculous.  Bunch of 14,15 even 16  year old kids thinking they can get easy karma by posting things almost everyone agrees with on this sub. You're not changing any minds.  You're not doing the right thing. You're not delivering social justice. What you're doing is karmafarming. And it's becoming absurd. And you think you're being smart because you can just accuse  anyone who calls you out of being transphobic, when that's literally not even how transphobia works. The majority of people on this sub, I would say,  are pretty much accepting of the Trans community. 

Even if someone doesn't think transgenderism is valid,  why do you care? That opinion is old, outdated, and is slowly doing off. And while it will likely always exist,  you're not going to be changing any minds any time soon. Especially  (and I mean this with all due respect to the Christians,  Muslims and all other religions) If they use scripture and holy text to back up their case. It's nearly impossible to change someone's opinion on the validity of transgenderism. Stop trying and be original for once in your life.  Post your fucking Hazbin Hotel fanart or something.

Most of you don't even try arguing your case or using any kind of scientific evidence! There is massive amounts of scientific research condoning the validity of transpeople. But do I see you using any? No. It consists literally of a title along the lines of "Trans people valid UwU",a description that says "that's it 👍" and none of the science condoning it! There are peer reviewed papers in many scientific journals that have proven the validity of transgenderism, that the X and Y chromosomes aren't the only thing that determines gender,and yet you choose to include exactly zero of them.  Good way to change someone's mind,  huh? 

In effect you are actually harming the Trans community.  I was hesitant to make this rant bc I was scared it would be considered bandwagoning. But I just have to point out,  the more you say transgenderism is valid the more you are undermining that very fact. It's making it sound like what you're saying is the exception and not the general consensus. 

Please, if you're going to put something here. Don't make it something people have seen ten thousand times already.

Edit: for those of you who asked for the peer reviewed studies I referenced. https://youtu.be/szf4hzQ5ztg

It's a video from Forrest Valkai, an evolutionary biologist.  He lists his bibliography at the end of the videoOk so I ain't desperate for a kiss guys I'm just doing this to see how long I will keep doing these post basically it's for fun nth more nth lessIts not like the shooter us gonna see the lights off in every classroom and think "wow i guess everyone just isnt here at 1 pm on a tuesday"Honestly THERE IS A UNIVERSE OF TOPICS TO TALK ABT but ALL I see on here is a rotation of the same stupid 5 topics you all choose to post abt EVERY SINGLE DAY. GET OFF UR PHONES AND GO DO SOMETHING WITH UR LIFELike holy shit I'm tired of all these posts. Day after day they just seem to he increasing. No one needs to know about which bathroom you wanna go it. Like Jesus Christ. How can you kids just switch to man to woman at 13 when you barely have any pubes and your voice still makes you sound 10?! "i fOuNd oUt I wAs bIsEXuAl aT 6." No the fuck you did not. You were playing with Power Ranger action figures. Y'all can't just be doing this shit 24/7...y'know I'm done. This is just too absurd.Men aren't real. They are a myth made up by the women of this platform as a form of escapism. All the "men" on this platform are just women. And to confirm it even more. Men don't exist anywhere else, not irl or on other platforms. Reddit is the only place with these supposed "men" so I have concluded that they must also not be real and are simply made upliterally everyone here is, just calm down and go jerk off cuz that's all you can do to make it go away till our damn teenage hormonal balance stops being so wackToday I got to know about an Olivia Rodrigo NSFW sub and my lord the people there were saying disgusting things they'd do to her. Not so suprisingly, they opened that sub on the day she turned 18. They literally sexualize every single thing she does and that sub has 10k+ members.

The more surprising thing is that there's a similar sub about Billie Eilish, opened exactly on her 18th birthday which has 300k+ members! I was literally shocked because I thought only some people did this but no. 
It hurts because Billie recently became confident with her body, she said that she wore baggy clothes in order not to be sexualized but people are so gross it's disgusting.

There are subs to fap on female celebrities and people literally post their videos of them cumming on their pictures. I don't care what you do in your room but atleast have some decency and don't post them on the internet. I know this is reddit but isn't this basic human decency to show respect to others?Way 1: The LGBTQ+ Exploitist

Stop posting about it ffs.honestly i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m so unhappy and want to end my life so badly i don’t know what to do. i’ve had severe depression for the past three years and i feel like it’s never going to get better. i turned 16 in february and i just feel like i’m being tortured just living daily life. i don’t know what to do anymore. i have a therapist that i see regularly and i’m on 40mg daily of fluoxetine and i just feel extremely depressed still. i try to do things that make me happy, but they are getting less and less helpful. i used to love gaming and could do it for hours on end, but now it feels like it’s insane to just get up and sit at my desk to play something. i feel so demotivated and i don’t know what to do. i feel so worthless and like i’m disappointing everyone. it doesn’t help that i don’t want to put anymore work on my parents shoulders because i have a special needs sister that they have to take care of already and i don’t want to give them more work. but i just don’t know what to do. i used to be extremely unattracted to the idea of hurting myself and just wanted to die in a harmless way but i’m getting scared by the fact that it doesn’t really bother me anymore, and i honestly don’t know what to do. 

i’m really just tired of letting everyone down and making everyone else feel bad for me. i just wish i could end everything without giving my parents that massive price for a funeral and everything.

i have been extremely just disappointed with myself and everything i do. i have a massive porn addiction and i absolutely hate it, i am constantly thinking about porn and i don’t like it; i want to just be able to satisfy myself but i feel like i’m endlessly horny. the worst part is i sexualize everyone i find attractive which i hate because they are actual people not just things for my pleasure. and even if they were it’s not like i could get anywhere close to actually doing anything with them.

i’ve been extremely close to just taking like 2kmg of melatonin and just hoping i don’t wake up but i don’t want to burden my parents anymore.

i know this will most likely not get any reactions but i honestly just needed somewhere to say this. sorry for typing so much, if i’m here tomorrow and i can find this i’ll most likely delete it.Truth or dare!SHUT UP RYAN NOBODY CARES-asking for a friendLike if you agree#Omg! 

Idk why I just find it really hot! 


Especially women in suits 🥵🥵🥵


And even women who wear black clothes!I like women 😔✊have funCan somebody start a convo with me im bored as hellSo, a couple years ago my former best friend and I parted after agreeing that our friendship was unhealthy. A few months after that, I failed to hold it up by commenting something on one of his YT videos that I knew would cause him to reach out to me. We started talking again very briefly, until I realized I'd made a mistake, panicked and blocked him. More recently I found out through another friend who goes to the same school as him that he still hates me and actually asked her (my other friend) for my address so he could "you know what." It triggered by paranoid tendencies and I wrote a letter to him apologizing for how I ended things but saying that our friendship was toxic and we both need to move on. Not deciding if I wanted to have her deliver it, I just kept it. Tonight I remembered it and am considering it again. Should I risk reopening things for more drama for the purpose of helping my old friend move on? Or just let things be and try to ignore my paranoia?like it got me kicking my feet up in the air and shii, like giggling and shii, like sucking dick and shiity
It is very clear from earlier posts that most of the people here dislike smoking cigarettes, or the people who smoke cigarettes. but why? What’s your reason?That's it 👍 This is a sub about Teenagers. We are the new generation, WE are the ones who need to talk about the LGBTQ when they need to talk about something. WE need to educate ourselves about this issue because CLEARLY it isn't just a case closed that every teenager accepts it.

Homophobia is rampant out there, we can't stop these people from posting about their experiences, issues or thoughts here, because as a community of teenagers with tons of different sexualities, interests, religions, countries of origin, walks of life and tons more different variables, we have a ton of input from experiences and thoughts that we need to share and discuss in order to understand each other and ACTUALLY improve society in an important way.I said no because I had my schedule full of crying alone and suicidal thoughts.My family is really fucked all because my grandmother is a piece of shit. She is one of those entitled old people and constantly belittles my mom saying "Whose house are you staying in?" Or "Whose food/water are you eating/drinking?" "Whose son are you married to?" My mother tells my father about all this but he barely does anything because he respects his mother like all Indian children.
So, today at yesterday at dinner my mother was telling my father about what my grandmother did. My father was really tired after working the whole day so he just got angry and told her to deal with her own problems and shit went loose. Basically, my mother locked my father out of our floor to the stairs (our house has 3 floors where my parents and I live on the second floor, grandmother on first and ground floor is for guests). 
So, while I was sleeping, I heard something burning and immediately got up and saw my mother burning something in the bathroom and about to go in. I had to rush in and stop her from doing so and I got beaten a lot. I poured heck ton of water to diffuse the fire and my mother was constantly beating and scolding me to stay out of it. I probably broke a finger or two because my hand really hurts. Then, my father, uncle and mother had a talk while I stood trying to calm her down. She was bragging about how she once saved my grandmother from a stroke and still she is grateful. I felt like saying so many things like how she forgets the number of times I got beaten by her to prevent her from committing suicide (yes, this isn't the first) and how she and my grandmother are no different if they keep bragging about what they did for each other yet keep bitching about it. I don't want to live like this. What should I do? I'm 15.These are the times where the sub is at its worst. All the stupid unoriginal posts and repeated bullshit validity post and then the posts who call said posts out you know what none of you are valid just shut up i dont even know what valid means and i dont wanna know but its half the fucking posts on this sub.

Girls ask boys answer posters, shut up. Music rating posters, shut up. Horny mfs who only talk about how their never gonna get laid in their mortal existence bc they spend 16 hours a day on reddit instead of getting bitches, shut up. People who make posts about these over saturated type of posts, shut up. Everyone shut up. After I post this I will also shut up.

Cant we just go back to posting random shitposts and clips of our teen lives before we leave this god forsaken sub and move on to our empty hellish adult life. Cant we just be positive for once or does everyone have to complain about everything in existence on here

Text-only weekends just heighten this bullshit side of the sub and at least during the week it can all be buried under stupid shitposts and something new for once🫂Omg, this is gonna change so many minds, transphobia is gonna drop to 0%, if someone gets annoyed at the obvious attempt at k\*rmawhoring and lack of an argument it's because they're transphobic, we're seriously standing up and fighting oppression here, babe, I'm expecting a call from the president any secondJust waking up with your dick in your hand, or even sometimes I'll start rubbing it before my eyes are evwn open? It's so weird.must be because im ugly(it’s a song lyric guys)Playing guitar is so tiring^(youll also get the worst of the sub with that but whatever)I am feeling so lucky and good, i just wanted to share it with you guys! 






So we were having this selection for presenter/mediator for this debate discourse happening at our school. The school, actually the invigilator, wanted a guy moderator for some reason, anyways this one girl had a pretty good record, she had good speaking skills and was normally calm. My bf would been the second choice. But everytime she presented her case she was ignored for silly reasons. My bf got an invite he stepped down saying she would be a better candidate, he told our parents what was going on, we fucking called the school out, ofc they denied the allegations, (*hmmm for some reason in the entire 25 years of school setting up discourse there has never been a female moderator for some reason, strange.... I gUeSs IT is JUsT CoiNciDEnce*) 



anyways, the good news is that, we got this exceptionally talented and well deserved girl what she deserved! She's the first girl from our school setting up public discourse ! She was literally on the verge of  crying when she was thanking us for our effort !like why can’t you be they them because that’s not boy or girl it’s the middle it’s nothing they confuse me so much i’m not calling u kittenher or kittenselfPosting this rn because I've just kept it bottled up for so long and I've tried to be open and I want to yell someone but I just can't so imma just post it here where nobody knows who I am. Not looking for advice or help, just need to tell someone. 

I don't want to live anymore. I hate being alive. I have lots of friends, a good home, hobbies, interests, maybe even passions. I'm smart and am doing fairly decent in school, and none of it genuinely makes me happy. My brain hates me. It makes me mate the way I look, it makes me think everybody hates me, it tells me I'm not good enough, it constantly reminds me how big of a disappointment I am and how much I've hurt people, and every fucking second that I am alive I have to live with so much self hate and guilt and hopelessness.  I don't know how much longer I can do this. I already attempted suicide this year, it's the third time I've tried and it was the closest attempt to actually succeeding by far. I know I can do it and I have it in myself and it's only a matter of time. I can't fucking take it anymore.My answers are boobs and eyes.Edit: Stredy’s responses are voidedAnd like it’s very cool and I’m really proud of it but now I’m gonna be extremely tired the entire dayI used to be able to Post Photos, now I can't even post Photos of my unofficial adopted Cats. Now all I can do now is just Text and Shit, This is Bullshitso this girl and k have been talking for a while and she finally came over, we just kinda snuggled and i leaned in and kissed her.I feel disgusting reading some comments hereMf 8 year olds be knocking each other up.... I remember eating mac and cheese and playing Arkham City and Black Ops. What has this world come too...?So there was this guy I fell in love with, he’d call me almost everyday and talk to me whenever he could. It was amazing, he made me feel special and safe, he’d comfort me when I was at my lowest and he was funny and adorable. he’d even say he loved me a few times but as time went on he stopped talking to me, he only spoke if I was feeling suicidal. Which still is nice but thats the only time he’d speak with me. When i tried to communicate i got nothing but silence, he ghosted me over and over until I heard from a mutual friend of ours that my crush was in a distant relationship. 

I felt used, like i was just a test run for the real deal. My feelings were played with and I was to blind to see it sooner. I eventually lost a bit of feelings after a few nights of crying myself to sleep. I’ve never been hurt like that before and I still can’t let go. Am I doing something wrong? Am i the problem?it’s hard for me to do simple tasks now⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿ ⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿ ⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼ ⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼ ⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉ ⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄⠀say gnWtf.I would cook for you but you gotta do the dishes

Edit: this is not girls only it autocorrected from an old post

Edit No.2: holy shit guys I didn’t think this would blow up thanks for the support. Unfortunately, I did report him, but he didn’t buy anything so we couldn’t find out who it was. I’m doing fine now.I flunked my maths test hard. I wasn't able to finish the paper. I got my results and it is so bad. The paper was too lengthy and I wasn't able to finish my paper. I dunno what to do now.Ofc I'm saying this just cause I don't have a Valentine hahahaaa amiritewho are they and what do they want?its been some okay weather for the past few days and i wanted to play basketball but theyre burried in the snow somewhereBut it's ok because the idea of 1 day where people HAVE to get their special someone something is meaningless. What is I ga e you a flower on Septenber 20th rather than giving you a flower on February 14th? Hmmm?IM GONNA BE ASKING OUT MY BEST FRIEND EITHER ON THIS TUESDAY OR THE NEXT SUNDAY!!!!!  
ITS ALL ON THE LINE NOW IF SHE SAYS NO THEN UHHHHH ITS WILL BE VERY SAD FOR ME SINCE SHE IS MY ONLY.....ONLY FRIEND. AND THINGS WILL BE AKWARD  
BUT IF SHE SAYS YES OOKMMMMMMGGGGGGGGG!!!!  
(SORRY FOR THE CAPS IM EXCITED/SCARED)  
I WILL MAKE AN UPDATE I PROMISEEEEEEMy parents were arguing about something dumb like whenever my dads at home my dad doesn't talk to my mom because he's busy with work and spends a lot of time at work. I hate my mom for this kind of bullshit. My mom should understand that my dad just lost all of his data that was on his laptop last week, and him being busy is just him trying to recover it. Today was the big argument when my mom who is a MAJOR Drama queen tried to leave the house even though my dad knows she can't so he dragged her back in and tried to calm her down but that stupid bitch made my dad reach his breaking point. ( he is a pretty calm guy ) And then he took his car keys and left the house but not before telling us that some point in life we will meet again. It was not until he left that I realized what he meant. Guys wtf do I do? My dad just left the house and I don't know if he would be coming back. Guys please helpI saw 1.00945 inches of a girls shoulder today. I immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity.

What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my übernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra.

It vaporized the girl as it punched right through her, barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder.

The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of Illinois to fall pregnant with my children.

When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies.Dating someone and here I am that hasn’t even gotten to kiss someone or hug.*hugs*I want a custom hentai but cant find anyone to make one for me.  
if this is out of topic mods pls delete it :)I personally find simps to be way more irritating, and an incel too. But I think simps are worst than incels.

Thoughts?


Edit - Forgot to add that both have never felt the warmth of a women.Sometimes, it’s only the teenagers that understand.Im bored we can just talkYeah the silicnsrWhat do I do help

I want to tell him but it’s Saturday and I’ll lose all my courage on MondayMaaaaan I dont even have a crush on anybody how boring is that??? The last person I was attracted to was Varus from LoL??,Whatever your going through I'm here for you :)I can provide some attentionWhat do u think is the worst disney animated movie

I’m having post partum embarrassmentWe get it, you don't like the posts abt 'omg trans valid' but I'm 100% sure I've seen more people complain about it than actually doing it lmaoIs that normal?The read time is an even 4 hours now. (Proceeds to fist bump the air) 

Damn I’m so proud of myself. And I finally got to the part where I reveal the main antagonist :3Yeah. What now huh? How about something new next time.i'm in love with a girl i'm good friends with and i don't want to ruin our friendship because this has happened before and it was quite painful

Wt should i do 

And if the girl sends me hints how i can get themSeriously, I need to get some bitches 💀💀💀What does it mean? What r its origins

Edit: Yes ik y'all forgor but tell me what it means 😭🥲When you’re cleaning your room and find some old stuff that you almost forgor💀 about
Use [S] if straight, and [G] if gay

Please be respectful.And it's disturbing....Im a girl and i got a guy friend and i thought he considered me one of the boys but he didnt and he just said i wasnt today is a very bad dayYeah, i hate my life. It’s fucking shit and i don’t know why everything bad happens to me, 
since just november 2021 this has happened
Harassed by a kid in my class (still hasn’t stopped 4 months later and i’m about to bitchslap him)
Testicular torsion surgery that resulted in emergency surgery and if i had waited 2 more hours i would’ve had my left testicle amputated. 
My friend is dying from heart problems
My mental health is fucking destroyed and has been for a while
I’m in pain
I’ve had many emotional breakdowns
My depression and anxiety has gotten out of control
And i am barely stopping myself from going into homicidal rage and commiting murder on the kid who harassed me, and the teacher who is letting it happen.

And that is just november to today

This is some more stuff throughout my whole life
I almost had covid on 4 different occasions
I’ve had 2 deaths to very close family members
I’ve had depression and anxiety since i was 8 years old
I’ve almost died 10 times (3 just barely missed by a speeding car, 7 almost being forcefully drowned by other people AS A FUCKING CHILD)
My friends have abandoned me on multiple occasions.
My house was broken into by my mother’s psychotic ex while i was in the house and the police did nothing
My family was almost harmed by a drunk uncle when i was 2 years old and we were in another state and the police were called
Last 2 times i tried having a therapist they were full of shit and didn’t know how fucked up my life was

Thats just the start of what i could think of, if i had more time this would take you an hour to read
But that is why i hate my life. I legitimately want to die as my mental health is fucking destroyed, i’ve got so my repressed trauma and i just can’t deal with my life because every time i try to take a break from life, something else bad happens.Bro someone tell that guy to stopI'll wait LIKE CMON BRO, a little hair on the forehead doesn't hurtt. I saw myself in the camera, and I was like "aight aight, I look kinda fly" but then the photographer told my parents to fix my hair, and UGHH CAN U NOT. 

I should've seen this coming, I thought they would let me wear my hair as is, but I also saw that other people my age had their hair fixed bc it was longI haven’t dated anyone, I haven’t lost my virginity, I don’t do exceptionally well in school, I don’t have any plans for college, I don’t know how to drive.

I feel like im wasting these precious days of being young doing absolutely nothing that will help me in the future, this thought haunts me everyday, and I feel like I won’t succeed in life because of it.I am the *quiet kid* of the class. Don't really talk to anyone unless they are my friend. I'm pretty smart. I usually just screw around in class until the day is over so i can go play some vid games at home. For whatever reason people are constantly assuming I'm gay(which isn't wrong or anything) because I don't talk to people. Like what?? Anyways, I almost never talk to girls unless I'm forced too. This is because, I'm a introverted, super low self esteem, anxiety like crazy, I'm not very fat, but I'm not skinny either, skinny-fat is the most unattractive body form, and i stopped playing sports about a year ago after my parents got divorced because i usually played sports with my dad but he lives super far now. Anyways, I don't really have a crush currently, I'm just chilling yk. But at this rate I don' t even think I will have a girlfriend in college. Do super introverted people have a chance of getting a girlfriend? I think I'm funny when I'm with my friends because they usually laugh, but still.Mostly shorts but nothing else really.Hello teens, I used be v active on my old account but hello! How goes it folksUse [S] if straight, and [G] if gay

Please be respectful.For some reason I always find it weird, how many people are OK using it. I dont even use it even if I'm alone, idk why. I also sit while urinating on a normal toilet even tho I am able to stand and AIM.and now i found out that a girl was gonna ask me to hang out with her friend group, but the guy who has a crush on her said no because he thinks she likes me. so i’m still alone.I cant say vote cuz the bot will remove my post, but what is the most liked/disliked post/comment?But I got no one to cuddle with right nowlike cmon it aint that hard- its not like itll kill u to be respectful. smhIn my dreams :,(https://allbad.cards/game/cathartic-scorpion-6294I was searching up some of the old Disney shows I used to watch as a kid, and realized that most of them had ended shortly after I stopped watching them 😭 😭 😭And worst part is, there is a possibility of it being lost forever, because they throw some stuff in the fireplace, and some of the stuff includes paintbrushes>!Lily!<I made a post about 30 minutes ago about my racist teacher. I got 4 replies. One saying "put lead in her coffee queen" which was probably the only positive one, one saying about how I "wrote a whole essay" about her, and 2 either not believing I was black or not believing the story actually happened, and that I was simply seeking attention. I was in reality trying to vent about my issues and seeing if there was anyone who went through anything similar and there were next to no positive or affirmative comments. The fact that the auto mod straight up tells you to be respectful when someone flairs something as serious and people blatantly ignore it is ridiculous.sex mcsex sexexcept you cool people👍🗿👍Like why are they so frustrating to navigate? Theres constant pop ups and ads between the articles making it really difficult to read especially the "oh no sorry we wont let you read unless u disable adblock". One time I got frustrated with an assignment my teacher assigned, I put their emails in the news subscriptions so they could get spam mail or something.but i need a pipe bomb to defend against the local insects :(This is a friendly reminder for y'all to clear your browser historyWHY AM I GETING CALLED A BITCH BY YALL? I DON’T EVEN KNOW HALF OF YOU-I just saw an old video of me and my ex. I need affection. It's painful knowing I had something great going on less than 3 years ago and now I've got nothing. Nobody to hold me closely, nobody to tell me everything is ok, nobody to love me. I feel like I'm in genuine emotional agony knowing with full certainty that nobody out there loves me. I desperately need someone to care for me and to know I care about them. I need a hug. I haven't had a romantic experience in years and it's gnawing me from the inside.Both my mother and father are 5”8. I am currently 5”10-5”11 at 14 and a half. Is it safe to stay I’ve stopped growing. I’ve still got a relatively childlike build besides my height. Should I expect to continue my growth spurt or is this it.karma pleasehttps://forms.gle/oCg8g3cVY2nTkvCc8that's how i copeLike an actual date and not a hookup for once haha. Hes really sweet but a freshman in college to my senior in HS which ig is concerning for some but I turn 18 in 2 months so… were just going to the park to sit and smoke and “talk about the complicated” as he said which is a huge change from other people.

Thanks <3This has been a general statement from the office of the Toad.It’s hard for me (15f) to make new friends, is it like that for any of you? I have like 3-4 close friends max, the rest are all acquaintances or people I talk to once in a while. I’m introverted anyways…YOU SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A LIVING HUMAN FROM THE FIRST PLACE GO GET SOME FUCKING THERAPISTsorry for making another one of these post but would anyone want to talk for a bit? this might be my last one for a bit im thinking of taking a break from redditLiterally the most stupid shit I frequently hear Christians say.i’m retrardedWe’re both 16, no cars (driving age is 18 here), no woods nearby and both my parents and his parents definitely can’t know we have sex. 

I mean we could skip school and do it in the morning when they are at work but we can’t loose a day of school every time we want to fuck

Any ideas?I'm currently listening to the song Sixteen Blue by the Replacements, and I think you folks would really enjoy it. 

It's the most relatable song about being a teenager that I've ever heard.

It portrays the constant feeling of being just on the cusp of something, but still feeling like you're wasting your time, so well. 

It sums up the cocktail of bordom, ennui, horniness and hope that defines our lives as teenagers.

Paul Westerberg's perfectly slurred, drawling voice combined with his amazingly poetic songwriting really makes it feel like this song genuinely understands us.

Give it a listen.I... I found blueditYes I’m singleAnd for Roman’s. On Valentine’s Day, men would choose women to “have fun” with for the entire day. Even if the women didn’t want to.i have successfully befriended the neighborhood crows. they bring me gifts sometimes and might fly around me or land near me for something. i am the bird woman.

so on that note, what are your favorite birds? which would you like to befriend?r/NewFriendsForTeens

Also, the discord server is great, and a lot more active then the sub, so I’d definitely recommend it! The discord can be found pinned in the sub, hope to see you there :) we have free pizza!

Please feel free to join!! We’re always looking for new people to meet and talk too.I really don’t get it guys.not even joking i’m in the mood for whoring around

except if ur one of those no-profile-1-karma mfscucumbers😔So I read this.

"Encanto's "*We* Don't *Talk About Bruno*" Has Surpassed "*Let It Go*" on US Charts, Becoming Biggest Disney Tune in Decades."

I've heard the song might surpass Can You Feel The Love Tonight. If it does, I will lose hope in humanity.

That's all I have to say.

EDIT: We Don't Talk About Bruno still solos many Disney songs, don't get the assumption I think it's a shit song, Encanto and the songs are great.I think one of my friends likes me and im repulsed. Hes not a good person deep down inside. Surface level he is a chill guy but he is one of the most racist people ive ever met and likes to tell us ‘dont be sensitive its a joke’. I get dark humor, i had a Leafy phase for a cool minute but no he is just straight racist and that disgusts me. So does the way he presents himself. I think hes just an overweight insecure pathetic bald moron. I fr cant stand him rn. And i have mild autism, so I don’t even feel comfortable interacting with someone who likes me and i dont like them back. I dont know how to handle it. I know that may make me a bad person but Im sorry. Thanks for readingI’m so bad at talking to people and I get too attached too quickly. As soon as I start getting comfortable with someone I overstep and make them uncomfortable and I hate myself for it. I’m so weird and dumb I just want to be happy and make other people happy.if you are hot then you probably have a fever.  i’d advice you to go to a doc and do a covid test. you never be too protective these days. 

wear your masks. even if you’re in cali. i know it’s hot but your breath stinks.I got you

five nights at freddysOops I did 4 🤨Well here in Australia most 7/11s r petrol stations and when I heard they’re not petrol starvations in America I cousins believe my ears. So yh I’m bored shhhAccording to the people in my previous post. Nothing I can do. I can't believe that just 3 days ago he was smiling upon me. My life is ruined; I don't feel anymore. I just don't want to. All the things to look forward in life. Gone. I would never go to college, never find love, never shake the hands of my friends, never have kids. I can't believe that because of my mother. This family line ends with me. 

Edit: My mother is leaving the house she took the car keys. oh fuck. My sister so young in life has to experience all this. I have to live for her. I don't know what to do.ITS NOT MY FAAAUUULLTTTTT

YUGANDA SEKAI NI DAN DAN BOKU WA SUMITOOTTE MENAKU NATTEEEEESo I started riding the same as a freshman friend of mine. I am a sophomore and 15 while she is 14. We usually just talk about the stupidity that’s happening on the bus. But she also just goes through my phone because she knows that I have more memes than I have selfies. I also don’t mind it because I like putting a smile on peoples face.For time being, she is grounded I don’t know why. So I jokingly said, “In trade of me letting you go through my phone, you should give me head pats.” And to my surprise, she did not say a word and just gave me headpats. Her hand is kinda short and my torso is kinda tall so to make it easier for her, I just rested my head on her lap. She stoped for a second but she continued scrolling through my phone. Do I have a chance here?Edit: Will come back in some time, others pls feel free to rate others as well as [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/srdr28/comment/hwr6xoc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I will rate, or maybe notHow do we avoid our toxic friends or try to fix them who are very close to us?Trying to be fluent in cumThis Sunday is the Super Bowl, and that’s great and all. Hope those who care and tune in have a great time. For me, this Sunday marks one whole year of no self harm. I stopped because weather started getting warmer and I couldn’t keep wearing a hoodie to cover my arms, and I didn’t want anyone in my high school noticing.

Now I’m in college, and this second semester has been really rough. Life hasn’t gotten any better as I got older, but after going cold turkey last year, I can at least be proud of myself that I got this far. Yeah I still hate myself and I’m really tempted at times to start cutting again, but at least I have this small win. Can’t really celebrate it cuz nobody really knows, and I gotta watch the super bowl with family and friends tomorrow, but just thinking about it is making me happy. If I got this far, I think I can keep going till I get past this depressive part of my life. 

At least until my next exam grade comes in, cuz I totally bombed that exam 💀

Enjoy the weekend everyone. Happy early valentines. Get flowers for your s/o, or maybe your sister or mom or friend.So I was looking up who some of the actors on the L word were. I accidentally learned Dana died from breast cancer. Not sure when, I'm on season 3 so we'll seeSo am I a bad friend for feeling bad when my friends deside not to hang out with me? Like I'm not over here thinking they don't deserve to hang out with anyone else they can make their own decisions. But when I'm excluded from gatherings or inside jokes it makes me feel irrelevant. Or as if I don't matter in the friend group. I'm not going any further into this as this sub-reddit seems to hate long post.Also if I eat too much ketchup at once I gag.Everyone looks so sleep deprived in here. Me, on the other hand, oversleeps like hell.I have yet to see a post about how awesome crocodilians are and I barely see posts about dinosaurs all you guys ever talk about is lame things like cum and humans or you make long rants, nobody wants to see that we want to see epic crocodiles and dinosaursFuck you me you fucking suckI HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE

YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU just dm me or smthMe and my friends are going to have a PowerPoint night one night, I don't know when but I don't want to start making it a day before the night so I need to start making it soon. I've had SOME ideas but I don't think that they're good enough to fit for a PowerPoint so if y'all have any ideas, I would appreciate them thanks!Cant even imagine what it’s like for people who actually have anxiety. I feel so fucking scared but horrible, there’s this sick feeling in my gut like I’m on the verge of puking. I wanna fkn run but I feel so stuck. Cant wait for highschool to be over , worst 2 years of my life. Fuck the IB (even though the only reason I even got accepted by a college is bcoz of it).

Edit: worst part about it is that inhibits you from dealing with what’s making you feel like shit too. “Choking up” ukI just use the default one.

Edit: phone.It’s almost 11 pm and I put too much cocoa powder in my hot chocolate so now I can’t sleep tonight and I am bored

Edit: guys notice the flair i am seriously asking

Edit: you guys are uselessLiteral hell, I'm saving up money so I can buy a phone then when I look at my drawer (where I hide my money)  earlier this week it got reduced like 20% of it. I suspect my siblings cuz I dont even open the drawer unless I put money in to it.i am both a hateful and an insecure personIt's just a excuse I throw around whenever anyone tells me why I want to leave or if I'm sitting alone, the real reason why I lose all my energy in parties or with  friends is because I am surrounded by people who get along really well. I see strangers having fun in their groups and Couples having a fun time and I'm just stuck in between either alone or with a group of friends who don't seem to pay much attention to me.


I feel really lonely just watching them having such a good time. There have been times I end up nearly puking or tearing up. 


The few times I had a person take interest and speak up with me while in a party made me feel so alive and wanted, I stayed up for 2 days partying with a close friend until he moved away last year.


I'm 23, just finished college last year. No girlfriends or close relationships yet. I don't believe in luck but if you guys could share some it would be awesome 👍.how the fuck did i just get a gf 

I dunno anyway here's a funny poem


There once was a bloke from China

Who was a very shit climber

He slipped on a rock 

And cut open his cock

And now he's got a vaginaOhhhh....It was a sex toyI made a collaborative playlist for the subreddit. Do we have a good music taste or do we just listen to the duck song 24/7? Let’s find out c: 
Go and add you favorite song(s) and hope we can create something interesting but cool out of this.

[“Teenagers be listening”](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4wz6Mb8DRaj4pgczFKZV03?si=EaUEChtQTB6dD1yOCYSIgg)pls someone start a discussion in the comments or smthand I feel like I just don’t really care that much??
We dated for like 6 months and she broke up with me and obviously I really liked her but I just don’t feel much about it
Is this normal lol ? ? ?



also she broke up with me over text lmaooooi’m legit so bored, the weekends lowkey are boring for me cause my two real friends got grown up shit to do and i’m free. so feel free to message me and do some tic tac toe or hangman, or some number game thing or whatever. 

i like switch : pokémon (sword, BDSP, arceus)
ps4: smite, the forest, gang beasts, beyond two souls, any COD, meh on rainbow (not that good), love gta V, minecraft a good vibe after a dab or two, etc
don’t have a monitor for pc, don’t have an xbox anymore

just convos pls🤣i don't know why but today r/teenagers decided to make about a billion posts talking about karma farmers posting about trans rights and shit like that. listen, we all get that those people are karma farming. there is no need for half of this sub to post about it. these are getting more annoying then the original posts that these posts are complaining about. 

just stop pleaseI am 😔How can i tell my mom i need help. My mental health is really bad and being single for valentines day is not helping. I know i need help but i am too scared to ask and dont want her feeling like its her faultMy big brother's girlfriend came over yesterday and she slept here and I haven't met her yet. I have no idea what I should say or do please send helpI FOUND SOMONE SHE MAKES ME SO HAPPY YEEEEESSSSSi was home alone and tried masturbating for the first time and uh i liked it and now i do it way too fucking much (ig hormones puberty that kinda shit) that i got a small lil scab on my dick wtf do i do i’ve been jerking off way too much  and i need a way to stop my self from jerking offWell, I've known her for 3 years, we talk everyday
Lately he treats me very well and in a somewhat strange way, she gets angry when I talk a little about my Ex, there are times when she talks to others guys and asks me "Jealous?", when we do a little roleplay she always chooses the characters who are a couple for us to do, and lately she fills me with hints and well, Whenever she needs to vent she wants to talk to me and I listen to her, since she apparently doesn't talk much about those topics with her other friends, she is interested in me or she is just playing around?Lynx (a very common deodorant brand in places like the UK and Ireland) is know as axe body spray in America.Well I am not sure i I should be asking this here but I didn't have a better option. Anyway, I always hear guys talking about masturbating and ejaculating in tissues. However when I tried doing this(I used multi0le tissues) they all got soaked and shit started dripping and it got real messy.

Ps. I am not comfortable asking this already so please don't make it harder for me :)I haven't slept at allAnd no woman likes me so being tall is a lie, just look good you’ll get wamenSo yk the way I was ranting about the teletubby porn thingy with my mum and whatever yeah that led me to start a story so I’m here now okay bye (this is only a draft of a little bit so be nice)

The kids of the class 9H were on a field trip. A small group of teenagers clambered noisily down the cheap metal steps of the yellow school bus onto the cracked pavement, drained dry from the scorching summer sun.

‘Shit, I forgot my water,’ I heard someone mutter. I couldn’t care less, I was too busy trying to revive my legs from the cramped two hour journey to get to this… what is this place anyway?

‘Ah finally! We’re here!’ Mr Halloran, my science and drama teacher, exclaimed while he was adjusting his hat.

I whisper to my friend ‘he looks like he’s exploring the african plains,’ ‘hey! I like him!’ she retorts.

‘Whatever,’ I mutter before I tie my shoelace. ‘What is this place sir?’ Said Euan.

‘This! Ah this is the place where we learn!’ He sang out while clapping his hands excitedly. I can’t believe I actually thought this might be fun. ‘We will learn all about the glorious creatures of the oceans!!’ ‘Mate you could’ve just said an aquarium’ Joanna groaned.

‘Nevermind all that, let’s get inside before we all cook’ the assistant Mr Carlisle (although all the kids just called him Tony) spoke

The rest of the kids made their way inside, but I rounded the bus into the shade and took out my jacket to sit on to keep the dust from clinging to my legs and a book, The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. I opened the book and carefully peeled the sticky note I used to mark my pages off as I began to pick up where I left off.

Law 1| 7: Authority. Avoid outshining the master~

I eventually got bored and decided to walk inside to cool off with the life-saving breeze of the chilling aircon. As I rounded a corner past reception and towards the Coral Reefs exhibit, I heard my friend, Laura, quietly conversing with a bitch that goes by the name of Freya. Freya was beautiful on the outside, with her length raven-black curls tumbling down her back, greatly contrasting her light skin and ghostly blue eyes, on the inside… not so much…

‘I’m not really her friend… never liked her anyways… my parents made me hang out with her… I’m only using her to pass maths…’ I’d heard enough from my friend, could I even call her that anymore?

I pushed the thought of Laura to the back of my mind, and set off to find the rest of the class.

As I wandered through the aquarium, I caught small glimpses of the information panels, but my class was nowhere to be found. 
I wanted anything but to draw attention to myself, so I texted on the chat asking them where they were. No answer.

‘Must just be bad signal,’ I murmured under my breath before checking my watch, 13:24. They’re probably having lunch, and so I made my way to the cafeteria.

‘Hello?’ My voice echoed through the barren hall. ‘Where is everyone?’ I questioned to myself.

The burgers still sizzling quietly on the grill with no-one to flip them… strange.
The logical thing to do would be to go to reception to ask where they were, but I was met with an empty chair.

‘This isn’t funny guys!’ I called out. It was quiet. Far too quiet.
I laughed to myself, ‘Of course! You’ve obviously just vanished from the face of the earth! Because that’s totally possible.’

I wasn’t about to start chasing fairytales, if there’s anything that I believe in this world, it’s that there is always some form of logic behind everything. 
We live in a world of logic not flying pigs for crying out loud!

Still… somethings off about it. For the first time all summer, the cicadas have stopped buzzing, the birds have stopped singing, the crickets have stopped chirping.

I’ll admit, somethings strange, but there’s a reason nonetheless. There always is.

Upon stepping outside, it appears to be normal, but I fear I’ve gone deaf, the rickety yellow bus isn’t creaking anymore and the snakes aren’t slipping between the ferns, hissing at the horseflies.

This is too weird, I’m going back to the Coral Reefs.

As I slowly patter back to the exhibit, I notice the splashing sounds of the water is gone, like the animals have simply vanished into thin air, leaving only the buzz of the aircon to accompany meI was literally on a winning position on a chess tournament, but all of a fucking sudden my enemy exploits me and I fucking lose! . Fuming right nowDon’t get to frisky down there!I have a presentation coming up, and whenever I read something in front of the class my heart would beat fast and hard as hell, my voice gets very shaky tooIt's because I am scared of the darkhttps://youtu.be/UE0hK2JrjBg

What do you thinkPlease shut up, all of the railways need to be torn downthey should👍🗿👍I'm bored sad angry horny and deadhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rDkb25xMlMHvXkx0e6_ODpU6pJpeD-WBBUbGckQKirE/editOk so here it goes. I am a 16 year old teenager and I ve known this girl (same age) for about 2 years and for about the past 3 months our talks have been getting spicier (Is that even a word?). And when the valentine week started she wished me Happy Rose Day and the next day Happy Propose Day. Now I personally do have feelings for her but I dont know if she does... When she wished me those two days she said "Since neither of us have anyone to wish I m gonna wish you". We both flirt a lot with each other and sometimes I feel like she does have feelings for me but then I get scared thinking that she might not and I m just making baseless assumptions. So when she did wish me those two days I just said Thank You or smthing like that's sweet cuz I wasnt sure how appropriate it is for me to say it back or what it would mean if I did. But when she wished me the third day and I said Thanks she said that she wants me to say it back. And I ve just been thinking a lot about all of it because I know that there is definitely something between us and sometimes I feel like I want to talk to her about it but again I get scared thinking that I m thinking too much about it and she's being friendly.What's ur take on it? I appreciate any advice as well.

This sort of turned into a rant somewhere along the way. And I know this is some super teenage stuff.... Tease me if you want. I appreciate jokes as well.  


Edit 1 - This whole talking thing has been happening over whatsapp cuz of Covid. And during the Covid I changed schools so she is from my previous school. But we still talk to each other, actually more than ever now. So I really treasure that.like fr why did she cross the road I've never heared whyI got myself a boyfriend. This is very cool and I like him a lot.Because if I'm horny, I probably don't wanna read for 2 hours before I encounter erotic stuff.

And if I actually wanna read, chances are that I don't want the erotic stuff.

Although I did spend like an hour reading one earlier, so ig sometimes worked.Normally I’m a pretty chatting, fidgety, and loud person. When I’m shooting though, whether in practice or at a match, I get real quiet, my jaw sets, I’m hyper focused on the target, it’s a distinct feeling that I am like nowhere else. This feeling lasts for like 30 minutes before and after I shoot and then I’m back to my normal self. This isn’t a bad thing or anything, it’s probably good because it means I’m in the proper shooting mindset, I just notice it sometimes and think “I am acting differently right now.” I actually kind of like it, I’m really relaxed and focused which doesn’t happen anywhere else really. 

If you read this, welcome to my ramblings. I won’t be here all night. I literally made this because it was on my mind. I have no purpose in posting this. Enjoy.

(I've been busy as fuck) but that's aside the point... How are y'allfor those who do not know, Lionmaker was an extremely popular Minecraft youtuber. a few years back hw was outed for some major pedo activities. these were not allegations, these were facts that I believe may have brought jail time (not sure tho). he has created a new account where he has been posting old/new content. even showing his face proving it to be the real him.

for those of you who know who to contact, let us know so that we can let ppl know he's trying to come back. and we wont let himI am 18 (turning 19 in a month) and I have never masterbated in my life, mostly because I always thought it was gross so I never started. However I just saw a post from someone who is 13 who posted about how we wanked it for the first time and it got me wondering, am I like the only teenager male who doesn’t masterbate. I am genuinely curious how many of people like me are there. 
I’m also curious how you started, like did you just hear about it and just thought, “why not give it a go.” This has just been floating around my head for a couple of years and that post with the 13 year old motivated me to try and get answersI have found that I mainly now come to reddit to see what fucked up, weird, gay shit that has happened while I've been sleeping, and the thing is, ALL I FUCKING SEE IS GAY SHIT, noone talks about normal shit no more like music or games you might want to play online, meeting new people on reddit or some crap, I log on and all I see is some 14 yr old fighting and arguing about whether gay or whatever people should be accepted or not, I don't give a shit, talk about something NOT controversial please, for the love of god

EDIT: I don't mean this in a mean way, just please talk about something that everyone will agree with for once, ask how someone is doing or some shit, instead of being controversial you teenaged fucks

EDIT2: Ignore the first title, new title is "Talk about something normal for a change guys, make friends for once"My parents just finished giving me a speech on responsability on the way to tennis.
And I just realized I forgot my racket.
What do I do?  💀Idk what to flair so I just chose a random one but anyways I have ADHD so like I can be up to speed with what I'm thinking because I'm also unmedicated and it's kinda hard to explain what it's like to people without ADHD but I think people with ADHD kinda get what I'm talking about anyways yeah one of my favorite games to ay is rock band 2 Because I'm a percussionist so I have that always wanting to hit things and play the songs I play in band and learn music and all that stuff and so when I have a lot of energy I play rock band 2 Because I can you know finish the fun fast songs with a good score but I can't play rock band because my sister is using the Wii and I could see if they wanted to use my Wii u to play Wii sports but there wouldn't be any of their miis and I don't want them to clutter my Wii u Wii menu with random miis and if have to set up my Wii u with my monitor so they could actually have a makeshift tv to play Wii sports on so that I could play rock band with all the unlocks on the wii and for those that are probably wondering I'm trying to play Everlong by foo fighters which if you haven't listened to I would highly recommend that you do because it's a good song and you might like it but for those who have listened to it you probably know the drum part with the constant 16th notes on the hi-hat and the bass drum and snare thing that goes on with it and it's fast and very tiring on my arms and wrists and hard to get the bass drum timing while keeping a constant speed with the hi-hat and the snare that's in there at times and if I had more energy and stamina I could totally do it which is why I drank the monster for the pep game and also so that I could have more energy for the game to have more fun at the game and wow I've written a lot and I've kinda run out of things to talk about or forgotten where I was going but anyways if I just stopped in the middle of a story then tell me I'm the comments and if you read everything you're pretty cool and I think that's about it thank you for coming to my ted talkI just moved into a new house and im the new toilet EVERY SINGLE TIME i take a shit it splashes all over my ass and that's fucking annoying how do y'all cope with that 😔?This hatred stems from the very beginning of the year, but leg me cut to the chase. 8 in the fucking morning on a Friday, she decides to talk to a student who has, for lack of a better word, behavioral issues. She says she needs to do her work and stop being on her phone. Thing is, my classmate is not very respectful to teachers, and says "Shut up, n\*gga!". Any normal human being would say "Don't talk to me like that" or "Don't use that word" but Ms. Karen had to say "DON'T CALL ME A N\*GGER" twice, loud and clear for the whole class to hear. When we call her out on it, she says we're disrespectful. And then she says "well I didn't say it in a derogatory manner, so it's ok" and "well nobody should be saying it." Of course, me and my militant ass friends decide to tell everybody and so Ms Huyck gets in trouble, but the principal (who is black BTW) just says "Don't let it happen again". She gives some bullshit Travis Scott apology, saying it was a "knee-jerk reaction" and then wanting to blame it on us, saying we need to have a mutual respect. She then wants to say "what can I do to make this class more fun", and she doesn't really let us talk to each other or anything but in fear of getting in trouble the room goes silent, so she proceeds to single out and ask all of the black kids. I, of course, lie and say I can't think of anything. But of course, this wouldn't be the end. Earlier this week, she decided to pull me over after class, since I was "mumbling" to my friend and "not paying attention". She asked if there was "some sort of underlying dislike" for her and I again lied and said I just don't really like school. I have failed to mention that I am the lead in the school musical, which she of course is directing, so she expects me to defend her and love her and be her little black boy that makes her look not racist. But also this week, she was talking to the same student from the first incident for some unrelated behavior problems. The conversation eventually escalates to Ms. Cracker saying "YOU DON'T EVEN NO WHAT N\*GGER MEANS". At this point, it's obvious she has quite the history with the word. She is definitely not the youngest, so I can only assume her parents or even her used it quite frequently back in the times of segregation. On Friday, she had to attend a "meeting", and the girl was also noticeably gone. We quickly figured out this "meeting" was really some sort of conflict resolution or disciplinary training with the student. But, luckily for us, we had a substitute. My favorite sub in fact, as she plays DnD and is overall just really cool. So, we spent half the class venting about Ms. Saggytits and the other half talking about FNAF lore because we were paranoid she was going to come back from her "meeting". Anyway, I just had to get my feelings out about her.

TL;DR:

My theatre teacher sucks at her job, doesn't take responsibility for shit, and is so racist she said the N-word 3 times in January and February alone and probably had a long history with the word prior.It's something something about minors being attracted to adults or somethingI'm cooking dinner cause u guys probably don't know how to boil water smh

(I'm good in cooking Chinese food though)Since my pc is pretty sh!t and getting older and older I don't think I can play it anymore but really missed it. I will get back when i have a better pci hate them because of how they treat their employees but i love them because i pass a 7/11 on the way home from school and the entire bus clears out and everyone who stays gets a seat, it’s great

i’m going to start putting this at the end of every post like this one: i don’t know why i posted this i just felt like itI accepted it.

I got a girl.

Edit: her parents made her leave me. I'm back with you lotEdit: lmao it workedI love his music but man just fucking broke his friendship with Cudi which is the nicest dude alive just cuz he's friend with his ex's new boyfriend,he's so childish 💀💀Chunks would load when I gave the wordIf you have one, more power to you. I’m just so sick of the culture here about “virgin=bad” and “single=sad”. 

Its completely fine and not shameful if you don’t have a valentine. I think feeling “whole” doesn’t require another person. I’m single right now and it’s been the best period of my life since childhood. Just because someone is single doesn’t mean that they’re not desirable. 

Even if you want a valentine and don’t have one, that’s fine too. Nobody should be shaming you for that. Your time will come along. 

I just needed to get that off my chest.We were playing jstris with is tetris but multiplayer and I noticed that i was getting a lot better, and i said that out loud and my friend was just “I can beat you any day of the week” and like, tf you play this game all the time (has mobile tetris) while this is my like 2nd time playinggood job bro, u said something someone else just said just to farm for karma and moral brownie points and u know it. have a cookie and a juice box and a new pet elephant and a standing fucking ovation for breaking open the same barrier that already has a gaping fucking hole in it so you can get that medal instead of actually addressing the next problem like you would if you actually gave a fuck.Reddit in reality: "you know women are hoes and i want to rape you"Go on.Like fr wtf can u do at this age?? Are u going to take them for a date with ur parents? You guys gonna lightly kiss each other on the cheeks? You gonna share a chocolate milk at lunch? 

One of my friends came up to me the other day and he looked sad, so I asked him what was wrong. He said he lost "the love of his life" on this day two years ago. Keep in mind that my friend is 14 years old, so he had the love of his life at 12 years old. Homie didnt even have pubes yet, and he was claiming he had a love of his life already. When i heard this, im sry to say this, but i just straight up cringed.like no matter what you do, whether you fake a personality or not, people will never accept you and would prefer you just sit in a corner alone, so you do just that because you don't know what else to do, and you spend your life just constantly looking for someone to give you validation

cuz it feels like that a lot for mePls3 people dmed me asking my masterbation habits, one of which is over 30??? 

Also oh so many dick picsi used to be bitchesI'm trying to sleep but I can't stop crying about something. Any ideas?My (now ex) girlfriend broke up w me yesterday. Its been such a shit day cuz i still love her so so much. Whats worse is that she also loves me but shes just thinking about it all. Yesterday a few hours after the thing she called me crying while telling me she loves me. I just don't know what to do anymore...I'm going to sleep now
Thanks for coming to my Ted talkso i just wanted to come on here and say that i hope u guys are well <3I thought I should tell the rest of you that you’re all beautiful and cute too! ❤️Thought of this because I’m not for from it.~~better than Shrek~~I was visiting a friend’s house when I noticed a show her child had been on. Caillou’s short body combined with his lustrous, circular head enthralled me to the point of soiling my panties the instant I saw him. I have had sex with hundreds of men before this moment, each of them thrusting their cocks into my ass, but their cocks didn't give me nearly as much arousement as a mere glance at his seductive body. From that point on I had dedicated myself to watching every episode of Caillou while fantasizing about Caillou ravaging my insides while playing Cailou Thug version Trap remix. I had bought a VR game as well, with a custom Caillou dildo from the creator of Caillou herself for extra enjoyment. I changed my last name to Anderson like Caillou's last name so we would be like a real family, even going as far as testing methods of contracting cancer so I could become as close as possible to him. If only Caillou really existed, I could enjoy his dick ravaging my pussy as much as he pleases everyday for eternity. Alas, it was an impossibility, a dream that would never come to fruition; no amount of Caillou butt plugs would be the same as the real thing. At that point all of my friends and family had alienated me, but that didn’t matter to me as long as I had my God Caillou with me. October 3, 2010; I sat there in despair, heartbroken and desensitized from everything around me with the cognizance that I'd never get to masturbate to another episode of Caillou ever again. As I stood hovering over a cliff over a thousand meters high ready to end it all. What was the point of living without Caillou? I stood there at the edge of the cliff, ready to end it all whilst reminiscing about all the times I would moan to the graphic Caillou poster’s and plushies in my room all the while plunging the foot long dildo into my womb. I leaned back and renounced ownership over my life.Go find God, come back when you find himImagine you're blindfolded and you're getting the best raw pornstar-grade blowjob in the entire universe. The catch is, however, that you'll never figure out who's giving you that god-tier awesome schmösome sloppy toppy unless you take the blindfold off. It could be anybody, Ariana Grande, Ben Shapiro, Harold from the 7-11 near my house, or even your uncle's neighbour's fireman's cat. Now the question is: would you take off the blindfold and find out who the person/thing behind the stupendous jimmy-nibbler is and risk permanently scarring yourself, or would you keep the blindfold on and continue having your knob slobbed till your spirit hits the sky?okay so I asked a girl to be my valentine yesterday and she said yes. problem is I have no idea what to get her. so does anyone have any ideas please?I have not drawn anything in a while and have almost nothing in my portfolio. I'm offering practically free commissions as long as I can toss them into said portfolio.

This is a bad idea, I know it. Anyhow, please give me something interesting to draw. When I retrieve my tablet pen I'll get to work.

I ain't doing any NSFW and I won't be able to draw everything commented. I'll select a few that interest me. I highly encourage broke DBD players to take a jab at this one because they always are interesting to me and I understand saving money for an illustrator is hard. Give me a brief description if you do need something of this sort.

There's a good chance this is gonna take some time so please be patient.

TLDR: comment something for me to draw and put in my portfolio because I have some artist block.At this point I’m suspiciously good at cleaning up blood 

(Former self harmer lol)I’m kinda miffed cause I answered someone’s question about what the worst part of my life was and this guy was like “I swear every mfer on this sub has been r&@*£$” 

Statistically, 81% of women and 43% of men have reported experiencing sexual harassment or sexual assault in their lifetime, and that’s only those that report! One in three female victims that have experienced completed rape were between the ages of 11 and 17, that’s the age demographic this sub is about! One in four male victims of completed rape were between the ages of 11 and 17. It’s a big problem a lot of people have to deal with. (Source: https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics)

I caught her while spoiling my table with nail polish aur throwing what ever she got from that day she is cheating me hope this funny
So let me get this straight: she doesn’t know that I like him. But the other day we were having a sleepover and we were just chilling on the couch when I asked where we should sleep tonight. My crush and best friend both jumped on the same couch, and were like “I’m claiming this!” “Well im not going anywhere?” (The latter was my best friend) than when we all decided to go to bed, my crush fell asleep on the couch, and my best friend, who was still awake and sat next to him, didn’t move. I asked her if she was sure that she didn’t want a bed, but she was all like “no, I’m fine here.” Now I’m awake while the both are laying next to each other on the couch. She was also really touchy with him the night before.Anyways want a bagel?Fellas, is it gay to have sex with a woman?no fr people on this sub in the morning (the morning for be before all you weirdos in a different time zone get mad lols) are assholesAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

Everything is hitting hard again since June 2021, I want to kill myself every day, I recently started cutting myself and I can't stop anymore, I got addicted by it.
Even if they aren't very reliable, I took 5 or 6 depression tests and they all say I am severely depressed and that such thoughts heavily affect my life.
If I just could tell someone it would be great, but I struggle telling my parents even that I feel a little sick, imagine if I had to tell them I want to kill myself every day...
(P.S. I am not in suicide danger, mine are just thoughts)In the comments section of every post about LGBTQ+ people on this sub, there are homophobic/transphobic trolls. Why don't you guys just ignore them? I always see people having endless arguments with them. Like you know damn well those trolls aren't gonna stop being homophobic/transphobic. You getting mad is what the trolls fucking *want*. Just downvote and forget about them.Goddammit what has my life come to.In my country even for a pistol that just shoots 1 bullet, you have to pay a hefty amount and a gun license is the hardest to get in my country. I am so scared of American gun laws that even if I ever get a chance to go to a school in America I would never go.And it is not real that I have no clue how much it would cost for the first two years old to have the sauce on it for the first thing to eatr/TeenFashion is a part of the TSP and it is catered to all fashion lovers, another popular Fashion related subreddit r/TeenMFA is also a part of the TSP.So a little bit of context, yesterday she asked me if I wanted to be her valentine, and I thought it was like a joke or sth so I said ‘Last tine I checked you had a bf’ and she told me he lost feelings and then they broke up. So I said yes bc I’ve never had a valentine. But now idk wtf to do on valentinesday. I guess you’re supposed to get them flowers or chocolate right?As you can read the title I wanna make some friends. I have been very sad and depressed recently because of studies and some medical issues. Sorry for bad English as it is my fifth language.so on friday i kissed this guy i have a crush on and it went well and i told him i want to take it slow. But then on saturday i got a tinsy bit tipsy and i kissed a girl i met for a little while tho. i feel bad. i also texted him some stuff and he got a bit worried. We are not dating tho we never had that convo.

this was about a week ago. so I *actually* woke up around 9:30 and then immediately fell back to sleep. I then was in some random dream for a while until I was almost killed and then realized I was asleep. as soon as I became self-aware the world grew cold and dark and I couldn't escape. I eventually woke up and started going about my day until things started going wrong, and I realized I was still dreaming. and then it turned into some weird dream labyrinth of me waking up into new dreams that deteriorated the more self-aware I became, for what felt like literal days until l I finally *truly* woke up. and it was only 10:00.  


tldr: I was trapped in a seemingly endless labyrinth of dreams for what felt like days but was actually minutesLike what the fuck was going on that is literally the bare minimum but the simple acknowledgement that i was there was gonna make me cryI just heard them blowing what sounded like a damn horn in their room at like 10:30.They look immensely different, I’m an emo, we’re pretty uncommon nowadays but still, I’ve been mistaken for a goth, and for an eboy, so many times, and it’s honestly started getting on my nerves, if you don’t know the difference, don’t say anything, if you do and you have friends who don’t know the difference, PLEASE educate them.POV1: It's the middle of the night and you wake up to a quiet sound, you notice your closet door barely opening until it is all the way open. You then wake up and look at your closet thinking it was a dream but it's wide open.

POV2: You wake up in the middle of the night to get some water but when you go back to bed you look at your closet for a sec until it violently slams open and then silence consumes the room, while you stare into the darkness.

idk why I thought of this I might need mental help lmao

(in my opinion POV2 is way worse because whatever opened the door *wanted* you to know it was there so now you have to sit there in absolute terror wondering what's going to happen while POV1 whatever is opening the door wants to be stealthy and does not know you are awake most likely)Today around 9:30 PM or so, me and my dad were in the car together and some mfs decided it would be funny to hide behind a tree and throw things at peoples windshields. While we passed them my dad was surprisingly calm but I was unsettled considering that we live in a nice suburban town without too many people. After we stopped we checked to see what it was but couldn't really tell. It was just a translucent slime without a particular smell (not cum).personally i love sasquatch and pamphletIt works lolfirst of all, I'm not an introvert.
currently I'm not in school (gap year) and all of my friends left me, i have nothing to do, i just sit in my room all day and do nothing, i think my life is getting wasted and all my time is me being on my phone, i think I'm having depression, and zero people to talk to, i want to change that, but how???? i literally have no where to go, i need serious helpme and this guy have been talking for a while and we go to the same school
but we’ve never talked to each other and we’ve been going to school together for four years and idk waht to do bvs i acc rlly like him abs stuff but we don’t have any classes together and none of our friends are mutual so idk how to talk to himI made chili with beans and it tastes so good

Its going to take a long while to recover. I need prayers!Please, I am addicted to the internet and not doing anything productive, at the same time I am not getting the feeling and interest to studyI looked all over my house but I just can't find itMy sleep schedule rn is from 23:00 to 05:00 which is about 6 hours of sleep. Alot of times I sleep at 10 tho so let's say 7 hours. When I wake up I'm tired and throughout the day I'm tired, I go sleep tired and then wake up the next morning tired, I eat enough and drink enough. The only time I don't feel tired is when I get 2-3 hours of sleep for the max.

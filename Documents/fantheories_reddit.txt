Something that always bothered and confused me about Disney's Aladdin was the ease at which he could suddenly "not be a prince" at several points in the movie, despite the fact he has specifically wished to be a prince. If I wish for 3 arms, do I not have 3 arms? it was a thorn in my side it what has always a Disney classic in my heart.


The other day I was watching the movie for the first time in many years, and the truth struck me like a thunderbolt: **Aladdin did not wish to BE a prince, he wished for the Genie to MAKE him a prince. Everything that transpires after Aladdin has made his first wish was simply the Genie (using his omni-potent powers to pull the strings behind the scenes) fulfilling Aladdin's wish to be made into a prince. At the end of the movie, he marries a princess. He now IS a prince. The Genie's work is NOW completed.** The dudes at Disney clearly had some blade runner level shit going on when they wrote the script.


The Genie states several times in the movie that his powers are both phenomenal and cosmic, virtually omnipotent and only restricted by a few rules. **He also states he can see at least one million years into the future.**  (certainly at least to the invention of automobiles) Dressing Aladdin up, giving him an elephant and a parade to make a fantastic entrance into Agrabah are **simply means to an end.** The reality is Aladdin doesn't even want to be a Prince, he just wants Jasmine. **When the Genie's mission is about to succeed Aladdin suddenly gets cold feet. The Genie -seeing into the future- allows his lamp to be stolen by Jafar and the hijinks that ensue because he knows that Aladdin's heroic efforts to set things right will convince the Sultan to change the law, and thus let Aladdin marry Jasmine, and Aladdin will then BECOME A PRINCE.** Aladdin doesn't even have a choice, he can't "undo" his wish, the wish was made and magical contract bound.


What the genie is doing can easily be seen after Jafar is banished to the cave of wonders at the end of the movie. Everything goes back to the way it was, everything Jafar did was undone, people, objects and animals un-transform. The palace magically teleport's from the mountain back to the city.  Did it ever really move? Did someone magically wish for all these things to be undone? **The Genie's knows his ultimate mission is nearing it's conclusion. So he resets the sideshow, the purpose of which was to convince the Sultan Aladdin should be a prince and make Aladdin rise to his inevitable royal promotion, both in spirit and mind.** The Sultan, clearly traumatized at crackers forcibly inserted into his mouth for hours on end (in some kind of pseudo-sexual prison nightmare) would happily make a homeless thief the next ruler in place of Jafar. It's an experience so disturbing he instantly rewrites the very laws his culture is founded upon. The Genie needs to demonstrate that true worth lies within-a Diamond in the Rough. These length's were necessary since Mind Control, Murder and Resurrection are the three things the Genie can never do. The truth is nobodies life was ever even in real danger. **The Genie has been using his mystic Machiavellian scheme since minute one to set Aladdin up as a prince. Jafar's wishes were meaningless, he was a pawn in a greater game.** 

The second Aladdin made his first wish Jafar was doomed-Jafar was in the Genie's way. The Genie is omniscient and used this rivalry to position Aladdin into prince-hood. After Jafar's part had been played out the Genie had no more use for him, since the Genie can't kill, the Genie did the next best thing and buried his sorry ass in a cave for ten thousand years. Think about the magnitude of that amount of time, it's a fate worse then death. The Genie is an unstoppable engine of destruction on a mission to fulfill Aladdin's wish by any means necessary.

We must also look at Aladdin's wish very carefully. He does not wish to "BE" a prince. He wishes for the Genie to "MAKE" ***(by force if necessary)*** him a prince.  **Aladdin may actually be aware of whats really happening the whole movie.**  This is first hint we have of this is scene in the palace Garden with the Genie. Aladdin's basically asking the Genie how to make Jasmine fall for him, and the Genies advice is to "Tell her the TRUTH". What truth? That hes a street rat? But didn't he wish to be a prince? Is he not NOW a prince? If I was Aladdin I would have thrown this in the Genies face. But Aladdin doesn't. Perhaps this is a sign that **Aladdin, the clever little devil he is, knows what game is being played, and that he is not a real prince yet.** (on many occasions, such as deceiving the Genie into a free wish, tricking Jafar ect. Aladdin proves his main attribute is his quick mind)


**When the immortal Genie lays the sad news on Aladdin he can't make someone fall in love with him, Aladdin's dexterous and cunning human brain works furiously to find a way around it. So he has a genius stroke. He wishes for the Genie to make him a prince. The creation of a kingdom has not been wished for, only that Aladdin is made a prince. And what a coincidence: the closest kingdom's princess just happens to be Aladdin's dream girl. Aladdin knows what he really wants, as does the Genie, and perhaps as a reward for Aladdin's cleverness and out of geographic and language restrictions, the Genie has no choice but to make Aladdin the prince of Agrabah. Well played, Aladdin. Well played.**


**Edit 1: **People seem to be really hung up on the seeing events/into the future genie powers. Thats really not the point I'm trying to make. The genie could just have easily implanted the whole action/adventure lamp stealing nonsense into the minds of the main characters to bring about the ending (thus the castle magically reappearing-did it even move?) The point I'm trying to make is the genie was in control, plain and simple, and the ending proves it.

**Edit 2:** In trying to see if other people had stumbled upon this, I ran into a lot of lame theories that the Genie had traveled back in time to make Aladdin's father the prince of thieves. This is all nonsense  because they are based off direct to video sequels written long after the original movie. As far as I'm concerned, the journey of Aladdin and the Genie is the story Disney wanted to tell: Everything that transpired between Aladdin's first wish and to the end of the movie was expertly orchestrated by the Genie to make him in to a prince, as he was commanded to do. I don't think the Genie is evil, he is a fun loving, free spirited demi-god. Hes slighty insane because anyone trapped alone in a cave for eons would be.* **He had a job to do, with the promise of freedom from an eternity of slavery as payment no less.**

*I stream myself writing sometimes, welcome to join me: https://www.twitch.tv/undependablexl*I'm referring to at 0:33 in this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pd0Pk5av2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pd0Pk5av2s)

Thanos moves his glove hand towards Rogers, and Rogers stops it with both hands. Thanos strains a bit more, but is unable to move his hand forward or close his grip, so he just knocks Rogers out with his non-glove hand instead.

If you look at his facial expression, he looks shocked at 0:34 upon the initial block, then at 0:38 onwards he looks really perplexed with his eyes squinting and all, like he's thinking "how is this guy able to do this"? But what is '*this*' that Rogers is doing?

I don't believe it's *physically* blocking Thanos' hand. Thanos beat up Hulk, and Rogers is definitely not stronger than Hulk, not to mention Thanos knocks out Rogers seconds later, while Rogers' uppercut punch at 0:30 did nothing to Thanos.

The glove works by responding to the will of the user, and in that moment, both of them were in physical contact with the glove. So Rogers was kind of "out-willing" Thanos, and while none of the infinity stones were actively being used, they were implicitly responding to both Thanos' and Rogers' wills respectively, with Rogers' influence being greater. And that's how he was able to resist Thanos.**WARNING: SPOILERS ARE ALL OVER THIS THEORY LIKE DEMENTORS ON AZKABAN.**

TLDR at the bottom...

Stay your pitchforks, brothers; lay down your torches, sisters; hold your downvotes Reddites until you consider the following: Ron Weasley isn't the cute, innocent boy he seems. In fact, he's possibly the biggest monster in the entire wizarding world.

**Disclaimer**: The following theory is based solely on evidence presented in the films and does not take any content from the books into consideration. **Edit**: Just to clarify - this theory is based only on the films, not the books. Unfortunately, due to the number of differences/changes between the film and the book series that sometimes contradict each other, this theory is strictly an analysis of data from the movie series.

I've watched the Harry Potter films many times over the years, and each time I always felt a little confused as to why Hermione Granger ended up with Ron Weasley. Throughout the series, Ron is (in Harry's words) a right foul git to Hermione.

* \[[1](https://youtu.be/eVE375YQL0s?t=94)\] **Sorcerer's Stone** / After the students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, Ron openly mocks Hermione to his classmates. Hermoine happens to overhear the cruel conversation and runs by, crying.
* \[[2](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4)\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Near the beginning of the movie, Ron is quarreling with Hermione about her pet cat, Crookshanks, and makes vicious comments.
* \[[3](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=52)\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Later in the film, Ron makes additional nasty comments about Hermione's pet.
* \[[4](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=121)\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / After Hagrid reveals that Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, is alive, Hermione attempts to elicit an apology out of Ron for his earlier comments. Instead of contriteness, Ron offers a disingenuous apology toward her cat to spite her request.
* \[[5](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=49)\] **Goblet of** **Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup is attacked by the Death Eaters, Arthur Weasley explicitly tells the children to stick together and run for the portkey. During this scene, Ron starts running with Hermione but fails to wait for her, leaving her behind completely while she stops to wait for Harry.
* \[[6](https://youtu.be/ZE9rtMB1TfQ?t=49)\] **Goblet of Fire** / During class, Ron laments about finding a date for the Yule Ball then turns to Hermione as a last resort. When he does, Ron tries to shame Hermione into saying "yes" by stating "it's one thing for a bloke to show up alone but for a girl it's just sad."
* \[[7](https://youtu.be/RvSgbakp1RI?t=61)\] **Goblet of Fire** / At the Yule Ball, Hermione sits with Harry and Ron while her dance partner gets drinks. Hermione is elated at the fun experience she's having which triggers Ron to make several sharp comments in an attempt to destroy her good mood.
* \[[8](https://youtu.be/rCGMWCljcqE?t=5)\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron says he will go easy on Hermione, downplaying her abilities as a student-wizard. After Hermione easily bests Ron in one move, he downplays her accomplishment by stating he intended to lose.
* \[[9](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=23)\] **Half-Blood Prince** / During an after-game victory celebration, Ron is pulled into a kiss with Lavender Brown in front a cheering crowd (including Hermione). Ron makes no attempt to stop the kiss and embraces it, instead.
* \[[10](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=105)\] **Half-Blood Prince** / After Hermione runs away from the shock of seeing Ron kissing another girl, Ron gleefully skips through the halls with Lavender Brown and stumbles upon a weeping Hermione. Though he sees she is distraught, Ron doesn't apologize or show remorse or even abandon his frivolity with Lavender. He sees that his actions have hurt Hermione and he continues to run off with Lavender.

Yet, despite being treated so horribly, Hermione decides *"yeah, this sounds like a perfectly stable foundation for a relationship”* and marries him. I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?

But upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn't paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the [**Imperius** **curse**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse) on Bogrod, the goblin teller.

* \[[11](https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.

When cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster’s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.

So why does Ron Weasley know this curse?

At first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that **I was wrong**.

Ron actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.

* \[[12](https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc)\] **Goblet of Fire** / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.

Which leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?

Casting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn’t be nearly as threatening. As we’ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does – through practice and proper form.

* \[[13](https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell’s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.
* \[[14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry’s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).
* \[[15](https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q)\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to *git guud*.

You might be thinking, *“But Harry also* [*cast the Imperius Curse*](https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186) *on a goblin and I’m sure he wasn’t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it’s just an easier spell to cast?”*

Harry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort’s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord’s abilities (as evidenced through Harry’s ability to speak [parseltongue](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue)). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn’t anyone just cast it for anything?

With that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn’t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.

So, when (or **on whom**) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?

He practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she’s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.

*“What?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that’s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.”*

Oh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let’s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?

It’s because he’s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry’s shadow.

*“Riddikulus!”*

I’m not a Boggart; that won’t work on me!

*“But Hermione wasn’t attracted to Harry.”*

Actually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.

* \[[16](https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / After Hermione repairs Harry’s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry’s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.
* \[[17](https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes. This is much different to how she looks at Ron and may be a sign that some of that early infatuation that she had still lingered.
* \[[18](https://youtu.be/TJIG-KQPnvg)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / When Hermione is cured from the Basilisk’s petrification curse, she crashes into Harry with a big, loving hug first and gives him huge smiles. When she turns to Ron, she does not offer the same warm greeting.
* \[19\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / When Professor Mcgonagall tells Harry he is unable to go on the class field trip to Hogsmeade village without a signed permission slip, Hermione looks back at Harry twice after their initial goodbye, and even offers an additional farewell wave. While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry's situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.
* \[[20](https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154)\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious. When he awakens, Hermione is at his bedside looking terrified and then relieved. She locks eyes with Harry the entire time and even plays with her hair, which can be seen as a sign of infatuation.
* \[[21](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=47)\] **Goblet of Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup game is attacked, Hermione fearfully calls out for Harry several times (while being dragged away by Ron).
* \[[22](https://youtu.be/JMrQ4uE4j84)\] **Goblet of Fire** / Just before the first trial, Hermione enters the Champions' tent and lovingly embraces Harry out of fear and worry.
* \[[23](https://youtu.be/K-tLdA55c3k?t=242)\] **Goblet of Fire** / After the second trial, Hermione rushes to check on Harry and even gives him a kiss on the head. I don’t recall Hermione giving Ron any kisses in between his fits of nasty remarks.
* \[[24](https://youtu.be/GwJKdQ_dBY0?t=98)\] **Goblet of Fire** / At the end of the film, Hermione encourages Ron and Harry to both write to her over the summer break. When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.

This isn’t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together. And even **he** was surprised to hear that Harry and Hermione were not together.

* \[25\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When Albus summons Harry to his office the first time in order to ask Harry to gain Professor Slughorn’s trust, he asks if Harry is seeing Hermione romantically.

Now, imagine you’re Ron: You’re the youngest of 5 older brothers who is always in trouble (and being howled at), constantly being teased by your older siblings, and you’re given embarrassing hand-me-down items over the years. To top it all off, you’re a Weasley (a *Weasley*!), [who are looked down](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_family) on by other wizard families. It’s not easy feeling successful in that situation.

* \[[26](https://youtu.be/YDlz1JbLLZs?t=13)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Draco Malfoy makes degrading comments toward Ron Weasley.
* \[[27](https://youtu.be/ZUl4amon00E?t=64)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Mrs. Weasley yells at Ron.
* \[[28](https://youtu.be/EvWihzwI2uY?t=77)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Lucius Malfoy makes degrading comments toward Ron Weasley.
* \[[29](https://youtu.be/fBziSx7RtqY)\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Ron receives a howler from his mother.
* \[[30](https://youtu.be/fNYo67ESmn0?t=16)\] **Goblet of Fire** / Mr. Weasley jabs Ron with a passive-aggressive quip.
* \[[31](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ?t=30)\] **Goblet of Fire** / Ron receives hand-me-down dress robes.
* \[[32](https://youtu.be/r94aUPdPgzk?t=44)\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Hermione tells Ron he has *“the emotional range of a teaspoon”*.
* \[[33](https://youtu.be/vxRqPmvGlUY?t=60)\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When asking Fred and George the price of an item in their joke shop, Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, the older brothers tell Ron the price is five galleons. When Ron pushes the issue, they raise the price to ten galleons. Immediately afterward, Ron turns away defeated and says to his friends “Come on, let’s go” in a tone that sounds as if he’s dealt with this type of thing for far too long.

Know what would make it all worse? If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone’s attention. Then that boy becomes your “best friend”, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness. Imagine how frustrating that must feel after a few years.

* \[[34](https://youtu.be/12hxT4URRGU?t=121)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / When Ron first meets Harry on the Hogwarts Express, he is so poor that is he unable to purchase any sweets from the trolley. But Harry flaunts his vast wealth by purchasing the entire trolley of sweets. This would be awesome for young Ron, at first, but eventually this becomes unbearable as he grows older.
* \[[35](https://youtu.be/f-XC-Lz2E5w?t=22)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is invited to be on the Quidditch team after barley starting the school year. Some of Ron’s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps. So it must have burned to see a kid come and take a spot on the team, thinking that it might be just because of his namesake.
* \[[36](https://youtu.be/gq0E5QN_mvo?t=66)\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is gifted the Nimbus 2000, the best flying broom in the entire school (at the time), and the gift was even from a professor. If you were in Ron’s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.

And when you’re always in the shadow of your friend’s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.

* \[[37](https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs)\] **Goblet of Fire** / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry. At one point, Ron even quips, *“yeah that’s me, Ron Weasley, Harry’s Potter’s stupid friend,”* which shows that he does actually resent being Harry’s friend, deep down.
* \[[38](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=65)\] **Goblet of Fire** / During the attack on the Quidditch World Cup, Ron is seen dragging Hermione away from Harry even though she is calling out for him. Instead of stopping to be a good guy and help his best friend, Ron makes it a priority to drag Hermione away from him.
* \[[39](https://youtu.be/bA5cIGdt9j4?t=18)\] **Half-Blood Prince** / On the Hogwarts Express, Hermione expresses concern about Harry while leaving the train but Ron immediately dismisses her concern while urging her to follow him off the train. Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.

Harry hasn’t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.

* \[[40](https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38)\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.

But the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley’s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin’s Locket, one of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed – that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn’t love him, and that he’ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.

* \[[41](https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / When Harry opens Slytherin’s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, *“I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.”* Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:
* o Ron’s mother wanted a daughter.
* o Ron’s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.
* o The locket’s shadow of Hermione also said, “Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?”

Keep in mind, Slytherin’s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley’s spirit. But also keep this in mind… If all the locket’s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket’s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron’s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to “get the girl”, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.

Now that we have a motive, let’s talk about Ron’s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?

But actually, he’s shown us that maybe he’s not the most noble Gryffindor.

* \[[42](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ)\] **Goblet of Fire** / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry’s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.
* \[[43](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.

So now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron’s darker personality.

*“But the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn’t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.”*

[Right you are, Harry!](https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9) The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we’ve seen her succumb to their requests before.

It’s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she’s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. [Stress can also have negative impacts on a person’s mental and emotional willpower](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/), and we’ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry’s safety to running off crying because of Ron’s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.

I believe Ron took advantage of that fact to **groom** Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.

[Grooming](http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming) is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person’s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.

* \[[44](https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0)\] **Goblet of Fire** / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron's choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered [manipulation](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html), which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don’t want to do through a variety of techniques.
* \[[45](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater's memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn't ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone's memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents' memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.
* \[[46](https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin’s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron’s jealousy of Hermione. Ron’s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she’s staying or going. This is an example of [basic coercive](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html) techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It’s like horrific “all or nothing” scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it’s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she’s not under a mind-controlling curse. It’s clear that Ron’s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.

Ron just isn’t an insensitive brat, he’s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.

The fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron’s influence.

* \[[47](https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.

So, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?

Considering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn’t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron’s house a few days before the start of the school year but she’s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.

More specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.

* \[[48](https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25)\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he’d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help \[39\]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione’s enthusiasm for Harry.

*“But Hermione doesn’t look like she’s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.”*

The films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, [victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes](https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123). But during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses \[12\], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins \[11\], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.

Based on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.

But while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don’t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.

If you’re still not convinced, if there’s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.

At the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron’s expression.

* \[[49](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117)\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express. We learn that Ron is now a father of three adorable little Weasley-Granger children. Harry and Hermione warmly smile as they watch their children ride off toward their first Hogwarts adventures but Ron shows no emotion. In fact, he looks a little depressed.

Ron. Looks. **Destroyed**. Hermione is smiling. Harry is smiling. But Ron? Ron looks like he dun goofed. He just stares forward with a vacant expression and eyes devoid of any joy. ~~He looks like a man who had a wild fling with a beautiful girl but then got stuck with three children and realized “oh snap, being a parent is hard! I thought this would be different!”~~

~~If his love for Hermione was genuine, why wouldn’t he be happier in this scene? Why does he look so defeated?~~

In conclusion… [Ron is a right foul git](https://youtu.be/GCqsItHrwoo), and now **you** know it.

    TLDR Version

**What happened?**

Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him, instead of Harry Potter.

**Why would you think that?**

Ron treats Hermione very poorly across all the films and Hermione doesn't take it well. But then, in Half-Blood Prince, Hermione is suddenly really into Ron.

\[[1](https://youtu.be/eVE375YQL0s?t=94)\]\[[2](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4)\]\[[3](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=52)\]\[[4](https://youtu.be/1khveF9mOe4?t=121)\] \[[5](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=49)\]\[[6](https://youtu.be/ZE9rtMB1TfQ?t=49)\]\[[7](https://youtu.be/RvSgbakp1RI?t=61)\]\[[8](https://youtu.be/rCGMWCljcqE?t=5)\]\[[9](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=23)\]\[[10](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=105)\]

**Why would he do that?**

Because he was jealous of Hermione's affection toward Harry \[[41](https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU)\], frustrated about being one of youngest Weasley siblings, and exhausted of living in Harry's shadow. \[[26](https://youtu.be/YDlz1JbLLZs?t=13)\]\[[27](https://youtu.be/ZUl4amon00E?t=64)\]\[[28](https://youtu.be/EvWihzwI2uY?t=77)\]\[[29](https://youtu.be/fBziSx7RtqY)\]\[[30](https://youtu.be/fNYo67ESmn0?t=16)\]\[[31](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ?t=30)\]\[[32](https://youtu.be/r94aUPdPgzk?t=44)\]\[[33](https://youtu.be/vxRqPmvGlUY?t=60)\]\[[34](https://youtu.be/12hxT4URRGU?t=121)\]\[[35](https://youtu.be/f-XC-Lz2E5w?t=22)\] \[[36](https://youtu.be/gq0E5QN_mvo?t=66)\]

**But Ron would never...**

In Deathly Hallows, we saw Ron suggest murder \[[43](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111)\], and in other movies Ron demonstrates abusive behaviors towards Hermione such as [manipulation](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html)\[[44](https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0)\], [grooming](http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming)\[[45](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137)\], and [coercion](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html)\[[46](https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4)\]. Other times, we see Ron pull Hermione away when she's calling for Harry, as if he resents her for focusing on Harry. \[[37](https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs)\] \[[38](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=65)\]\[[39](https://youtu.be/bA5cIGdt9j4?t=18)\]

**That doesn't mean he used an Imperius Curse...**

Ron successfully used the Imperius Curse on Bogrod the goblin teller \[[11](https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22)\]. Where did he practice it? The films established that spells require practice and proficiency to use them successfully. \[[13](https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M)\] \[[14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8)\] \[[15](https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q)\]

So how did Ron become so well practiced with such a spell?

**But the books...**

Are separate from the film universe. Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren't continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe's retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.

    Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)

Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering "let's go."

\[[E1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&t=1m55s)\] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron's controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.

&#x200B;

[u/bubblegumdog](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog) writes...

>I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn’t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  
>  
>One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione’s face fall when she grabs Ron’s hand?

\[[E2](https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120)\] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione's expression as she takes Ron's hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It's almost as if she's waking up and realizing that something isn't right. I don't believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she's starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;OK we are led to believe that all the golden tickets have been found. The news reported from Paraguay. Gene Wilder actually plays the reporter who relays the news that the last ticket has been found so we can easily make the assumption that the reporter is actually Wonka and he intentionally fabricated the report. Why? He wanted somebody to find the last ticket the pure way, not just as part of the contest to win the lifetime supply of chocolate. He also wanted somebody local for many reasons. It would be much more likely for a child to be able to stay and move his entire family into the factory if he/she was local. Also if the last kid was local there would be no logistics of getting him/her to the factory because the event was just a day away. Now lets look at how Charlie gets the ticket. He finds money and goes into the candy store run by Bill (oddly another form of William and Willy). This theory has Bill working for Wonka.  We know he likes kids and gives them free candy....lots of it..as seen in the opening Candy Man number. But you say 'Wonka has only Oompa Loomps working for him'. Not true. Remember Slugworth? At the end Wonka even admits to Charlie "He Works For Me". So we know he employs humans as double agents. Bill gives the kids candy and sells it as well. He reports to Wonka about everything. Wonka instructs Bill to give the last ticket to a local kid, a poor kid, an unselfish kid. Bill probably already knows these things about Charlie but just need to confirm them. When Charlie comes in with his found money Bill offers him a Slugworth or a Wonka. Charlie says "whichever is biggest". So he gets the Wonka. Then as Charlie is walking out he says to Bill "I also want to get one for my Grandpa Joe"...that is the clincher. Bill HAS to give the ticket today because the event is tomorrow. Charlie NEVER gets to choose what candy to buy grandpa Joe. Bill says 'here, try a traditional Wonka bar this time' and grabs one. He doesn't grab one from the stack as an owner would, he takes the display one and hands it to Charlie. He knew exactly which one had the ticket. It was displayed right out front but behind the counter so it could only be retrieved by him. Also (and this might be a bit of a stretch) when Wonka meets the kids he acts like this is the first he has heard of any of them....until he gets to Charlie and he says "I read all about you in the papers". He didn't say anything like this about any of the other kids. Could the "papers" he is talking about be a report from Bill?

EDIT: Wow. thank you so much for the kind words and the gold! Appreciated.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are saying the Paraguay reporter was not played by Wilder. This may be correct. However I swear I saw that in some reputable place a few years back and thought it was common knowledge. It is true that the actor who played that particular reporter isn't listed anywhere. Either way the theory still holds.
It's a well-worn idea that _Predator_ is a film about masculinity. You have seven men each competing for alpha status, showboating their strength, stoicism, roughness and physical power. I'd like to go a step further. I'd like to suggest that the trials of the film are a test of masculinity, and that each man who dies does so in a way that mocks his masculine performance.

Let's go through the kills in order.

**Hawkins**

Scrawny, glasses-wearing radioman Hawkins is the first to die. Appropriately enough, he is the least successful in projecting his masculinity. He fails to crack bawdy jokes about his girlfriend's vagina, finds little useful intel for the team, and kills no-one during the guerrilla camp raid.

He dies when he runs after Anna and catches the attention of the predator. Out of context, the scene almost resembles a rape - Hawkins chases Anna and wrestles her to the ground. But this dynamic is reversed when the predator runs him through, drags him on his back, strips him naked and disembowels him.

Do you remember the joke he keeps telling? It's about how big his girlfriend's "pussy" is. The predator essentially carves him a fairly large one of his own. We see him moments later, dangling upside a tree, a gaping hole in his belly.

(A ghoulish detail: Judging by the naked marines Billy discovers at the start of the film, similarly skinned and upside down, the predator doesn't just disembowel men - it castrates them.)

**Blain**

Blain's not the weakest of the remaining crew, but he is certainly the showiest, with his enormous minigun. Blain has the most famous line outside of Arnie's: when he's shot in the arm, Ramirez rushes to his aid - "You're bleeding, man!". Blain's having none of it: "I ain't got time to bleed".

Indeed he doesn't. When the predator fires a plasma bolt through Blain's torso, the resulting wound is bloodless:

    DUTCH
    ...Just like the others...no
    powder burns, no shrapnel.
    
    DILLON
    The wound all fused,
    cauterized...what the hell
    did this?

**Mac**

You remember Mac. He's the one who snatches Dillon from behind, threatening that if he blows the team's cover, Mac will "bleed him slow and quiet". He's probably the least mentally stable of the gang: by far the most menacingly violent, and with a propensity to talk to himself. When the Predator escapes the team's trap, Mac takes chase, babbling to himself, mentally decomposing into a violent trance.

You'd think that if anyone can out-sneak the predator, it's Mac, but the predator has him sussed fairly quickly. Sliding on his back, Mac suddenly sees a target on his wrist. It runs over his arm and head and - blam!

At first, it wasn't obvious to me how Mac might have prompted this death in particular. But I recalled two things: firstly, that Mac constantly, ritualistically shaves his head. He's doing it right from the first time we see him on the helicopter. So a headshot seems appropriate, though I'll admit the tie is a little weak. 

(It may be the only one in the film, though, if you interpret Ramirez's death as neckshot.)

What's more, Mac's apparent madness makes his head his 'weapon'. He's just a little crazy, and that's supposed to make him scary, but there's no brain chemistry so unstable it can't be met with a well-placed microwave pulse. So mocks the predator.

Another matter I remembered is his threat to the predator the night before: "I'll carve my name into your skin". It's actually the predator that marks Mac, with his laser sight. The triangular target is the nearest thing we ever get to the alien's calling card, and it's traced over Mac's flesh slowly and carefully. Eventually it is visually 'imprinted' on his head by force.

A final, tenuous link: Mac promises to 'bleed' Dillon 'slowly'. Mac's own death seems to be the slowest: even when his forebrain is blasted apart, we see his body continue gasping and twitching until at least scene cut (and therefore implicitly longer). Everyone else dies fast.

**Dillon**

Dutch's old friend from some unnamed army unit, Dillon is keen to show he hasn't softened with promotion into the higher ranks of military brass. He greets Dutch with an arm wrestle, and he loses. This turns out to matter.

Dillon has his arm lasered off and is shortly run through by the predator's claws.

This death is the most obviously telegraphed: it's the same arm. In the former scene, the arm is brought to the ground as it desperately pushes back; in the latter, the arm falls to the ground firing its weapon impotently.

**Ramirez**

Slim and wiry, Ramirez isn't a major presence in the movie, so this one's a little tougher to read. If you can't remember, he's the green beret who gets hit by the log trap, sent flying and landing in a crippled heap. He limps along for a little while before being unceremoniously shot in the neck.

Ramirez's greatest swaggers happen in the guerrilla camp raid. Carrying a six-shooter grenade-launcher, his well-placed blasts fling enemies through the air over and over. I counted four shots of men being thrown towards the camera by explosions in that scene, and three of them belong to Ramirez. (The other is a grenade from Billy). The film fixates on these shots enough to conclude they're supposed to be impressive, so it's a pointed irony that Ramirez is thrown through the air in a similar manner.

Not convinced? There's a little ad-hoc addition to the original screenplay. When Blain boldly asserts he "ain't got time to bleed", Ramirez quips back: "Oh yeah? Have you got time to duck?". Ramirez is later crippled by a fast-moving log to the chest that everyone else jumps under.

**Billy**

Billy doesn't swagger. He acknowledges his fear, listens to his superstitious instincts and generally prefers to act rather than talk. He is granted the most noble death of all the soldiers: an off-screen fate that preserves his mystery and lets us imagine - or rather hope - he died bravely.

But he dies all the same, because he chooses not to run. And that is the difference between him and Dutch. Running is how Schwarzenegger's character survives. He runs and falls into the river, covering himself in mud. He backs into a corner, camouflaged thermally. He lets the predator chase him into a trap, which eventually proves the alien's undoing.

Of course, there's a practical reason for Dutch to retreat: the way power shifts between man and monster makes the scene engaging and tense. It modulates our fear and hope. But it's curious how feminine our hero's cries are when we hear them from the Predator's POV; they're high pitched and whimpering. Dutch doesn't hide his pain or his fear; in fact he's actually the least ostentatiously masculine of all the squadron - his masculinity comes from acting with instinct and knowing the land, not swaggering performance.

Turns out, that's the only real masculinity that actually matters.Major Spoilers obviously and a pretty long post I've thought about for a while...


Watched IW for the 3rd time today and I realized that after Thanos obtains the soul stone, his entire demeanor changes. Even though Thanos needed the soul stone to complete his mission, I believe it ended up crippling him in the process.

Before obtaining the stone, Thanos took lots of joy in killing and completing his mission. Ebony Maw telling Cull Obsidian to "let Thanos have his fun" when fighting the Hulk implies that this is a normal thing. Thanos loves overpowering and crushing his enemies. He looked incredibly happy killing Loki, smiled when torturing Thor, smiled while torturing Nebula, and took pride in beating the Hulk. Basically, he takes joy in killing anyone that isn't Gamora.

Now, post soul stone, it seems his entire demeanor changes. I know he's sad from killing Gamora and Mantis reads his emotions and says he mourns, but I think theres more to it than that. Red Skull said the soul stone comes with knowledge, and since Red Skull knew of Thanos before he's ever met him, it's safe to assume that the soul stone forms a connection between all the living things in the universe and the wielder of the stone.

Not only does it give you knowledge of everyone in the universe, I believe it also gives the wielder insights into the emotions and motivations of those he comes into contact with. Red Skull immediately knows that Thanos isn't crying because he can't complete his mission, but because he loves Gamora. He has barely interacted with Thanos and he already understands what he loves and why he mourns. This is the "curse of knowledge" both the Red Skull and Thanos talk about. Just knowing who everyone is in the universe isn't really a curse, but having to experience and understand their struggle, pain, and emotions is the curse.

This is why the battle on Titan is so drawn out. We already saw on Knowhere that Thanos can completely manipulate reality around him, and he can instantly defeat anyone by using the reality stone. But he never once uses this power. Obviously you can say that he didn't instantly defeat everyone because that makes for a boring movie, but that's literally what he did for the first half of the movie. He completely destroys the Hulk in 5 seconds, drags Thor around like a rag doll, and just rolls up and takes Gamora like it's nothing. Even when he is able to close his fist, he unnecessarily prolongs the battle. I think the Russo brothers knew that there had to be a reason why Thanos doesn't just win instantly like he does in the first half of the movie.This is because he is crippled with empathy for the other characters. He still has the will to complete his mission, but his struggle on Titan isn't from fighting the Avengers, it's from fighting himself.

Thanos previously had no qualms about killing people who stood in his way. He was perfectly fine with killing Thor and Loki. I think the entire sequence on the Asgard refugee ship would have played out different if Thanos had the soul stone and could read all the struggle and loss Thor has experienced. Why does he suddenly feel empathy for Tony and Cap but he feels no empathy for Thor? 

Now, onto the Wakanda battle. We saw that Thanos kind of struggles when he's pushing down Captain America. He's struggling because when he makes contact with Steve, he is now feeling all of Steve's desperation. Thanos should be in a hurry, he sees the mind stone being destroyed. If you rewatch the movie, it actually looks like Thanos is holding back tears when fighting Steve. He has the exact same facial expression as when he is dragging Gamora off the cliff. He sees everything Captain America has been through in an instant.

The next person he struggles against is Wanda, who is probably feeling the most grief out of anyone he has encountered yet. He could just close his fist and disable her like he did to Drax, but he can't bring himself to do it. He isn't struggling because Wanda is powerful, since he has 5 goddamn infinity stones at this point. He's struggling again because her grief is the same grief he feels when he has to kill Gamora. They both had to kill loved ones to complete their mission. He can't bring himself to easily overpower her because he's again reminded of Gamora.

Now, the last piece of evidence. After the snap, he looks around confused and dazed. I think he can actually feel the connection to half the souls in the universe being severed at once.

Now, how does this tie into Avengers 4? Maybe Thanos refuses to wear the gauntlet because all he can feel whenever he puts it on is the overwhelming grief of everyone in the universe after having lost their loved ones. He begins to doubt his mission, and to stop himself from bringing everyone back, he won't put on the gauntlet anymore because it's too much to handle. It's the classic part of the heroes arc where the hero begins to doubt himself and what he's fighting for. 

Infinity War has always been following the arc of Thanos. I really don't want Avengers 4 to just be a rehash of the battle on Titan but with more heroes. It would be extremely disappointing if Avengers 4 was Infinity war but this time the Avengers overpower Thanos. I think it would be a more powerful statement for the avengers to stumble upon Thanos and just finding a broken, hollow man. Maybe the final confrontation happens in Avengers 4 and Thanos is forced to put on the gauntlet in the latter half of the battle, but it's too much for him to handle. No matter what the Avengers throw at him, he is easily defeating them, but the entire time we see him being overwhelmed by all the sorrow he feels when he wields the gauntlet. Maybe the Russo brothers would constantly have him being pulled into the soul stone world where he is haunted by the people he killed. So he shatters the gauntlet, killing himself in the process, and  separating the infinity stones believing that no one can safely undo the snap without him. Thanos' arc is over, and instead of just being defeated, he has become the ultimate hero in his own arc and sacrifices his own life for what he believes to be universal salvation.

This completes his arc and shows that even though his viewpoint was flawed, it was completely selfless.  He truely believed that what he was doing was right and he is forced to kill himself to ensure the snap stays permanent. He worries his will is not strong enough to resist the temptation of undoing the snap for the rest of his life, so in a final heroic act of selflessness, he kills himself, believing it is the only way. This also ties into the fact that he said "I was the only one with the will to do what is necessary". He always believed the culling of the population should be dispassionate, but it is literally impossible now that he has to bear the burden of all the sorrow in the universe.

 Then we have one of the heroes, maybe Captain America or Iron man, wield the soul stone by themselves and trade their lives for the people who died. This offers a kind of parallel between Thanos and our heroes. Maybe Captain America sacrifices himself and we get a sad reminder of how Cap was originally willing to lay down his life in World War 2. Maybe his life flashes before his eyes and the last thing he sees is Peggy reaching out to him. Maybe Iron Man sacrifices himself and we get a reverse IW situation where spiderman holds Tony as he dies. But this time it's not hopeless, but bittersweet.

The Russo brothers did a great job of making Thanos perhaps one of the most empathetic villains in the MCU, so I really don't think they'll go the "ultron route" and have the avengers defeat Thanos by shooting different energy beams at him (god, still feel upset by that ultron ending). They want the audience to feel conflicted about the defeat of Thanos. They see a character who sacrificed the only person he loved in the world and also killing himself, only to have his life mission undone. Obviously most of the audience will root for the avengers, but I think ending this arc on a bittersweet tone really will separate this movie from others. 

TL;DR Sad Purple Grape man gains the power of mega empathy and basically ends up defeating himselfOwning and running the chocolate factory was not a positive experience for Wonka. It took a very obvious toll on his mental health and made him basically unable to interact with other people. The trials he laid out were to see if the potential kids could take care of the factory. Augustus Gloop proved he would either eat or contaminate the product, Violet couldn't follow rules and let her own temptations disqualify her, Veruca was just mean and couldn't get along with the workers (squirrels), and Mike basically failed for the same reasons Violet did. All of these kids would probably either ruin the factory or sell it for cash. 

But Charlie was the only one just gullible enough and innocent enough to take care of the factory and follow the rules forever, and Wonka saw that he was the only one suitable to push this hellish existence on. He'll be fine in the near future when his family is alive but when they're all eventually gone then he'll likely realize Wonka's factory was never a reward at all. With the golden ticket scheme, Wonka was trying to expand his company's empire. All five of the children were specifically chosen because of their preexisting relationship to food. Take a look at Veruca Salt. Her family owns a nut factory, a logical business pairing with a chocolate manufacturer. Mike Teavee is an unwitting expert on media, advertising, and technology because of his addiction to television. On the tour, Wonka specifically shows Mike the prototype for Wonka Vision. Although Mike fails the test, I believe Wonka's original goal was to put Mike in charge of this innovative technology. Violet Beauregarde holds the world record for gum-chewing, so who better to help with the development and advertisement of his new Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum? Violet could give some valuable input on the creative process, and she could use her gum-chewing fame to promote the product. On top of being known for his appetite, Augustus Gloop's father is the most prominent butcher in Drusselheim. Perhaps Wonka was looking to expand to a more international market, or invest in foods unrelated to chocolate. Lastly, I think Wonka chose Charlie Buckets to be the heart of the company. His rags to riches story would inspire and give the big business some emotional capital. He also comes from a frugal family, so he knows how to be efficient with finances. It is important to note that Charlie is the only one who "wins" in the end, so although Wonka's original intent was to branch out to four new markets, Charlie's good heart was the end goal for Wonka's company vision.**This theory has a lot of evidence and took a few Reddit posts to fit.

*EDIT:* This got way bigger than I expected. I'm in awe at the size of this post. Thank you! I simply don't have time to respond to everyone like I hoped, I'm sorry. Still, enjoy.

I started a read-through of Harry Potter recently, and I was determined to pay close attention to Snape early on with interest to viewing his character through the lens of a double-agent. However, early on I noticed the strangest behavior coming from Hagrid instead which I had never noticed before. I started paying more attention to the actions, statements, and inconsistencies in Hagrid and realized almost every move taken somehow aided Voldemort. I read the entire series watching for anything to prove or disprove Hagrid being a Death Eater, and by far the majority of the evidence points toward Hagrid as a servant of the Dark Lord.Is this what J.K. Rowling intended? Almost certainly not! Is this theory given entirely seriously? Definitely not. I still find it to be intriguing given the amount of evidence which supports the conclusion that Hagrid is one of the top servants of Voldemort. In short, what I posit and will provide evidence for:

1. Hagrid is a high ranking servant of Lord Voldemort.
2. Hagrid is secretly much more talented of a liar than he lets on.
3. Hagrid is secretly a much more talented wizard than he lets on.
4. Hagrid has been performing deep cover tradecraft, espionage, source validation, sabotage, and spotting and assessing for Voldemort.
5. Hagrid has been in the service of Lord Voldemort at least since the First Wizarding War, potentially since his time at Hogwarts.

**Scope of the Evidence**

I will lay out the evidence in chronological order as it is presented in the books, while referencing supporting pieces of evidence from the rest of the series. I am basing this theory entirely on what is textually presented within the original 7 Harry Potter books and not based on other material such as video games, movies, Cursed Child, Pottermore, or the word of J.K. Rowling outside of the text.

**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone**

Summary

In the Sorcerer’s Stone, we see the following from Hagrid:

* Magical abilities Hagrid uses which are otherwise only known by high-level Death Eaters or extremely talented wizards and witches.
* Disregard to and participation in cruelty to Muggles, as well as a casual approach to Azkaban-level offenses.
* Subtle manipulations of Harry which put him into private contact with Voldemort on multiple occasions.
* Passing private information regarding security directly to Voldemort.

The Evidence

*Hagrid’s immediate presence at the Potter residence indicates that he knows advanced fast-travel magic.*

When we first meet Hagrid he is delivering baby Harry to the Dursleys’ house. He rides in on Sirius’ motorcycle with the child for delivery, and mentions to Dumbledore and McGonagall how the Potter house was almost entirely destroyed “but I got him out before the Muggles started swarmin’ around.” We know from later books that Sirius gave Hagrid the motorcycle while at the Potter residence. Godric’s Hollow is located somewhere in the West Country portion of England, and we know that Hagrid lives at Hogwarts, somewhere in the Scottish Highlands. We also know that Hagrid is not allowed to use magic due to his expulsion from Hogwarts, which places his magical ability supposedly at the third year level.

Hagrid had to be able to travel to Godric’s Hollow and arrive at the Potter residence before any emergency services arrived, beating their travel time in response to an explosion that blew out the entire side of a house. Hagrid arrived and took the child away, having run into only one other person, Sirius Black. Hagrid is too heavy to ride a broom or thestral, as he states in Book 7; Apparition is only taught in the fifth year and requires a Ministry-issued license. Portkeys need to be approved by the Ministry. Hagrid would not have learned any of this magic in his three years at Hogwarts. He does not have the flying motorcycle until he already arrives at Godric’s Hollow. The only two explanations are: he is using some sort of magic to travel quickly, or he already happened to be in the area of the attack on the Potter residence and was able to respond to the unexpected explosion immediately.

Without means of fast travel, Hagrid would have needed to already be hanging around Godric’s Hollow, but why would he do this? There is no previous connection between Hagrid and Godric’s Hollow other than his having known James and Lily, and the attack from Voldemort on the Potter family was unexpected to the Order of the Phoenix. It’s much more likely that Hagrid has a means of fast travel, which indicates a much more advanced level of magic than we expect from him.

*Hagrid knew where to collect Harry, likely because Wormtail told him.*

How did Hagrid even know where to collect Harry? We know James and Lily were in hiding using the Fidelius Charm. This charm prevents any person except those told by the Secret Keeper (Wormtail) from knowing where the Potters were, nor could anyone but Wormtail tell someone else. The only people mentioned in the books who knew where the Potters were hiding were Wormtail, Dumbledore, Sirius, and Voldemort. In Book 7, Harry surmises the Fidelius Charm died with his parents; as he was not Secret Keeper, Dumbledore could not have told Hagrid where the house was until after Wormtail or the Potters died. Yet somehow Hagrid appeared at the residence within minutes after the attack. It is possible that Dumbledore tells Hagrid where to go immediately after the Potters are killed, but the necessary conclusion in that case is that Hagrid is capable of high-level magic, as well as creating the question of how Dumbledore knew of the Potters’ deaths. Given that Wormtail doesn’t die until Book 7, the much more straightforward conclusion is that Hagrid knew where to go in Book 1 is that Wormtail had let him in on the secret along with Voldemort.

*Hagrid knows about the function and effects of Horcruxes, and that Voldemort used them.*

Horcruxes are a very powerful type of magic known only to a few people in the books. Using a Horcrux, you can hide away part of your soul in another object, losing part of your humanity, in order to stave off death. The books’ first reference to Horcruxes is in Book 6… except for the reference made by Hagrid in the very first book.

In one of his first conversations with Harry, Hagrid says that Voldemort did not actually die, commenting “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die... Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on.”

Despite what Hagrid says, believing in Voldemort’s survival is a complete aberration to the attitude we see from the rest of the wizarding community. Hagrid’s comment also turns out to be both very specific and very accurate regarding Voldemort’s reality. The only other people we know were aware of Horcrux magic were Dumbledore and Slughorn, so it is meaningful that Hagrid makes specific references to their function and effect on the user.

In Book 4, chapter *The Death Eaters*, Voldemort confirms some of the Death Eaters know about his Horcruxes: "I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?" The first person in the books who displays a belief in what Voldemort refers to is Hagrid.

*Hagrid growing a pig tail on Dudley demonstrates that Hagrid is one of the most powerful dark wizards we see in the entire series.*

We see Hagrid do two amazing things in his very first appearance: he uses a fairly powerful spell with a broken wand, and he uses it in retribution against the Muggle that is bothering him by hurting his Muggle son. This shows both Hagrid is more capable than he lets on, but also shows a blatant disregard for wizarding laws and the safety of Muggles.

After Vernon calls Dumbledore a crackpot, Hagrid uses transfiguration on Dudley turning him into a part-pig, part-human. The transfiguration, against Dudley’s will, was severe enough it required surgery to remove his newly grown tail. Hagrid claims he made an error, and meant to turn him into a pig entirely, although we can’t be sure he is telling the truth. He performs this magic non-verbally while using a wand that was snapped in half. So how advanced of magic is this?

Transfiguration is considered a challenging and exact magical discipline. Human transfiguration is considered extremely advanced, and is only taught at the N.E.W.T.-level. In the sixth year at Hogwarts, one of the spells McGonagall teaches is the transfiguration of the color of one’s eyebrows; this is shown to be extremely difficult for sixth years to perform, and only Hermione seems capable. How does a mostly untrained, third year level wizard with a broken wand, who is forbidden from even practicing magic, perform something that is only taught at N.E.W.T.-level, and something far more advanced than anything we see sixth years learn? He even performs the spell non-verbally, something so challenging that few wizards can do it at all. Non-verbally growing an entire pig's tail permanently on a human, with a broken wand, is more advanced than most magic we see in the entire series.

The second major element in this scene is Hagrid using a powerful spell against a Muggle in a hostile manner. Magical law has many restrictions, and while this event takes place prior to Arthur Weasley’s Muggle Protection Act, there certainly were protections provided for Muggles in the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Hagrid not only shows a complete disregard for a person’s safety, but he loses his temper and does so with complete hostility. Afterwards, Hagrid makes no attempt to reverse the spell, and cheerfully goes on with his life while Dudley is forced to get surgery.

*Hagrid learned unaided flight from Voldemort.*

Unaided flight is a remarkably rare ability, as we see only two wizards in the entire series able to do it: Voldemort and Snape. Wizards require a mechanism to convey them through the air, usually a broomstick, although we see thestrals and enchanted vehicles used as well. Voldemort invents unaided flight and subsequently teaches it to his closest lieutenant, Snape. In Book 7, during *The Sacking of Severus Snape*, we see the following conversation after Snape flees out of a window without a broom:

“‘No, he’s not dead,’ said McGonagall bitterly. ‘Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand… and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.’

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.”

We know Voldemort can teach people to fly unaided, and he teaches Snape how to do this. Why is this relevant to Hagrid? There is one circumstance in which Hagrid travels which cannot be explained by any other means.

In Book 1, during *Diagon Alley*, Hagrid collects Harry on an island. The boat which the Dursleys and Harry used to reach the island is still docked there when Hagrid arrives. Harry is understandably confused:

“‘How did you get here?’ Harry asked, looking around for another boat.

‘Flew,’ said Hagrid.

‘*FLEW?’*

‘Yeah - but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”

We know Hagrid flew to the island. He no longer has Sirius Black’s motorbike, and there is no other vehicle left on the island besides the boat. We also know that Hagrid did not fly a broom to the island. In the same chapter, Harry needs to pay the newspaper owl and he searches through the sleeping Hagrid’s coat. Harry digs through the pockets enough to comment on keys, slug pellets, balls of string, and teabags, but he never mentions a broom; something that would be far more notable. Another reason we know he didn’t take a broom is the same reason we know he didn’t take a thestral: in Book 7, during *The Seven Potters*, Hagrid says, “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see.”

So how did Hagrid fly to the island? There are no creatures on the island, a broomstick or thestral would not have supported his weight, and there are no enchanted vehicles on the island. There is only the one boat, which Hagrid uses to sail back with Harry, cruelly stranding the Dursleys on the island with no escape. The only other method of flying we know of is Voldemort’s means of unaided flight which he teaches to his closest followers: Snape and presumably Hagrid.

*Hagrid personally introduced Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort’s servant.*

The first place Hagrid takes Harry after collecting him is Diagon Alley. It just so happens to be timed exactly when Professor Quirrell, Voldemort’s servant, is there. While everyone is introducing themselves to Harry, the only person Hagrid specifically singles out and introduces is Quirrell. Once everyone else in the bar pushes Quirrell away, Hagrid ends the “unplanned” meet-and-greet and takes Harry away. Afterward, Hagrid specifically discusses Quirrell, out of all the people in the bar. While it may be a coincidence Quirrell happened to be at the Leaky Cauldron on this day, at this time, during Harry’s impromptu visit, it is more likely a coordinated effort between Hagrid and Voldemort in order for Voldemort’s servant to come meet with his target.

*Hagrid purchases a conspicuous and easily-surveilled owl for Harry.*

Right after Hagrid introduces an 11-year-old Harry Potter to Quirrell, he decides to leave Harry - a defenseless and naive child - alone in Diagon Alley, in order to return to the place where Voldemort is. Afterward, Hagrid continues to shop with Harry, deciding to buy Harry a birthday present in the form of an owl:

“Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, ye’d be laughed at - an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”

Hagrid buys a beautiful, white snowy owl named Hedwig… certainly a creature which stands out, and which would be easily tracked and followed, as described in Book 4 in the chapter *Beauxbatons and Durmstrang*. Sirius, on the run, sends a letter stating, “Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing owls.” Ron questions this, and Hermione states:

“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention… She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding… I mean, they’re not native birds, are they?”

Hagrid, always looking out for Voldemort’s interest, specifically purchased Harry the most conspicuous owl we ever see, which would be easy to track and observe, which is all the more suspicious given that he did so right after returning to the last known whereabouts of Voldemort’s other servant.

*Hagrid personally delivers Harry Potter to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest.*

In Book 1 Neville, Hermione, Draco, and Harry attend detention in the middle of the night with Hagrid. For some reason, Hagrid decides to take first years into the Forbidden Forest, where he is worried enough about the dangers he brings his crossbow. He then immediately splits the children into two groups to walk on two separate trails. In the end, two 11-year-old children are going down a trail in the middle of the night with a cowardly dog, alone in the Forbidden Forest on a path selected by Hagrid, during an excursion which Hagrid knew about ahead of time and had ample time to plan. This is a level of irresponsibility rarely seen even in the Harry Potter books. Harry and Draco walk directly into Voldemort’s path in the forest. Draco and Fang retreat, leaving Harry completely alone with Voldemort. If not for the timely and unexpected arrival of Firenze, Harry would have made the most welcoming and effortless target for someone who has wanted him dead for over a decade. All of this is easily explained because Hagrid is Voldemort’s servant, and as such had informed him early on about the plan for detention and which direction Harry would be headed.

*Hagrid constantly endangers Harry with illegal and dangerous activity.*

Hagrid acquires a dragon egg, then subsequently agrees to get rid of the dragon after it hatches. Hagrid does not provide basic safety information, training, or any sort of assistance for handling the dragon. A person who later shows sufficient knowledge to teach Care of Magical Creatures would know the dangers involved with dragons. When Norbert bites Ron, Hagrid doesn't urge medical care or even attempt basic first aid, resulting in Ron’s first near-death experience. He then persuades three unqualified and untrained first years to commit to an illegal smuggling operation after curfew on his behalf. If Hagrid was a Death Eater, this situation is a win-win. If the dragon injures or kills the children, Voldemort’s enemies are dead. If they are caught, their education is impacted and he knows they won't rat him out. If they succeed, he builds a trusting relationship with them which is based on illegal activity they can't share with other adults and, if needed, develops compromising material on them. The third ends up happening, and Hagrid is able to continue developing the relationship by gradually introducing more and more nefarious and dangerous activity throughout the rest of the series.

*Hagrid willingly provides sensitive security-related information to Voldemort, and fails to report it to his employer.*

Hagrid and Dumbledore are the only people we know of who were aware that the Sorcerer’s Stone was being kept in Vault 713 at Gringotts, in a highly-secure and secret location. It’s worth noting that the only other person who is aware of its location is Quirrell-Voldemort, and it’s much more likely that Hagrid told him where it was rather than Dumbledore.

Once the Sorcerer's Stone arrives at Hogwarts, it is concealed behind a series of magical protections to safeguard it from Voldemort. Hagrid provided Fluffy, the three-headed dog and first line of defense. Hagrid may not have known the protections the other professors created, but he knew their identities, and he knew the location of the stone. We know for a fact he revealed the solution to his segment of the operation, and very likely the location and other professors’ identities to Voldemort.

What Hagrid revealed was severe: he states himself that he offered up all information regarding Fluffy, in a game of cards where he won a dragon egg from a stranger. It is easy to accept that someone could get drunk and share information with a fellow enthusiast, accidentally relaying secret information in the process. It’s much harder to accept that someone as suspicious as Quirrell was getting the information out of a Hagrid who is so lucid and aware that he remembers specific details of this interaction months later with surprising clarity, but never once shared this interaction with any other professor or Dumbledore. It is far more likely that Hagrid wittingly shared secrets and kept this exchange to himself, having been fully complicit in revealing security-related information in exchange for a valuable and highly desired prize.

The stranger was acting remarkably suspicious in Hagrid’s extremely detailed recollection, and Hagrid even remembers sharing private information with him. He can’t describe the stranger because he wouldn’t take his cloak off, and therefore Hagrid couldn’t see his face. Hagrid remembers discussing Hogwarts, his involvement with magical creatures, Fluffy specifically, and how to get past Fluffy. He relays all of this to the trio.

Hagrid blames the drink, but has a remarkable recollection of the night. More likely he was witting in passing information to Quirrell. He is also aware of the seriousness of sharing privileged security information about the Sorcerer’s Stone to a stranger and says as much to the trio, but despite this he never reported the encounter to anyone else.

*Hagrid sends the trio alone to Voldemort.*

Without Hagrid, Harry would have never been involved in the security operation surrounding the Sorcerer’s Stone, and neither may ever been at risk. Hagrid first peaks Harry’s interest by bringing him to Gringotts on his top secret mission, but the details quickly dry up for the trio. At this point, Hagrid "lets slip" the three-headed dog is guarding something for Dumbledore, and that it involves Nicolas Flamel. This renews the trio’s interest, and gives them the leads they desperately needed. As their sole source of information, Hagrid is quite obviously providing them a trail of breadcrumbs.

Later, Hagrid confirms to the trio the existence of the Sorcerer’s Stone at Hogwarts. Then Hagrid invites the trio to his hut, where he leaks information on everyone who has put a protection on the Stone, information he assuredly passed to Voldemort.

Finally, on the night Dumbledore is gone and Voldemort gotten past all the defenses, having been informed ahead of time about Fluffy and likely the expertise of the other professors who contributed, Hagrid not only provides the final puzzle piece to the trio. Hagrid tells them that music will put Fluffy to sleep, but gives them a sense of urgency by telling them in great detail about the shady stranger in a bar. Hagrid provides just enough information for the trio to pursue the Stone themselves, but too late to get an authority figure to intervene, at a time when Dumbledore is conveniently gone. Even more dangerously, once the trio leave to secure the Stone, Hagrid does not stop them, pursue them, or even tell a single other person at school about the breach in security or the whereabouts of the kids. Hagrid simply does not take any obvious course of action any good or normal person would do under these circumstances. As a result of his actions, Voldemort knows precisely the location and security vulnerabilities of the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Harry has enough information to once again find himself in a room alone with a person who wants to kill him. Finally, Harry himself was one of the only ways Voldemort could bypass the Mirror of Erised, and Hagrid adroitly led him to the Stone on the exact night Voldemort needed him.

The only question remains: Why didn't Hagrid just deliver the Stone to Voldemort himself? There are several reasons: the Stone would have only been a relatively temporary solution to a problem that could have been solved through other means. Also, Hagrid had specific instructions from Dumbledore. To renege on those instructions would not only have jeopardized Hagrid's valuable placement, it would have revealed to Dumbledore Voldemort’s return, a fact Voldemort went to extensive lengths to try and conceal in Book 4. Finally, Voldemort knew where the Stone was hidden, and despite what Hagrid says, the defenses at Gringotts seem stronger by far than those placed on the Stone at Hogwarts. Hagrid was instrumental in providing the Stone to a location at which Voldemort could both retrieve it and also kill Harry Potter at the same time.

**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets**

Summary

In the Chamber of Secrets, we see the following from Hagrid:

* Hagrid knows who Voldemort is, and has known him for years.
* Hagrid spends time in areas known for dark wizards and witches without explanation.

The Evidence

*Hagrid is one of Voldemort’s oldest associates, and knows his true identity.*

The true identity of Voldemort is a mystery only known to a few people. Dumbledore himself says, “Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts."

Who else was around fifty years ago at Hogwarts who knew Tom Riddle aside from Dumbledore and Slughorn? Hagrid, who was on a first name basis with him. The same Hagrid who was a member of the original Order of the Phoenix dedicated to fighting Voldemort, and a confidant of Dumbledore. Hagrid is the longest known associate of Voldemort other than Dumbledore that we know of. Hagrid is certainly aware Voldemort is Tom Riddle, the boy he knew. In the *Diagon Alley* chapter of Book 1, he told Harry that Voldemort was a Slytherin, and confirmed he went to Hogwarts years and years ago, something nobody else but Dumbledore or Slughorn know, tying Voldemort to Riddle. Hagrid never again mentions knowing Tom Riddle, nor Voldemort. He never alludes to his history with Voldemort, which spans decades longer than anyone except Dumbledore. Who knows what kind of relationship could have developed that long ago and with no one else to confirm or deny?

*Hagrid Suspiciously Hangs Around Knockturn Alley*

In the chapter *Flourish and Blotts* of Book 2\*,\* Harry misuses Floo powder and finds himself in Knockturn Alley. It’s a dodgy place, filled with sketchy wizards, and is home for shops devoted to the dark arts. Molly Weasley is horrified upon hearing Harry was there. Who does Harry happen to run into there? Hagrid. Hagrid is supposedly in a sketchy alley with shops devoted to the dark arts and a sinister reputation in order to ostensibly buy gardening supplies for his cabbages - a mundane activity far from the dark arts and which should be available to him in Diagon Alley. Hagrid's true reason for being in such a place in never elaborated on or explained; we only have his word for it.

**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**

Summary

In the Prisoner of Azkaban, we see the following from Hagrid:

* Hagrid has developed access and placement to all of Voldemort’s enemies and priority targets.
* Hagrid purposefully spreads misinformation and rumors which only serve to aid Voldemort.

The Evidence

*Hagrid maintains unusual access to the powerful and influential, including Voldemort’s main targets.*

Hagrid works as the groundskeeper and Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts. He is a school drop-out with minimal education, a controversial half-giant many people don’t want around their children, and an all-around gruff person working a blue collar job at a school. People constantly judge him and look down on him throughout the series, largely due to his brusque manner and social clumsiness.

How then is Hagrid able to associate with some of the most rich, powerful, and influential people in the world in such a casual capacity? His access and placement as a source is astounding, and he very likely had to put in a lot of effort and outreach to obtain his position as an individual with access to so many powerful people. Hagrid strikingly and effortlessly maintains the following relationships:

* As a confidant of Dumbledore, Hagrid  is given secret missions of the utmost importance.
* Hagrid has a friendly association with the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, and is on a first name basis with him.
* Hagrid is a longstanding member of the Order of the Phoenix.
* Out of all adults in the series, Hagrid maintains the closest relationship with Harry Potter and his friends.

For a supposedly socially-clumsy blue collar groundskeeper, school dropout and half-giant, having these associations are downright incredible. And perhaps most importantly, they all happen to be targets of great interest to Voldemort.

In Book 3, during the chapter *The Marauder’s Map*, a group of people go out for drinks together in Hogsmeade: Professors McGonagall and Flitwick, Minister Cornelius Fudge, and Hagrid. Two illustrious professors and heads of houses at the major wizarding academy ... and a groundskeeper. Hagrid and Fudge are already deep in conversation when the professors enter, and during the course of the evening Fudge shares secret investigative details regarding the Black investigation.

Hagrid was also one of the early members of the Order of the Phoenix from the First Wizarding War, as well as the renewed group from the second. He was privy to their secret plans and operations.

Finally, Hagrid is one of the closest people to Harry in the entire series, which he cultivates carefully through Harry’s years at Hogwarts. More on this in the section on the Half-Blood Prince.

*Hagrid’s penchant for rumor-mongering spreads divisiveness and aids Voldemort’s operations.*

Hagrid spreads information which is oftentimes private or has no reason to be discussed except that in doing so, he serves the purpose of turning good people against each other or sowing confusion. This is best exemplified by a conversation in *The Marauder's Map* of Book 3. McGonagall, Flitwick, Fudge, and Hagrid are all discussing private information surrounding Sirius Black.

As the readers learn, Black is innocent and has always been opposed to Voldemort. The Death Eaters that know this, such as Bellatrix Lestrange, seem elated that Black is being blamed for murders he didn’t commit. Almost nothing aids Voldemort more than discord and distrust between members of the Order of the Phoenix and the wizarding community at large. In addition, the spread of misinformation leads to the Ministry’s wasted efforts, resources, fear mongering, and proliferation of Dementors in public spaces.

In the scene, Rosmerta, the bartender, has already heard some private information about Black from Hagrid. This prompts McGonagall:

“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.

McGonagall’s exasperation implies this has happened before, and we know Hagrid has let slip secrets which served Voldemort before. The information Hagrid shares always seems laser targeted toward helping Voldemort, such as the details surrounding the Sorcerer’s Stone operation.

The bar scene continues: Fudge reveals secrets about the Potters’ murder, including that Sirius was Secret Keeper, his confrontation with Wormtail, and his subsequent arrest. Fudge’s story is wrong, of course, but the Ministry's incorrect understanding paints Black as a traitor to the Potter family. All of this occurs under hushed tones, as the pub is “extremely crowded”.

Despite the obvious private nature of the conversation, Hagrid takes the opportunity to let loose:

"'Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!' Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet."

He then proceeds to yell all of the private details, down to the exact names and sequence of events which paint Sirius as a traitorous mass murderer, even though McGonagall urges him to keep his voice down.

Hagrid knows better than this; he shows a knack for keeping secrets and performing covert duties which we will talk about in Book 5. Given the information, location, source, and level of detail provided, Hagrid’s outburst in the pub can be nothing but intentional. It only serves to bolster Voldemort's agenda by sowing distrust, unnecessarily wasting Ministry resources, and taking the heat off of Voldemort himself..

**Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**

Summary

In the Goblet of Fire, we see the following from Hagrid:

* Hagrid coordinated with Crouch Jr, disguised as Moody, to deliver Harry to Voldemort.
* Hagrid illegally and unethically cheated in the Triwizard Tournament.
* Hagrid saved Voldemort's wand.

The Evidence

*Hagrid has an established relationship with Barty Crouch Jr.*

Mad-Eye Moody, secretly Barty Crouch Jr using Polyjuice Potion, is a Death Eater sent by Voldemort to ensure Harry wins the Triwizard Tournament. Moody is shown to be very aloof and unfriendly with just about anyone. In the chapter *The Hungarian Horntail* in Book 4, Hagrid is spotted in Hogsmeade sitting alone in a private conversation with him.

Hagrid is crouched low and obviously trying not to be overheard, in stark contrast to his yells and lack of secrecy with the Minister in the previous book. There is no established relationship prior between Hagrid and Moody, or any reason they would go off to Hogsmeade for a private drink together, especially one in which they are conspiring. Once they get up to leave, Crouch-Moody spots Harry under the Invisibility Cloak; Hagrid soon after extends his secret invitation to Harry to preview the first task.

This advance warning of the first task for Harry is obviously one of the things they discussed in their hushed, secretive conversation. Hagrid is the only adult we know to have a good one-on-one relationship with Crouch-Moody, who loops the supposedly honest Hagrid in on a plot to unethically cheat for Harry in the Triwizard Tournament. Given the lengths that Crouch is going to in order to conceal his identity, as well as the extreme sensitivity of the operation, it’s incredible that he trusts Hagrid as much as he does. The most likely explanation for this is that Hagrid actually knows Crouch-Moody, they have an established relationship, and the same goal: Get Harry to the Triwizard Cup, and thus to Voldemort.

*Hagrid cheats for Harry in the Triwizard Tournament, coordinating with Crouch to deliver Harry to Voldemort..*

Without Hagrid, Harry never would have been able to win the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid pressured Harry to compete, gave him insider information, conspired, and cheated on his behalf. Only two people knowingly cheated for and contributed to Harry's success: Crouch-Moody and Hagrid, who conspired together to do it. The end result is Harry being delivered into Voldemort’s trap, taking the Cup/Portkey to the graveyard and restoring Voldemort’s body. Hagrid contributed to Harry's success in the following ways:

* Hagrid planned with Crouch-Moody to unethically provide advance notice of tasks ahead of time (*The Hungarian Horntail)*
* Hagrid escorted Harry to the site of the first task in order to observe the dragons ahead of time and make preparations. Crouch conspired with Hagrid to concoct a plan and relay to Harry; further, Hagrid is aware of the illicit nature of the activity, as he told Harry to bring his Invisibility Cloak to avoid getting caught.
* Hagrid, the new Care for Magical Creatures Professor, assigned his students with raising Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry even helped Hagrid outside of class with the biggest and fiestiest of them. Blast-Ended Skrewts were one of the maze challenges, which Harry was exceptionally prepared for over the other competitors, who were unfamiliar with them.
* Hagrid was undoubtedly involved in preparing the challenges, given his extensive experience of many of the Triwizard creatures. One challenge, giant spiders (presumably Acromantulas), Hagrid knows for a fact Harry has dealt with successfully in the past. Indeed, Hagrid was the very person who had introduced Harry to the Acromantulas two years prior in Book 2.

Between Crouch-Moody and Hagrid, the only parts of the tournament Harry did not have an unfair advantage on were the Sphinx and the limbo mist. All of Hagrid’s careful preparation served to deliver Harry to Voldemort on a silver platter.

*Hagrid dutifully kept Voldemort’s wand safe for 13 years.*

Voldemort’s wand, which Ollivander sold him when he was 11, is a yew wand with a Phoenix core feather, and twin to Harry Potter's wand. This is the wand he took to the Potter residence to kill Lily and James.

Later, we see Voldemort has this wand in his graveyard duel with Harry Potter where the cores connect in Book 4 (*The Death Eaters)*. We also see him reference using it in his conversation with Snape in Book 7. In the chapter *The Elder Wand*, Voldemort says,

\*\*"\*\*My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed."

After 13 years of hiding, how did Voldemort get his wand back? In a world where a third year who is expelled has their wand snapped in half, I would guess the darkest wizard of all time should have it destroyed as well. But instead, Voldemort’s wand was already in the robes provided to him when he got his body back in Book 4. *Priori Incantatem* demonstrates that his last spell from this wand were the curses cast in the Potter residence, as well as the recent activity in preparation for the tournament, meaning nobody else used it from his disappearance to his resurrection. There were only a few people present immediately after the Potter murders who could have taken Voldemort’s wand:

Hagrid arrived first, and collected Harry to deliver to Dumbledore and the Dursleys. Sirius arrived second. Hagrid references to Dumbledore in the first chapter of Book 1 that he arrived before the place was swarming with Muggles.

We know Sirius gave his motorbike to Hagrid at this point, and left in pursuit of Wormtail, whom he found a short time later; Sirius was immediately arrested. This means that if Sirius took the wand, it would have ended up in the Ministry's hands. Sirius never mentions the wand, which would be a fairly huge plot point to omit to Harry and the Order later on.

If the wand was left at the residence, the Ministry would have acquired it when they searched the house, and especially to keep Muggles from taking it.

This leaves Hagrid as the only possible person to have collected Voldemort's wand as Hagrid. Nobody else made it to the scene before the Muggles and the Ministry but those two. If Sirius, the Muggles, or the Ministry collected the wand, it would not have ended up in his robes at the graveyard - it would have been snapped in half. A Death Eater had to have obtained the wand prior to its confiscation and likely destruction, and Hagrid is the only available option.

(Part 1 of 5, but the posts below are shorter. See posts).People have complained a lot about his "don't choke on your aspirations" line, but it was pointed out to them he has similar lines in the OT. Now, why does it fit his character to begin with? Why would a dark lord of the Sith make those horrible jokes?

Well, before I ask you, I want you too look at some other Sith lords:  
Darth Maul was (at least in the movie) an aggressive savage specialized in melee (lightsaber) combat - true to his name.  
Darth Tyranus was a tyrant, ruling the CIS with an iron fist - true to his name.  
Darth Sidious was indeed insidious, as his name suggest.  

Do you know what "Vader" is? It's German for Father. And just as the name suggests, he makes horrible, horrible dad jokes all throughout his reign as lord of the Sith - while killing and torturing some people along the way, because you know, he is a Sith after all.


Edit:  
Pssst /r/all... have you heard the tragedy of Plagueis "The Wise"?The reason that the language in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies is frequently juvenile and all profanity seems limited to the constraints of a PG-13 film is because we're usually hearing it as Starlord hears it through his universal translator (mentioned onscreen in the first movie's mugshot scene).

Starlord was taken from Earth when he was eight. He probably stopped actually learning English shortly after, since it's unlikely that he had anyone else to actually speak it with. As such, his language (and all language he hears) is going to seem juvenile. Additionally, any profanity he knows probably came from movies and TV shows he saw before he was kidnapped.So we all know Dumbledore dies in the sixth movie. But there are hints that his death was already spoiled in the third movie. 

There is a christmas dinner with various people involved. Finally Sibyll Trelawny joins the party. Before she sits down she is frightened because  there are already 12 people sitting at the table and 13 people sitting at the same table brings misery. She does not sit down and mentiones that the first of those 13 persons to stand up would die. 

In order to calm her, Dumbledore stands up and leaves the table. 
But we later get to know that Ron's rat was just Peter Pattigrew who transformeed himself. Knowing that Ron carried his rat in his pocket most of the time, that'd mean there were already 13 people at the table. 
As Dumbledore leaves as the first of those 13 people, his fate was sealed.


**edit:** Thanks for the gold !Perhaps it would not have played our exactly as it did with Marty in the car trying to park it, but I definitely can see George walking away when confronted by a drunk Biff, and allowing Lorraine to go through what he stopped him from doing to her with Martys help.

When we first see Lorraine she's an alcoholic, depressed woman trying to make it through the days. She may have been repressed sexually, but has clearly had some trauma around dating and boys as she will not let her daughter even talk to a boy, let alone date. She doesn't like Martys girl because she represents the type of girl she was before the incident with Biff and is "forward". A classic sign of sexual trauma 

She brings up the dance as she pours herself a drink of straight vodka as she remembers the night and details. As she tells it she remembers the only positive part of the night, the kiss she had with George, a man too feeble and weak to do anything like Biff could do. George however is lost in the television, literally dissociating from conversation because it's traumatic for him too, he failed to protect his wife from Biff.

Further evidence, OT Lorraine is never in the same scene as OT Biff after the dance, like when Biff arrives at the house after school with the car busted up. George, who works, and the children are all home but Lorraine is not. Biff laughs and says say hi to your mother for me, before leaving, further rubbing salt into that old wound. When Marty allows George to stand up and protect Lorraine instead of doing so himself, Lorraine undergoes a miraculous personality change in the future... With the direct intervention in changing George's personality it should not have altered Lorraine's personality so much as this erasing of a trauma would. She used to be fun loving and a bit of a party girl. Unknowingly, Marty protects his mother from a sexual assault that would have traumatized her.


Edit: Thanks for the gold! Please contact 800.656.HOPE (4673) if you need to talk to someone 24/7 confidentially about your experiences with sexual assault. To test whether an acolyte was worthy of completing their training, the dojo will deny an acolyte the scroll at the end to test what kind of person they really are. If an acolyte had truly learned the art of balance and inner peace in addition to his physical training, he would have accepted the denial with humility. In doing so, the acolyte would then prove that he is perfect inside and out, and at that point, the master would then explain that it was just a test and grant him the scroll.

Tai Lung failed this test by reacting with anger and hatred. That was why he was never granted the scroll: not because he was not worthy, but because he proved himself unworthy. For all his prowess, tai lung failed the most important test in the end, the test of whether he could exercise his great power with great responsibility. 

This was clearly hinted strongly by the movie by the fact that the scroll was empty.This mainly applies to the Disney version, since that's the version that comes to people's minds nowadays when they think of Tarzan, but this could technically apply to other adaptations as well.

Many viewers have wondered how Tarzan knew to wear clothes. He was raised by gorillas, right? And gorillas don't wear clothes, they have their privates proudly exposed for the whole world to see. How did Tarzan know he needed to cover his junk? 

Well...a lot of people don't know this, but [as this (relatively SFW) chart shows](https://images.theconversation.com/files/154053/original/image-20170124-16070-v8lwj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip) humans are actually unusual for having proportionately HUGE dicks compared to other ape species, possibly as an adaptation for walking upright. Seriously, a gorilla penis is only two and a half inches in length when fully erect. If any of you guys are ashamed of your teeny weenie, just be thankful you're not a gorilla. 

Even as a child, Tarzan would've had a bigger penis than the other gorillas. And he was already freakish enough with his lack of fur. Who knows how much bullying he faced from the other gorilla kids when they saw how big his kid wiener was compared to theirs? The bullying was so bad he ended up having to cover up his junk with leaves or animal skin or whatever his loincloth is made of. 

Even after he became fully accepted by the rest of the gorilla clan, childhood bullying trauma prevents him from exposing his freakishly massive dick to the world, hence why he continues to wear it at the end of the film and in the spinoff series.

EDIT: Did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thanks for the double-gold strangers!

EDIT 2: Now I have triple-gold, and this is one of the highest-rated posts on this sub! Did not see that coming!When Nedry first encounters the Dilophosaurus it seems curious and almost playful. Then, seemingly out of the blue, it shifts gears and things rapidly spiral downward for our beloved corporate espionage character. I always thought it was just sizing him up before eating him, as in it always saw him as prey. But upon watching it for the millionth time this morning I noticed an important detail:


*The Hood*


When they first come face to face, Nedry has his hood up and it's spread wide around his face. His poncho is bright yellow, just like the Dilo's hood flaps. As Dr. Grant said, dinosaurs and man just got thrown into the mix together and we have no idea what will happen. A dinosaur has no idea what a rain poncho is, so when it first saw Nedry, all it saw was a giant figure with a huge hood around it's face. Now bear in mind all of the park's dinosaurs are female. I believe that the Dilophosaurus thought Nedry was a male, and more specifically a potential mate. That's why it followed him like a puppy and made those little cooing noises at him. That is until he tripped, causing his hood to fall down. Once the female Dilophosaurus realized Nedry's ruse it became aggressive, putting up it's own hood in a threat display, hissing, and spitting venom in his face. And the rest is history.Vader's angry all the time, don't get me wrong. But even through his anger, his inflection remains calm. The only time he ever resorts to shouting at people is during the beginning of A New Hope.

So hear me out. The Rebels just openly invaded Scarif, destroyed several Imperial starships, stole valuable military intelligence, and handed it off to the Tantive IV. Tantive IV was *at the battle.* Vader saw *with his own two eyes* rebel troops running into the Tantive with the plans in their hands, giving it off to them before they flee the battle. No ambiguity at all, Vader saw everything himself.

This was **ten minutes ago.**

And now the captain of the ship, the very rebel ship Vader *just* watched break off from a military vessel attacking his fleet, this guy has the *audacity* to try weasel his way out of it, to *Darth Vader,* saying it's a councilor ship, on a diplomatic mission to a planet on the other side of the fucking galaxy from where they are now, with *no* ties to the rebellion whatsoever.

This is the single *stupidest* asshole Vader ever had to deal with, and he feels like his intelligence has just been personally insulted.He knows exactly what he's doing.

**TL;DR: Loki is going to Valhalla to consult with Odin/other dead Asgardians, and dying in "battle" with Thanos was the only way to get there.**

Disclaimer: I've seen a lot of theories as to why Loki dies so easily at the start of the Infinity War, including many that assert he dies on purpose. I give full credit to those other theorists for inspiring this theory, but I think this one ties all the evidence together in a way that makes the most sense.

Let's look at the evidence.

**1) Loki's move against Thanos looks like suicide.  So, it probably is.**

He should know that a tiny knife isn't going to do much damage to an Infinity Stone-wielding Thanos. 

This creates two options: Loki is stupid enough to think this attack will work, or he know it won't, and is intentionally setting himself up to die. Given Loki's history as a master manipulator, I think Option B is far more likely.

**2) Why would Loki want to die? To get to Valhalla.**

In order for an Asgardian to get to Valhalla, they must die in battle. That would explain why Loki couldn't just kill himself to accomplish his goals. Loki may not be an Asgardian, but as a son of Odin, he would probably be eligible to enter Valhalla. He just needed to perish while fighting.

That would explain why Loki did exactly what he did--making a lame attempt to strike Thanos down and then dying brutally at Thanos' hand. That was basically the quickest way for him to ensure a one-way ticket to Valhalla.

**3) Why Valhalla? Odin is there.**

Although Odin himself didn't technically die in battle, he did die while exerting his power to imprison Hela, and that probably counts enough. It stands to reason that, if Valhalla exists, Odin is there, along with a bunch of other dead Asgardians. 

Loki could be looking to visit Odin to get advice on what to do with Thanos, and how Thor can defeat him.

**4) What good is information if you're too dead to share it?**

Fortunately, Thor's family members appear to be able to contact him from beyond the grave. Odin does it in Thor: Ragnarok for his famous "Are you the god of hammers?" speech, and so it stands to reason that Loki could replicate the same trick, speaking to Thor from Valhalla and sharing vital information with him.

**5) Loki's final words are very well-chosen, and very important.**

Most of this has been covered by other theorists, but the gist is that Thanos is dead wrong when he tells Loki that he should have chosen his words more carefully--Loki always chooses his words with the utmost care.

When Loki says, " I, Loki, prince of Asgard... Odinson... the rightful king of Jotunheim... god of mischief... do hereby pledge to you... my undying fidelity," he's looking directly at Thor, and it stands to reason that the pledge is meant for Thor, not Thanos.

The key phrase here is "undying fidelity," meaning that Loki's faithfulness to his brother will go beyond death, and that Loki will be helping him out even after he's had the life choked from him.  


**6) Even Loki's final taunt to Thanos is a clue.**

Loki's last words are directed at Thanos, and they are "You will never be a god."

This could be Loki hinting at how he's going to help beat Thanos--no matter how powerful Thanos becomes, he won't ever be an Asgardian, and thus he wouldn't be able to access things like Valhalla that are built for the gods. 

In other words, "We gods have an afterlife, and you don't, and I'll be spending my time there plotting your downfall, Grimace."So at the end of the movie, Peter is returning to high school. And if you look closely behind him, you can see an administrator welcoming students back to school. That administrator is played by Ben Mendelsohn, who plays Talos (the leader of the small group of Skrulls shown) in Captain Marvel. I had to see the movie twice to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind 

This HAD to be intentional, and sets up for a Secret Invasion/Wars plotline in future phases

Edit2: I got published https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/marvel-fans-noticed-clue-end-132600868.html 

Credit: u/StimulisRKThe reason Captain America is able to wield Mjolnir now is because he is worthy. This seems like a duh but it's not so simple. 

In Age of Ultron we see that he is able to move the hammer because for a moment the hammer senses all the good that Cap is but then it notices his one fault... 

Later in the movie Scarlett Witch gives all of the Avengers nightmares and they see their worst fears realised. Cap's worst fear is that there will be no more fight. No more war. 

THIS is the exact reason Odin took Mjolnir from Thor and placed the spell on it. "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." Remember that Thor had a strong desire for combat regardless of the consequences. He was unable to see how to resolve conflicts without violence. This seemingly makes someone unworthy. 

Now back to Cap in Endgame. He has never felt such defeat like this ever before in his life. But rather than punching away and breaking 30 punching bags a day(Avengers 2012) he is counseling people through their loss. Then in the elevator he easily could have taken all those guys down(we have seen it before Winter Solider 2014) but this time he realizes he doesn't need to fight when he can trick them and no one gets hurt. He obviously had no choice but to fight thanos when he was right there in front of them but he did not want to "punch his way out of this one"-Black Widow(Civil War 2016)... he just wanted to bring back everyone they lost. 

Now to the end... just like Tony. Cap is ready to rest. He is ready to live a normal life and just be happy. He isn't Captain America anymore. He hasn't been since the Snap.  He has just been Steve Rogers.  Trying to do what's right and go back home. This makes him worthy.Anyone who has watched The Office knows that the characters become caricatures of themselves as the series goes on. 

Kevin goes from being a slightly dull, but still functional, accountant in the beginning to trying to glue a turtle's shell back together using office supplies.

Dwight goes from the ornery guy who takes his job way too seriously to the guy who shoots a coworker with tranquilizer darts and slides his limp body down the stairs.

The branch goes from a dysfunctional, believable office setting to getting so hopped up on espresso that they rip up the carpet.

Why do the employees get so weird later in the series? 

The series has a running joke where Toby wants the building to be checked for radon, but no one ever takes him seriously. However, Toby was right.

Over the years, the radon in the building caused many of the Dunder Mifflin employees to develop brain cancer, greatly altering their personalities the longer they worked in the building. The flanderization of their characters is the direct result of radon poisoning in their brains.

This is why Michael is so different in the finale. His time in Colorado allowed his brain to overcome the effects of the radon poisoning, thus allowing him to mellow out and become more mature. 

Edit: to piggyback on what u/jinjoz said, it's also possible that the documentary crew is pumping radon into the office to manipulate the subjects' behavior.

Edit: Many commentors are saying that the decline in quality happens to shows that last a long time. This is true. However, this theory is a rationalization about why, IN UNIVERSE, the characters behaved the way they did. It is not meant to say that the writers wrote it this way on purpose. The writers' intent is irrelevant to this in universe fan theory. Hello there!

Did you ever hear the story of Star Wars by Disney?

I thought so, it's kinda everywhere.

But Snoke. Who the fuck is Snoke? Most people seem to think Snoke is Darth Plagueis. Oh, you don't remember Darth Plagueis from the other films? I thought not, he's not a character the prequels would show you. The only mention of Darth Plagueis is when Chancellor Palpatine tells the story of Darth Plagueis the wise to Anakin Skywalker over some space opera. Rather brief and easily missed if you aren't a fan of Coruscant high culture. One of the more common criticisms of the theory that Snoke is Darth Plagueis is that Darth Plagueis is too obscure a character for the regular fan, so the big reveal will go over a majority of people's heads.

If Disney wanted to achieve maximum impact for the reveal of Snoke's true identity, then they would need to impart some knowledge onto the fan base. Some would consider this to be, "unnatural". For if Disney were to come straight out and start dropping more information on Darth Plagueis, people would clue on to this as confirmation that Snoke is indeed Darth Plagueis the wise. So Disney had no choice but to do it in secret. They used memes.

What is the biggest meme on /r/prequelmemes?


*"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"*

What was the first big meme on /r/prequelmemes?


*"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"*

What meme has spread throughout reddit and the internet like sand on a windy day on Tatooine? ^^fuck ^^sand


*"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"*

Search your feelings. You know it to be true. Disney started /r/prequelmemes. They wanted to make sure that everyone knew who Darth Plagueis was before The Last Jedi, so when the *Snoke* is lifted, everyone would understand. Avengers will defeat Thanos in the first 20 minutes of endgame!
As i watch all the trailers and read all the information we have my theory is the next.
Captain Marvel join the Avengers at beginning of the movie, saying (based on the disney shareholder screening) that they should go take down Thanos ASAP and reverse the Decimation. We see Thor approving Marvel and the idea, so the team is going right to the Garden fight Thanos easily overpowering him with Stormbreaker and binary Captain Marvel. Only they cant use the Gauntlet, whether it is broken or none of them has the knowledge to figure out how to do it. So at the end of the day they won the fight but solve nothing. Going home, and we get the "we should move on" attitude we saw in trailers. They are desperate but has nothing that they can do about it.

Months or years gone by, when the wheel get spinned again. Suddenly Antman shows up after such a long time, (we saw in first trailer)
and Cap does not belive his eyes. Which is totally understandable, Antman is counted missing like the other half of all life. (we saw this as well in trailers) Antman say hi i have just come back from a trip to quantum realm and they let him explain. He is not the brightest of minds but has acces to pym particles and tech that the geniouses of Avengers can use. They put together the plan of travelling through the quantum realm, time vortex etc super deep science stuff. All the information, scenes from trailers, time gone by, and the transformations of clothes, hairstyle etc are all supporting my theory.
In the next chapter the team must "start over" meaning they go back to the beginning which is the first Avengers film. They will prevent the snap, and make some sacrifices. That doesnt mean death, but good things maybe that happened, and we all see in previous movies we like. So a lot of good stuff is being undone that made this past 10 years MCU what it is. A complete start over is happening.

So people who are arguing about who will be the ultimate solution Captain Marvel or Antman can stop it. Captain Marvel has the powers to beat Thanos and she will, but Antman will be the main solution.

Pls tell this to Kevin Feigi and if i am right invite me to the premier :)President Snow isn’t an idiot, he knows that his method of ruling is bound to cause a rebellion eventually, especially with district 13 lying in wait.

Now as any dictator can tell you, you the only people you need to keep happy are the ones you’re afraid of. But how does Snow decide who to fear? Easy. Every year, he rounds up a smattering of kids from each district, and drops them into a controlled environment so that the capitol military can see exactly which districts are a threat. Who is giving their children combat training? Survival training? How would the average members of each district population fare in battle? It would be incredibly easy to get this vital information just by watching the games.

Districts one and two don’t dominate the games because they’re treated well, they’re treated well because they dominate the games. Snow realizes he needs to keep them happy, because he constantly watches their fighters kick everyone’s ass.

 They use the reaping to gather a (mostly) random sampling. Giving extra food for entering your name multiple times ensures that they can see the skills of the truly desperate (those most likely to join a rebel militia) and allowing volunteers lets them see how the glory hounds and tough guys fare (those most likely to lead a rebel militia). 

From there, they offer training to see how quickly the average fighters from each district would adapt to combat training. How educated are they? How fast do they learn? Are weapons new to them, or do they have experience? They even test media savvy and ability to rally capitol citizens to their cause with Caesar Flickerman’s show.

When they’re actually in the arena, not only is the capitol assessing the fighters performance in different environments (why do you think they keep changing the map?), but they’re also testing counterinsurgency weapons. That’s why there’s always new environmental hazards every year. They’re seeing how effective they are against armed, twitchy revolutionaries. Fireballs? 86 them, they didn’t hurt anybody. Mutant animals that remind the fighters of fallen allies? Keep those, they were good. That’s why we see all those traps in the capitol. They were the ones most effective against the tributes, so they were recycled into city defense systems.As a youngster I watched BttF, and was pleased to see at the end of the film that Biff had got his "just deserts". "Hah!" I thought, "Biff is a nobody now, he has to clean George's car!" I think this is what most people think, and what you're supposed to think.

What I didn't notice (or at least, the meaning of it was lost on little me) for some years is Biff's truck in the background with his company logo: "[Biff's Automotive Detailing](http://www.nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/biffauto2.jpg)". As I grew older I started to think that perhaps my initial conclusion, the one the film seemed to lead me to, wasn't really correct. Owning your own business is nothing to be sniffed at, even if it's a one-man operation. Many people would prefer to be their own boss rather than work for someone else! But recently I've started to think it goes further than that...

At the start of the film we see that Biff has George writing his reports for him at work, something we later learn has been going on since the two of them were at school. It's not a stretch to imagine that Biff probably *can't* write his own reports, he's not qualified for his own job and he knows it. Imagine the fear of knowing that you rely on a subordinate for your job status - what would happen if that person left, or died? What if you were 'found out' by your own bosses?

Back in 1955, at the climax of the skateboard chase in the town square, Biff drives into a truck full of manure which fills his open top vehicle. I believe it's mentioned that he pays for the repairs, but I would imagine that in an effort to save money he would have cleaned the car himself. Again, I think it's no stretch to imagine that in the hours spent restoring his car he might have discovered, if not a love, then at least an *aptitude*, for auto detailing - leading him to start his business doing just that.

So Biff goes from working a job he is not qualified for, in constant fear of someone discovering that fact, to owning his own business working at something he's probably pretty good at - something we (should) all know is quite satisfying. There's no doubt in my mind that Marty's actions changed his life for the better - just like everyone else's.Unfortunately I have no substantial evidence but it seems rather absurd that w every dwarf came in and immediately started requesting snacks and beverages. I find it hard to believe 13/13 dwarves are rude and demanding after the claiming to be "at his service", even if they did intend to pay him back. I think Gandalf may have suggested it was in their best interest to arrive with a hearty appetite with an alterior motive, other than to snicker at Bilbo's predicament.For ever, I thought he was just an oddball who introduced himself that way. This is why Ryan's joke (What kind of work are you in, Bob?) landed well.

But Bob isn't marketing to the people at Dunder Mifflin. He's marketing to the cameras, and getting free television advertisement.

Sorry if this was painfully obvious to everybody else, but if it's not explicitly spelled out in the show somewhere, I'm calling it a fan theory.In season 3 episode 13 "Traveling Salesmen", Stanley tries to strike out on his own when he is assigned to travel. When Michael tells him he can't do that, he sighs and says he'll take Ryan. While this may seem like it's because Ryan is the least annoying person, I think it's because Stanley was trying to help Ryan.

Ryan had not made a sale prior to that episode (possibly due to his visible anxiety when trying to make a sale), so I think when Stanley dropped Ryan in a situation outside his comfort zone (all black salesmen who know Stanley well), it was a form of immersion therapy. Stanley knew the clients liked him, so he wouldn't lose the account even if Ryan bombed.

Granted, Stanley is later seen laughing at Ryan's failure, but I think this is because Stanley doesn't want to be seen by Ryan as a mentor. He's too lazy to present himself as a permanent resource for Ryan.

TL;DR: Stanley gave Ryan a worst-case scenario, and showed him it wouldn't be all that bad.I briefly checked the history by doing a few searches and didn't see anything quite like this, but I apologize if someone else has come up with a similar theory before.

Joker, although a lying psychopath, is actually the hero in The Dark Knight. Before the Joker, Gotham was a mess. Entire sections of the city were closed off due to madness, organized crime ran rampant, and the majority of important city officials were wildly corrupt. The city even tolerated a renegade vigilante who ran around wearing a rubber suit (Okay, special armor and carbon fiber, but they don't know that).

Along comes the Joker and by the end of a very short time, almost all organized crime was eliminated, many corrupt officials were imprisoned or dead, and the city's Vigilante even went into hiding for 8 years. This was all part of Joker's masterfully executed plan.

Everyone must realize that Joker, despite his claim otherwise, really was "The Man With The Plan" throughout the entire film. The very first thing we see Joker do is rob a mafia controlled bank, eliminating the entire team of expert bank robbers who helped him pull it off. Of course, the robbery wasn't about the money, it was about luring Lau out of hiding, preferably with all the major crime families' collective money.

This works beautifully, and as Joker predicts, Batman goes to Hong Kong to "Extradite" Lau. Now Lau is in a safe place which Joker can, amazingly, access with ease. This of course is all just the plot of the film, but Joker is playing it amazingly, murdering key criminals and corrupt officials that could help insulate those at the top. Dent actually argues FOR insulating the men on the top in the interest of cleaning the streets of lower-level goons, but Joker knows that won't work in the long-term.

At this point we honestly just have 3 men battling for Gotham's "soul" (as Joker puts it), but Dent and Wayne are simply playing into Joker's greater plan. This even extends to Joker's threats to destroy a hospital. With Batman and Gordon's help, Joker helps them root out corrupt police officials. Dent even kills some of those officials later in the film.

Gordon's promotion, too, did a major service to Gotham. I think a lot of people take the Joker's clapping during Gordon's promotion scene to be sarcastic, but I actually think that Joker believed in Gordon, one of the few officers on the force who was truly incorruptible.

So now Joker has a pretty clear path to getting rid of the Organized Crime problem and the corrupt officials problem, but the Vigilante problem remains. As we saw at the beginning of the film, Batman was inspiring other vigilantes, and a society cannot stand when each man takes his own justice. This symbol of fear and unbridled vengeance, as Joker sees it, needs to be stopped, but not Killed. If he were killed, he would just be a martyr, and his symbol would live on. Of course, since Dent was a far better symbol for the city, he would make a far better martyr. 

I don't know if Joker actually intended for Harvey to be so physically scarred by the explosion from which Batman saved him, but I am certain that he wanted Harvey to feel the full pain of Rachel's death, which is why he purposely tells Batman to go to the wrong address. He knows what Rachel's death would do to Harvey psychologically, and that Batman would eventually have no choice but to kill Harvey. This breaks Batman psychologically, and also makes him a villain, a true villain, the kind that abandons his own principles. Batman now has no choice but to disappear, leaving his memory to fade into something of urban legend by the time of TDKR. 

When we pick up in the next film we see a defeated Bruce Wayne who had retired 8 years prior. The city was safe and peaceful (until Bane shows up), and doesn't need constant vigilante justice to keep it safe. Joker shows Batman the error of his ways, but does so in a totally devastating way.

Even the display with the two boats at the film's climax only served to prove to the people of Gotham that they wouldn't turn on each other. He proved that there was good even in the most supposedly despicable of Gotham's inmates.

In the end Gotham is actually clean. It wasn't because of Harvey, who died too soon to do any good, except as a martyr, and it wasn't because of Batman who was ostracized and treated like the criminal such a vigilante truly is for 8 years. Gotham was safe because the Joker had cleaned up the streets. He eliminated the corrupt police, he destroyed organized crime financially, he uplifted Gotham's spirit, and he even got rid of the flying pest that had been corrupting Gotham ever since he declared himself it's protector.People in porn have constant sex. Incest. Orgies. Pizza deliveries. Punishment. There are no references to wars or other kinds of non-kinky violent conflict. Bonobos have constant sex. Incest. Orgies. Sex to resolve conflict. Never, or almost never, violent conflict. Just like humans in porn.
A few seasons from now, whenever the show doesn't get renewed, at the end of the series finale bojack is going to walk into a bar. At this point everyone he loves will have died or abandon him. The bartender asks "why the long face?", then CUT TO BLACK Suprannos style ending. You know, in every analysis of Pixar's *Wall-E*, people look at him as a messianic figure: Someone who sacrificed himself in order to save mankind, and then comes back from the dead.

However, there's an alternative character interpretation for Wall-E, and enough evidence to support it: He's not a Christ-like figure. Instead, he might have more in common with Satan (as depicted in Genesis).


First of all, let's take a look at mankind in Wall-E's universe:
At first sight (and judging it by our standards) they are not happy. However, almost all the issues that have plagued mankind doesn't exist anymore: There's no war, illness, hunger, hatred or discrimination. Religion and politics are non-existent too... People live long, healthy lives where they have everything they need at their disposal. Generations have passed since they left Earth (which turned into a barren wasteland) and, aside from the Captain of the ship, no human knows that it even exists. Why would they look forward to returning into a place where they had to fight for survival when they have lived their whole life being served by robots, in a comfortable (even boring) existence? **They basically live in Paradise**.


**Then, comes Wall-E: A robot who gave Eve a seedling, which triggered the Captain's desire to bring mankind back to earth**. In Genesis, the fruit that the Serpent gave to Eve was referred to as *the fruit of knowledge of good and evil* - And, for the Captain, the seedling was basically this: Prior to interacting with it, he went along by performing his required duties and ensuring mankind's survival in a Paradise-like environment... However, after knowing of the existence of this seedling, he started doing research on Earth, which then turned into a deep desire to return to it. He lost his innocence by gaining a new understanding of the world - Just like Adam and Eve realized that they were naked after eating the forbidden fruit.

**Do you see the parallelism here? We have an entity (Wall-E/Satan) who gives an object (Seedling/Apple) to a (robot/woman) named Eve, which starts a chain of events that led to mankind losing a Paradise and getting stranded in Earth.**

By the end of the movie, we see that mankind has settled back on Earth, and have returned to activities such as agriculture and fishing. Something that brings a resemblance to Genesis 3:19 - *By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return*

Mankind doesn't have a carefree existence anymore. Now they have to work in order to eat, and it shouldn't take too long before disparities will start to appear: Some will be able to have more possessions than others, which will spark the flames of hatred against humans... And then, the cycle will start anew.

It wouldn't be surprising if, generations later, the people in Wall-E's universe starts telling tales of a time when they lived in a place of eternal bliss, until a tempter gave a woman named Eve a plant, which led to mankind's downfall.Every time Palpatine force lightnings, it's in a situation of dominance where he is full of powerful male sexual confidence. He laughs in ecstatic joy and it seems to give him immense pleasure when he shoots the lighting from his fingers. In every instance, you could replace it with a rape and it would match the emotions of both doer and receiver the same.

I have become convinced this is because Palpatine's dark power comes from applying intense orgasmic sexual energy to his hate.

I give special proof to this that once he starts his lighting, it acts much like an erection at the moment of splooging. He enters a trance- like state and can no longer control himself. Even in instances where it is redirected back onto himself, he cannot stop. Just like an orgasm at the point of climax. He just keeps going in ecstasy like a man at climax. The orgasm has to finish once started. He completely looses control.

Furthermore, the Sith derives his or her power from emotional strength, and the greatest emotional experiences are sexual ones. 

Therefore force lighting is a sexual experience for Palpatine, and this is the secret to his power. The Jedi renounce emotions and have to reply on concentration and focus. The Sith rely on emotion, and so Palpatine - once he discovered how to overlap sexual energy with his hate - unlock unnatural powers of the dark side.... Through sexual orgasmic strength.It's no secret that Rick likes to break the fourth wall, often at the end of episodes. He's been making meta references and directly addressing the audience since the pilot, and has continued to do so in the latest episode. 

I think this is because Rick recognizes that, if there are infinite universes, realities, dimensions etc, then it means that there must be a universe in which he is a character on a television show. Addressing the audience he assumes must be there is both an indication of his advanced intelligence, his understanding of the world he inhabits, and a measure to stay sane in the face of overwhelming realities. I'm not certain if he has actually seen Rick and Morty through his interdimensional cable, but it's definitely a possibility. (In this way, Rick is much like Elon Musk and Musk's belief that we may be living in a simulation.)

Meanwhile, let's consider Mr. Poopybutthole. It appears that Rick must have given Mr. P an interdimensional cablebox to occupy Mr. P during his recovery from the gunshot wound. While it's unclear if Rick has actually seen Rick and Morty (the show), it's obvious that Mr. Poopybutthole has, as he explicitly mentions Episode 204 (and his own appearance in it) when he shows up in the after-credits sequence in Ep 210, The Wedding Squanchers.

While this could just be another fun instance of a character breaking the fourth wall, I think the reality is that Mr. Poopybutthole has been watching an extraordinary amount of interdimensional television, which included the full run of Rick and Morty. This has also caused a slight break in his own sanity, as we can see he is behaving more unhinged in Ep 210 than he did in Ep 204. 

If interested, I wrote more about this theory and the various universes and realities in Rick and Morty here: https://whatwouldbaledo.com/2017/04/08/the-rick-and-morty-fan-theory-that-explains-total-rickall-and-rick-breaking-the-fourth-wall/

(One sidenote is that I do not think that the Rick in "Total Rickall" is C-137, but that's not the crux of this argument.)Upon first seeing suicide booths, it looks like some dark humor and nothing more. As the series progresses though, it becomes more clear that it's basically the only way for people to die. People use suicide booths because they've just lived a lifetime and simply want to end. 

Youth-anizing allows for reversal of age (and maturity levels), so nobody dies from old age if they don't want to. Medical care is so great that it's reasonable to live to 160, and then you get taken to the Near Death Star, where you presumably live basically forever in a shared virtual reality. Speaking of healthcare, it's so great that it's almost impossible to die from an accident. Even incompetent doctors like Zoidberg can save a person from complete dismemberment. Even decapitation is a pretty trivial injury. 

Basically, the only ways to die are complete disintegration, eaten alive, or suicide booth. And it seems in this world, people aren't as adventurous as the main cast, so the grand majority of people will die by suicide (assuming the die at all and don't have implied immortality on the Near Death Star). The episode starts with Spongebob coming home, looking out for Sandy to do karate with. Why would Sandy already be in his house, if they were not in a relationship? He looks around, sees she isn't there, then sits on the couch. She appears shortly after and tries to tackle him. Before Spongebob starts to go at it, he runs off, puts on his safety helmet and gloves, says "safety first" then winks at the camera before charging at Sandy. That would clearly be representative of condoms. Spongebob then starts announcing his special moves/techniques. 

Later that night, Spongebob calls Sandy to try and do karate with her and she says "Nice try". This was clearly a booty call. The nexy day, they briefly do some karate that knocks her on her back at the grocery store. And at another point in time, she surprises him for karate on the way to work. This time, she says the karate will be long and merciless, and she grabs him by the tongue and makes it stretch really far. I suppose this could be cunnilingus. She tries to pour hot sauce on his tongue (the hot sauce comes alive and says he is powered by naughtiness) but this scares him so he backs off. This could be analingus. But then it turns out Spongebob's toy was fake, so that could be a metaphor for a dental dam or something. 

At the Krusty Krab, Spongebob can barely get any work done because he can only think about karate with Sandy, and sees her everywhere. In his mind, she even winks at him. 

Krabs asks Spongebob if he's on some new allergy med, possibly assuming his new level of "aggression" is a result of that. It gets so bad that Krabs has to tell him to cut off on the karate or he's fired. Sandy, not knowing this, tries to do karate with Spongebob but he doesn't consent, and he ends up getting fired. Sandy says it was her fault and Krabs gives Spongebob another chance so long as they stop with all the karate. 

Spongebob and Sandy try to find things they can enjoy other than karate end go to the park to have a picnic. Both pretend they no longer like karate at all, but both are clearly fighting their desires to do it. Spongebob thinks of doing it right there but gets embarassed as soon as he says it. Sandy's desire to practice karate ends up going through the roof when she sees Spongebob doing karate-like chops with a sausage. Spongebob starts to feel the same, and eventually it reaches a breaking point and they go absolutely nuts, doing karate all over the park and making a bunch of sandwiches. The camera shakes and a tree is broken in half. 

Krabs later is on a stroll through the park and sees Spongebob and Sandy together, Spongebob being in a very relaxed and laid back position as he ponders whether or not Krabs ever does karate. Krabs ultimately decides to hire both Sandy and Spongebob at the Krusty Krab because he realizes their karate is a really good way to make krabby patties. It ends up turning the krusty krab into a Benihana-esque place where the food is prepared live and it's somewhat of a show. I want to start by pointing out the moments we see dancing in this movie. 

At the beginning of the movie, Arthur is a guy searching for identity. Specifically, he wants to be a comedian and wants to be on Murray Franklin's show. One of the first things we see Murray do is dance when he makes his entrance to the stage. 

When Arthur >!kills the guys in the subway!<, he hides in a public bathroom and does a dance. But this dance is slow, unenthusiastic, almost sad. He's trying to express something that he doesn't quite understand. Like he found a hint of who he wants to be  but he's not quite there yet. He was pushed into >!killing those guys in the subway!<, so he's not fully in control. 

Arthur then tries to dance with his mother, but she refuses saying she wants to go to bed. This is Arthur trying to mix his old identity (Arthur the son) with his newfound persona that's beginning to grow in him. His mom's rejection is a hint that he can't have both. He will either dance alone or not dance at all. 

At the end of the movie, he >!murders his mother in the hospital!< and he dances a bit while painting his hair green. This dance is a bit more upbeat, but it's not really that expressive. Just a couple of new dance moves. Maybe it's because he's busy painting his hair, or maybe the bathroom was too cramped... or maybe there's just something else missing. 

Then he >!murders Randall in his apartment!<. This leads to his now famous dance on the stairs. Upbeat, enthusiastic, even a bit sexy (with the humping), completely authentic and expressive. This is him fully embracing his Joker identity. >!Killing his mother!< didn't quite do it because that was still a reaction to >!all the abuse he received from her!<. >!Killing Randall!<, though he could've justified it as >!revenge for what he said about the gun!<, was Arthur's first >!unprovoked murder!<. A truly chaotic action. A classic Joker move. This dance is him symbolically entering the "world's stage" as the Joker, the same way his TV idol does. 

Then he goes on the show, dancing as he enters, and show his chaos to the world.So the villain of the movie, Screenslaver is revealed to be Evelyn, the sister. I feel thye went with a different direction for her character mid-production.

In Evelyn's introduction scene, she walks in as a mess. She fumbles and drops her papers and glasses etc trying to enter. This, I feel, was her original character style for the story.

But I think they changed it to the suave and relaxed person we see in the rest of the movie because the villain reveal being someone sweet and unpredictably evil was recently done in Zootopia with their office worker turns evil conspirator; BellWether, who is also a fumbly person who is super non-threatening.

Thoughts?   

   

   

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR UPVOTES, COMMENTS AND MATURE MANNERS IN ALL THE BELOW DISCUSSIONS.   

I did NOT expect this to be anything more than 20 people going "NO U" at each other but coming back on reddit 4 days later to see this post made me very happy.    
You all should feel very proud of yourselves and I thank you all.!007's methods are... unique, to say the very least. He seems to have no patience for spycraft of any kind, and instead, seems to prefer going directly up to a villain while drunk and telling them his real name. He's absolutely a deadly force of nature, and can survive almost any encounter. However, you'd expect the world's greatest spy to be a little less well known. You also have to wonder what the hell MI6 is doing. Why would a *secret* organization hire a guy who constantly uses his real name in public? Also, I don't know the exact finances of international spies, but it seems like they could hire a dozen highly trained spies and assassins for the price of Bond's alcohol and sports cars *alone*.

**Bond fills the role of "doomed spy" for MI6, allowing them to sneak other spies into the enemy organization.**

For those who don't know, the doomed spy was tactic where a person would be recruited as a spy, given false information, and used as a sacrifice to the enemy, sometimes with another spy turning them in. That way, the enemy would get false information, and would be lulled into a false sense of security. It would also give credibility to the real spy.

Every time Bond crashes one of SPECTRE's casinos drunk and tries to seduce the villain's assistant, there's a dozen MI6 agents using the opportunity to slip in unnoticed. Nobody's going to question Jimmy in accounting because he spent a little too much time going over SPECTRE expenses while there's a drunken brit with submachinegun car running wild. It's also far, far simpler to get moles into SPECTRE and other organizations. Consider: every time Bond blows up an enemy base, there's likely at least some survivors. However, all of the records from that base are destroyed, and the heads of their security, science division, etc. are likely dead. That means that instead of having an agent join up and gain credibility over the course of years, MI6 can get an agent directly into SPECTRE with little suspicion.

That's also how Bond constantly manages to survive, even against crazy odds. Yes, he's still insanely skilled as a killer, but he also has MI6 agents backing him up from the shadows. For every goon we see Bond take down, there's another who got garotted in a dark corridor, or who was ordered to go on a wild goose chase far from the base.

However, there's the obvious hole in this-- Bond doesn't die, and MI6 often rescues him.

**MI6 decided to change the doomed spy role, in order to keep Bond alive as a constant threat.**

Bond even says himself, he's the world's most famous spy. You would think that that would be a negative, but MI6 turns it into a positive. Look at almost every famous spy in history. None are anyone who you'd find immediately dangerous or threatening, many just infiltrated a place and took pictures. The few that would present a legitimate threat would kill you before you ever knew they were there. None of them dressed up in a suit worth thousands of dollars and drove up to the enemy's front gate in a sports car. Bond constantly gets captured because people recognize him, even if he does make an attempt to be somewhat subtle. He almost never tries to disguise his extremely famous face that SPECTRE is well aware of. That functions as a distraction, as stated above, but also as a scare tactic. Think about it: James Bond has a similar effect to John Wick, he's essentially "the bogeyman" for international criminals. Every time he shows up at a place, nearly everyone there dies (with MI6 help, but of course, nobody knows that). For your average goon, that's going to terrify you, and fill you with doubt. When Bond actually does come at them, they're often too panicked to be able to do much damage. It also seems fair to say that the second Bond arrives, there's a few dozen goons, henchmen, and flunkies who decide to get the hell out of dodge.

MI6 uses that scare tactic the same way a stage magician uses smoke or loud noises. "Look over here, at that plume of blue smoke, ignore what's happening behind that curtain". Everyone is so busy looking for the attractive man in a suit, none of them look twice at the mousy IT lady, or the fact that they've never seen that plumber before. It also means that once Bond shows up, they stop expecting enemy spies at all. Everyone knows Bond works alone, maybe with one or two sidekicks, so they don't anticipate more MI6 agents infiltrating them.

**TL;DR: James Bond's job isn't to succeed on his own, it's to provide a distraction, allowing other MI6 agents to secretly infiltrate the enemy. Those agents then help strengthen Bond's reputation as an unstoppable killer, which serves as psychological warfare against their enemies.**The genius of Star Wars is revealed in a few lines in the opera scene of revenge of the sith, as far as I know not many realise this. Palpatine tells anakin that his master, darth plagueis, had found a way to achieve immortality. Palpatine then boasts about how ironic it is that he killed him in his sleep. 

The truth was, the fool here was actually palpatine, not darth plagueis. In Star Wars, achieving immortality meant being a force ghost, or a powerful energy being free of the constraints of the fleshy body and one with the force. And that was actually what darth plagueis meant by immortality, by being a force ghost. By killing him, palpatine merely fulfilled darth plagueis mission to achieve immortality by freeing him Fromm his body and becoming one with the force. So it was not Qui gon, it was darth palgueis who was the first force ghost.

Now there is another thing even more significant about this: only Jedi who practice the light side of the force have been known to achieve this high state of being. Darth plagueis is also described as fulll of wisdom, something which the sith are not associated with. What this means is that darthbplagueis was so well practiced in the force, so attuned, so studied, so wise, that he broke through the dark side of the force and the petty divide between light and dark, realising the oneness of the force, achieving full knowledge in it and ultimately became one with it. Far from being just a failed Sith Lord, darth plagueis was the first enlightened Jedi. And by doing what he did, darth plagueis would ultimately set in motion the events that would bring balance to the force, the achievement of the force's ultimate goal and destiny. Darth plagueis was the key to the whole saga, palpatine was but a mere instrument.

Now a final note, do we really know how qui gon was suddenly able to achieve this ability? The canon speaks of him being taught directly by the force as if the force was a person. But The force is an impersonal energy field, it cannot speak, and it has never been known to speak or be a personal embodiment. The only explanation is simple: it was darth plagueis, now pure and one with the force, who taught him and about the destiny of the one. The enlightened plagueis was qui gons teacher.If it were any other sitcom, Bob and Midge would have been the main characters (or at least the main parents) because they fit the cliche sitcom mom and dad perfectly. Bob is overweight, goofy, and funny and somehow managed to get a housewife that looks like a supermodel. 

Red and Kitty, however, are both more average looking people that work blue-collar jobs to provide for themselves and their children. Red is not goofy and overweight, he's slim and can be outright mean at times. Kitty can be goofy and fun but also has a drinking problem to cope with life at times. They aren't dumb but they aren't overly intelligent either. 

I think this was done intentionally to juxtapose sitcom cliches with reality. **PRELUDE: For those who came late to the party, know that this is my last adventure in creative writing and fan theories. Having my theory stolen and watching it go viral while the thief gets all of the credit due to a combination of his own manipulation, poor fact checking by numerous online "journalists", and a complete disregard by the internet press for correcting their errors after they've been reported many, many, MANY times has left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. I'm done here. I enjoy fan theories and especially those in the MCU, but this experience blew all of that enjoyment out of the water. Thanks for reading.**

While I admit there's virtually no evidence to support most if not all of this, I think this theory fits in well with the canon timeline and information available.

Years and years ago, Odin learned about the Infinity Stones through his father, Bor, who was responsible for taking the Reality Stone from the Dark Elves. After his death and Odin's subsequent rise to power, he (with Hela at his side) began conquering all the realms in order to locate and claim the Stones. Odin found the Space Stone first and this allowed Odin and his armies to travel between realms and conquer them very quickly. ~~the Bifrost is essentially an Asgardian reproduction of the power of the Space Stone~~ (EDIT: Never mind that bit.) During this he commissioned Nidavellir to create a device which would allow him to control all the Stones at will: the Infinity Gauntlet. They created the mould for it and made one casting as a test fit for Odin, complete with fake Stones to give Odin an idea of the grandeur of the finished Gauntlet.

However, at about this time he discovered the whereabouts of the Soul Stone and what was required of him to get it: He'd have to sacrifice that which he loved the most, which was Hela. He found he couldn't do it and in that moment Odin stopped being a conquerer and started being a king. Hela didn't understand this change of heart; she knew what the Infinity Stones were because Odin specifically told her that's why they were conquering all the realms, and Hela believed in that power more than anything else. So she and Odin fought; Odin won and that's when he imprisoned her in Hell. Odin put the fake Gauntlet in his treasure room as a reminder of both what he'd done and what he'd lost, and swore that he would protect all that he had conquered. Thus he became Odin Allfather, Protector of the Nine Realms. Nidavellir decomissioned the Gauntlet mould and Odin hid the Space Stone on Midgard. Odin almost definitely knew where the Reality Stone was because Odin's father had it at one time. If this theory is true then he definitely knew where the Soul Stone was, he might have known where the Power Stone was, he probably didn't know the Time Stone was also already on Midgard (otherwise he likely wouldn't have risked two Infinity Stones in the same place), and he almost definitely didn't know where the Mind Stone was.

When Thanos arrived on the scene and went to Nidavellir to have them forge a control for the Stones, they used their previous knowledge from Odin's Gauntlet to make one for Thanos.

If this theory were true then it explains how and why Odin was previously a conquerer and why he changed; why there's a fake Infinity Gauntlet in Odin's treasure room; how Hela knows it's fake; how Hela knows what the Tesseract is ("That's not bad," she says while giving a small pause in front of it); why Odin changed from conqueror to king; why Odin and Hela fought; and why Thanos' Gauntlet is basically the same as the fake Gauntlet at Asgard.

**EDIT/BONUS 1:** I thought of something else. Odin may have used the Space Stone to banish Hela to Hell, which may be considered unnatural since Hell isn't supposed to be for living beings. That being the case, Odin "tampered with natural law" and the bill came due by way of the Ragnarok prophecy. The destruction of Asgard may have been the universe's way of balancing itself out.

**EDIT/BONUS 2:** And another thing... Odin himself said that Thor was stronger than him. You could argue that "young Thor" is stronger than "old man Odin" and you'd probably be right, but what if Odin meant that Thor is *always* stronger than Odin? That Odin in his prime couldn't have beaten Thor? If that's true then the question becomes: If Thor is always stronger than Odin, and Thor *couldn't* defeat Hela, then how did weaker Odin defeat Hela? A possible answer is that Odin held the Space Stone. Odin's power, amplified by the abilities and power of the Space Stone, may have been enough to tip the fight Odin's way.
Thanos knew the price that had to be paid for the Soul Stone, which is why he 'adopted' Gamora, knowing that he had no family or loved ones of his own. However, in raising her, he found himself genuinely coming to love her and could not bring himself to harm her, so instead, he adpoted Nebula and planed for the pair to seek out the Soul Stone together with the intention of Gamora sacrificing her sister.

This is why he constantly pit the two against each other in combat, to be absolutely certain that Gamora would always be the victor. Everytime that Nebula lost, he would replace a part of her body with cybernetics, not to make her stronger, but actually the opposite, making sure she would always be at a handicap against her sister, as well as fostering a deep resentment in Nebula, ensuring she would be willing to fight to the death even if Gamora tried to refuse. This is also why Nebula seemed to know the price of the Soul Stone but not Gamora. In *Infinity War* Nebula comments that Thanos returned from Vormir with the Stone and not Gamora and instantly knew her sister was dead, and in *Endgame*, when Clint and Natasha set off for Vormir, she states that she hopes the pair do not fall out on the way.

I also suspect that Thanos probably had a similar plan in place for Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive if Nebula and Gamora failed.Which is it?Think about it? It seems ineffective to call on a vigilante by shining a light in the sky. There is a huge chance he won't see it, or notice it in time for the crime to still be stopped. My theory is that the bat signal itself doesnt actually apply to batman, but rather it is a warning to criminals, like saying "we called him, nows your chance to drop everything, go home, and turn your life around", and there is a silent alarm mechanism within the signal that sends a signal directly to batman's computers



Also, Epstein didnt kill himselfEdit: I suppose I should add: No "Logan" spoilers in my post. Haven't even seen it yet.  
I was reading this interview with "The Wolverine" director James Mangold, on why after teasing Wolverine's yellow superhero costume from the comics they have not put it in any of the movies. 
Specifically, he says:
> "Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit , particularly canary yellow, and kind of prance about doing good deeds and have people go, “Oh my God! It’s The Wolverine!” At least as I see him, that’s a real struggle for me and always has been." 
  

I think that this is true, and carries over to the comics. The stoic, grumpy, serious Wolverine doesn't really have a personality to match the flamboyant bright yellow costume.
So why does he wear it? Consider:  
1. He only seems to wear the yellow costume when working with the X-Men. When he is working on his own, he usually wears his everyday clothes.  
2. Practically half the X-Men are teenagers, depending on which version of the team. There's usually at least one underager on the team. The particularly reactive nature of the X-Men as a superhero team made up of oppressed minorities makes putting insanely powerful teenagers in harmful situations look somewhat necessary.   
3. Wolverine is ridiculously tough and for all intents and purposes impervious to harm.  
4. Wolverine is extremely protective of the young X-Men. Consider his fan-beloved arcs mentoring Kitty Pryde, Jubilee, X-23, Rogue etc. Also, in Jason Aaron's run Logan starts his own branch of X-Men separate from Cyclops' and one of the main points of contention is Cyclops' and Xavier's use of children and teenagers on the X-teams.  
So, my theory is that Wolverine wears a canary yellow suit to draw fire. To draw fire away from the X-Mens' "child soldiers" who outside of the comic's dire circumstances probably shouldn't be fighting giant robots and future mercenaries anyway and towards a guy who basically cannot be seriously harmed.
Consider also:  
-The most memorable time Wolverine ditches the yellow costume is in Grant Morrison's New X-Men, which also notably a run where the active X-Men team was all adults.  
-The fan theory that Batman has the circle of yellow on the chest of his costume to draw fire to the most armoured part of his body.  
-Wolverine tends to wear the yellow costume when he is in the Avengers. Usually incarnations of the Avengers which include Wolverine also include Spider-man, another teen hero.  
-In Uncanny X-Force Wolverine wears a more subdued black-and-grey version of his costume. Once again, this team is all-adults.  

tl;dr: Wolverine wears a dumb bright yellow costume(that completely does not suit his personality) so that Sentinels will attack him and not teenage X-Men who really shouldn't even be around.So for most of the modern comic book iteration of Batman, his rule is no guns... no killing. 
But I’ve noticed in the animated series and the Rockstar game series, he also does not call the villain by their villainous monicker. I believe this is a way to connect with any possible humanity left in his opponents. He calls Penguin, Cobblepot, Two Face, Harvey or Dent... Poison Ivy , Dr. Isley or Pamela... he only calls Joker by the only identity he has. 
Ultimately, I feel like Batman has an almost unshakable hope. Hope that someday, all these “villains” can be rehabilitated. Which is why he wants to trust in the system.In Avengers: Infinity War it’s established that Thor speaks Groot. When Thor introduces Groot to Cap he says this is my friend, Tree. Therefore Groot’s real name is Tree.This theory may sound a little far fetched, but part of it came from my 10 year old daughter so bear with me.  

In Infinity War Thor was given Stormbreaker by Etri and it was called a King's weapon.  The weapon could access the bifrost and was very powerful.  It even healed Thor and restored his armor.  I believe the King's weapon gave Thor access to the Odin Force.  The most powerful magic in the universe.  This is the first part of the theory and it is not too crazy yet.

Now, why was Thor so out of shape in Endgame?  He is around 1500 years old and spent his youth drinking, eating and fighting.  So why in 5 years did he gain weight and appear to let himself go?  The Odin Force is why.  

Now this is the 10 year old daughter observation.  Thor looked like Santa, big belly, long beard, red shirt.   Yes, I laughed too, but then I realized in some myths, Odin was a source for the Santa Claus story.  

In some myths, Odin used to come to earth an act as Santa.  His eight legged horse was a possible source for the eight reindeer.  So if Odin was Santa, I figured it was his magic that allowed him to transform into Santa.

Now Thor has Odin's magic, it is transforming him into Santa.  Thor doesn't care or even really notice because he is depressed.  

TLDR:  Thor is becoming Santa due to Odin Force.(This is based on the original book and animated movie, nothing else in the Seuss-verse)

First off, there's his appearance. He's clearly physically different from every other Who: taller, green fur, yellow eyes, etc. He's a member of a completely different race than the Whos... but there's no other member of that race in sight. We also know that he's not just some genetic aberration -- the cartoon version mentions he gains the strength of "ten Grinches plus two". Not ten times his *own* strength, but the strength of ten people like him (plus two).

So, where are the rest of his people? Simple: he's *the* Grinch, not *a* Grinch. They've been wiped out. Every last man, woman, and child, besides this one lonely survivor.

But who (pun intended) could possibly have done such a horrible thing? Who (pun also intended) do we know that have a near fanatical belief in their religion? Who (*this* pun was completely accidental) makes up 99.9% of the population, and controls all the resources? *The damn Whos*.

For some reason, their religion caused them to wipe out the entire race of Grinches, leaving only one alive. It wouldn't be difficult -- the Whos have massive numbers on their side (one man had 96 daughers), and for a supposedly peace loving people, seem to have some *giant fucking knives* (as well as giving their kids javelins and bows). It also would be believable -- one of the few things we know about the Whos is how *super* religious they are. Them deciding to go all "Deus Vult" on the Grinches for refusing to follow their religion wouldn't be hard to believe.

The Grinch survived (likely due to him being frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 100 years later by two siblings). More realistically, he likely fled, or was already living as a hermit, allowing him to escape the slaughter. He lived at the top of a remote mountain, and due to his cunning, likely had a number of traps and defenses set up. The Whos were content to ignore him, so long as he was out of the way.

So of course the Grinch hates the Whos for killing everyone he ever knew (it's mentioned that he hates them all year round, not just at Christmas). But Christmas makes him even more enraged. He wants to forget about them, but on that day, the noise they make causes it to be impossible for him to do so. Even more enraging, they're singing religious hymns *of the religion that killed his people*. It's highly possible that Christmas was the anniversary of the Grinch Genocide.

At the end of the movie, the Grinch is shown making a change for the "better". Did he though? Notably, both the book and cartoon state that "*some say* his heart grew three sizes that day". It doesn't just describe it happening, it states that certain people would make that claim. It's Who propaganda, to cover up the harsh truth: The Grinch had grown depressed, and knew the Whos would kill him for ruining their special day. He was open to death, especially if it involved screwing them over, and letting them know the Grinches would never give up. However, at the last moment, he had a change of heart -- not out of love, but self preservation. He decided to assimilate instead, and pretended to join their religion. That allowed him to not live in a shitty, cold cave, and also granted him a measure of security. If he pretended to be a convert who was truly inspired by them, and declared so publicly, the Who religious officials couldn't kill him without public backlash.

**TL;DR: The Grinch is the sole survivor of a purge by the Whos, wiping out all nonbelievers. At the end, he's forced to convert in order to escape his life of poverty and seclusion.**u/zaneman777 posted a great [fan theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/9ju7qh/mcu_the_true_villian_in_infinity_war_is_the_mind) that's been stuck in my head ever since. With additions from u/loveWaffle1 and u/nosoyyo9 the theory goes as follows:

The real villain in the infinity saga is not Thanos, at least not entirely. The real cause for all the trouble is the mind stone (yes all the infinity stones are sentient). 

Thanos had the mind stone for a long while, and when Titan was on the brink of collapse, he asked it for a solution and it led him to genocide.

In Thor Loki is mischievous and wants the throne, and to please his father. It's the corruption of the mind stone that causes him to be so much more evil in The Avengers, causing harm indiscriminately. This is supported by Thor's general confusion regarding Loki's actions

The previous point is supported by the fact that in The Avengers, when everyone is on the HeliCarrier, Bruce in frustration is compelled to pick up the Scepter (Mind Stone) while everyone is fighting and arguing, and is arguably a catalyst to all the fighting in the first place.

Stark is compelled by Scarlett witch (who got her power from the mind stone) to make Ultron. Ultron comes from the mind stone and immediately attacks JARVIS; his first instinct is violence. Then his solution to a better world after only a few days alive? You guessed it, genocide. 

When Thor tells the team about his vision in AOU he says that he saw "a whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its center, is that" as he points at the mind stone. 

Vision is much more nuanced and perhaps the weakest point of the argument, but arguably Vision has more control over the stone than anyone else, and it's always alluded to that his relationship to the stone is very complicated. 

Also a support of the AoU points is that Thanos' "Fine, I'll do it myself" can easily be seen as a response to Ultron's defeat. Why else would it be in the End credits of that movie? 

So this is all old news, but here is my addition:

Strange tells Tony there was only one way to defeat Thanos. I believe there were actually a myriad of ways the Avengers and Dr. Strange could have won the conflict against Thanos. Of course there were, we've all thought some of our own. But Dr. Strange saw the future, 14,000,605 futures, and in them all he realized a pattern. Stopping Thanos is not enough: the mind stone continues to corrupt those near it and genocide reigns. 

For Dr. Strange, winning was much more than simply killing Thanos. Winning was ensuring that what caused Thanos to have the ambitions he did, would never happen again. To anyone. This is why letting Thanos win was the only way: because not only does Thanos destroy the stones, but Thanos is one of the only beings with the strength to do so. The future where they win is the future in which the mind stone is destroyed, and where the snap is undone, not simply the latter. 

This makes much more sense insofar as otherwise it's very hard to see why the events that occurred were the ONLY way to win.

Thoughts? Other supporting/refuting evidence?!

TL;DR: The Mind Stone acts like a genocidal horcrux, and Dr. Stranges plan not only involves the snap being undone, but relies on Thanos winning so that Thanos destroys the stones ensuring it can never happen again.**The Trolley Problem**. Different characters experience variations of the Trolley Problem and try to solve it in different ways.

For those unfamiliar, the Trolley Problem is a thought experiment to help understand the complexity of ethics and choices. The basic scenario is that you're the conductor of a runaway trolley barreling towards a group of 5 workers. You can trigger a switch on the tracks to divert the trolley — which will save the workers — but kill 1 pedestrian in the trolley's new path. Do you trigger the switch?

Thanos is the conductor in the basic scenario. He sees the universe's finite resources as the trolley, all the future lives of the universe on one track \(the 5 workers\) and chooses to throw the switch: kill half the universe \(the 1 pedestrian\) so that future generations will survive. Thanos is a sympathetic villain, because the most common conclusion of the Trolley Problem is that saving the 5 workers is a moral obligation. This is how our movie begins.

The story picks up with Doctor Strange, who actually agrees philosophically with Thanos, and goes out of his way to say it. His choice is to protect the Time Stone and stop Thanos, even if it means sacrificing Stark or Spidey. He's flipping the switch to save the 5 workers too, just in a different way than Thanos.

Star Lord experiences the first variation of the Trolley Problem: the "Fat Man." The setup is the same, with the runaway trolley, but instead of the conductor, you're standing on a footbridge above the tracks. There's a fat man next to you, and you could push him onto the tracks to stop the trolley. The important distinction is that you're actively taking a life, instead of passively letting someone die. Gamora is the "Fat Man," and shooting her on Nowhere would stop Thanos. He pulls the trigger.

Around the same point in the movie, Vision personifies a new variation of the Trolley Problem called the "Super Samaritan," where the conductor has the third option of derailing the trolley \(killing himself in the act\). He begs Wanda and Cap to destroy the Mind Stone so that others may live, which is reasonably beyond the moral obligation of the trolley conductor.

However, Cap says "We don't trade lives," and he's the first person to challenge the previous answers to the Trolley Problem. By objecting to "flip the switch" and kill Vision, he adds the premise of incommensurability to the story: it's not possible to weigh and balance the value of human lives.

Next, Thanos experiences a new variation of the Trolley Problem. If we conclude that killing 1 person to save 5 is the moral obligation, what happens if you switch the random pedestrian with a loved one? The outcome is the same — 5 people live, 1 person dies — but this twist in the scenario usually has people second\-guessing their original conclusion. Thanos, however, is resolute, and kills Gamora for the Soul Stone.

Back to Doctor Strange! Whereas he had resolved to let Stark die originally, he trades the Time Stone for Stark's life \(and metaphorically switches the trolley back to the original course\). Why? He has information from the future that reveals how Stark is important to the endgame. That's a new variation of the Trolley Problem, where the 1 person's life might be valued higher than the 5 lives \(the traditional twist is that the pedestrian is a scientist or doctor, with the cure to a disease\). From this perspective, human lives can be compared, but it's not as simple as every life being valued the same.

Wanda is our next flip\-flopper. She first resisted the obligation to destroy the Mind Stone, but faced with the consequences, she changes her mind. She pushes the "Fat Man" onto the tracks to try to save the lives of others, just like Star\-Lord did. 

The movie ends with only one person solving the Trolley Problem on their own terms: Thanos. The two unresolved choices belong to Strange and Cap, and they're unique because they both disagree with Thanos' conclusion... Cap refuses to weigh the value of life, Strange chooses to value one life for the eventual greater good, and we'll find out where these choices lead in Avengers 4.Obi-Wan looks at R2, gives him a funny little look and say "I don't recall ever owning a droid" 

We think it may be because ol Lucas made a boner on the prequels. Or maybe he was trying to hide his importance. I think, we saw how much R2 did and accomplished in ep 1-3, and how much the heroes owe to him. He practically saved their asses a dozen times over. When Obi-Wan says that controversial line of never having owned a Droid, he has a little glint in his eyes. He's not saying "keep quiet you, you'll blow our cover." he's saying no motherfucker in this galaxy can own R2, he's intelligent and reliable in a way no other Droid has been. He is correcting Luke about droid ownership. 

He's saying I don't own this Droid, this Droid is my friend. For years, movie studios have had their social media worker bees intentionally post spoilers for new releases all over the internet. Their intent is to inject the 'fear of being spoiled' into the consciousness of the average fan. 

Consumers who are tired of getting spoiled may decide that the best remedy is to simply go see the movie in its opening week. This helps ensure the theater is packed for release and boosts box office numbers.In Captain America The First Avenger, after Bucky falls off the train, Steve tells Peggy that he can’t get drunk because of the super soldier serum. She tells him that his metabolism is 4 times the amount of an average human.

That means he eats 4 times as much food, which makes sense. Similar to how Olympic athletes need to have insane diets. Cap probably does as well.

But this also means he takes either 1) incredibly massive poops that are four times the size of normal poops. Or 2) he poops four times as often as a normal person. 


Meaning that during the entire battle of New York in The Avengers, Steve probably was clenching his b-hole because he would’ve had to go really bad, and wouldn’t have gotten a chance to.In the epic opening battle scene of Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, Baby Groot is getting his groove on when Drax comes flying in and lands inches behind him. We see Baby Groot freeze, at which point Drax seems to no longer see him. Almost like he vanished. I think he then came to the realization that things that don’t move or move incredibly slowly are essentially invisible. Similar to how the vision of the T-Rex is described. What he doesn’t realize, however, is that other species don’t have this same handicap. So when he tries his hilarious invisibility bit in the following Avengers movie, he’s unable to comprehend why it’s absolutely absurd to the others. He’s convinced of a reality that simply isn’t so for everyone else.**Edit: Spoilers for BOTH Infinity War and Endgame**


**FINAL WARNING - SPOILERS**



So, most of us remember the scene with Thanos talking to young Gamora directly after the snap, in which shes asks him "did you do it?" and "what did it cost?" 

Well, it got me thinking; does this happen to everyone who uses the gauntlet? And if so, who does the user see? I think that Hulk saw Black Widow after he snapped and it was that conversation with her that made him realize her death was permanent. Iron Man saw his daughter, Morgan, sealing his own fate in his mind


Not a significant theory with huge implications, but adds more emotional weight to the sacrafices


Edit: going through a lot of the comments, I do think that Tony seeing Yinson would be a much more satisfying ending that would link the first saga together really well, while Morgan/Peter Parker would work well in the terms of Endgame as a singular project/setting up the next saga for the MCU. Tony seeing his parents would be a great option as well, but imo this one doesn't stand as strong because that story-line seemed to be addressed in Civil War/in the 1970's scene with Tony and his dad. I appreciate everyone's feedback and you've all made re-watching endgame a ton of fun.I’m gonna make this short and sweet.

Finnick reveals that Snow sells tributes to people in the capital if they have a desirable body. We learned that Finnick was being prostituted when it was earlier assumed he just had a lot of lovers. In the book, Katniss wonders why Snow never sold her off.

I believe he did sell her off. Cinna was a capital insider on high society and would have known exactly what was in store for Katniss. I think he bought her with full intention of shielding her. I think he did this because he was touched by her willingness to step into the games for her sister.

He takes her on in an extremely compassionate way and is a source of moral support for her. Before the first games, when Katniss is waiting to get into the elevator, Katniss eats a meal with Cinna and then spends the rest of the time waiting on a couch. But why would he be waiting with her on some creepy couch if he’s just her stylist? Because he was supposed to be having a go before the games. But he didn’t because he never intended to.

TLDR: read the title of my post

That’s my theory. Tear it apartIn the Batman cartoon episode (and comic from the '50s) The Joker inherits a fortune from a deceased gangster. But it's a prank, the money is fake, and now the Joker owes the IRS millions in estate taxes. He states that he [is perfectly willing to take on Batman, but the IRS scares him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IITiB6Yrg4s). At first I thought this was an offhand joke, but then I realized that there's a reason why the Joker doesn't want to tangle with the IRS: The insanity defense would never work for financial crimes, and he would go to state or federal prison instead of Arkham.

Joker knows what Arkham is like, his supervillain friends are there, and he knows all the escape routes. But if he went to real prison, not only would it be a completely new environment to navigate, but he would also have to contend with all the inmates. How many henchmen has Joker thrown to Batman to keep him busy? How many gangsters has he ripped off? How many people has he murdered who have friends on the inside?

And even if by some miracle none of Joker's enemies were in the prison he went to, the kinds of crimes he's committed (terrorism, kidnapping, various crimes against women and children) are the kind inmates despise. His combat skills would only take him so far if he was locked up with dozens of men who wanted to kill him. So the Joker can commit as many gruesome crimes as he wants and plead insanity, but if he gets on the wrong side of the IRS, he's put in real jail where he'd be beaten to death inside of a week.Each returns every 20-something years (Pennywise 27, Mary Poppins 25) to regenerate energy from a new group of children, but also have a tendency to return to those they met on their last visit (Pennywise returns to the Losers, Mary Poppins returns to the Banks)

Mary Poppins manages to maintain energy for 25 years despite interacting with less children than Pennywise requires for 27 years as she relies on children’s joy, unlike Pennywise who relies on their fear, and as proven in Monsters Inc children’s laughter is worth more than their fear

Upon each of their returns, they draw a child named Georgie away from their siblings with a paper toy, then appear alongside that toy to return it to Georgie (Mary Poppins returns Georgie's kite, Pennywise acts as though he’s returning Georgie’s boat)

Each has the same set of powers, in which they can take advantage of what lies in the children’s minds (Mary Poppins uses their imagination, Pennywise uses their fear)

Mary Poppins famously has a living reflection that can function separately from her, and Pennywise is shown to share this ability in Chapter Two

In each of these stories, the parents are oblivious to the fantastical situations being experienced by the children

The Losers club forget their experiences as children until Pennywise returns, and although the Banks children do not forget Mary Poppins, they do forget that the magical experiences actually happened, and they remember Mary Poppins as just a nanny

Each has a love for singing and dancing, which should be obvious for Mary Poppins, but becomes clearer for Pennywise when you remember that he refers to himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, dances for Beverly in Chapter One, and sings for Richie in Chapter Two

Pennywise is heavily associated with the song Oranges and Lemons, which is a song about old London, where Mary Poppins lives, showing that Pennywise has an awareness that another member of his species is out there, and he knows exactly where they are 

Pennywise has a mystical light source called the Deadlights, and although we never see Mary Poppins’ Deadlights, it is likely she has them too, as in Mary Poppins Returns she creates an imaginary crowd of lamplighters to sing the song ‘Trip a Little Light Fantastic’, which may possibly be her way of convincing the children to look into her Deadlights without scaring them into it (It is proven that these lamplighters are fake and created by Mary Poppins, as when Michael hears the children singing outside and opens the door, he sees only Mary Poppins and the children, and all the lamplighters appear to have vanished 

At the end of Mary Poppins returns, the characters all grab balloons and float into the air, and balloons and floating are both highly associated with PennywiseAs stated in the title, something people constantly bring up as a plot hole of sorts with most incarnations of the character is how he can both create and easily repair high quality costume as a teenager with likely no other experience in sewing or costume production/design in general. I think a solution to this is that the bite gave him another power; seamstry skills on par that of a spider spinning it’s own webs. This could also be spun (pun intended) to apply to how he knows how to easily produce non-organic webbing.

EDIT: A lot of people are saying this doesn’t need an explanation because him being poor would probably give him experience in sewing, or how over the years he would probably improve and get costumes the quality of the Spider-Man PS4 suit as an example, but I meant this as an explanation more towards the universes like the Raimi one for example, where his first ever costume is an INSANELY high quality outfit with raised webbing and the like, that an 18 year old with sewing experience gained mostly from having to repair old clothes ABSOLUTELY could not make. In other universes, like the MCU, where their first suit looks like it WAS made by a teenager with some sewing experience, I wouldn’t say this is the case. Johnny sins is one of the main characters in the brazzers cinematic universe, but hes a very strange one, the show showcases multiple times the fact that he has multiple jobs, at fist this doesn't seem like something weird but when you look into it you know something's up, he has been seen as both a doctor and a astronaut, those are major careers that require years of training, hes apparently also a fire fighter and a lawyer, this just doesn't make any sense, my theory is that the entire show is him daydreaming incide a jail cell because he's a registered sex offender, you might be thinking "tf are you talking about this doesn't make any sense" let me present to you the evidence, in the bcu women behave in a very strange way, mr sins straight up assaults women and instead of reporting him to the authorities they engage in sexual activities with him, in one specific instance Johnny shows a woman his genitals instead of the pizza she requested and what does she do, she has intercourse with him, this just seems like the weird fantasy of a rapist, well... What if it is.So, it’s no secret that Spongebob clearly cares for Squidward. No matter how many times Squidward pushes Spongebob away, Spongebob always goes back to trying to be Squidward’s friend. 

In the show, this is often presented like classic Spongebob naïveté/stupidity. That it’s obvious Squidward doesn’t want to be Spongebob’s friend but Spongebob is too naive to see it. However I don’t think that’s the case. 

First, Squidward has no other friends. I think that’s obvious. He hates everything and thinks everyone is an idiot expect for him. I think Spongebob is really the only person (besides himself) that Squidward really cares about. 

Evidence Squidward cares about Spongebob: 

1. In the April Fools Episode, Squidward says, and I quote: 

“I didn’t mean to hurt you, in fact Spongebob, I *like* you. I like living next store. I like hearing your fog horn alarm in the morning and your high pitched giggling at night.” 

He then goes on to say he even likes Gary, Patrick, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs. 

2. When Squidward moves away, he finds his new home to be too boring and misses Spongebob. 

3. When a fish makes Spongebob cry Squidward knocks him in the face with a pizza.(pizza delivery episode) 

4. In the Hash-Slinging Slasher, Squidward tells Spongebob “I’ve always kind of liked you!”

5. In the Christmas episode, Squidward pretends to be Santa and literally gives away all of his stuff just to make Spongebob happy  

Basically, Squidward is grumpy, unhappy, and disappointed at where his life is at. He’s very posh and it’s clear he never expected to spend his life as a cashier. But deep down, he sort of likes his life. Though he tries not to admit it.

And I think Spongebob knows all of this. He knows

1. Squidward is unhappy and doesn’t have many friends 

2. That deep down Squidward really does care for Spongebob 

And for Spongebob, being the lovable sponge he is, that’s all he needs to know. He knows that Squidward needs a friend so no matter how many times he gets pushed away, Spongebob keeps going back to make Squidward happy.

TLDR: Spongebob cares for Squidward and feels bad for him, so he never stops trying to be Squidward’s friend.When Harry tried on the hat, it mentioned all of the houses as options, and Slytherin in particular. But Harry got into Gryffindor *because he asked*. He didn't specifically say Gryffindor, but he ruled out Slytherin, and didn't want either other house.

Same for Hermione: we find out the hat actually wanted to put her into Ravenclaw, but she asked for Gryffindor.

Ron and Neville both talked about being worried about getting into Gryffindor, and not living up to the expectations. Harry never told anyone except Dumbledore about his choice until he was an adult, and Hermione only told a small group of friends her fifth year. It's pretty likely that they, and others, made the choice, then never told anyone about it.

When all of the Gryffindors first come in, none of them actually see to have the traits of the house: Neville is cowardly, Ginny is shy and meek, and none of the Gryffindors really seem *brave* right off the bat, certainly not as much as other houses, where Malfoy is clearly arrogant and cunning, Luna is clearly clever, etc. In fact, many Gryffindors seem like they belong better in other houses: Hermione, McGonagall, and Dumbledore were both exceptionally intelligent, Percy was extremely ambitious, Neville and Ron were loyal and hardworking, etc.

Godric Gryffindor set up the hat purposefully so that it would never just choose Gryffindor. We know that the hat sometimes will shout out a house almost instantly, which we never see occur with Gryffindor. The test isn't if someone is brave already, *it's if they have the bravery to make the choice*. If someone *wants* to be brave, they can be, and by getting the validation from the hat, they then start choosing that for themselves. Neville stands up for himself, both to Malfoy and to the trio. Percy throws aside his ambition for his family, and for what is right, Ginny becomes self confident and self assured.

TL;DR: The Sorting Hat choosing Gryffindor is a placebo effect, people allow themselves to be brave by choosing the option.

Edit: A lot of people are asking about Neville, since he claims to have asked to be put into Hufflepuff. Neville is an exception to this rule (please listen, not a cop out). From Pottermore "In Neville’s case, the Hat was determined to place him in Gryffindor: Neville, intimidated by that house’s reputation for bravery, requested a placing in Hufflepuff. Their silent wrangling resulted in triumph for the Hat." (Thanks to u/Observa for the quote). These "Hatstalls" are exceedingly rare, and it takes the hat nearly four minutes to decide for Neville. Consider: The Sorting Hat is an immensely powerful legilmens with years of experience, and Neville was able to flat out resist it. Unlike other Hatstalls mentioned like Pettigrew, where the hat was deciding between two options, in this case, Neville was able to short out the hat himself. He showed bravery not by asking explicitly, but by ignoring a powerful authority figure (the hat), and doing what he believed in. Hand blasters are really, really powerful. We frequently see blasters [blast concrete apart with greater force than an anti-material rifle,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxgQS-7EcCo) and put [smoldering, head-sized craters into metal surfaces.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKI-dGNHgDo) They can be used for [demolition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnFTtPjGxc) and [collapsing tunnels.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq6eKszACkI) When droids get hit by a blaster shot they tend to get [blown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4WtbewfvEY) [the hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgpzeQy5Nw) [to bits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VND-L2EL8BQ) Even a [missed shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Jk8fj3oEU) can knock someone [flat on their ass.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fPIsZYUWUE)

Edit: FULL god, my mistake.If you're like me and you've watched all five Ice Age films, as well as both of the holiday specials and the eight short films, you'll notice that humans are never mentioned beyond the 2002 original. The series goes from having its toes dipped in reality to gradually becoming far more cartoony with the introduction of dinosaurs, pirates, aliens, and cults of eternally young animals. And, if you're like me, you've lost sleep over this fact. Where did humanity go? Like, Jesus, we just watched 81 minutes of trying to SAVE a human baby, did they just stop existing after that?

Yes.

Let me explain.

Included with the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Ice Age: The Meltdown (2006) is a short film entitled "No Time For Nuts" where the lovable Scrat discovers the skeleton of a scientist buried under the snow. In the palm of the scientist's hand? A time machine. Scrat does as Scrat does and gets into a variety of hijinks that eventually culminates in him being thrown into some strange alternate dimension with a lot of clocks and acorns. Clearly, this is some sort of rip in the space-time continuum, which angers God. But would a just God be angry at Scrat, a simple creature that knows only how to fend for himself and try his best to survive, or would God be angry at those who ENABLED the poor saber-toothed squirrel to cause such damage? The clear answer is the latter, but God is not one who acts with a scalpel. His decision is to bring the hammer down on ALL of humanity, for they have attempted to play God. But luckily for Him, He was able to catch humanity's affront long before it TRULY happened, catching it in 20,000 B.C. rather than whatever year humanity invented time travel. Unfortunately, the effects of the time rip are still felt throughout the greater Ice Age world, causing anachronistic details like diegetic music that would not exist for thousands of years appearing in four of the films.

In Ice Age: The Meltdown, there is not a single mention of humanity, but several details in the herd's sophomore outing hint at humanity’s demise. For starters, let's take a look at the premise. A great flood has surrounded the valley where the film is set, and the animals have to travel to the opposite end of the valley to reach a large boat that will save them from the flood. Straight off the bat, the plot is oddly biblical, reinforced by the imagery in the crowd sequences where the animals are mostly seen marching two by two. We also know that a great flood is part of God’s grab-bag of tricks to wipe out humanity. There’s an awkward sequence where Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths, who try to sacrifice him to avert the coming flood, proving that the idea of religion exists within the animal population of the Ice Age universe. One huge moment for this theory comes in the climax, where Scrat inadvertently saves the herd from certain doom after Ellie gets trapped in a cave and the rest of the herd forgoes getting on the boat to save her. The moment was practically… an act of God?

Am I implying that Scrat is God?

No.

But remember the unifying detail behind every major natural event in the Ice Age franchise. Scrat attempts to bury his acorn in the opening sequence of the very first film. The shattering of the wall holding back the flood in The Meltdown is started by Scrat pulling his acorn from its buried hiding spot. Scrat learns from these events by the time Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) rolls around, and does his best to be careful when burying his acorn once more, and yet the mountain he is scurrying across splits down the middle and he is launched to the center of the Earth, splitting apart the Pangea supercontinent. (Now, the fact that Pangea still exists at the time of the fourth film may be one of the leftover effects directly tied to humanity’s meddling with the flow of time, as 2002’s short film “Gone Nutty: Scrat’s Missing Adventure” already depicted the continental drift, but I digress.) The glaciers, the flood, the draining of the flood, the (two) splits of Pangea, were all caused by Scrat, or more specifically, Scrat’s coveted acorn.

God is an acorn.

THAT’S why the rip in time and space was filled to the brim with clocks, which represented time, and acorns, which we now know represented space. It’s why the inhabitants of Scratlantis in Continental Drift and the aliens in Ice Age: Collision Course (2016) have such a heavily acorn-based culture; in their great scientific exploits, they have discovered the existence of God and worship His oaken form. In the short film Scrat: Spaced Out, included on the Blu-ray release of Collision Course, it is revealed that the alien race (known as the Scratazons) were trying to get their hands on the holy acorn, which explains why the UFO was buried on Earth and was only awakened by the placement of the acorn in the steering console. The Scratazons have built grand acorn shaped temples on Earth, as seen in the 2019 video game Ice Age: Scrat’s Nutty Adventure. 

The empathy of His Nuttiness is not only limited to Manny and the gang. It is the most obvious explanation for the survival of the dinosaurs well past the strike of the asteroid: He saw a group of dinosaurs that he felt were worthy of His love and protected them from harm, deep under the ice. 

Now, it should be mentioned: with His Fagaceaeness wiping out humanity, not to mention the dinosaurs, what species will become the dominant species on Earth? That answer is simple: None. He has learned His lesson and will no longer put all of His eggs in one basket. As such, He has decided to rapidly evolve (a concept noted in the Ice Age franchise, 11 minutes and 46 seconds into The Meltdown) all of the animals on Earth. We see that by the time of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), the animals have grown in intelligence, having developed the concept of villages (at 27 minutes and 53 seconds, Manny tells Ellie, Crash, and Eddie to head back to the village) and by Continental Drift, mammoths no longer do the anatomically accurate speed walk that real elephants can do as depicted in The Meltdown and Dawn of the Dinosaurs; instead, their physicality and anatomy has shifted to allow them to gallop at great speed like horses. In the 19 year time jump between Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift, animals now form societies with massive statues, bridges, and pirates, and several years later in Collision Course, they throw parties with decorations and music and play sports such as hockey. 

In the grand scheme of things, what does this all mean? It means that quarantine has taken a serious toll on me and the vaccine has been one of the better occurrences in my life.

TL;DR God is real, he’s an acorn, and I cannot wait to rejoin society.A number of people have presented fan theories on what the plot of Avengers 4: Endgame will be. I was watching Age of Ultron and Doctor Strange and realized something that most if not all the other theories have missed. 

Several users have surmised that Endgame will feature time travel and Quantum Realm as a major component to defeating Thanos - and fulfilling Doctor Strange's 1 out of 14 million visions.  The more I think about it, it seems to me that we are grossly underestimating the scope of that vision and how far did Dr. Strange implement his plan before he was turned to dust. 

If there is one thing we know about Marvel, it's that they love putting in hints and Easter eggs in the movies. Piecing together at least of some of these, I think most of what have happened since Doctor Strange (or some time after the events of Doctor Strange) is part of a time loop - that will repeat itself until it is broken in Endgame. 

In the Age of Ultron, Banner says to Tony "this is a time loop..." which struck me as an odd statement given the context. There's not much discussion or mention of a time loop reference other than that exchange and in Doctor Strange where Strange puts Dormammu in a time loop in order to force Dormammu to quit his plans for Earth and seal the dimensional passageway. 

Further, I think that it is weird that in only 1 out of 14000605 futures that Strange saw resulted in a victory over Thanos. By its very definition, there are an infinite number of universes - every decision  any being takes results in a new alternate universe. By that logic, it does not make sense why Strange saw a subset (large as it may be) of the alternate futures and why in only 1 do they win. By definition there cannot be only 1 out of all possible alternate universes in which they win. 14000605 is too arbitrary a number.

I do not think that Strange saw all possible outcomes - rather he saw 14000604 iterations "until the heroes win". There literally is "only one way to stop Thanos". That makes even more sense because he is using the Time Stone which controls time. Alternate realities should be the domain of the Reality Stone (and I don't think  we have seen the true potential of the Reality Stone) not the Time Stone. Though admittedly of course 14 million iterations might take the plot a tad too far. 

In Infinity War, when Strange cedes the Time Stone to Thanos, the stone is clearly glowing and thus "activated" - since the events of Infinity War at least at that point are within the time loop.

Even though Strange is dust, that does not break the time loop, as we saw in Doctor Strange (when Dormammu repeatedly kills him). We are again reminded of that by Strange when he tells Ebony Maw, "you will find a dead man's spell.. hard to break.." in Infinity War.

I believe the time loop is also perhaps another reason why the Infinity War movie is named as such. Think about it, the war against Thanos doesn't happen everywhere in Universe - but only in specific locations like Earth, Xandar, Titan, knowhere, etc. Several other cosmic places and entities exist in Marvel's universe but are not party to this war, though of course they would affected by the outcome. The war however is infinite in iterations - in addition, at least, to the war being over Infinity Stones (which of course is the more obvious reason for the title), the events of Infinity War on an infinite loop (though we see only one iteration) until the heroes win and break the loop in Endgame.

Scott Lang (Ant-Man) is the wild card in breaking the loop. Since he went into the Quantum Realm, he may escape the time loop (perhaps by going to a Time Vortex mentioned in Ant-Man 2). That would explain why Time Vortices were so wittily mentioned in the movie. Everything we see in Civil War and Ant Man movies is part of the time loop - but going through a Time Vortex while stuck in the Quantum Realm allows Ant-Man to escape the time loop.
Throughout the show, Iroh has shown his actions that seem silly or weird have a double, deeper meaning when we know more about Iroh and I think his love of Tea is a perfect example of that.   


It clicked with me when we see Iroh explain to Zuko how that learning from all 4 elements helps to create a more rounded view of the world and be a better person.  


To make Tea, you need all 4 elements to work together to it succeed, you need the clay for the teapots and cups, the water for the substance of the tea, Fire to heat up the Tea and the air blown on the hot tea to cool it so you can drink it (even if you leave it out to cool naturally, it would get cold and taste worse to drink). If you take one element out, tea is either impossible or worse without it.  


It's just fascinating thought and the depth of Iroh that people may dismiss if anybody looked at him on a surface level.This is not a new theory. This is basically my way of rationalizing a theory which is already in existence.

For those who aren't aware, there is a theory that the Joker in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight is the way he is because of PTSD. The idea is that he was either a soldier or some form of military personnel who experienced such a severe level of trauma that he cracked and became the Joker. 

___
**Let me start by saying that this is going to contain spoilers so if you haven't seen the films, you have the option to back out now.**
___

My theory actually doesn't endorse the idea that he was a soldier. I believe that the Joker may have been an intelligence officer of some sort. A type of Spec-Ops agent who was highly trained in various combat techniques and educated in how to conceal one's identity. A spy/assassin of sorts.

**My arguments...**

1. **Do you want to see a magic trick?** -  During the first interaction between the Joker and the various heads of the organized crime groups, he uses a pencil to kill one of the henchmen. The fact that happened is extremely important to this theory because one of the more famous claims about highly trained government agents is that they have the ability to kill a person with a pencil or pen. This was even touched upon in the John Wick films. 

2. **He's military trained.** - This one goes without saying. The Joker not only has the capacity to get his hands on military hardware but he also has technical skills in the use of various firearms and explosives. We can take this even further and cite the point when he was disguised as a cop. It's not a stretch to say that he understood uniform dress standards and standing in formation. Any cop would have noticed something was wrong had he not been educated in this. The fact he understood these standards means it's possible he was a police officer at some point or he was able to use a previous military uniform/rifle knowledge to conceal himself.

3. **His clothes have no discernible tags or markings. They seem to be hand-made.**- This line gets dropped after the Joker gets arrested. They were looking at his clothing in hopes of getting a lead on his actual identity and it turned out they had no tags and were possibly hand-made. - There is actually a case of a man who died randomly on a beach years ago. [(The Taman Shud Case)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamam_Shud_case) He is theorized to have been some sort of sleeper agent who committed suicide after completing his mission or fearing he was compromised. One of the more notable mysteries of his death is his clothing was free from any markings or tags. It was as if he knew people would use it to find his identity.

4. **His face doesn't exist.** - At one point in the film, Bruce and Alfred are looking at a facial scan of the Joker in one of Bruce's computer screens. It's using some sort of facial recognition system to get a match on him. The odd thing about this is it can be assumed Bruce's system is tied into Wayne Enterprises and all resources connected to W.E. (some public military and public record systems) This means that his face isn't "missing" from the system but was likely purposely shielded from public systems and records. - The Joker couldn't just be a guy because any guy would show up on a facial recognition scan. Even if it was a drivers license photo or a yearbook photo or something that was bound to leak onto public/private record. A 100% clean record is not possible. This actually comes up in Cat Woman's story arc in the third film. Joker was clean of any matches. That tells me his record was blacklisted from all systems (government or otherwise) on purpose and that purpose being he was likely some sort of agent whose identity had to be protected. 

5. **I know the squealers...and you're a squealer.** - At one point the Joker comes face to face with the head of Chinese operations and he tells me straight up "Batman will find you and make you squeal. I know the squealers." - This line is important in my view because it leads me to believe that torture (either the conducting of torture or training to resist torture) may be a part of Joker's background. I genuinely believe that he was saying he could gauge a person's pain tolerance by their body language. This may actually be what made Joker crack to begin with. It's possible that he experienced a torture so horrid that he ended up evolving into this "Joker" persona to cope with the anguish. 

6. **Never start with the head, the victim gets all fuzzy.** - The Joker says this after Batman punches him in the interrogation scene. This may come off as a sarcastic and joking line to most but I'm of the opinion that he was being serious. I believe that Joker may have actually been giving Batman some pointers in proper interrogation. You don't beat the head because that makes them concussed and they can't remember. Joker was speaking from experience in torture. The second punch to Joker's hand, the punch which he doesn't react to at all, that tells me he has an extremely high pain tolerance which may be related to his training to resist torture methods.

7. **You wanna know how I got these scars?** - His constantly shifting stories aren't a joke or a way for him to mess with people. He is actually trained to do this as a means of confusing his interrogators and to prevent people from uncovering the truth. The Joker has multiple ways of explaining away an obvious thing. None of his answers are THE answer but they are each plausible and they make sense considering the circumstances. If 20 stories can all be equally true while all being false, that fucks up an interrogation. Joker coming up with multiple stories isn't just a character trait for him. Joker is trained to manipulate interrogators by leading them away from the answer. Silence isn't perfect because interrogators will keep trying to make you squeal. Speaking nonsense and giving purposely false information to help distract the enemy, that is a strategy. He does this consciously. Even when he finally told Batman where Rachel and Harvey were being kept, he reversed the numbers to manipulate. Even in speaking the truth.

I think the background story of Joker being a soldier isn't going far enough. The idea that he may have actually been some sort of highly trained intelligence officer may be a valid explanation for these dots that other people have connected.

This is just my way of rationalizing it.When Mr. Incredible and Frozone are being listened to, it’s indicated that Frozone was the initial target that Syndrome wanted to attract. During the next scene, while rescuing people from the fire, Frozone mentions that he can’t use his powers because it’s too hot and he’s dehydrated. 

It’s only after observing them that the plan changes, and Mirage decides to go after Mr. Incredible instead. 

When Mr. Incredible arrives at the island, it seems like he is simply dodging all of the Omnidroid’s attacks when he falls into the volcano. Later, however, Mr. Incredible asks why he was attracted to the volcano— I theorize this is because he realizes the Omnidroid was directing him to the volcano. 

My theory is that the Omnidroid was so easily defeated by Mr. Incredible because it was the Omnidroid created to defeat Frozone. We find out that a large number Supers have been defeated because the Omnidroid learns as it fights— but it would also make sense that Syndrome would program them with methods intended to defeat the Supers. I believe that the Omnidroid, when realizing it was outmatched, immediately began funneling Mr. Incredible to the volcano because that was the strategy it was programmed with to fight Frozone (his anticipated opponent). Thus, the only reason Mr. Incredible is able to defeat the first Omnidroid is because it was never designed for his fighting style. Similarly, had Frozone remained the target its likely he would have been funneled to the volcano and defeated by the Omnidroid. A common complaint from directors are that Marvel is very restrictive about the IP which led to Edgar Wright and Scott Derikson leaving Antman and Dr Strange 2.

Hemsworth was also at that point tired of 'serious' Thor. 

So I theorise that for non flagship (i.e not Iron Man or Cap) characters they allowed some freedom to the directors. In the case of the supposedly final Thor movie they let a comedy director take over and change the tone of the character completely.

Might also explain why the first Dr Strange was allowed to be so trippy and why Captain Marvel was so generic

That may mean that the more creative movies in the future will come from C or D list characters. Squirrel Girl please.This direct order is mentioned by the character Trudy Chacon to the others as she's piloting the helicopter that's searching for Jake. She says this because the sun's setting, and they're losing light.Moana (2016) begins with the titular character in her home island, doing normal, worldly things. Then she gets the Call to Action, gets on a boat, goes on an adventure, saves the world, and then goes back home.

In the very beginning of her journey, Moana asks the ocean for help and immediately gets hit by a storm. We're meant to understand that the storm drove her to her destination, because she wakes up in Maui's island.

What if there's a barrier between the normal human world and the magical otherworld, where are all the things from Polynesian mythology are? And the only way to get to the otherworld is to be a part of it? For instance, by being dead?

My theory is that the storm killed Moana so she could go to the place where all the weird magic stuff exists, and at the very end, Te Fiti not only fixes Moana's boat (which had been wrecked to bits), but also brings her back to life, so she can go back to the human world. Things to support it:

\- Moana doesn't meet or interact with any "normal" humans from the moment of the storm until after Te Fiti brings her back; she only runs across Maui and monsters;

\- Throughout the film, Moana survives things no human could survive (just look at all her falls in the Realm of Monsters). The only time we see Moana get physically hurt is when she gets her foot stuck in the reef - which takes place BEFORE the storm, when she was still in her island (and alive). (Of course, being apparently made of steel could also just be because she's a cartoon).

\- Moana meets her grandma and ancestors as ghosts during her adventure; she also sees her grandma's spirit as a stingray before the storm, but it is only after the storm that the two actually interact and talk to each other (because they're both dead).

\- In early drafts of the script, the Realm of Monsters was called the underworld, and Moana actually met her ancestors there (that doesn't matter so much because it's not canon, just a bit of trivia).

And all of this applies to Hei Hei the chicken as well, since he was with Moana all throughout her adventure. He must have also died in the storm and then been brought back to life by Te Fiti (at the end, Maui even points out, "The chicken lives").

Edit: I just remembered Moana does look hurt for a second when she's trying to get out of Maui's cave. That may be simply mental pain, since she just ran into a rock and her brain is telling her that should hurt. Also, she does some crazy Spider-Man stunts a second after that. To the best of my memory, that's the only time she looks physically hurt between the storm and the finale.Hela says that Odin was a conqueror, an emperor, but "suddenly" decided to become a pacifist.

With no further context, Odin's change of heart could seem sudden or even forced. But we did get more context on the first Thor movie.

The real reason Odin changed was... Loki.

When he found the baby abandoned in the battlefield, he finally learned the consequences of his acts. It's very likely that Thor was already born as well, so he empathized with the baby because he had his own baby. So, he thought about how many babies must have died because of his conquests, and from that point on decided to stop.

So, in a certain way, Loki might  have saved the Marvel Universe from Odin and Hela.In a deleted scene from The Incredible Hulk, Bruce tries to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head by putting the gun in his mouth. This obviously does not work because as he put it in The Avengers, the other guy spit the bullet out. My theory is such, when he fired the gun in his mouth, it caused trauma to his face and broke bones before the Hulk could take over and thwart the attempt. His bones healed as they were while the change was happening, changing his face, making him go from Ed Norton to Mark Ruffalo.

&#x200B;

Edit: This also changed his voice due to the trauma of a gunshot to the mouthIn the LOTR movies there are these little details that only last for about a second.  First when Aragorn witnesses Gandalf fall he freezes for a few seconds and almost takes an arrow to the face.  It takes Boromir shouting at him to snap him out of it.  Also when the sad music is playing and all the hobbits are crying we just see Legolas staring at the ground in disbelief.  My theory is that Aragorn and Legolas where more distraught then any of the group but just didn't show it because they are hardened warriors but they are also educated and know who Gandalf is.

In the LOTR lore, it is revealed that Gandalf isn't just some mysterious Wizard but something equivalent to an archangel like Saint Micheal and Satan.  He and the rest of the wizards of Middle Earth are on the same power level as Sauron and Morgoth and Legolas and Aragorn know it because they were raised by the elves and were educated.  To the Hobbits, losing Gandalf was like losing a grandfatherly figure and Gimli and Boromir, both hardened warriors themselves, are barely affected by it but to Aragorn and Legolas it was like watching Jesus die.  What was probably going through boths' minds afterward was "we are truly fucked now."Bacteria is the answer. In the scene of the transformation of skinny Steve Rogers into big buff Captain America there is a small joke where Erskine injects him penicillin beforehand. The penicillin shot was much more important than it seems, because human body is full of bacteria, and the Super Serum would enhance microbes as well, therefore they should be killed beforehand.

In the movie it is shown that Johan “red skull” Schmidt injected the serum by himself, it worked but it also enhanced the bacteria, the grow in such a way that they destroyed the skin of his face (and maybe entire body), and it would have killed him if he wasn’t enhanced as well, so his body is in a constant battle against super microbes and that messed up his face.I have been reading this book to my son and something about it struck me. When Willy Wonka announces his golden ticket giveaway, there is a mad rush for his chocolate bars and in the first week 4 of the 5 tickets are found. The 5th ticket remains unfound and the search goes on for weeks. In the book, between when the finding of the 4th and 5th ticket Mr. Bucket loses his job putting on toothpaste caps and can only find work shoveling snow. Charlie is described as slowly starving and becoming thinner and thinner due to the lack of food. Eventually he finds some money and uses it to buy the chocolate where he finds the ticket. In the book, he finds the ticket on Jan 31 and the tour happens the next day on February 1 just down the street from where he lives. I think that this was part of Willy Wonka’s plan. He wanted to contest to continue for as long as possible since once the 5th ticket was found the rush to buy his chocolate would die down. If the ticket had been found after the 4th ticket his sales would have dropped dramatically. If this ticket had been found anywhere but the town the factory was located in the winner would have had to travel to the town to attend the tour and that would have risked them missing the tour. So at the start of the contest Willy Wonka sent out 4 tickets to the UK, Europe and the US and withheld the last ticket until the last possible moment to continue the hype around the contest for as long as possible. So, for those of you who haven’t seen *Age of Ultron* in a while, one of the stand-out moments of the film is Vision casually lifting Thor’s hammer when he’s first created, and then later outright wielding it during the Ultron Offensive in Sokovia. At the end of the film, Steve and Tony are arguing with Thor about how he pulled it off: either, as a machine, he doesn’t count as a living being and can lift the hammer (“if you put it in an elevator it would still go up; elevator’s not worthy”) or he’s a genuinely pure soul who, as a being on “the side of life”, is worthy of protecting the human race.

Vision’s up there with my favourite Avengers so I’m sorry to do him dirty like this, but yeah, *Endgame* kind of implies that the elevator thing was right. Here’s how:

Steve lifts the hammer during the final battle in *Endgame.* Like Vision, he can call the hammer to him and swing it around, but unlike Vision he can also summon lightning (and uses it as part of his attacks). Remember the inscription on the hammer:

>**Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.**

Thor’s power is the lightning. When he uses it, the hammer works as a conduit for that: he doesn’t get the lightning from the hammer itself. *Thor: Ragnarok* establishes that. The lightning is the power of Thor, and the lightning is what Steve can use whereas Vision can’t.

So, yeah. *Endgame* was an unlucky film for Vision all round

&#x200B;

**EDIT: I made a mistake, Vision never actually summons the hammer to him. I was thinking of** [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2iv62jrSdo)**, but in that case he picks it up off the floor instead of summoning it**But that's because we live in the Matrix. Where humans are bad batteries. But in the real world, we produce more energy than we could ever use. 



You just have to wake up.Not much more to it than the title really. The 1/8th of Voldemort's soul that attached itself to Harry means he has more soul than everyone else (with the possible exception of James Brown), Dementors go "shit yeah, 1.125 for the price of 1, gotta get me some of that".

Sorry if this is a repost, I'm new here.In *The Last Olympian*, Percy takes on "The Curse of Achilles" by bathing in the Styx. By doing so, he becomes essentially unkillable, with enhanced speed, strength, and reflexes, as well as invulnerable skin. However, it comes at a cost: he has a weak spot, where even a tiny wound can kill him. For his weak spot, Percy chooses the small of his back. He dismisses the thought rather quickly, thinking that it's harder to hit, and has some covering from his armor. However, there's a far larger, subliminal reason for his choice.

What is Percy's fatal flaw, that the goddess of wisdom straight up tells him? *He's too loyal to his friends.* Percy would sacrifice the world to save one of his friends, and because of his loyal nature, can't imagine his friends not doing the same.

And who is constantly covering Percy's back in a fight? *His friends*. We see dozens of mentions of Annabeth, or Grover, or Thalia, or Beckendorf fighting beside Percy, and in almost every case, there's a mention of them making sure an enemy can't get behind him.

**In order to kill Percy, his friends would either have to fail him, or betray him, neither of which is possible in his mind.**In the seventh book, its established that you need to win a wand's allegiance for it to function as intended.

Ron uses his brother's old wand until the second book, where it breaks and he's essentially wandless for a year. Aside from a couple of fluke cases, we don't see Ron perform any magic which works as intended until the third book (where his parents get him a brand new wand). His poor results are put down to a lack of aptitude and effort, (or tree attack) but in the later books he's easily Harry's equal (outside of DADA).

The same is true of Neville. He's renowned for being awful at magic throughout the series, and he's another character who uses a wand which didn't choose him (in this case, his father's). That wand gets broken in the fight at the Ministry, and once he has his new wand, he becomes the best student in the year at herbology and leads a revolution. He's even so good he ends up as a professor. The turning point could be seen to be during the DA, but bear in mind that he's just as bad at magic as ever, all through that fight.

There are definitely holes in this theory, but compared to a lot of Harry Potter theories that are passed around the web, this fits the source material pretty well.

Edit: My phone's spellcheck does not like the word Wand.In their hit song, "All Star", one of the lines clearly admits this: 

*My world's on fire, how about yours?

That's the way I like it and I never get bored*


One of the key tenets of Daredevil's comic/Netflix series is that while Matt Murdock/Daredevil was blinded during an incident with chemicals, his other senses were heightened to the point that he can still "see"--only he states that what he "sees" is a "[world on fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTj7dRD6ho)". 

And of course being a secret superhero isn't boring. Especially when you could lose your powers at any given moment (more on this below). 

Furthermore, notice how most blind people tend to wear sunglasses. This is typically to protect their eyes from the sunlight--their eyes still can be sensitive to light. Some also wear sunglasses to try to conceal their eyes, as "blind eyes" are noticeably different-looking from "seeing eyes" (just think about your dog's eyes--one has glaucoma and is filmy, while the other is clear). 

Now, look at [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/SmashMouthAlbum.jpg) photo of the band. Or [this one](http://www.vanyaland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smash-mouth40340.jpg), or [this one](http://yewnorktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/smash-mouth6.jpg). How about [this one?](https://i0.wp.com/www.atlantamusicguide.com/wp-content/uploads/Smashmouth.jpeg). Have [another](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/f/f5/Smash_Mouth.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130314181805), and [another,](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DDGy10vJhXQ/maxresdefault.jpg) and [yet another one.](http://starsingers.net/wp-content/uploads/images/Smash-Mouth_12829.jpg) And one [final photo.](http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.12.99/gifs/smashmouth3-9932.jpg). 

Now, what do the above photos all have in common? In all of them, at least one member of Smash Mouth is wearing sunglasses. 

This is because the members change off as to who is blind. So someone has to wear sunglasses to conceal the fact. Sometimes several members wear sunglasses to try to throw us off the scent. But this bloodhound has found out their secret. 

I believe they randomly lose their sight and gain Daredevil's powers. It is outside their control--it could happen on a daily basis, weekly, or hourly basis. 

They prove this in their song "Everyday Superhero". 

First, they clearly state *"I'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero*". A straight up admission.

Another line goes, *Trying to save the world, but never really sure*, while yet another line states, *I don't see myself as invincible, it's not true at all*. 

They don't see themselves as "invincible" and are "never really sure" because they never know who will have the superpowers at any given moment. This makes their crimefighting lives truly challenging. 

In summary: They declare their "world is on fire" just like Daredevil's world is on fire. 

They admit to being "everyday superheroes". 

One member is always seen in sunglasses to conceal his blindness. 

They never know which member is blind because the power is moved randomly from person to person, as they admit in the lyrics "never really sure" and "I don't see myself as invincible". 

So in Season 1 Episode 7 "My Three Sons" Fry drinks the Emperor of Trisol thereby becoming Emperor himself for a time.  Part of becoming Emperor of Trisol, we're told, is that one must recite an exceddingly long Coronation Oath from memory and if you fail at this you are killed on the spot.  Fry, being ever lazy, opts to simply write this on his arm and cheat.  He reads off his arm in front of the whole planets population, even misreading one of the last words before correcting himself.  Ever since this episode first aired it's always bothered me that none of the Trisolians called him on it.  His advisor is even standing right behind him and has proven himself to be a stickler for rules.

Today I realized it's because the Trisolians don't know anything about human biology.  Just seconds before this scene we see one of them try to assassinate Fry by drinking him through a straw.  For all the Trisolians know Fry IS reciting from memory and a human method to recall memory is making it appear on their arm.  Trisolians are liquid so you couldn't write on one so they have no concept of cheating by writing on yourself.

TL;DR: Fry was able to cheat because no one knew he was cheating.I searched for this theory and didn't see a result, so I thought I'd share it. This is a repost from SOMEWHERE, I fully admit I did not invent this, but i'm pretty sure that it's never been featured on r/FanTheories so here it is in my own words.

So it gets memed to hell and I promise you Lukas didn't actually think this hard about the script, but there actually is a legitimate foundation for why "The High Ground" would be so important in that moment between those two duelists, allow me to explain.

To start off, lets cover the circumstances of the duel.

Obi-Wan is sword-fighting his once-apprentice Anakin Skywalker. Obi-Wan is one of the premier duelists of the Jedi Order, and he taught Anakin just about everything Anakin knows about the art. Interestingly, despite this they still had vastly different takes on Lightsaber Combat. Obi-Wan preferred Form 3, which emphasized deliberate and efficient action, primarily in defense, to lengthen a fight until the opponent made a mistake. Anakin however favored Form 5, which while the lore says it was an evolution of Form 3, it is actually quite more aggressive. Form 5 is characterized by powerful strikes, as well as counter-attacks immediately after successful defense, regardless if an opening is actually perceived. This can tire the user quickly, but also will tire their target faster as they contend with constant counterattacks and "haymaker" type attacks. They begin their duel in a control room on the volcanic lava planet Mustafar, and their duel damages important safety mechanisms that cause the facility they're engaged in to begin melting into the lava below. Eventually, they are dueling simply on scrap metal floating upon a lava river. We see that the river is leading to a lavafall, and so the duel must end here one way or another. Obi-Wan leaps from the raft to an embankment of volcanic gravel and turns back to Anakin, who is now stuck on the aforementioned lava river. Staying here is suicide, going over the Lavafall is death, that is no option. The way behind him is too steep to safely land on, and he's too angry to retreat from this duel in any case. Jumping onto the gravel below Obi-Wan entails high risk, as the lava river continues to rise and if the gravel gives way he will find himself ankle-deep in molten steel and rock. Even if he were to land the jump, the duel would not be over and Anakin would be at a disadvantage: now pressed for time to push Obi-Wan up the slope further so as not to burn in the rising lava. But there is a third option: to jump over Obi-Wan. A once successful tactic that Anakin has heard doubtlessly many times... but we'll talk about that in a moment. As we know, Anakin took this path despite Obi-Wan pleading with him not to and died there on Mustafar, becoming Vader.

So, why did Anakin think to jump over Obi-Wan? Well to answer that we have to look back at another duel. The first duel between Obi-Wan and the Sith Assassin: Darth Maul. At the end of this duel, Maul has killed Master Qui-Gon Jin and has effectively defeated Obi-Wan. He stands above the then Jedi Padawan, who dangles from a small strut over an endless pit that his weapon had just been discarded into. Maul is overconfident, and lets Obi-Wan marinate in seeming hopelessness but in fact Obi-wan is gathering his strength. Using the force, he leaps out of this hole with a 15 foot vertical and summons his fallen master's lightsaber. In midair, he ignites the green blade and bisects Maul as he lands, defeating the first Sith to be fought in (no exaggeration) one thousand years and casting him into The Pit. Pretty heroic, right? Sounds like the kind of story that literally every Jedi ever would be asking Obi-Wan to tell over and over again, right? Of course, Anakin would be by his side listening with rapt attention for every single retelling... but do you think that's how the story goes in Obi-Wan's head every time he retells it? No, every time Obi-Wan retells that story - with the adrenaline and dopamine having long worn off - now his mind can't help but show him... alternate circumstances. Every time Obi-Wan replays that duel in his mind, he sees a new outcome. This time, Maul doesn't turn around to face him, he simply turns his lightsaber around and impales Obi-Wan on it. The next, Obi-Wan's bisecting attack doesn't land and instead he has to continue the duel having spent all his stamina on that feat of Force conjuration. Of course, as his mastery of Form 3 would grow, his mind would conjure the perfect response to that attack to torment him. An efficient movement which would simply remove the fighting hand and legs of his opponent as they twisted in the air above. Truly this would be the most horrifying alternate outcome of that duel, as there would be no more last-ditch efforts. He would be alive, and completely at the Sith's (lack of) mercy. 

He likely never confided in Anakin his fears of that movement's failure. The most he ever said was probably that it was "brash" or "far to risky", but Anakin was all too enraptured by the triumph of Good over Evil to listen.

So Obi-Wan turned to Anakin and said "It's over, I have the High Ground" because he, just like Anakin now, had once been in a position where success requires a massive vertical leap over your opponent and he knew the risk that move entailed.

Obi-Wan begged Anakin "Don't try it.", but Anakin misinterpreted that plea. In his hatred and overconfidence, Anakin felt Obi-Wan's fear and thought he had found the situation where he could best his master. He believed he had found a strike that Obi-Wan could not repel and now, of course, his statement about the High Ground was simply a bluff! Unfortunately, Obi-Wan's true fear was that the only way to survive that slope on Mustafar, the only hope for the Republic to live, was to make one of a million past nightmares reality.Im not sure if this is something thats been discussed anywhere else but I was watching  the series and noticed how often the characters reference grief, loss and death & when watching all movies back to back the plots surround each of the stages of grief

Denial - JW
- john’s living by himself with his wife’s things left around the house and in the bathroom, untouched as if she’ll come back to use them
-trying to live normally and act like nothings wrong but we see him in anguish driving recklessly in his car

Anger - Chapter 2
- his killing spree from the first movie entices Santiago to pull him out of retirement, use and betray John
- his anger gets the better of him and he kills on Continental grounds 

Bargaining - Parabellum
-  begging his connections for help; the doctor for meds, the director for a ticket, forcing Sofia’s marker, guidance from Berrada
- walking through the desert to find the high table and ask them for another chance to live 

Depression - 
The fourth movie would probably exist around the depressive stage of grief where John is forced to stay in the life but never getting that “chance to deserve the memory of love”  he has a choice of killing Winston or getting revenge with Bowery. 
- He’d become an empty shell, slower and sloppy (as was mentioned a lot in Parabellum) 

Acceptance -
Whatever the choices may be, the final stage of grief could be John finally coming to terms with who he is/was and continuing as an assassin, dying, or taking his dog & car to go home for good

Edit: the exact moment that made me think of this was from parabellum:
“so you seek to live for the memory of love?”
“at least a chance to earn it” 
(To ‘earn’ the memory is to accept her death and accept that he was worth loving & acceptance is the final stage of grief) this was my first time watching the series and I thought it was said on purpose. Either way thanks for all the support on this!! I didn’t think id get so much positive feedback on this one😂In Season 9 of *The Office*, it's revealed that Jim and Pam have a close friendship with a boom mic operator working on the documentary. Brian steps in to comfort and help Pam during her marital problems, seemingly leading to the threat of a love triangle. Many Office fans hate Brian, but much like Karen in Season 3... Brian doesn't actually do anything wrong and never really oversteps. In fact, by almost all accounts Brian is a pretty great guy. *So why do we hate him?*

- In *Customer Loyalty*, Jim and Pam get in a very heated phone argument. After the conversation is over, Pam cries and immediately turns to Brian for comfort. *It is only here where Brian actually steps in.*

- In the cold open of the next episode, *Junior Salesman*, Brian checks in with Pam and it's revealed that Brian was given some light discipline for "talking with the subjects".

- Later in the episode, Jim tells the documentary crew that he fell in love with Pam after sitting near her for years and the scene cuts to Brian smiling at Pam as they film. Remember, that while romantic feelings from Brian are *implied* by the documentary, there is still very little evidence for it. Pam and Brian's relationship on the surface is strictly platonic.

- In *Vandalism*, Brian stops an angry warehouse worker from attacking Pam. Once again, this is a morally justified reason to step in. However, Brian is fired much to Pam (and Jim's) horror. Brian tells Pam that he's available to talk if she ever needs to. *This still isn't necessarily romantic.*

- In *Couples Discount*, Jim and Pam prepare for a date with Brian and his wife. Jim challenges the documentary crew, telling them that they "know Brian's a great guy" and implying that he did not deserve to be fired. (This also implies that there is tension between Brian and the rest of the crew).

- Brian reveals to Jim and Pam that he and his wife are separated. Jim and Pam have an argument about Pam crying to Brian earlier, as that's revealed during the date. However, this doesn't appear to be about Pam getting too close to Brian, it's more about Pam not being open about her feelings with Jim.

- Finally in *Promos*, Pam visits Brian to ask about the thoroughness of the documentary footage. This visit is totally unannounced, Brian did not invite Pam over or even speak with her.

- Pam asks Brian if she's crazy for thinking that Jim has changed. Brian is careful but tells Pam that "she's not crazy". This... is a fair assessment. Jim *has* changed, and this is a very challenging period of their marriage due to Jim's actions.

- Brian reveals to Pam that the documentary is much more thorough than she had believed. Pam storms out, and this is the last we see of Brian. (Note: Brian revealing this information to Pam would also be cause for the documentary crew to be pissed at him.)

No love confessions, no extreme acts of romance, no pleads to leave Jim. Brian arguably never does anything that a stand-up guy wouldn't do.

Jim and Pam not only make peace with each other, but we know by their feelings in the finale that they have also made peace with the content of the documentary. It doesn't make sense that they would blame their good friend, a boom mic operator who is *actively going through a difficult time*, for their lack of privacy over a decade, especially when he was the only one who was honest with them. So why didn't they make peace with him?

Well, *they probably did*. We know from the extreme and unfair way that Brian was let go that the documentary crew likely does not like him. They have some vendetta against him for showing up on camera, and they get their revenge on him by making him a villain in the final product. They carefully splice in footage to make it look like he's in love with Pam, and for all we know they omit scenes of him making peace with his friends.

For all we know, Brian's wife Alyssa could also be a crewmember of the documentary. She may even be a higher-up. Maybe she's the moderator in the talk-back portion of the finale. Brian's firing and separation come very close to one another, it's more than likely that the two are connected. This could all be Alyssa's doing as revenge for Brian "ruining" her nine year project. That, of course, is all conjecture.

TL;DR: Brian the Boom Mic guy is actually pretty cool, but it's clear that the documentary crew doesn't like him. When he starts getting too involved with the onscreen dynamics of the subjects, the documentary crew edits footage of him to make it look like he's trying to drive Jim and Pam apart in an act of character assassination.Did you ever hear the theory of Darth Plagueis "The Wise"? I thought not. It's not a theory a normie would tell.

&#x200B;

Many people have speculated who Darth Plagueis is and whether he might somehow have a presence in the last trilogy of the Skywalker saga. Well, hang onto your Corellian seats Redditors because I'm about to go full warp speed and blow your mind when I tell you that...

&#x200B;

**Kylo Ren is Darth Plagueis**.

&#x200B;

This isn't a joke post - I'm serious, and when you look at the evidence, you'll never look at the Skywalker saga the same way again.

&#x200B;

Dark Plagueis was a powerful Sith Lord who could influence the midichlorians to create life and also save others from dying. He taught everything he knew to his apprentice, Sheev Palpatine (aka Darth Sidious), but he eventually lost his power and young Palpatine killed him in his sleep. \[[1](https://www.moviefanatic.com/quotes/did-you-ever-hear-the-tragedy-of-darth-plagueis-the-wise-no-i-th/)\]

&#x200B;

There are two issues with this story.

1. How could Plagueis not foresee his own demise at the hands of his ambitious apprentice?
2. Why did Plagueis suddenly "lose his power"?

&#x200B;

The truth is, he didn't lose his power and he knew Sheev planned to kill him. It was part of the plan. By dying, I believe Darth Plagueis was able to transmit himself into Sheev and assume control of his body, almost like an infectious disease.

&#x200B;

Ever notice his name? Darth **Plague**is. [Plague](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/infectious?s=t), as in an infectious disease.

&#x200B;

Darth Plagueis unlocked the secret to immortality by moving from one body to the next, continuing his lifespan through multiple hosts over countless years.

&#x200B;

Ever wonder why Palpatine was so obsessed with training a powerful young apprentice? Surely he knew that one day the apprentice would want to overthrow him, so why train his own murderer? In Return of the Jedi, Emperor Palpatine continually provokes Luke to strike him down. Why would Palpatine want to be killed if the goal is longevity?

&#x200B;

Because Emperor Palpatine was assumed by Darth Plagueis and, through his death, he would then be able to transmit himself into a new host body. He wasn't just looking for an apprentice, he was looking for a new body since Palpatine's body was growing old. Luke Skywalker was meant to be the next host body for Darth Plagueis. But unfortunately for Plagueis, Darth Vader had a change of heart and defeated the Emperor.

&#x200B;

So how does that make Kylo Ren Darth Plagueis?

&#x200B;

[StarWars.com](https://www.starwars.com/databank/supreme-leader-snoke) describes Snoke as a seeker of arcane and ancient lore \[2\], and the [Last Jedi Visual Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/bF7NdW5.jpg) shows that he is a collector of rare memorabilia \[3\]. At some point, Snoke must have found the wreckage of the Death Star on the forest moon Endor, and was infected by Darth Plagueis when he came upon the corpse of Palpatine.

&#x200B;

Did you ever wonder why Snoke thought it was so important to complete Kylo Ren's training?

&#x200B;

It's because Snoke was Darth Plagueis and he was training his next host body. Plagueis didn't have a choice but to infect a really old political influencer like Snoke. Kylo was being groomed to become the next host body.

&#x200B;

Remember the infamous scene in The Last Jedi where Snoke is "predicting" how Kylo Ren will kill Rey? Wasn't it a little too obvious? Wouldn't Snoke have been able to foresee Kylo's treachery? See through his conflict? It's because he wasn't predicting Rey's death, he predicted his own. He knew Kylo would kill him. He deliberately bullied and provoked Kylo inorder to stir his anger into hatred to further fuel his dark side and lead him to completing his training.

&#x200B;

Then, after Kylo killed Snoke, he told Rey that they should just "leave it all behind". He told her to forget the First Order and the Resistance. But then, suddenly, when Rey turned him down, Kylo Ren became the new Supreme Leader... Why? If Kylo wanted to burn it all down, why is he suddenly taking charge and leading the First Order attacks against the Skywalkers and the Resistance?

&#x200B;

Because as soon as Kylo defeated Snoke, Darth Plagueis infected him. He is no longer Kylo Ren, he is now assumed by Darth Plagueis, and it is Darth Plague's desire to rule.

&#x200B;

In Episode IX, I believe Rey and company will discover this secret in the ruins of the second Death Star. Emperor Palpatine will not be alive. He will either be a haunting spirit or he will merely be a recording that provides insight to the secret of cheating death.

&#x200B;

With this new found information, Rey will use the knowledge of the sacred texts and call upon the help of former Jedi Masters in order to save Kylo Ren from Darth Plagueis.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

Darth Plagueis was able to cheat death by transferring his essence into other host bodies through death. He possessed his apprentice Palpatine, then possessed Snoke, and finally possessed Kylo Ren when Kylo killed Snoke. Episode IX will be about the battle to save Kylo by defeating Darth Plagueis once and for all.

\[[3](https://i.imgur.com/bF7NdW5.jpg)\] Last Jedi Visual DictionaryI know I'm putting out a fan theory on a 13 year old movie, so go ahead and reacquaint yourself with [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zJ0DLJmXl8), where Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, blackmails Lucius Fox, Batman's confidant and main man at Wayne Enterprises (I believe CEO at this point). He demands $10 million per year for life to buy his silence. The question relevant to this fan theory is, his silence on what?

Based on Lucius's response to his demands, it sounds like Reese is accusing Bruce Wayne of being Batman, but Reese never actually says that. What he *does* say is that there are discrepancies in the R&D budget, and that Wayne Enterprises designed the Batmobile. From those pieces of information, it does *not* logically follow that the owner of Wayne Enterprises (who is notoriously hands-off in his handling of the company) is Batman. If Reese does have evidence of Batman's identity, he never indicates as such. It's Lucius who first brings it up.

I believe that Reese had no idea who Batman was before walking into that meeting. He wasn't blackmailing Bruce Wayne, he was blackmailing Wayne Enterprises. He was accusing Wayne Enterprises of aiding and abetting Batman, and threatening them with a PR nightmare. 

So what happens after he lays out his evidence and demands? Lucius essentially calls the bluff but in the process tacitly admits that Bruce Wayne is Batman. What if that was a mistake? What if he played his cards too loosely and revealed information that Reese didn't already have? As Lucius talks, Reese gets visibly uncomfortable and shaken, and eventually he backs down. One explanation is that he hadn't thought his plan through, but another (and I believe more likely) is that his plan was to go up against Wayne Enterprises and threaten to expose wrongdoing, not go up against Batman himself. When he realized that's exactly what he was doing, he lost his nerve and left. It was only later, when the Joker starts killing people and demanding that Batman turn himself in, that Reese threatens to expose his identity.**TL;DR:** I’ve proven beyond a shadow of a doubt the long-running fan theory that Michael Bay’s *The Rock* is the last chapter of Sean Connery’s run as James Bond 007, and have come up with a full narrative that is completely consistent with the continuity of the six Connery Bond films, Connery’s backstory in The Rock, and actual world history. 

**If you’d rather watch a video than read a 3000 word essay on Reddit, then you can do that here:** [**https://youtu.be/9FdnevXjqdc**](https://youtu.be/9FdnevXjqdc) 

\*\*\*

*The Rock* was released on 7 June 1996 – exactly 25 years ago (greetings from New Zealand time). To mark this anniversary, I decided to go through the evidence – in WAY too much detail – that supports the fan theory that Sean Connery’s character in *The Rock* (John Mason) is James Bond. You have probably seen the odd article about it like [this one](https://screenrant.com/james-bond-sean-connery-rock-movie-007-theory/), or [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/119s6m/sean_connerys_character_in_the_rock_is_an/), or [this entry on FanTheories.com](https://fantheories.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rock), but trust me when I say that NO ONE has looked at this theory in this much detail and there is WAY more evidence than people think. 

*Plot refresher*

*The Rock* is the second feature film directed by Michael Bay. It’s about a decorated US war veteran Francis Hummel stealing a bunch of chemical weapons, taking hostages on Alcatraz, and holding the US Government to ransom until reparations are paid to the families of the soldiers who died under his command. 

FBI Director Jim Womack and the Department of Defence enlist the services of convict and former British special forces operative John Mason to help the Navy Seals break into Alcatraz, using his knowledge of the prison from when he broke out of it in 1963. Mason teams up with chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage to break into Alcatraz and disarm the missiles before Hummel’s deadline. 

*The fan theory*

Almost since this movie came out, there has been speculation that Sean Connery’s John Mason is in fact James Bond. This is usually based on some surface level lines about the fact that Mason was “trained … by British Intelligence,” that he was “a former SAS operative,” and the fact that he was captured in 1962 – the same year the first Bond movie (*Dr. No*) was released. The [fan theory usually says](https://fantheories.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rock) that Bond’s escape from Alcatraz happened before *Dr. No*, then we see him go on all his adventures in the six Bond films he was in. 

But this narrative isn’t consistent with the Connery Bond films (his Eon run ended in 1971), and this is often used as evidence that the theory is a fun idea, but not supported by the continuity of The Rock or the Bond films. 

Well I’m here to tell you that it 100% is. So let’s get stuck in.

*Why is he called John Mason, not James Bond?*

The most obvious hiccup in the fan theory is the name: Sean Connery’s character in *The Rock* is called John Mason, not James Bond. The most popular explanation is based on [another fan theory](https://fantheories.fandom.com/wiki/James_Bond) that James Bond is in fact a code name for whoever takes on the role of 007, and that John Mason is in fact the real name of Connery’s James Bond. 

Now, I strongly disagree with this argument. The Eon films have consistently established that these are different actors playing the same character, and that character’s real name is James Bond. Films in the tenures of Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all refer to the death of his wife as depicted in George Lazenby’s *OHMSS*. [Her name was Tracy Bond](https://www.007museum.com/teresa_grave.JPG) – she wouldn’t marry a codename. In the Daniel Craig films his [parents’ surname is Bond](https://i1.wp.com/whatwouldbaledo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gravestone.jpg?ssl=1), and he is called Bond before he becomes 007. 

The codename is 007. **The person’s real name is James Bond.** 

So why is Connery called John Mason in *The Rock*? Well, it’s simple. **John Mason is the code name.** James Bond frequently uses fake names, and usually has fake documents to support his cover identity. In Connery’s run alone we see this in *From Russia With Love* (where he takes the name David Somerset) and Diamonds Are Forever (where he becomes Peter Franks).

If we assume Bond was captured on a mission then it makes sense that he was processed under the name listed in his fake passport – in this case, John Mason. 

What supports this idea even more is the fact that in *The Rock*, Womack says: “This man has no identity, not in the United States or Great Britain. He does not exist.” So after capturing Bond, they clearly ran the John Mason name through the system and got nothing – because it’s not a real name. 

*Why didn’t MI6 rescue him?*

If we go with this the theory that Bond was captured by the Americans while on a mission, wouldn’t the CIA or MI6 see to it that he got released? Well, not necessarily. It’s a common trope of spy movies that if an undercover agent is captured their government will deny any involvement (we see this in the Mission Impossible movies, for example). 

In the Bond films we consistently see how M puts Queen and country above the life of its agents – including Bond (remember the [opening of *Skyfall*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etnCBggA4Os)?). If M thought that it was in MI6’s best interests for Bond to stay captured, then I have no doubt that M would leave him to rot. 

So to me, it’s entirely plausible that Bond was captured by the US while using the fake name of John Mason, put in Alcatraz, and MI6 decided to leave him there. 

*Do the timelines match up?*

In *The Rock*, we learn that Mason was **“incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962… escaped in ’63.”** So 1962 is where we start – the same year *Dr. No* came out. Now, as I said earlier, the fan theory [usually goes](https://screenrant.com/james-bond-sean-connery-rock-movie-007-theory/) that Bond was first captured *before* the events of *Dr. No*, which assumes that *Dr. No* is set in 1963 after he escaped. But that doesn’t work. 

*Dr. No* is definitely set in 1962 or earlier, because in Jamaica he visits Government House – the seat of the British governor – which is flying the British flag (3.17 in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OjeDtZi7Ig) if you want to fact check me). [Jamaica became independent](https://jis.gov.jm/information/independence/#:~:text=Alexander%20Bustamante%20was%20elected%20in,member%20of%20the%20British%20Commonwealth.) on 6 August 1962. So there is no way *Dr. No* can take place in 1963, because at that point in time the British no longer had control of the country. 

**So, in my narrative, Bond is captured** ***after*** **the events of** ***Dr. No*****, and escapes Alcatraz** ***before*** **the events of the next film,** ***From Russia With Love*****.** 

If you haven’t seen it, *Dr. No* ends with Bond destroying Dr. No’s evil lair, after the villain tried to disrupt a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. He is rescued by CIA agent Felix Leiter, but, because Bond is Bond, he would rather get it on with Honey Rider than be rescued, so he disconnects the tow rope. It’s a typical Bond ending, but let’s be realistic. Leiter rocks up [with a boat full of heavily armed Marines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5jj3vqPau8) (01:18). They’re not all there to rescue Bond – they’re rounding up the henchmen who escaped from Dr. No’s evil lair and are throwing them in the 1960s equivalent of Guantanamo Bay. 

Because Leiter knows Bond is a spy, he made sure to rescue him. But after Bond gives him the slip, he must have been picked up by some random Navy patrol and got lumped in with all the other prisoners. Without the CIA to vouch for him, Bond got locked up with the rest of the henchmen in Alcatraz under the fake name of John Mason. 

But, Bond being Bond, he escaped. In *Dr. No* itself we see Bond escaping from a prison in Dr. No’s base – proving he was more than capable of busting out of Alcatraz. 

This theory is supported by the fact that, in the next Bond movie, Silvia Trench complains that Bond disappeared for “six months” after going to Jamaica. So he must have escaped in January 1963 – meaning his imprisonment in Alcatraz happened around July 1962 – **consistent with the timeline in The Rock.** 

Oh, not that you care, but I checked and there was a [rocket launch from Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_in_spaceflight_(July%E2%80%93September)) on 25 July 1962, and it was even a Titan rocket like [the kind shown in *Dr. No*](https://perihele.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/drno-46.jpg). 

**I warned you I had looked at this in WAY too much detail.** 

So this timeline perfectly matches – to the exact day – the first two Bond films, *The Rock*, and actual world history. 

*Why was Bond/Mason captured in the first place?*

In *The Rock*, Womack says: 

“1962, J. Edgar Hoover is head of the FBl, some say the country. It's no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans: de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the prime minister. \[…\] Mason was the British operative who stole the files. But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.”

Now, this is where *The Rock*’s own continuity gets a bit confused. Womack’s comment implies Mason stole the microfilm in 1962. But the movie [mentions twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nzB0PqYw1s) that it contains “the truth about the JFK assassination.”

So this microfilm can’t possibly have existed before November 1963, so this just further supports the fact that Mason/Bond’s first imprisonment in Alcatraz in 1962 was unrelated to the microfilm, and that he stole this sometime after his escape in 1963.

*When was Bond/Mason recaptured?* 

*The Rock* establishes that Mason was recaptured sometime after he escaped in 1963, but it never makes it clear when this happened. The closest thing we have to a date on that, is Mason’s daughter Jade. When Womack is asked why the Hoover didn’t use Jade as leverage over Mason to reveal the location of the stolen microfilm, he says: “Hoover was dead in ‘72, she wasn’t been born yet.” 

So this tells us that the daughter was born sometime after Hoover died in May 1972, and also strongly implies that Mason stole the microfilm after Hoover’s death.

Think about it – we are meant to believe that Mason stole a top secret government microfilm, escaped Alcatraz and, instead of returning to the safety of Britain, just lived undercover in the US for ten years or so, fathering illegitimate children, until he was recaptured again? 

**No, we’re not expected to believe that, because we know what John Mason was doing between 1963 and 1972. He was being James Bond.** 

If we return to the earlier narrative that Bond was first captured in 1962 by mistake after *Dr. No*, let’s assume that after he escaped, he returned to MI6 and carried on being Bond until his last on-screen adventure: *Diamond Are Forever*, which was released in 1971. Quick note here for fellow super-Bond geeks: I’m **not** including *Never Say Never Again* because it’s not an official Eon film and takes place in a different continuity. 

*Diamonds Are Forever* [ends with Bond in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhTPEz9UHlk). Not just anywhere in America – he’s on a cruise ship leaving a city on the west coast. Now, the ship he is on is the [SS. Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Canberra), which docked in San Francisco in 1971.  

**So we can place Bond in San Francisco in 1971 – not long before John Mason was recaptured in 1972.**

*Why did Bond/Mason get sent to steal the microfilm?*

I’m not going to get too deep into the history here – sources [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mvm15.5?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) and [here](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.489687) – but in the early 1970s, there were some several fairly big foreign policy disagreements between the British government and the Nixon Administration.

So, with relations frosty and their best field agent already on American soil, its not totally unrealistic for MI6 to send him in undercover to try and find the secret microfilm that has all of the dirt on the British government.

So after his cruise, Bond goes undercover in the FBI. In this time, he befriends Womack. The Rock makes it abundantly clear these two men have a personal animosity, but never makes it clear why. Well, this is why – **Womack was the person Bond used to get access to the FBI in the first place, only to betray him by stealing the microfilm.** This is why Womack doesn’t trust Mason in *The Rock* – he’s already been betrayed by him.

While undercover in the FBI, Bond knocks up Jade’s mother after a one-night stand – which is a very James Bond thing to do. In *The Rock,* his daughter says that Mason met her mother “in a bar after a Led Zepplin concert.” [Led Zepplin toured North America in June 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin_North_American_Tour_1972) – so once again the real world history supports this narrative. 

After learning that Jade’s mother is pregnant, Connery’s Bond began to reflect on his life and career – like we have seen subsequent Bonds do (in *OHMSS*, *Goldeneye*, *Casino Royale*, and *Spectre*). He decides to hang up the pistol and retire once and for all. But a few weeks earlier, J Edgar Hoover [died on 2 May 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover), leaving a leadership vacuum in the FBI. **MI6 saw the opportunity for Bond to exploit the vacuum and steal the microfilm.** 

M agrees to Bond retiring if he can pull of this one, final mission. Bond steals the microfilm file, stashes it in Kansas and flees to the border, only to be captured and locked up – this time, for good. 

*What happened after Bond/Mason was re-captured?*

When he is captured and the FBI realise he was an undercover agent, **Bond tells them his real name is John Mason to protect MI6.** The FBI realise he is the same person who escaped Alcatraz in 1963. They lock him up, MI6 deny all knowledge of him, and Bond stays in prison until 1995: the year *The Rock* takes place. 

**The timelines of the Sean Connery Bond films and The Rock match perfectly with both each other and real world history.** 

*But there’s ONE PROBLEM*

The *only* evidence that Bond and Mason might be different people is when Mason talks to Hummel, and says he was an Army Captain, when we all know that James Bond is a Commander in the British Navy. Well, you could just say its Bond staying in character and leave it at that. 

**But that wasn’t good enough for me, and you’ve come this far, so get ready for the final part of the theory because this one will blow your socks off.**

Francis Hummel, the villain in *The Rock*, is well-established as a decorated war veteran, with “three tours in Vietnam,” where he was a Major. 

To be a major in the US Army, [you need to have ten years of service](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/army-commissioned-officer-career-information-3345007). As Hummel did three tours in Vietnam, we can assume he was fighting there from fairly early on in the US deployment, which began around 1964. Furthermore, Hummel says that his career “dates back to the Tet ’68.” 

During the Vietnam war, US soldiers had [respite leave in Hong Kong](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07075332.2014.946948), which was a British territory at the time. So let’s say Hummel was there in 1967, shortly before returning to the war in time to be there for the [Tet Offensive in 1968](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/tet-offensive#:~:text=The%20Tet%20Offensive%20was%20a,involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War.).

**As we saw in** ***You Only Live Twice*** **(1967), James Bond was in Hong Kong at the same time.** 

Now, its not plausible that Hummel and Bond encountered each other in Hong Kong, even if they were in the same city at the same time in 1967. But what is plausible is that Hummel picked up the newspaper one day and saw a [front page story about British Naval Commander James Bond being murdered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlIIflu2cik) – complete with photograph – as shown in *You Only Live Twice*.

It’s a sad story for any soldier to read, particularly one who was shown to have a huge amount of respect for the fallen (it’s what motivates Hummel’s entire operation in *The Rock*). Maybe this story struck a chord with him, especially while he was experiencing his men dying during some of the fiercest fighting in the Vietnam War – a war he felt was unjustified. Maybe he saw the full honours bestowed to Bond by the Navy and wondered why it wasn’t given to all fallen soldiers? Perhaps he kept the newspaper clipping, and went to pay respects to Bond’s next-of-kin, only to find out that Bond’s death was faked – the first time he learns that perhaps governments can’t always be trusted. 

Maybe Hummel reading about Bond’s death planted the seed in Hummel’s mind that his government couldn’t be trusted, and that the US didn’t care for the lives of its soldiers – a seed that would go on to grow over the next three decades.

**Maybe this explains why Hummel greets Bond by asking: “Name and rank, sailor.”** 

Hummel is testing Bond, to see if this is the same naval officer he read about all those years ago. [Look how Mason reacts to the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiSTYTRZFNc) (0:11 in this clip). Bond knows that somehow Hummel suspects his true identity, but he doesn’t buy it. He sticks to his cover story, and the film continues. 

**Now, I admit this last bit is a bit unbelievable.** But it’s not unbelievable  by the standards of James Bond movies – or for that matter Michael Bay movies.  In fact, by those standards I actually think the Hummel story is pretty tame. 

*CONCLUSION*

So after 25 years, the case has been made and it’s finally settled. John Mason in *The Rock* is the same character as Sean Connery’s James Bond 007. Every detail covered – some way too thoroughly – and another leaf added to the tree of film knowledge. There are a [few more details I covered in the video](https://youtu.be/9FdnevXjqdc) because they’re more visual and don’t work as well in a text post (like Bond’s capture in *Die Another Day* and some characterisation similarities between Mason and Bond). But rest assured that the theory is proven once and for all, and a solid narrative has been written that matches **perfectly** with the continuity of the Connery James Bond films, *The Rock*, and actual world history.

Celebrate the 25th anniversary of this great action classic by re-watching it with this theory in mind, and enjoy the true final Bond film by Sean Connery.Hit upon a theory when watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off and I was shocked I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet. The reason things constantly seem to go right for Ferris Bueller is that he has lived this exact day countless times before a la Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow.
 
The biggest piece of evidence is how he is able to plan for almost all possible contingencies to make sure his plan works - the Rube Goldberg-like mechanisms that are *just* good enough to work on his parents, outsmarting the snooty waiter, constantly outsmarting Rooney, covering every single possible flaw in the plan (the answering machine messages, calling Rooney while he's on the phone to 'Mr. Peterson'). The reason every gambit he makes works is that he has had the trial-and-error opportunity to perfect his day. He's incredibly lucky with every situation - able to catch the baseball at the game, able to sneak onto the float, able to hit the baseball perfectly onto his tape recorder at the end - and has mastered complex skills at a young age including being able to hack into his school's computer network.

This theory also justifies his mostly live-in-the-moment, no care for consequences attitude. His fixation on getting married to Sloan is another sign of this - he's desperate for this romance (by all accounts in its early days since the administrator isn't sure who Sloan is dating) to have some kind of meaning because in his head, he's been in a relationship with Sloan  for years.
 
Thirdly, the constant fourth-wall breaking. This is a sign of the strain this time-loop has left on his brain - it has deluded him into thinking he has a constant audience that he can explain all his thoughts to. The camera is essentially his imaginary friend, a result of the trauma of reliving the same day constantly. 
 
The theory is even supported by some of the dialogue - the moment where he looks into the camera and says 'this is the bit where Cameron goes berserk' suggests that he is recalling current events as a memory. Best of all, at the end of the movie when his parents come home and he's in bed, they ask him how he ended up so perfect. His response?
 
"Years of practice."According to his Facebook: 

I’ve always liked the theory that Heath Ledger’s Joker in Christopher Nolan’s DARK KNIGHT is a war veteran suffering PTSD. His referencing a “truckload of soldiers” getting blown up, his ease with military hardware, and his tactical ingenuity and precision planning all feel like an ex-Special Forces soldier returned stateside and dishing out payback. I love films that contain enough thought and shading to sustain post-screening theorizing like this.

But I just re-watched THE DARK KNIGHT, and another wrinkle came to mind about The Joker.

What if he’s not only ex-military, but ex-military intelligence? 

Specifically — interrogation? 

He seems to be very good at the kind of mind-fuckery that sustained, professional interrogation requires. His boast about how “I know the squealers” when he sees one. The way he adjusts his personality and methods depending on who he’s talking to, and knowing EXACTLY the reaction he’ll get: mocking Gamble’s manhood; invoking terror to Brian, the “false” Batman; teasing the policeman’s sense of loyalty to his fallen, fellow cops; digging into Gordon’s isolation; appealing to Harvey Dent’s hunger for “fairness.” He even conducts a “reverse interrogation” with Batman when he’s in the box at the police station — wanting to see how “far” Batman will go, trying to make him break his “one rule.” He constantly changes his backstory (and thus who he is). To Gamble and his henchmen, he’s an abused child (figuring that they were also the products of abuse and neglect). To Rachel, he’s a man mourning a tragic love — something she’s also wrestling with. 

In the end, he ends up trying to mind-fuck an entire city — and the city calls his bluff. Or is that what he wanted all along? He plummets to his seeming death, laughing like a child. And when he’s rescued by Batman, the one individual he couldn’t manipulate or break, he’s blissful and relieved (and, visually, turned on his head). Even the language he uses when saying goodbye to Batman — describing their relationship as an “irresistible force meeting an immovable object” — is the kind of thing an interrogator would say, ruefully, about a fruitless session. 

It didn’t matter how he got those scars, turns out.

(*As Cody Glive points out, in a comment below, The Joker also “directs” Batman’s interrogation of him, like an instructor with a newbie. “Never start with the head, the victim gets all fuzzy.” Can’t believe I missed that. Thanks!)

(And I ALSO just realized — The Joker uses The Russian’s dogs against him, and later sics them on Batman. Just like the pictures from Abu Ghraib of the  prisoners being terrified by dogs)In Episode IV of Star Wars, Vader listened to Moff Tarkin, who later referred to him as "my friend." When that one commander mouth off to him saying "She'll die before she tells you anything," Vader just shrugs it off. Later in the movie, he has two crack pilots who he trusts with his life when he gets into his TIE, and he says "**we'll** have to destroy them ship to ship." 

This all points to a collegial atmosphere of mutual respect. 

The next time we see Vader, he's a terrifying monster who's killing subordinates. 

I think Vader was having fun in IV. He'd done terrible things. He'd lost his love and his family. He was alone and lost, Anakin Skywalker, traitor and murderer. But then, Darth Sidious rescued him. He was reborn as Darth Vader. He had respect. He had power. And no one knew who he was (well, maybe Tarkin) or what he'd done. He could rebuild a life. 

Part of him was *happy,* in this period. He finally had what he thought he wanted. He was doing something truly important. He was finally getting the respect he deserved. He could be collegial, even magnanimous. He'd rebuilt a life, one filled with purpose. 

(The one time he uses the Force choke in Episode IV, he's obviously toying with his victim, who's able to breathe, barely, through the whole thing. Ozzel goes down the second Vader's done talking.) 
 
And then the Rebels took all that away. They insulted his twisted sense of justice, making all the sacrifices he'd made to create a galaxy of order worthless. They killed the colleagues he'd worked with, destroying the facade of normalcy he'd tried so hard to rebuild. Vader let himself care about people - and it was taken away. 

The shock made him withdraw. Palpatine, still nurturing the wounded child within Vader, gave him a giant ship and a purpose, but it wasn't enough. Vader was never the same. 

It was in this time of hurt and turmoil that he learned the name of the pilot that blew up the Death Star. Vader realized Palpatine had lied to him. For the first time, he truly understood how he'd been used. 

As angry and hurt as Vader was in Episode IV, he was even more so in Episode V. And he was no longer following some twisted version of loyalty, some hope of doing good for all those who'd suffered through the Republic's ineptitude. Now he was finally acting out of evil, with contempt for the Imperial officers around them, who did not understand the true nature of their master as he finally did. He was gunning for revenge.

**EDIT: The icing on the cake:** A reader on Twitter (hi /u/hueypriest) suggested that A New Hope refers to Vader's attempt to rebuild his life.   People on r/movies were talking about Inside Out (2015) and this aspect, but there were so many comments that instead of letting mine get buried, I thought I’d post here.

Okay, so, Riley’s parents don’t have Joy piloting their emotions the way Riley does. The mom has Sadness and the dad has Anger.

Now this isn’t some edgy “the mom is depressed and the dad has a temper” theory. 

It’s the fact that the movie shows, as you age your emotions become more complex (shown by Riley’s emotions being able to created fused memories at the end)

These deeper and more mature emotions pilot the parents!

The Dad’s anger is actually protectiveness, an expected fatherly trait.

The Mom’s sadness is empathy, an expected motherly trait, and the message of the movie (that sadness is the key to empathy)

Sadness made Bing Bong feel better through empathy, and the mother has empathy as her main emotion to better connect with her child.

Riley had Anger piloting during the hockey game at the end because it’s protectiveness / competitiveness, and fathers have to protect their family. 

This isn’t really a theory, more an observation, but I’ve had to point this out a lot since people I know would always be like “lol the mom is depressed”This is probably something that is super obvious to everyone, but it was a revelation to me today when I watched Lion King with my son, so....

Simba caused the drought in Pride Rock. The past kings, like Mufasa, are in the sky. Specifically the clouds as shown by Mufasa talking to Simba when he is with Timon and Pumba. The clouds, which carry the rain, left to follow the rightful king when he left Pride Rock.

Simba spends years with Timon and Pumba in an apparent tropical jungle that obviously gets plenty of rainfall. When he is shown going back towards Pride Rock, the clouds roll in behind him. They seemingly follow the rightful king back to the pridelands and it begins raining shortly after.

For years, it bugged me how Scar taking power somehow caused a drought. It really wasn't Scar seizing control or the hyena population explosion that caused a weather issue, but the rightful leader abandoning his people and taking the wisdom of the elders with him.Thanks to The Mandalorian, it’s canon that storm troopers suck. There’s the scene where two repeatedly fail to shoot something only a few feet away. Also, the ex sniper defends his credentials by emphasizing that he wasn’t a storm trooper, implying they’re known to have bad aim. 

So in the OT, why does Obiwan think they’re great? He emphasizes that the shots on the transport were too precise and thus must have been a storm trooper. 

The simple answer: they literally don’t make them like they used to. When Obiwan thinks of storm troopers, he thinks of the clones he used to fight with. They were extremely talented. 

But thanks to the sequels, we know that storm troopers are made up largely of new recruits of average people like Finn. It makes sense. Clones were engineered to not have full life spans if I remember correctly. So there’s no more clones but the empire needs an army, so they recruit. That’s why storm troopers suck but Obiwan assumed they didn’t.Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the James Bond franchise knows he drinks his Martinis "shaken, not stirred". However, Martinis are typically made stirred, as shaking the drink causes the ice to break up, melt quicker and water down the Martini. As a result many Martini drinkers scoff at Bond's order as he is ordering a weaker drink and being pretentious about it.

However, I theorise that Bond is ordering a weak drink deliberately so as to make it seem like he is drinking more than he actually is. This is because Bond is almost always on duty in both the books and films and needs to keep his wits about him, either to defend himself or not blab all his secrets to the bartender, but sometimes he will need to drink to maintain his cover. As a compromise he orders a weaker drink to give the appearance that he is more inebriated than he actually is, thus maintaining his cover and gaining an element of surprise over his targets.

As for why he still orders them when he seemingly isn't working there are 2 possible answers for this. 1. Bond views himself as always on duty and so always orders the weaker drink, or 2. He just orders it out of habit, or genuinely enjoys the weaker drink.

Apologies if this theory has been posted before.Jim doesn’t really seem to have a social life outside of The Office. His primary hobby is cycling, usually done solo...his main interest is sports and he was an athlete so he probably never needed to learn how to make friends, he had teammates and that led to some surface level “buddies”. The kind of guys you invite to a Valentine’s Day poker game (a very Michael move) and the only people at his BBQ were his roomate and people from this office.  Beside all this, his determination to be with Pam indicates a lack of connections outside of work. Once he feels there’s no hope with her he uproots his whole life and moves. 

He meets Katie (the purse girl)  at the office, he meets Karen at the office in Stamford. All of his major connections happen at work. His main priority at work is having fun and killing time and being well liked, he only works hard when he has to, traits he shares with the one and only Michael Scott. When he’s put in charge at first he tries to do what he wants by putting all the birthdays together then he panics and tries to make everyone happy, which leads to a moment of connection with Michael. 

P.s. Dwight’s the hero and he should have ended up with Isabel.People wonder how cap got around to return the stones in the past(s), what with them being all over space. 

I know he may have used quantum teleportation but we don’t know it’s distance limits/knowledge of where you’re going limits. We do know that he was **weilding Mjolnir** and that (generally) means he has access to the Bifrost as Heimdall would see him with Mjolnir and the stones. That’s something Heimdall would notice. I think Heimdall would be willing to quietly help someone he knows is worthy to fix the timeline(s) by rainbow zapping him about the 9 realms. Maybe even giving him a ship or whatever to get to Vormir. 

I know, in the 70s Mjolnir was without the worthiness enchantment, BUT he has a duplicate Mjolnir and information about Asgard etc. oh and a suitcase containing the entire set of Infinity Stones. 

Even Odin would be likely to quietly help. Not to mention The Ancient one might sling America’s ass straight to wherever as it’s now established the portals have crazy range. 

Anyway, that's my theory of the Pym-free ways Cap could’ve returned the stones. 

Live. Laugh. Love.&#x200B;

(Spoiler alert for a book old enough to have a driving permit)

The most common complaint about the Harry Potter series is that time travel is introduced in the third book and never used again. Specifically, Hermione Granger is given a Time Turner necklace because it’s important for her to attend additional classes in school, but when wizard Hitler returns from the dead, no one even considers it might be important enough to resort to changing the past. This seemingly painfully obvious solution has inspired both [satirical videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w) and even a piece of fan fiction that became a [successful long running](https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/uk/) show in London’s West End and Broadway.

The reason time travel didn’t change the past is this: it couldn’t. **Time travel in Harry Potter works on Terminator rules, not Terminator Sequel rules.** If you understood that reference immediately, congratulations genius, the rest of this article is just filler for you. Everyone else, please keep reading.

Yes Harry Potter fans, a cabinet of the mysterious magical hourglasses are destroyed two years after Hermione hands hers back. It is referred to multiple times in the text of later books. That isn’t a satisfactory explanation as there could easily be more turners out in the world. The Ministry of Magic lent Hogwarts a Time Turner for the astoundingly trivial purpose of allowing a 13 year old who grew up as a non wizard, to learn about non wizards in school. This is roughly the equivalent of a Chinese student emigrating to Canada and enrolling in a class about Chinese culture. If the bar for being granted a Time Turner is that low, it’s incredibly unlikely there wasn’t at least one other turner distributed to someone else. Furthermore, the Ministry of Magic is just the government of one country. Voldemort travelled across Eastern Europe looking for a wand from a children’s story, why wouldn’t he steal a Time Turner from Romania or Bulgaria?

Most people who claim the time turners are a missed opportunity assume that time travel in Harry Potter works exactly like in Back to the Future; if you travel back to the past and change something, it diverts the course of the timeline and changes history. If you accidentally prevent your mother and father meeting and falling for each other, then they won’t get married and have babies, therefore your birth will never happen.

Harry Potter, on the other hand, follows an [unmutable timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle), as decribed in Novikov’s self consistency principal, any actions taken by a time traveller in the past were part of history all along, and therefore it is impossible for them to alter the past. In the original Terminator film, the titular killer android travels back in time to kill John Connor’s mother, Sarah, only for his actions to send her into the arms of her time travelling protector, Kyle Reese and ultimately conceive John Connors. This is usually the part of a theory article where you would expect to see the writer gather obscure and contradictory quotes with scant regard for the actual context of those words. I am by no means above such shenanigans however, in this case, there is no need. This realisation is the climactic moment in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Harry and company are attacked by Dementors only to be saved by a mysterious wizard who casts a Patronus, a highly advanced spell that Harry struggles with. Just as he slips out of consciousness, Harry sees that the caster looks eerily similar to his late father.

Harry awakes in the hospital wing (this school has a lot of incidents) to discover that his innocent Godfather was captured and is awaiting the [Dementor’s kiss](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath), a fate worse than death. He and Hermione travel three hours back in time to save Sirius.

When they come across the scene of the Demetors’ attack, Harry awaits the arrival of his father, only to realise that he hadn’t seen his dad, he had seen his future self. In the emotional highpoint of the story, the hero solves mystery, emerges from hiding and raises his wand to save everyone, fully confident that this time he would [cast a perfect Patronus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXslqUnzdmE).

He later explains his reasoning **“I knew I could do it all this time … Because I'd already done it... does that make sense?”**

So there you have it, in Prisoner of Azkaban there was only one sequence of events that never changed, even with the effects of time travel. Could JK Rowling have made it any more obvious?

Well screenwriter Steve Kloves seemed to think so. In the Prisoner of Azkaban film adaptation Harry, Ron and Hermione are alerted to the arrival of Ministry officials when Harry is hit by a snail shell. When Hermione brings Harry back in time, she sees the officials approaching and remembers the shell, she picks [one up and flings it at Past-Harry’s head](https://youtu.be/Mg1A7fB9nrk?t=210). Past Harry had been pursued by a werewolf, only for it to be distracted by a howling noise. We later see that the noise was made by a time travelling Hermione.

So that’s three instances of characters realising themselves that the events of the past had already happened, including the effects of their time travel. It’s a little disappointing that Harry’s moment of clarity is taken from him by Hermione solving the conundrum twice before he did (in fact this is far from the only time she steals the [two boys’ thunder](http://www.mugglenet.com/2015/09/7-times-hermione-granger-took-ron-weasleys-lines-in-the-movies/)), but the repetition brings clarity.

Hang on, didn’t they use time travel to undo the beheading of the Buckbeak the Hippogriff? Harry, Ron and Hermione hear “a sickening thud” as they walk away from Hagrid’s hut and are very upset. The second time around, the time travelling heroes rescue Buckbeack before the executioner is ready. Does this mean they possibly did change the past? No, actually, in another a rare example of an aspect of a book being explained better in the movie adaptation, the movie shows that the executioner became angry and destroyed a nearby pumpkin with his axe, hence the sickening thud. The immutable timeline is demonstrated clearly, consistently and logically (other than the fact that Hagrid apparently has fully ripe pumpkins in May.)

\[EDIT tomothy94 points out that the books actually do have this line:  "**There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger.** \]

There you have it. The rescue of Sirius and Buckbeak and the casting of the Patronus charm by time travellers was actually part of the events of history all along. The nature of time travel is initially hidden from the reader through misleading dialogue and the limited perspective of Harry. But the twist ending makes it abundantly clear that wizarding time travel wasn’t able to change the past at any point in the story.

Anyone who wonders “But why don’t they use the time turners to stop Voldemort?” should really reread or rewatch Prisoner of Azkaban. Well, that or pen a highly successful [West End and Broadway show](https://www.ticketnews.com/2018/04/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-breaks-box-office-records/) built on that premise.Quill says to Rocket that he's going with Thor to Nidavellir because he's afraid of facing Thanos, I think it's because he wants to protect Groot.

Gunn said that the theme of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was "Fatherhood". The opening act of GOTG2 showed everyone in the Guardians doing some parenting towards Groot.

Now, 4 years later (I think it was 4 years between GOTG2 and Infinity War), the bond between parent and child is stronger than ever.

So, Thor shows up, tell them about Thanos, Rocket realizes this is a bad situation, then Thor wants to go somewhere Thanos isn't.

What does Rocket do? He makes up a BS reason to go, and says Groot is going to go with him.

He's taking Groot out of harms way. He's protecting his son. He wasn't afraid of Thanos in a self-protective way, he was afraid of Thanos because Thanos might hurt/kill Groot.

TLDR: Rocket isnt afraid of Thanos, he went to Nidavellir (away from Thanos) to protect Groot.Duloc was the capital city of Lord Farquaad, the main antagonist in *Shrek*. [Here are some pictures](https://i.imgur.com/jtW52AQ.png) of it in [the first movie](https://i.imgur.com/Q0PuPNy.jpg). It's prosperous, clean, has a large population and apparently a thriving economy as any big city must in order to stay afloat.

A few years later, during the *Scared Shrekless* miniseries... [here is](https://i.imgur.com/3SdwjBD.gif) how Duloc [looks now](https://i.imgur.com/NTV38UF.png).

It has clearly been destroyed and depopulated. But nobody ever has addressed *how* this happened. A kid watching probably wouldn't think too much of it, would just assume it got abandoned after Farquaad died. But I believe that in fact, immediately after the events of the *Shrek* movie, the fairytale creatures took their bloody revenge against the entire city, pillaging and burning it to the ground and likely murdering most of its citizens. Here is the supporting evidence:

1) **Cities don't get abandoned that quickly.** First of all, Farquaad dying wouldn't cause the whole city to instantly fail, someone else would just take his place and business would continue. Now perhaps Duloc's economy was wrecked as a result of the political changes... but even if we run with that and assume that people left because of economic hard times, it takes more than a few years for a large capital city to be entirely empty. There would still be some form of inhabitation for a while. Historically the only times a city has been suddenly depopulated is due to either natural disaster or... razing by an invading army. Such as a large uprising of fairies who are out for blood and starving for revenge.

2) **There is evidence of violence.** *Scared Shrekless* only takes place a few years after the first movie. That picture above is of a city that has suffered a severe trauma, not just one that people just decided to leave gradually. Glass is broken. Furniture is broken. Trees and houses show obvious burn marks (could be from Donkey's dragon or fairytale creatures going house to house and lighting them on fire). Carriages were hastily abandoned in the streets. There was a great battle fought here.

3) **And finally most importantly, there is motive.** The first film begins with Farquaad exacting all manners of tortures and atrocities on magical creatures in heartbreaking scenes reminiscent of the Holocaust. Put yourself in the shoes of a magical creature during the movie.  *Your own friends and neighbors* turned you in to the secret police for a reward.Your assets, businesses and life savings were seized by the state. You were forcibly relocated into the wilderness to die of the elements. You may have been physically tortured (ie gingerbread man). Entire families were cruelly separated and murdered (ie. Mama Bear flayed to use as a rug). Now at the end of the movie, Farquaad has been assassinated and the military leadership is in disarray. Duloc, once your racist oppressor, is now helpless. Your allies are inside the palace and ready to open the gates. You are traumatized and full of rage. What are you going to do next?

How did Duloc's mighty walls get overtaken, you may ask? As noted above, Shrek and his buddies including the dragon were already inside, and in a position to undermine the city defenses immediately. Furthermore we see the only "bad guy" who is reformed is the executioner; he's dancing around with our heroes at the end. It could be that he had the foresight to see which way the winds were blowing, and made a deal to open the main gates after Farquaad was taken out. For this he was spared.

Anyway. There is a lot of evidence to believe that after the movie credits rolled, Duloc was immediately overtaken by an orgy of rioting and slaughter by the fairytale creatures. Entire city blocks were burned. Babies torn from their mother's arms. Civilians ripped apart by magical spells, teeth and claws. Gingerbread may have gone around severing legs of his victims in a perverse sort of catharsis. The three little pigs huffed and puffed and blew down houses with the inhabitants still inside. I shudder to think how Pinocchio used his nose against maidens that he cornered during the pillage. All that remains is a smoking shell of a town.There are like 15 characters and as a new viewer I was bad at remembering their names.  Then Chris Traeger comes in and says everyone's first and last names and I then knew everyone's first and last names.  I  think they did this on purpose because they realized they had a ton of characters and viewers might have trouble remembering everyone's names.  Enter Chris.The jump in musical instrument quality from low range to mid range is far more noticeable than from mid to high for most instruments, but there is often a dirt cheap end. These might even be made of plastic, either intended as a toy or an actual instrument. At this very low level, you'd be lucky if it even played half in tune and wasn't airy. Plastic recorders on the low end are decent because they're in such high supply, but most instruments aren't in demand enough to be made well in plastic to a good quality. 

&#x200B;

I believe that Squidward, as poor as he is working at a dead-end Cashier job, cannot afford to save up for even a low-mid range instrument. His dead-end job and its terrible pay with the greedy Mr Krabs isn't enough for better. His plastic, cheap, airy, or even second hand (is it damaged?) clarinet is to blame, not his skill. 

&#x200B;

Supporting evidence is everywhere but the most recent and obvious one is episode Krusty Koncessionaires when he once played a high-end clarinet intended for use in a concert and it was beautiful. "I can't believe it. This really is the best clarinet ever made!" he says after playing.

&#x200B;

So my theory is, if he could afford an upgrade, his music wouldn't be at all so raspy.From what we see in the Spongebob SquarePants movie, the main characters can fit in David Hasselhoff's [hands](http://davidhasselhoffonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpongeBobSquarePantsPhoto40.jpg). We also know that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are similarly sized to the characters in the show.

The Bikini Atoll tests carried on in a 12 year span from 1946 to 1958 where  nuclear weapons were tested. My theory is that Mermaid Man was a Navy diver caught in the first tests in 1946 during a training mission gone wrong. Meanwhile Barnacle Boy; Mermaid Man's "young ward" must have been in a similar situation during the final tests in the late 50s.

They may have been responsible for testing top secret Navy equipment which explains Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's vast array of weapons and supplies. Being caught in the irradiated waters may have caused the two Navy Divers to mutate and gain the ability to breathe in water. 

The dates of the Bikini Atoll tests can also explain Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's age in the present day.

EDIT: forgot to say that Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy were mutated and shrunk by the radiation.It's mentioned that when Harry was younger, before he found out he was a wizard (a what?), he accidentally did magic several times. Some of these were relatively minor, and seemed to be the usual underage magic: Turning his teacher's wig blue, making his hair grow back, etc. However, there are a few that are... different.

At one point, Harry was being chased by Dudley's gang, he then suddenly found himself on top of a roof. This was explained away by the Dursleys as him jumping and being caught by the wind... but as we know, it was magic. What's the odd part? *Only highly advanced dark wizards can fly unaided.* It couldn't have been apparition, as there was no mention of a 'crack' sound, and without any training, he most likely would have splinched himself trying to do a magic spell that many adult wizards considered too dangerous.

So, how could he have done a spell linked to dark magic? *Because of Voldemort's soul inside of him.* We know from the locket that horcruxes can defend themselves if they are somehow put in danger: the locket first tried to choke Harry, then created an illusion to try and turn Ron against Harry.

The horcrux part of him likely was also responsible for making the pane of glass disappear on Dudley. The horcrux recognized the tormentor that had attempted to harm its host, and decided to try and remove it, by dropping Dudley into the enclosure of a deadly snake. Even if it failed (as it did), it meant that Dudley would likely be terrified of Harry's power (which he later was, until he found out Harry couldn't do magic outside of school).

**TL;DR: The piece of Voldemort's soul inside of Harry used its magic to protect him from harm. Not enough to make him invulnerable, but to avoid dangerous threats**I believe that originally, Harley was going to fulfill the role that Peter Parker eventually took. Namely, a "sidekick" and surrogate son for Tony to mentor. There are several reasons I believe this.

Ty Simpkins (Harley's actor) is signed for a three-film deal in the MCU. Seems a bit much for a character that would otherwise be a one-off. There was a good deal of buildup regarding Harley being a tinkerer like Tony, and there is a lot of development given to there being a father/son relationship between them. I remember that for a while after Iron Man 3 there was a lot of speculation as to *when* he would return, not if, because it seemed like a given that he would.

Iron Man 3 was released in 2013. A year and a half later, the Sony deal went through, allowing Spider-Man to appear in the MCU. This drastically altered the plans for the MCU, changing Civil War and adding a whole new movie to the lineup (2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming). Spider-Man would become a key figure in the MCU and central to Tony Stark's arc in Infinity War and Endgame, with their father/son relationship being the driving force behind him deciding to research time travel and undo the Snap. 

Infinity War and Endgame were in development since at least mid-2014, months before the Sony deal went through. It seems unlikely that a major component of the films like Tony and Peter's relationship would be left out of these early developments. I think Harley was supposed to fill this role. There are many similarities between Harley and Peter. Both are interested in science and mechanics. Both have a close relationship with Tony. Both have lost their fathers. It really would require pretty minor changes to have Harley in that role. Maybe have Tony visit him and give him a suit in Civil War, etc.

I believe that the original plan was to have Harley grow into the Iron Lad throughout Phase 3 and continue to develop his relationship with Tony, but upon the Sony deal going through, Marvel Studios (obviously) chose to give that role to the bigger character of Spider-Man. But now with the death of Tony Stark and Harley making his triumphant return at his funeral in Endgame, I believe that we will be seeing him return to his planned role of the Iron Lad in future films.I recently had a thought about Arnold's line in the gun shop scene where he asks for a "phased plasma rifle in the 40-watt range."  For a long time, I thought it was just kind of a joke since he's from the future, but I think there was actually a reason behind it.

In the scene, Arnold can see each gun before he asks for it.  He asks for the 12-gauge auto loader shotgun, and a .45 pistol with laser sight.  He asks for his plasma rifle and the owner's response is "Hey, just what ya see, pal."  He asks for an Uzi for good measure, then loads the shotgun and shoots the owner.

Why would he ask for a gun that hadn't been invented yet?  We know from Kyle that Skynet's records are incomplete which is why the T-800 doesn't know exactly which Sarah Connor to go after.  It's reasonable to think that Skynet's records on the development and availability of weaponry were also limited in some way.  Arnold asks for the plasma rifle because he isn't actually sure if it is available in this time or not.

Now, a phased plasma rifle would probably make terminating Sarah pretty easy, but I don't think that's why he asked since any of the other weapons he selected would easily be capable of doing the job.  The real reason he asked the gun shop owner is to make sure that the owner wouldn't be able to pose a threat to him when he stole all the other guns.

When Sarah asks Reese if he can stop the Terminator, he says "With these weapons, I don't know," suggesting that in the future, there are weapons which can take down T-800s.  When the shop owner confirms for Arnold that he doesn't have any phased plasma rifles hidden behind the counter, Arnold knows there is no threat to him or his mission and he can continue with his planned theft.

His question was actually a technique to ascertain the threat level posed by the shop owner before he moved to shoot him.We've all been there; you forget to hit mute and say something embarrassing on a conference call. Vader has been doing this ever since he got back from Mustafar.

After watching him force-choke a dude, everyone was too scared to tell him. The longer it goes on, the less likely it is someone will say something.


Proof: *xckhooooo tckhaaaaa, xckhooooo tckhaaaaa*Some tales say that when Achilles was first born, Thetis held him from his heels and dipped him in the river Styx. River Styx is the river of the dead, killing any god that touches it and giving immortality (as in invulnerability) to any non-gods that do. This was also mentioned in the 2004 movie, to which Achilles replied "I wouldn't be wearing armor if I was (invulnerable)" but I think this is intended on Achilles' part. 

Achilles wears the armor for 2 reasons:

- To be recognized in the battlefield. His armor is unique and instantly recognizable, proven when Patroclus wore it, everyone including his allies thought he was Achilles. This armor gives allies morale, and makes it known that it's THE Achilles fighting, so the glory points aren't accidentally given to someone else.


- If he were to use no armor, the tales about him being invulnerable would be pretty much confirmed and anyone who saw him on the battlefield would just run away from him. To be able to actually fight and gain glory, he had to tarnish his reputation of being invulnerable. 

Achilles lived for glory and fame. Even before the battle of Troy, his mother Tethis (a sea goddess) learns about his future and tells him. It's either he doesn't join the battle and live a long and prosper life, having multiple grandchildren, or he joins the battle and is remembered until the end of time as a hero of war. Achilles doesn't even consider the other choice and joins the battle of Troy for maximum glory. And that's why he wears an armor so people don't instantly run away from him, denying him the glory he seeks.SPOILERS FOR 'SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME' INSIDE...  


&#x200B;

In 'Spider-Man: FFH', Peter is given a pair of AI glasses from Tony Stark. These AI glasses are a huge part of the plot, since it has billions of dollars worth of security protocols loaded into it. They were originally meant for Peter to use to keep Earth safe from any potential threat, since Iron Man is no more.  


&#x200B;

When Peter first uses these AI glasses we learn the AI's name is E.D.I.T.H., which is an acronym for "Even Dead, I'm The Hero". A very bitter-sweet, Tony Stark-ish joke that encapsulates Tony's personality very well.  


&#x200B;

In the end of the film, Mysterio uses E.D.I.T.H. for his great illusion to look like a hero in front of the world. After Spider-Man stops him and Mysterio dies by his own hand, the glasses are returned to Peter and the end of the movie is carried out. Peter gets the girl and they swing off into the sunset. Happy ending, right?  


&#x200B;

That is, until the Mid-Credit's scene.You all know what happened. Mysterio's team sent out footage to the Daily Bugle revealing Spider-Man's identity. Not only this, but Mysterio's team doctored the footage to make it appear as though Spider-Man is evil, ordering drone strikes and murdering Mysterio.  


&#x200B;

Though it didn't go down how he originally intended it to, Mysterio still achieved his ultimate goal.  


&#x200B;

Even Dead, I'm The Hero.So this is admittedly not my own theory, but one I saw and which I wanted to expand on some.

After The Snap, people start disappearing. And it looks like a pretty peaceful death, to be honest. There's a quiet breeze as your body silently dissolves into the universe. It doesn't look painful, and in several circumstances it happens so quickly that the characters barely have time to react or understand what's happening.

And then we have Spider-man, whose death is very different. He says he doesn't feel too good, and then he has an overwhelming sense of impending doom as he 
 clings to Tony and laments that he 'doesn't want to go'.

However, it might not be that his death was inherently different, or even played up for cinematic purposes. It's possible that he experienced his death that way because of his spider sense. 

Given that he gets physiological symptoms from his spider-sense (hairs on his arm stand up, for example), and spider-sense is often depicted as a sort of 'danger foresight', it's possible that a 100%, guaranteed death on his part made his spider sense go haywire. He was fully aware of his impending doom several seconds before it happened, and his pain came not from his actual death, but from the anxiety and physical symptoms of his spider sense being tripped harder than it ever has been before. In the MCU it’s been established that Dr. Abraham Erskine, the scientist who turned Steve Rogers into Captain America in *The First Avenger* (2011), was the only person to ever successfully produce an effective Super Soldier Serum. It’s also established that Cap’s shield is made of vibranium, a supermetal that is only found in Wakanda.

Skip forward from WWII to the present day, and the closest we’ve seen in the MCU to powers resembling those of Steve Rogers are those of the Black Panther. T’Challa and Erik “Killmonger” Stevens both have enhanced speed, strength, and endurance when they possess the powers of the Black Panther. They aren’t necessarily superhuman, but they are at peak human ability, just like Captain America.

Going back to WWII, Erskine’s original attempt at making a super soldier failed, deforming Johann Schmidt into the Red Skull. A few years later, Erskine was ready to try again. With the help of the brilliant Howard Stark, he perfected it and turned the weakling Steve Rogers into the super soldier Captain America.

The difference between the two attempts is that Erskine was now working with Howard Stark. Stark, as we know, had acquired enough vibranium to make a shield sometime before Cap formed the Howling Commandos. 

Seeing as vibranium only comes from Wakanda, Stark must have gone to Wakanda (or at least he had a contact there) in order to get his hands on the vibranium needed to make the shield. At some point during his dealings with the Wakandans, Stark must have heard about the Black Panther and his superhuman abilities.

Stark, if not already working with Erskine by this point, would have realized that if America could harness the powers of the Black Panther, they could be used to create a super soldier. Seeing as how Stark was working with and doing science for the US military, he could have figured out that Erskine was the man to talk to about creating an American super soldier.

If Stark was already working with Erskine by the time he found out about the Black Panther, he would have told Erskine about the Black Panther and gotten the go-ahead to figure out how to incorporate it into the super soldier program.

So Stark manages to get some Heart-Shaped Herb via some kind of deal, or maybe he just steals some of it (à la Rocket and the Sovereign’s batteries) when he finds out that the Wakandans aren’t willing to exchange it for anything.

Now that the Americans have the Heart Shaped Herb, the Super Soldier program can continue unhindered. The Herb seems to contain a stabilizing agent which prevents unwanted mutations (e.g. turning into the Red Skull) during the enhancement process. The research is completed and they are ready to find a candidate. That candidate ends up being Steve Rogers. 

In short, because both are derived from the same source, Cap’s powers and T’Challa’s powers are very similar.

—

The influence of the Heart Shaped Herb on the MCU doesn’t stop there. The reason that Bruce Banner got turned into the Hulk instead of successfully relaunching the Super Soldier Program (like Ross wanted) in *The Incredible Hulk* (2008) is that the key ingredient — the Heart Shaped Herb’s stabilizing agent — was missing, and the same goes for Blonsky when he turns into the Abomination.

----

TL;DR: The Super Soldier Serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America was derived from the Heart Shaped Herb that gives people the powers of the Black Panther. The Heart Shaped Herb was incorporated into the Serum by Howard Stark, who somehow got a sample of the Herb from Wakanda, where he also obtained the vibranium used to make Cap’s famous shield. The Herb contains a key ingredient that prevents the enhanced individual from getting fucked up like the Red Skull, the Hulk, and the Abomination did.In ROTJ, Luke and Vader are fairly evenly matched until the end, when Vader scans Luke's mind and sees he has a twin sister. He gloats about turning her to the dark side which sends Luke into a frenzy, enabling him to finally beat Vader.

What if Vader suddenly realized who Luke's sister was in the second before Luke attacked? If Vader saw Lea's face in Luke's mind, he would know he personally tortured his own long lost daughter on the original Death Star.

That guilt would be horribly distracting.This is so simple. In fact, I won't be surprised if someone puts a link in the comments showing that it's been covered.

Hulk wants friendship. 

It's that easy.

Watch Ragnarok. All they talk about is "Thor not Hulk friend".

Waititi makes is perfectly clear: Valkyrie comes. They are friends. It's obvious. He helps her.

He clears the air with Thor. They establish a friendship between Thor and **Hulk**, not just *Thor and Banner*. 

Hulk runs after Thor. "Friend!" he exclaims.

Because he's lonely. Because no one likes or respects him for who he is.

Banner treats him like a trained animal.

Hulk liked being a gladiator. He got recognition for who and what he is. 

Which, at it's core is all anyone wants. 

There's nothing complicated going on. Ragnarok makes it clear over and over again that Hulk's primary motivation is validation from others, most importantly through **friendship**. 

Hulk came out on the Bifrost because Hulk's *friends* were in trouble. Not because Banner called him. In fact, Hulk was content to let Banner die. He waited. He didn't do it for Banner. He did it for Valkyrie and Thor. 

This ain't rocket surgery, folks.

Banner will be friends with his inner Hulk.So, compared to every other city in the DC Universe, except for maybe Bludhaven, which is right across the Gotham Bay if I'm not mistaken, Gotham City is wildly messed up. The question is, why?

I had an idea that might have solved it during a replay of the Arkham series. Throughout the main Rocksteady games, Batman comes across **three** Lazarus Pits ([one in Arkham City](https://youtu.be/uKvR9zT6B2k?t=2154), and[ two in the Shadow War side mission in Arkham Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJWpJT3Ohj8)), baths of mystical chemicals Ra's Al Ghul uses to revive and heal himself, that also drive him insane over repeated uses. It's also confirmed that the swamp that brought Solomun Grundy back to "life" was a Lazarus Pit. And in the New 52 story "Endgame," it's revealed that the Lazarus chemical is derived from a chemical called [Dionesium](https://crusadapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dionesium) that the Joker uses to become effectively immortal, and the Court of Owl also uses it to enable their Talons to live for centuries.

So, over the course of several mediums, that's *five* immortality-enabling chemicals under Gotham. In Shadow War, it's confirmed that [Lazarus is in the city's water supply.](https://youtu.be/zJWpJT3Ohj8?t=903)

So, a chemical that heals people quickly but also drives them insane is in the water supply (and has been for hundreds of years) for a city that houses not only the Batman, a human who seems to heal very quickly no matter his wounds, but also his rogues gallery, who also undergo just as much punishment *from him* (just look at the combat in the games, nobody should be surviving that).

Off the top of my head, there are three villains from outside of Gotham.

1. Bane
2. Deathstroke
3. Ra's Al Ghul

*One of them is a superhuman, one of them uses a drug to temporarily become a superhuman, and the other one actively uses the chemical that's the subject here.*

Look at [Firefly](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2015/06/27/Firefly_batmobile_chase_feature.jpg) and [Two Face](https://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/06/two-face-138946-1280x0.jpg); neither of those people should be alive. In all honesty, [Victor Zsasz](https://i.imgur.com/r0qWdhH.jpg) and [The Penguin](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/3/34/Image.png/revision/latest?cb=20160830081958) too (Note: That's not a monocle, that's a beer bottle someone shoved in his eye). They should have died from infections years ago. But because they're (unknowingly) constantly drinking trace amounts of a chemical that heals all wounds if you take a bath in it when its not watered down, and literally makes you immortal if you bathe in the chemical its derived from, their wounds never prove fatal.

TL;DR: In the Arkhamverse especially, but I believe in the mainline version of Gotham too, the water in the Gotham area is tainted with a chemical that makes the people who drink it incredibly resilient, but also slowly drives them insane too.

Check [here](https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Arkham_City_Stories) to see where I got a couple bits of information. Wish I could link to specific ones, but check out "Buried On A Sunday", "The Cobblepot Feud Part 4", and "Wonder City."

EDIT: /u/Fortanono also made a very excellent point that's worthy of being added: https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ay6fpe/batmandc_comics_i_think_i_figured_out_why_gotham/ei0sxr5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

After rewatching most of the show and many analysis videos I’ve come up with a two-pronged theory, one about how the families of Game of Thrones represent The Seven Deadly Sins and also about the White Walkers and how the show is going to end, but I’ll get to that later.

Part of what makes GoT so entertaining is that there really are no good guys or bad guys in this show. Everybody is oftentimes a flawed selfish asshole in their own way. There are some biblical undertones to the story as well, which isn’t surprising. George R.R. Martin has said he draws a lot of inspiration from Tolkien in fantasy and writing, and Tolkien’s work in LOTR/The Hobbit had many biblical themes and undertones, & A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones is no different. My theory on the TV show stems from this, I believe that each of the major houses in the show represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and on a greater scale shows just how corrupt people in this world have become, which plays into the end of the show.

&#x200B;

**Greed: House Tyrell**. The Tyrells are a compelling family, especially because they seem to be the only matriarchal family in Westeros, and the alpha women of this family play the Game of Thrones with great cunning. However, their greatest flaw throughout the show is greed for power, and ultimately it led to their downfall. They showed a complete lack of loyalty to anybody in The War of Five Kings, siding first with Renly Baratheon, later switching sides to secure a partnership with the Lannisters in a military alliance, then through Margaery marrying Joffrey/Tommen before finally siding with Daenerys, partly for revenge but largely because they knew nothing would be gained by staying allied with the Lannisters. They switch sides consistently and manipulate people with ease, and they don’t do it for an ideology, they do it purely for the sake of what they think will put them on the highest spot on the totem pole. Even their banner is [embroidered](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Tyrell) with the color associated with Greed, an all green Sigil surrounding the rose. 

**Rage: House Baratheon**. The Baratheon [house motto](https://imgur.com/gallery/WNNVPvJ) is the first indication, “Ours is the Fury” that rage is what they represent. Robert Baratheon has the hottest temper of any character in the show, verbally lashing out at those around him or [slapping](https://imgur.com/gallery/hP0QL) Cersei when she pisses him off. His bastard son Gendry is shown to be hot-headed at times as [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ym7mRYyuXs). Even their house animal: The Stag, though a majestic animal is known for having a [fiery temper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNGGbozilko) when threatened. The background color for the house sigil as well is an orangish/yellow hue, and orange is a color often associated with the deadly sin of rage. Symbolically as well this house encompasses rage in the sense that of all the deadly sins, rage in many ways most encompasses masculinity. Uncoincidentally this house lacks any female members besides the sickly child of Stannis.

**Envy: House Targaryen**. Envy by definition is “a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.” Obviously, the longing that’s aroused through the Targaryens is the Iron Throne, which is owned by the Baratheons/Lannisters who overthrew their father. The envy for the crown displayed by the family is shown first through Viserys, who seems to have dedicated his entire existence to trying to retake the throne even though Westeros is glad to see his families rule come to an end after his father. After Viserys is killed, the envy for the throne continues through Daenerys and the great lengths we see her go through to go retake a throne she doesn’t have a claim to anymore. I can guarantee the envy she has for the throne will carry over into the final season and create some fatal conflict when it’s revealed Jon Snow is really a Targaryen, and the rightful heir to the throne over her if the Targaryens take it. For a symbolic connection, I looked at some historical depictions of the seven deadly sins being represented by animals, and one that commonly came up depicting envy is the snake. The only lizard depicting a deadly sin, and the only lizard on the [sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZJzOP) of any house in Westeros.

**Gluttony: The Martells**. This one may be the biggest stretch for people to believe but I wholeheartedly believe they’re an embodiment of gluttony from what we’ve seen in the show. Their plotline after Oberyn's arc is often criticized as the worst in the show but their demeanor in many ways encompasses gluttony to me. Gluttony is all about overindulgence of some base instinct like eating, fighting or sex. [The first scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS6PJKoJSl0) we’re shown of the Martell family, it’s Oberyn and Ellaria taking their pick from several prostitutes in Littlefinger’s whorehouse, drinking and getting down with some freaky group sex stuff before Oberyn goes and starts a fight with some Lannister soldiers. overindulgence of sex is commonplace with the Martells, they sleep around with anybody who catches their eye, they overindulge in violence whether it be Oberyn talking about taking part in the fighting pits for fun, the Sand Snake girls indulging in violence for revenge, and of course they love to overindulge in terrible [one-liners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sggmx8vysoc) as well.

**Sloth: House Frey**. Walder Frey without question is one of the most unlikable S.O.B.s in the series, but the arc of this house shows the underlying deadly sin this house encompasses, through their sheer incompetence and laziness, the premier signs of sloth. From the getgo they’re shown as an all-around uninspired and uninteresting house, relying on their lucky location at the twins for their power. The house as a whole is lazy and it shows in their conduct when doing anything at all on screen. Jaime [verbally berates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi32sU4Kvtw) their lazy military conduct in season six episode seven. The obvious laziness of this house is part of the reason why it’s so easy to hate them (besides Walder being an old creepy pervert). Going back to the symbolism aspect, blue is considered the color of the Deadly Sin Sloth and at the base of the [Frey Sigil](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Frey) blue water is shown, same as how at the base of their depiction in the show it is their lazy demeanor that makes them so despised, and represent sloth in such a manner.

**Pride: House Stark**. It’s hard to throw any hate at the Stark family. They are after all the most beloved family in the show and the protagonist family, but if there was any deadly sin they would encompass it’s pride more than anything, primarily through two traits. The first is their incredible stubbornness. It’s widely known they’re a stubborn family, “our way is the old way” Ned’s stubbornness kept him in a dungeon for weeks, Jon’s refuses to bend the knee to Daenerys at first and is called out for his pigheaded nature several times by other characters, their stubbornness is a pinnacle part of their conduct. Along with stubbornness, another trait commonly associated with Pride is disobedience, a trait seen through the Stark children. Whether it’s Robb’s disobedience to promises he made to Walder Frey, Arya’s disobedience after pledging herself to the faceless men, it’s these two staples for me that convince me they’re representative of pride. To add icing on the cake their [house sigil](https://imgur.com/gallery/ndjGn) is mostly grey, a color commonly associated with pride (but the internet is particularly split between that and purple as the color of pride).

**Lust: House Lannister**. At first glance this one may seem obvious through Tyrion and his man-whore tendencies, known for his many brothel visits early in the series. Their [banner](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Lannister) is embroidered in red as well, one of the colors commonly associated with lust (or blue depending on the part of the internet you ask). Looking at the personality traits of the members of the Lannister family, they encapsulate lust in many ways, with their incredibly selfish and inconsiderate behavior towards anybody outside of the family, two traits strongly associated with lust the deadly sin. Of course what lust is most associated with is extreme sexual desire, and this is demonstrated through the twincest relationship between Cersei and Jaime. We know incest is a fairly common thing in the Game of Thrones universe, but same as real life, it comes with bad side effects in the children the more closely related you are. Madness especially is a common side effect in children of incest in the show (The mad king had incest genes) and oh boy is Joffrey one [rotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQbW06x_Wk) little shit, likely as a result of his parents being near genetic clones of each other. Both Jaime and Cersei know what they’re doing and the dangers that come with it but they encompass lust, and as such their lust controls their arc and almost every bad thing that’s happened to them in the show.

&#x200B;

The seven deadly sins are covered but where does this all play into the end of the show? Well, this is where The White Walkers come in. The most powerful families in the world all encompass the deadliest sins imaginable according to many forms of classic literature. Analyzing more Biblical symbolism I think the White Walkers could best be described as the flood in the story of Noah’s ark. If you’re not familiar with it, the story in the Bible book of Genesis goes that God saw that human beings were far too corrupt and beyond saving, so he sent a flood to wipe out everything on earth (except of course for Noah, his family and the animals they brought with them on their big ass boat). Perhaps the White Walkers are building up their army now because they have a mission from higher powers to wipe out mankind.

This is where fellow fans go sour on me and say I’m too cynical, but I believe that the White Walkers aren’t the overarching bad guys, they’re a force sent by the old gods in Westeros who see that people have become too corrupt and they need to start anew. Even GoT Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss describe The Night King, saying that he’s not really a force for good or evil, “He’s just a force of destruction” much like the biblical flood. This show is known more than any other for subverting expectations and what a subversion it would be if the beings we believed to be the bad guys through the show up to this point were actually sent on a mission by the old gods who don’t like what men have become?

TL;DR: The families represent the seven deadly sins in Westeros and the White Walkers represent a destructive force from the gods like the flood in Noah’s Ark because people in this world have become too corrupt.Qui-Gon learned the truth about the Dark Side that Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, and even Yoda never realized.

To be clear, Qui-Gon Jinn is still responsible for taking the risk of recruiting and training Anakin Skywalker, setting him on his path to becoming Darth Vader. But in a new one-shot comic book revealing Qui-Gon's crisis of faith long before Episode 1, the Jedi Master's doubts and true intentions are finally explained. Qui-Gon didn't fail to notice the Dark Side boiling up inside of Anakin Skywalker: he believed that darkness was exactly what was needed to bring balance to The Force. Showing once and for all that Anakin could have brought peace to the galaxy... if Qui-Gon Jinn had trained him.
 
The Force explained by the Jedi, you've heard it already: light side good, dark side evil and terrible. But for all their talk of "balance" the Jedi Order of the Star Wars movies had grown rigid in their prejudice. And in the pages of Star Wars: Age of Republic: Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi's crisis of faith long before The Phantom Menace is finally shown. Not to overstate it, but Qui-Gon seems to realize what no other member of the Jedi Council is noticing: that they have lost their vision. And to get his back, he leaps blindly into hyperspace with only The Force to guide him, and accepts the lesson it has to teach him. 

On an alien world teaming with both life and deadly, "dark" growth, Qui-Gon communes with The Force. Sensing both the life-giving Force and the darkness to balance it, he awakens from his vision to see that the darkness has been driven back. Light triumphed over it, returning true "balance, but through a means beyond conflict." The lesson sticks, and Qui-Gon returns to the Order keeping this knowledge to himself. The Jedi believe the Dark Side to be resisted by any means necessary... but only in the face of darkness can light restore the balance. A principle that clearly occupies Qui-Gon's mind when discovering a small slave boy on a planet called Tatooine.

Which is where the prequel must now be re-assessed. Because when Qui-Gon confirms that he believes Anakin Skywalker is the One prophesied to "bring balance to The Force," he and the Jedi Council are imagining two different victories. For the Council, it means The Force has produced a champion to vanquish the darkness, leaving only the light. While Qui-Gon's encounter with The Force has shown "balance" to be the acceptance of darkness, so that light might overcome it. The Council senses the potential for the Dark Side in Anakin, and views it as a threat. Qui-Gon would have sensed the same, but understand Anakin's potential for darkness was the entire point of The Force's lesson (and by extension, the prophecy).

If Qui-Gon had lived to train Anakin himself, that lesson would almost certainly have proven true. Because by that point, even Qui-Gon had come to realize what Anakin eventually would: that the Jedi had lost their way.One of the first things we learn about Azkaban is how absolutely horrible it is. Hagrid nearly has a breakdown when he's told he's going there for a few weeks, and is noticeably affected afterwards. Fudge is visibly ill just thinking about making a short trip, and Ron mentions that his dad was shaking and exhausted after just a few hours there on ministry business. From everything Sirius tells us, and what we later see with Death Eaters, Azkaban is capable of driving someone insane, and making them lose the will to live. This shows us that Dementors are incredibly dangerous, possibly the most dangerous things in Harry Potter. To the best of our knowledge, they can't be killed, and can drive someone mad just by standing near them, as well as their "kiss".

After Voldemort comes back, the dementors leave Azkaban, and start terrorizing Muggles. Fudge also mentions that they've begun breeding (good luck getting *that* image out of your brain). It'd be essentially impossible for the Ministry to fight them, and we don't see any evidence of them trying to do so. Taking down even one or two requires the patronus charm, something very few wizards can do.

Clearly, letting Dementors run free would be incredibly dangerous. They'd be a severe threat to both wizards and muggles alike (maybe 10% of adult wizards could manage to fight them off, at *best*), and they'd likely end up destroying the statute of secrecy. Thousands could lose their souls, and millions more would face horrible depression and fear.

We know that the Ministry has barely any control over the dementors. Voldemort basically just asks them to join him, and they do. When they're at Hogwarts, they all abandon their posts and attack children, and the ministry is powerless to stop them. Same with Barty Crouch Jr: Fudge is right there, yet can't stop the Dementor from sucking out his soul.

Azkaban acts as a sort of prison for dementors. They're given a constant supply of free prey without having to work for it, who they can make miserable. The ministry sacrifices some of their worst prisoners, the people their society won't care about. They also then get the added bonus of dissuading crime through fear. But their main goal is to keep the dementors there, under control, without the resources to breed more of their kind (from what Fudge says, we can guess they need an abundance of prey to do that).This idea came to me when I was thinking about gorillas, and sexual dimorphism in general. One of the reasons humans are less dimorphic than other primate species is monogamy and pair-bonding; since men don't expect to constantly be in competition with each other for mates, there's less (not zero, but relatively less) gender-specific selection happening on the male body, reducing differences between the sexes. Its still an advantage for human guys to be big and strong, but its also an advantage for women, and since men don't have to constantly fight other guys for the chance to reproduce at all the amount of benefit each gender derives from strength and size doesn't grow too dissimilar.

We don't, however, see this in gorillas. Gorillas are much more sexually dimorphic than humans; the males are much bigger and bulkier than the females since, as a polygamous species, they expect to be in constant competition with other males for mating rights. Their biology anticipates constant inter-male competition, and prepares them for it.

Now how does all this relate to mutants? It's simple. Its no secret that comic book heroes tend to have physiques exaggerated in a gender-dependent manner ( [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild) ,  [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperPower](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperPower) ). What makes mutants interesting is the application of this phenomenon to an entire 'species'. Here we have an entire subspecies of primate that is more sexually dimorphic than normal humans in the same way gorillas are more sexually dimorphic than homo sapiens. What could this say about what their biology is trying to achieve?

My theory is simple. Mutant biology expects strong inter-male competition for mating rights. That's why it tends to exaggerate the anatomical differences between the sexes; it expects polygamy. And this is because every X-gene on Earth, wants to be the only X-gene on Earth.

Each X-gene wants to spread as far and as fast as possible, but human culture and monogamy has drastically slowed down this spread. The X-gene expects mutant men to fight each other for mating rights, but instead mutants (men and women alike) band together to fight against humans/aliens/etc.... The X-gene was mean to kick off an evolutionary arms race during pre-history, but instead only started activating in large numbers during the modern age, when time and culture had tempered most of humanity's more violent impulses and, most importantly, technology had neutralised many of the advantages mutants would have had.

It has been observed that related X-genes confer similar powers. This can be seen in how related mutants tend to have related powers (Wolverine and Sabretooth, Cyclops, Vulcan, and Havok, etc...). And in many cases related mutants are even immune to the effects of each others powers (Havok and Cyclops can't blast each other, Cordelia Frost is immune to Emma Frost's telepathy, etc...). So it can be theorised that single X-genes not only give rise to similar X-genes, but that related X-genes can, in some cases, even be geared towards cooperation, forming a natural in-group. If the X-gene had started activating back in prehistory, this would have easily led to the establishment of related tribes capable of easily working together against outsiders (e.g the Summers tribe would not fear friendly fire, the Frost Tribe wouldn't have to fear being mentally dominated by each other, etc...) And it would have incentivised allegiance along 'ethnic' lines (if its harder to hurt people with similar, related powers, then suddenly it becomes much safer to live among similarly powered people). If wide-spread X-gene activation happened early enough, then over time simple human psychology and the competition for resources would have lead to only a few (or even maybe only one) X-gene remaining on Earth.

The final end result was meant to be a humanity much more similar to other sentient alien races - one species, with one shared superpower (and maybe a few 'minority' X-gene populations as well), instead of the random mix we see today. Instead modern culture has interrupted this process, giving mutants (and by extension humanity) much more control over their evolutionary future.

EDIT: I know that evolution doesn't quite work this way, but as far as I know the X-Gene was actually added into the human population by sufficiently advanced aliens. So a large part of my theory rests on the X-gene being explicitly 'designed' to do all of these things, rather than having evolved all of these separate features the normal way.Thanos destroyed the stones at the start of the movie was because he used the time stone to see into the future just like Dr Strange and saw the entire movie. He saw the Avengers coming to reclaim the stones and he saw that once he destroys the stones the Avengers would be forced to time travel, triggering Nebula's glitch and tipping off his younger self. That Thanos would then show up to reclaim the gauntlet and more importantly, create a new universe, which he was unable to do in his weakened state after the snap. That would also explain why he so smugly said "I am inevitable" before getting his fat head chopped off. If this theory were true, it would go to show how psychopathic and evil Thanos really was. Snapping half the universe wasn't enough, he ultimately wanted to rule his own.


Thing is, although Thanos saw himself winning, he was cocky, and he did not account for Dr Strange. The moment Dr Strange was revived, Thanos was fucked. Why didn't Thanos see this coming, you ask? Despite having the time stone for a short while, Thanos was never besting Dr Strange in a battle of timeline manipulation. It's very believable to imagine that while Strange cycled through 14,000,605 timelines to find a winning one, amateur user Thanos likely only looked at a few, realised he won in all of them, and stopped looking. This point is what holds the theory together, and it occurs very naturally. Strange bested Thanos, because Strange was just more thorough, and that thoroughness came out of desperation with his back against the wall in infinity war. From Thanos' point of view, it's insanity to imagine looking at millions of timelines just to find one where you lose, of all things. It seems unnatural for Thanos to need to look through so many, but very natural for Strange. This situation is very interesting. Thanos is primed to lose because he most likely will win, but Strange will win because he is so likely to lose. Is there a lesson to be learned here? Maybe. Anyway as soon as Strange is on the battlefield he begins manipulating the fight to bring his desired timeline to life while Thanos has no idea. Tony does the snap, takes all the glory, and the rest is history.

TL;DR
Thanos destroyed the stones and died smugly because he saw his future through the time stone, successfully creating a new universe. He naturally didn't look at 14,000,605 timelines like Dr Strange, was not aware of the timeline he loses, giving an advantage to Strange who already saw what strings he needed to pull to win.In Toy Story 1 Sid is confronted with horrifying revelation that his toys are alive. [15 years later in Toy Story 3 we see that Sid has become the local Garbageman](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--SRRk3QWS--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18xm3w5f7zwqepng.png). 

Now being a garbageman has one of the biggest perks that you may not have realized. We find things. [Lots](http://i.imgur.com/BVH0UAY.jpg) [of](http://i.imgur.com/naJXerq.jpg) [things](http://i.imgur.com/rFHLaG2.jpg). 

I even found a [42 gal trash bag](http://i.imgur.com/7jyc8eq.jpg) full of [Lego](http://i.imgur.com/pC339Bh.jpg)

[Sometrash picked Nerf collection](http://i.imgur.com/R8xBg5f.jpg)

I don't have a picture of the matchbox cars I've found because there's just too damn many. [Here's some monster trucks](http://i.imgur.com/Bd8keiS.jpg)

And don't even let me start on the Barbies.

Now, let's imagine you're a guy who just learned that inanimate objects are alive. What job would you get?  Sid isn't fucked up and working a crappy job. He's trying to save them. He is trying to save the toys.

He picked the one kind of job where you can [rescue those things.](http://imgur.com/a/lCa4g)

And Sid is uniquely equipped to fix those toys that he finds that are broken. He's pretty damn creative.*The Theory:*

&#x200B;

Dooku knew that the Republic's corruption was so endemic that no amount of reform was ever going to fix it.   As a political idealist, simply toppling Palpatine and taking over the Republic would have been a distasteful prospect.  He was a count, an aristocrat.  That made him better than the common man of the Republic, better than the sleazy politicians like his master Palpatine who ran it, better than the government tools like the Jedi who protected it.  His vision was clearer, his doctrine was purer, his ideals more righteous.

&#x200B;

As someone better he was burdened with greater purpose,  Dooku would not simply overthrow his master, but rather provide the galaxy with an alternative to the Republic, so superior and exceptional that it would implode.  He'd be the midwife to a galactic utopia, then hand it off to Kenobi to secure his legacy.

&#x200B;

*Evidence:*

&#x200B;

BIRTH OF A RIVAL

&#x200B;

**From paper tiger to real tiger.**  Palpatine merely intended the CIS be perceived as a great threat to the Republic, but Dooku was working overtime to make it true.  The Trade Federation, the Banking Clan and the Techno Union had all pledged to support it.  The Corporate Alliance and Commerce Guild were the next two prospects Dooku sought to add as backers.  With all those groups invested in it, the CIS would then have the industrial, financial, commercial and military base that would allow it to be the author of its own destiny.

&#x200B;

**It happened right under Palpatine's nose.**  Palpatine knew Dooku was on Geonosis and even who he was meeting since they were also allied to him, but didn't know that Dooku was working a backroom deal to secure the CIS's independence from him.  As Palpatine's puppet, Dooku wouldn't have needed to negotiate treaties with them to fund the war, he'd be able to order them to provide whatever he needed by Palpatine's authority.  If Dooku was brokering his own deals to supply the CIS, it's because he's cutting them a better deal in order to prepare for his uprising against Palpatine.

As for the backers, they were funding both sides, so as long as they made money it didn't matter to them who won the war.

&#x200B;

WHY BRING KENOBI ONBOARD?

&#x200B;

**Dooku knew he would leave his masterwork unfinished.**  He was old and Palpatine was already grooming his replacement.  Despite his idealism, the backbone of the CIS was made up of the same corrupt corporations as the Republic meaning it was destined to share the same fate.  The only thing keeping them in check would have been Dooku's status as a terrifying Sith Lord who'd kill them all dead if they crossed him.  He needed a powerful successor capable of maintaining the same level of order among them until the CIS matured into a proper state and could be reformed.

&#x200B;

**He had moved beyond the plebeian's binary understanding of the force.**  He still referred to his new dark side abilities as Jedi powers, but he wasn't one of the deluded Jedi who couldn't see they were working for a Sith Lord and he wasn't some common Sith Lord, ambitious for ambition's sake.  He was some kind of greater force-sensitive Other, so it didn't matter to him that he was dark side and Kenobi was light side, only that Kenobi's abilities were of a higher caliber.

&#x200B;

**Kenobi was one of the best Jedi Knights.**  As a padawan, he killed a Sith apprentice and helped liberate Naboo.  As a Jedi Knight, he helped foil the assassination of senator, was training the Chosen One, and uncovered the creation of the secret clone army among countless other exploits.

&#x200B;

**Kenobi was susceptible to the dark side through their shared connection with Qui-Gon.**  Dooku's idealism caused him to leave the Jedi.  He knew that some of that same idealism rubbed off on Qui-Gon ultimately leaving him a renegade Jedi and he sensed that Obi-Wan also had a similar darkness inside him.  During Episode I, Yoda said Kenobi was defiant like his master.  And remember, as straitlaced as Obi-Wan was in the prequels, by Episode IV, he had become a straight up liar trying to convince a boy to kill his dad under false pretenses.

&#x200B;

**Kenobi was someone greater like Dooku.**  Obi-Wan held himself to a higher standard and had the bearing of a statesman.  He was lawful.  He was diplomatic.  Honorable.  Civilized.  Qui-Gon spoke highly of him. The use of a blaster was beneath him.  If Dooku had been the leader the CIS needed, Kenobi was the one it deserved.

&#x200B;

CHANCE #1

&#x200B;

**Targeting the Sith.**  When he asked Obi-Wan to join him, he didn't ask him for help conquering the galaxy or to destroy the Jedi or the Republic.  He didn't want the Republic and the Jedi Order was a dead man walking already.  Given enough time the CIS, by virtue of its superiority, would bury both institutes.  However, the CIS could not kill Palpatine and he most certainly has to die for the CIS to live.  That's why he asked Kenobi to help him destroy the SITH specifically.

&#x200B;

THE JEDI ATTACK

&#x200B;

**Jango fled for no reason.**  After meeting Kenobi on Kamino, Jango fled.  Kamino was not part of the Republic, so the Jedi had no jurisdiction there.  Plus they had no real evidence linking Jango to anything.  He had no reason to leave Kamino.  He would have called his boss, Dooku though to let him know the Jedi were snooping around.  At that point, Dooku asked him to return to Geonosis knowing Kenobi would follow.  If Jango killed Kenobi on the way, great, the droid foundries would stay a secret.  If not, then Dooku could use Kenobi to his advantage.

&#x200B;

**All according to Palpatine's plan?**  Palpatine's plan was that the Republic would eventually attack the CIS to start the Clone Wars.  Would Palpatine knowingly have set events in motion so the Jedi attacked the heart of the CIS war machine right when all the people funding the Republic's war effort were there and in danger of dying in the crossfire or being arrested by the Jedi?  No, he wouldn't have.

&#x200B;

**All according to Dooku's plan.**  All those backers watched in fear for their lives as more Jedi like Anakin came charging in in a beserker rage to chop up poor Geonosians who's only crime had been leaving the Republic.   They then watched as droids under Dooku's command completely overwhelmed them.  Dooku even gave the Jedi a chance to surrender to show his benevolent nature.  When they refused the offer, they painted themselves as ruthless killers who could not be reasoned with.

When Yoda showed up with the Republic's unnatural clone army, Dooku's forces also held it off until everyone escaped.  The backers were indebted to him and if there were any doubts about the Separatists' chances of beating the Republic, they would have all melted away that day.

&#x200B;

CHANCE #2

&#x200B;

**Testing Kenobi.**  Even though Kenobi had already refused his offer once, Dooku gave him a second chance during his fight to escape Geonosis.  He went easy on Kenobi trying to test his abilities and check to see if turning him from the Jedi was possible.

&#x200B;

* He took out Anakin immediately so he could concentrate solely on Obi-wan.
* He used his lightning only once against Kenobi because he wanted to see if he was capable of 	defending against it.  If Kenobi was to take on Palpatine, he'd need to be able to.  Once he was satisfied that Kenobi could, he stopped 	using it.
* During their duel, he mocked Kenobi to provoke an emotional response and break through his Jedi 	indoctrination.
* He controlled his strikes giving Kenobi only flesh wounds to his arm and thigh when he could have 	easily severed both the way he severed Anakin's arm.
* After disabling Kenobi, he stood down a few moments to allow Kenobi a chance to respond.  That was the moment of truth.  With death seconds away, he needed Kenobi to 	lash out in anger or beg for mercy in fear, any kind of emotion reaction to signal a break from his Jedi brainwashing.  Instead, Kenobi just lay there like a limp fish resigned to his fate.  In that moment, Dooku understood Kenobi would not be turned and so 	opted to finish him off.  By that point though Anakin had come to and was able to jump in and save Obi-Wan.

&#x200B;

PLAYING PALPATINE FOR A FOOL

&#x200B;

**He turned Anakin over to the Geonosians.**  He knew Anakin was being groomed to replace him.  He couldn't kill him without incurring Palpatine's wrath though, so he handed Anakin and the others over to the Geonosians who were calling for their executions.  In the worst-case scenario, all three escaped to live another day, but he would score points with Nute Gunray and the Geonosians.   In the best-case scenario, he'd still score points with them and Anakin would be killed.  As for Kenobi, he had already refused Dooku's offer, so his death would be no great loss.

If Anakin did die, he could just lie to Palpatine saying the Geonosians demanded justice and he had to chose between handing over Anakin or continued access to their droid foundries.

&#x200B;

**He didn't kill Anakin when he had the chance.**  After severing his arm, Dooku chose to force push Anakin away instead of running him through with his lightsaber. The only possible reason would be because Palpatine had expressly forbidden Dooku from killing him.  Dooku obliged in order to buy the CIS time.

A Sith apprentice is supposed to scheme against his master.  As long as the master could still control the apprentice it wasn't a problem.  By letting Anakin live, he duped Palpatine into believing he was still obedient.  Under that assumption, Palpatine wouldn't try to actually win the war.  He'd just use the CIS as a meat grinder to thin the ranks of the Jedi, allowing Dooku to continue building it up in secret as a rival to the Republic.

&#x200B;

**The maiming increased his value while diminishing Anakin's.**  By laying a beatdown on Obi-Wan, crippling Anakin and then fighting Yoda to a standstill all in one day, Dooku made a statement to Palpatine.  “I will not be replaced anytime soon.”  Maiming Anakin permanently damaged his fighting ability and put doubt in Palpatine's mind, however small, that Anakin was not all that he imagined him to be.

&#x200B;

CHANCE # 2 ½

&#x200B;

**Taking the Chancellor hostage.**  As soon as he learned Palpatine would have Grevious take him hostage and orchestrate it so that the Jedi dream team rescued him during Revenge of the Sith, Dooku knew that he'd finally been made and that one of them would have to die during that mission.  He decided to try and make one last play for Kenobi.

&#x200B;

* His 	plan was kill Anakin and then strike down Palpatine. He told Anakin “I've been looking forward to this,” because there was nothing to prevent him from killing Anakin this time .
* He took the time to pin Kenobi to the ground with a platform instead of just crushing him like a bug.  He didn't want to kill Kenobi, just 	temporarily incapacitate him.
* After killing Anakin, he would attack Palpatine who would be forced to 	defend himself with lightning or a lightsaber revealing he was a 	Sith.   Kenobi would shortly come to from the blow he suffered just as Anakin did in Episode II, see Palpatine was a Sith and realize that A) he'd 	been working for the bad guy all this time and B) Dooku had told him the truth.
* Kenobi would then have to choose between his master's master who was honest with him from their first meeting or the man who'd been using him and the Jedi since the beginning. Together 	they would destroy Palpatine and end the war with a victory for the CIS.

&#x200B;

Instead of all that though, he went and died.

&#x200B;

**An undignified death.**  Why did Dooku stay silent at the end?

&#x200B;

* First, he was in shock from the physical trauma of being relieved of his arms 30 seconds ago.
* He was humiliated.  He was an aristocrat on his knees facing execution at the hand of a bastard slave on the order of a scumbag politician.  He would not add to his humiliation by giving them the satisfaction of begging for his life.  It was beneath him.
* Despite his best efforts, he had failed.  However, the Republic and Jedi Order still had to be destroyed.  If he couldn't do it, Palpatine might still be able to, so for the good of the galaxy his duty demanded that he remain silent about who Palpatine really was.

&#x200B;

TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS

&#x200B;

**He was 100% telling the truth.**  Gunray was vindictive.  (He was still trying to kill Padme 10 years after Naboo.)  After his failed invasion, Gunray really did go to Dooku for help and told him all about Palpatine because he wanted revenge against him too.  Upon hearing Palpatine's plan, Dooku became his apprentice for the purpose of using Palpatine's resources, not to save the Republic or the Jedi Order, but to bring about his own personal vision for the galaxy before Palpatine could achieve his.  He instructed Gunray and the rest of the CIS leadership including General Grevious to pay lip service to Palpatine as master until the time was right for him to rise up and then Gunray would have his revenge.

&#x200B;

**General Grevious.**  After Kenobi refused his offer and being unable to secure another quality apprentice, Dooku trained Grevious in the Jedi Arts for the sake of continuity of government.  In the event of his untimely death, Grevious as a big, scary cyborg, could assume control of the CIS, rule it as head of a military junta and use the droid army to keep the financiers and member systems in line.  Grevious would continue building the CIS in secret until he was ready to take on Palpatine.  After all, he had successfully killed multiple Jedi sans force.

Instead of all that though, he went and died too.

&#x200B;

**Palpatine ordered Vader to massacre the CIS leadership on Mustafar.**  Why?  Because he was afraid they'd blackmail him?  It was too late for that.  Who could they go tell?  The senate and courts which were in his pocket?  The Jedi Order which no longer existed?  The clone army which was loyal to him?  It made no sense to execute all his allies if they had only been following his orders, especially when they had knowledge of all the CIS's books.  It'd be better to send them to a gulag where he could keep an eye on them and still have access to that knowledge if he were that paranoid...unless.  Unless, he found they had actually been undermining him since Geonosis and very nearly handed over his victory to an apprentice he had seriously underestimated.  For making a fool of him, they would have to be punished for their insolence and all die in the most terrifying, visceral way possible by watching Vader work his way down the line butchering each one of them in turn.Mace Windu literally comes right out and says that the dark side was clouding their minds, and limiting what they could do. Palpatine was one of the most powerful force wielders to ever live, who had a specific motive to wipe out the Jedi, so it seems reasonable he'd figure out a way to limit them. They specifically state that he blocked their ability to make prophecies, so we know he can do it. However, that would likely take a lot of effort, and after Order 66, when he'd already been revealed, he likely dropped that limitation, allowing the remaining Jedi to be vastly more powerful.

Granted, we don't see many Jedi, but let's take a look at those we do see:

* Cal Kestis had only been a padawan before Order 66. After years of not training, and starting from nothing in the Force, he manages to become an incredible Jedi knight, seemingly on par with some of the main heroes from the *Clone Wars* TV show. He kills easily around a thousand stormtroopers, including a number of elite purge troopers, hijacks an AT-AT to destroy Imperial defenses, takes down three or four AT-STs, and beats two separate Inquisitors.
* Ahsoka was a skilled padawan in *the Clone Wars*, and is roughly around the skill level of a Jedi knight by the end of the show. In her own spinoff book, she then manages to take down an Inquisitor *while unarmed*. By Rebels, she's shown to be an incredibly powerful force wielder, able to go toe to toe with Vader, and injure him. She came close beating him throughout the fight. For reference, Cal Kestis, for all his power and body count could only run when fighting Vader, and stood no chance. Compared to the last Sith she fought, Maul, who beat her in a duel (but lost because he kept trying to flee and ignored her), Ahsoka did far better against an even more powerful opponent
* Kanan Jarrus was also only on the level of padawan. Despite that, he managed to become extremely powerful, becoming knighted, and showing force abilities and dueling skills equivalent to a Jedi master. He manages to singlehandedly hold back an explosion at the end of his life.

It’s pretty clear that there was a massive power surge for Jedi, as they were able to be more in tune with the force due to Palpatine’s influence being lifted.No one could pull off half the random crap Joker does unassisted. All the near deaths, convoluted plots and inevitable escape attempts... impossible without some other force at work. But really, it's his name that gives it away. He's got a power any comedian, class clown or joker would kill for.

He has a supernaturally good sense of timing. 

*That's* why all his schemes can work and why the only times he gets caught are when he can safely get away later. Because even if he's unaware that he's doing it, he's always in the right place at the right time.

Edit: Joker probably isn't aware he even has this power, but it's part of the reason he never gets over his insanity. Because everything always works out for him, he's never confronted with facing reality aside from the chaos he creates. Except... for... the Batman. Maybe he's immune or maybe he's just so organized he can cut through the chaos, but for whatever reason Batman's the only one who can overcome this subtle power. Joker may be aware of this subconsciously or just pick up that things go wrong whenever Batman's around, but he knows he NEEDS to kill him.

Edit 2: Maybe the Joker doesn't need to KILL Batman, but I think he does want some kind of final conflict where two enter and one leaves. Whether Joker hopes HE'LL die in the conflict or just prove that his reality is the correct one depends on which Joker you're talking about, I think.  

**TL;DR: Thanos manipulated Loki, giving him the mind stone, to get to Nidavellir.** 

**Thanos orchestrated the further corruption of Loki and the New York attack to divide and distract the  Asgardians. With the Asgardian royalty destabilized and fighting among themselves, he could attack the unprotected forge of Nidavellir, the only place capable of forging a device strong enough to hold the  Infinity stones.**  

In *Avengers (2012),* Thanos loans Loki the scepter with the Mind Stone so Loki can take over earth, and in return, Loki promises to bring Thanos the Tesseract. This seems like a simple 2-for-1 deal… except, Thanos doesn’t need Loki to collect the Space Stone; he has his own army and could seemingly send to do the work himself, unless he had other, more grandeur plans. 

**The Theory:**

Thanos specifically sought Loki to launch the attack on earth. The Mad Titan wasn’t aiming for the 2-for-1 Mind/Space stone deal he pitched to Loki, he was secretly plotting to create a rift in the Asgardian royal family. Thanos’ ultimate goal was to invade Nidavellir and force Eitri to make the Infinity Gauntlet, but he can’t subjugate the forge while it still has a defense pact with Asgard.

>“You were supposed to protect us, Asgard was supposed to protect us” - Eitri to Thor (Infinity War, 2018)

**How it Works:**

Thanos locates the recently ostracized prince of Asgard and tempts him with a conquest that defies Odin’s will, and pits Loki against his brother Thor. Thanos knows the risk that he’ll lose the mind stone, but he doesn’t care, the stones are of little use to him until he has the Gauntlet that allows him to wield their full power. 

>"Nidavellir is real? Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the universe. I would very much like to go there, please." - Rocket to Thor (Infinity War, 2018)

If Rocket knows about Nidavellir, then it’s almost certain the Mad Titan knows of the forge and what the dwarves can create for him. He’s going to need the most powerful containment weapon ever constructed to wield the stones. 

And the only thing preventing access to the forge is the mighty Asgardian army. Knowing Asgard will likely defeat his army, Thanos’ opts to play the long game and manipulate Loki into destabilizing the Asgardian royal family. His plan works, the rift between Loki, his brother, and his father grows and the Ragnarok destruction prophecy begins.I think we've all seen the comparisons:elastigirl was objectively thiccer in incredibles 2. Here's why:

Incredibles 1, which happened a week prior to 2, Elastigirl was worried about Bob cheating on her, which was evident in her behavior. What does she do when she gets her husband back?  She makes herself thiccer to make sure Bob isn't going anywhere.**TL;DR: Each episode or pair of episodes will be about the stage of grief. The first two episodes are being about denial. In episodes 1 and 2 denies the outside world and even fix and rewinds parts of her own fantasies to help deny the truth that Vision is dead. I think that Dr. strange is actively trying to lead her through the five stages of grief because of how dangerous her subconscious has become. Though she is unconscious and unaware, her grief creates real-world consequences, fracturing reality and opening up** ***the Multiverse of Madness.*** **The Beekeeper is trying to do the exact opposite. He is trying to throw her deeper into depression and grief, causing more destruction in the real world.**

Wanda is crazy powerful. She might even be the most powerful of the Avengers. She can warp reality and even has the power to rip the universe’s fabric, opening up portals to the multiverse.

**The theory.**

Wanda is unconscious and has created a safe, warped reality to deny the real-world reality that Vison is dead. Her mind is locked in this reality, but outside of her safe reality, her powers are warping reality and ripping open pathways to other universes in the real world.

This is where Dr. Strange comes in. He enters into her world, sometimes posing as Vison, sometimes manipulating events to lead Wanda through the five stages of grief before she destroys the world.  He, as a former doctor, would be familiar with grief and the stages. The shows’ version of  Vision is a fabrication. He is a figment of her fractured mind, but Dr. Strange” pops” in to try to jar Wanda just enough to come back from her false reality before it is too late. Strange could be working in conjunction with SWORD to wake up Wanda before SWORD  tries more drastic measures.

Dr. Strange is perhaps the only one that has the power to access her in this state. He is trying to slowly break her out of her reality by planting little things such as the boss choking, the colors, and other things that don’t fit with the safe manufactured reality that Wanda is trying to maintain. She is still denying the outside world and quickly fixes, erases, or just straight up rewinds things that do not fit with her world.

But Strange is playing a dangerous game; if Wanda catches on, she may become so unstable that she could rip the universe in two.

But other threats are trying to access her mind as well, others that want her to rip open the multiverse and destroy the world, others such as Mephisto. Dr. Strange has to work fast, not only to help her move on but to save the world from others that wish to exploit her pain

The beekeeper is trying to do the exact opposite from Strange, and he is trying to throw Wanda into more chaos, thus causing more destruction in the real world. The Beekeeper is someone who has everything to gain from a broken world.

This will, of course, lead to the multiverse of madness where Strange and Wanda will have to put all the pieces of the universe back together.In Ant-Man and the Wasp we are left with Scott Lang stuck in the quantum realm with seemingly no way out. However, according to the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, it is clear that he returns to the real world and meets up with the Avengers at some point. No one is sure exactly how this will transpire, although it most likely involves some sort of portal.  Janet van Dyne hints at a "time vortex" in the post credit scene, but regardless it is fair to classify this mode of transport as a portal.

&#x200B;

We have seen an important portal in the MCU before. In Thor: Ragnarok we witness Bruce Banner, Loki, Thor, and Valkyrie escape Sakar through a wormhole/portal known as the "Devil's Anus." 

&#x200B;

I posit that when Scott Lang informs the Avengers of how he escapes the quantum realm via portal, Thor will be inspired by the Devil's Anus and nickname the quantum realm portal "Thanos's Asshole." This is where a certain theory that Ant-Man will defeat Thanos by shrinking and expanding through his asshole might actually manifest itself. Ant-Man is extremely tiny in the quantum realm and he will definitely need to expand to normal size when he travels back to the real world. The portal he expands through will be named "Thanos' Asshole," thus Ant-Man effectively expands through "Thanos' Asshole" in order to stop him. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;In the finale of *The Office*, Dwight fires Kevin due to his years of incompetence as an accountant. When the rest of the office tries to fight this, their only defense is that Toby will not allow this to happen... only for Dwight to reveal that he is also firing Toby.

Dwight firing Toby is somewhat significant due to how easily he is able to achieve this. For the first seven years of the series, we watched Michael try and fail to get rid of Toby. He's unable to do this because Toby is technically an employee of corporate, who will not allow Toby to be fired without cause. ("It's be*cause* I hate him!")

However, the finale takes place after the airing of the documentary. This means that nearly a decade of workplace ethic violations were revealed to corporate and the general public for the first time. Nearly every act of harassment, racism, violence, and general misconduct that the Dunder-Mifflin Scranton branch ever experienced is neatly documented whether these events were recorded by Toby or not (and we know he probably didn't record all of them, due to him not reporting many of Dwight's complaints against Jim at the end of Season 2).

David Wallace clearly did not like the content he saw in the documentary (At the talk-back, he says "It’s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It’s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn’t wanna know any of it"). He also probably has something of a PR nightmare on his hands due to how much the Scranton branch was able to get away with for so long.

It would make a lot of sense for Dunder-Mifflin to use Toby as the scapegoat for all of the documentary's controversies. These events almost always fall under HR, and the fact that Toby allowed it all to happen for so long doesn't look good for him (he's even the cause of many of these issues). Besides, corporate can't lay-off the entire staff, as they're presumably still the company's most successful branch.

It's also very possible that Toby as a person is a cause of a lot of controversy due to Michael portraying him as a villain. Just like Joe Exotic's years of war against Carole Baskin are now putting the latter in a negative light around the world, it's very possible that Toby has a similar degree of negative notoriety. Evidence of this may include just how *sad* Toby is in the finale. He makes it very clear that life has not worked out for him since the airing of the footage. Unfortunately for him, that's also not a great look to have for your company. 

So in the end, Dwight probably didn't fire Toby. It was very likely David Wallace trying to salvage Dunder-Mifflin's image after the release of the documentary.In the 12th episode of the 6th season (Homer the Great), we're introduced to the secret organization The Stone-Cutters. Which I think most of us would agree is one of the best Simpsons episodes ever.

We learn that one can become a Stone-Cutter if they are the son of a Stone-Cutter or they save the life of a Stone-Cutter. In the episode Blood Fued from the 2nd season, Bart donates blood in order to save Mr. Burns' life and we see that Mr. Burns is a part of the Stone-Cutters, therefore making Bart eligible.

Anyhow, when Homer begins noticing Lenny and Carl getting special treatment at work, he becomes very curious as to what's going on. He explains to the family at dinner that he feels as though there's a conspiracy going on. To which Bart states something along the lines of "Yeah, a conspiracy. Do you think maybe Lenny and Carl were involved in the Kennedy assassination?" What's interesting about his statement isn't his sarcasm, which Bart is known for, but it's worth noting that when he says the word conspiracy he gives Homer a wink possibly implying a subtle attempt to throw Homer off the trail of discovering the secret.

Later on in the episode after Homer is found out to be the Chosen One, he's sitting at home having a philosophical debate with Lisa about divine power. When Homer says "Take the girl away!", Bart immediately grabs Lisa and takes her away. He even gives Homer a sort of bow after doing so.

Another piece of supporting evidence is how Bart is constantly getting in trouble with his teachers however he rarely receives further or severe punishment from Principal Skinner whom we see is a Stone-Cutter himself.

Some people may ask "Why wasn't he at the meetings then?" Well we see that Homer was given the number (I believe) 908 when he was initiated. Considering Moe mentions to Homer there's hundreds of Stone-Cutter chapters across the world, it makes sense that *each* chapter has their own sets of member numbers. It's obvious from the "dinner song" scene that there's barely 100 people at the table possibly meaning that it's not a requirement for a member to be at every meeting.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/Tigris_Cyrodillus it was pointed out that when Grandpa Abe claims that he may be a Stone-Cutter (which it turns out he is and is why Homer was able to join...), Bart curiously tells everyone at the table they should listen to him.

Lastly, consider that The Stone-Cutters are a secret organization that values greed, power, and privilege. Definitely an enticing group for someone like Bart to be a part of.

All things considered, I feel as if the evidence is strong that Bart is a Stone-Cutter and was one before Homer. 

I know this theory is a bit of a stretch, but frankly I felt as though this subreddit has been saturated lately with Star Wars theories. Thanks for reading!We first learned in the episode *The Storm* that Zuko was banished because he spoke out of turn in a war meeting and then refused to duel his father Ozai. By showing weakness, Zuko was forever banished unless he could capture the Avatar (which was basically considered impossible). But, doesn’t that seem more than a little extreme, banishing the crown prince for speaking out of turn and not dueling his own father? After rewatching the episode *Zuko Alone* on Netflix, I’ve come to the conclusion that the real reason Ozai banished Zuko was so that Azula could take his place as heir to the throne.

We see in Zuko’s flashbacks that while Ursa favored Zuko, Ozai and Azulon both favored Azula and even seemed embarrassed by Zuko. When Ozai asked Azulon to revoke Iroh’s birthright, Azulon decided to punish him by demanding that he kill Zuko. Well, that’s an insanely ridiculous punishment, why would Azulon have Zuko killed for something that Ozai said? Because with the death of Lu Ten, Azulon also wanted Azula to be the heir to the throne after Iroh.

Zuko was *always* going to be killed or banished for doing *anything* wrong, because both Azulon and Ozai wanted Azula to take his place. Ozai went into the Agni Kai against Zuko intent on killing him if he fought back, or banishing him if he did not. Would Ozai have treated Azula the same way if she spoke out of turn? No, absolutely not. He probably would have just said “Azula, silence yourself!” as he said to her in Book 3, or maybe he would have even sided with her against the general. If Zuko were an only child or born after Azula, I really don’t think that he would have been banished.

But, what if Zuko never did anything wrong, what if he was the perfect prince who never gave Ozai any reason to banish him? Well, consider what Azula says to Zuko during Sozin’s Comet: “Let’s settle this, just you and me brother, the showdown that was always meant to be: Agni Kai!” *The showdown that was always meant to be?* If Zuko weren’t banished, Ozai intended to orchestrate an Agni Kai between Zuko and Azula, and Azula was being prepared for this.

Zuko was never truly the crown prince (except for when Ozai believed that he killed the Avatar), it was always going to be Azula in Ozai’s mind. As an added bonus, banishing Zuko also took Iroh out of the picture, removing the only other claim to the throne. It was never really about honor or respect, it was always about power.First off, no, I am not saying this is the whole or even main reason for going to the Multiverse, but at the very least it is a huge proponent for it.  Remember that Marvel is a business, and their job over anything else is making money.   Now, making great content is the biggest piece of that, but now they can use this enormous fan base to really cash in. 

The Multiverse allows Marvel to tell any story they want with no consequences.  Don't like this story?  Purge it.  Does this film screw up continuity in a huge way for something they want to write later?  Say it is another universe.  Want to tell a story from the past that would screw with current continuity?  It is from a different reality.

A wildly popular character suffers a death at the beginning of a Blockbuster movie and wants to bring him back?  Bring him from another universe.  Want to make him a different actor?  He is a variant.  Want to make him the opposite gender?  Variant.  Actor wants too much money or unfortunately passes away unexpectedly?  Variant

This also allows Marvel not to be concerned with film rights with Fox, Sony etc.  They can give or take characters, stories, villains, when and how they please.  When Marvel loses the license, they can just say anything that happened was another universe(Spiderman).  They can also bring past characters (X-Men) and use the excuse that they came from another Universe rather than they were just created, or they have been there all along.

This is INSANELY beneficial to Marvel on the business end from the reasons you can see.  Multiple variants allows them to exponentially sell more merchandise.  It allows them to have an actual negotiating chip against any hero (or villain) that gets too big without necessarily killing them off.  This alone will save them 10's of millions on contracts.  

The last piece that solidifies this is that Feige stated they are no longer doing multi-film deals with actors.  Multi-film deals in a successful franchise are a huge way for studios to lock in talent for a lesser price than what they would have to pay them film after film.  The only way a studio would forgo that is if they had an even bigger negotiating chip.  That chip for Marvel is the Multiverse.  Every actor is expendable.Short one today folks, but I've always thought to myself when Vader says to Luke "you don't know the power of the dark side" that it definitely comes off as a sort of "you don't know what you're missing" type thing, but to me I've always seen it as "you don't know how much power it has over me" he's trying to tell his son that he's too far gone, and there's just no going back for himLet's do some simple math: Charles Dickens' *A Christmas Carol* was published in 1843. Ebenezer Scrooge, a "squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!" is depicted as an elderly gray-haired man in every official illustration and every adaptation of the book. And in the course of the story, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows him a vision of his own death exactly one year after the events of the story (presumably from old age). If you assume that Scrooge is around 60 years old when the story takes place, that would place his birth year around 1783.

That would make Scrooge exactly 20 years old in 1803—which you might recognize as the year that Britain declared war on France, kicking off the Napoleonic Wars that lasted over a decade afterwards. Even more importantly, it would make him around 23 when Napoleon enacted the Berlin Decree and set his Continental System in motion.

Why is that so important to understanding Scrooge? Well...

In 1806, Britain was the last major power in Western Europe that hadn't either allied with Napoleon or been conquered by his armies. With the Berlin Decree, Napoleon successfully enacted a trade embargo against Britain to cut it off from trading with the continent, hoping to weaken the country so that he could add it to his Empire. When Thomas Jefferson also enacted his controversial trade embargo against both Britain and France the following year (leading to the War of 1812), Britain's list of trading partners got even shorter. The result was nearly a decade of severe economic hardship, which left thousands of people in desperate poverty.

When you consider that Scrooge was in his early 20's when all this was going on, and likely *just* striking out on his own and trying to make money, you can understand why he might have grown up into a surly old miser with a chip on his shoulder.

If *you* had seen thousands of your countrymen starving on the streets while a war with a mad dictator raged across a narrow Channel, wouldn't *you* be a little bit afraid of winding up on the streets too? Wouldn't *you* probably spend a lot of time scrimping and saving, always making sure you had enough to feed yourself? Years later, wouldn't *you* probably get a little bit upset at seeing your young nieces and nephews taking their money for granted, heedlessly spending it all on gifts and food every December 25th?

If you stretch the theory even farther, you could even argue that that's why Scrooge had to end his relationship with his fiancée Belle, and why he ended up childless. Considering his country's dire economic straits, he was probably a bit hesitant about having children, knowing that he and Belle might not have been able to feed and clothe them. If Belle really *did* want to have children, that could have driven a wedge between the two of them, ultimately leading to their separation. It would also put his cynical comment about impoverished families in a rather different light:

*"If they would rather die [than wind up in the prisons and workhouses], they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population!"*

Scrooge was afraid of having children because he might have had to send them to a Union workhouse or a debtor's prison. He still feels that fear, and he's managed to convince himself that his children are better off never born than in severe poverty. He's bitter about that abominable "surplus population" because he believes that there are enough hungry mouths in the world without adding a few of his own offspring to the load.

Scrooge is stingy with his money for the same reason that millions of Americans who lived through the Great Depression are stingy with their money: he's experienced true hardship, and he never really shook the lingering feeling that hard times are always just around the corner.

His encounter with the Three Ghosts didn't just teach him that there are more important things than wealth; it also taught him that hard times—like the times he grew up in—are even harder when people don't take the time to care for each other and spare a day for cheer and merriment.

**TL;DR**: Scrooge is old enough to have lived through Napoleon's decade-long embargo against Britain, so he probably holds onto his money because he knows what economic hardship is really like.When Ross is in the coffee shop meeting Rachel, his umbrella opens up unexpectedly, inside; this begins a 7 year bad luck streak with Rachel. Once the curse is lifted, Rachel tells Ross that he's going to be a father.

Season 1: September 22, 1994 (Pilot)
Season 8: September 27, 2001 (Pregnancy Announcement)So posting this after watching the new footage and I came up with a theory that explains why we really know so little about Snoke and Rey’s past, and will find out in a TROS.

The reason Palpatine is reappearing is because the Death of Snoke. What if Palpatine’s contingency plan if he ever died consisted of  secret apprentice or force sensitive underling (Snoke, unknown alien race, who was extremely wealthy) in the Unknown Regions financing a cloning operation for different force sensitive bodies for Palpatines spirit to posses, and also to mantain a fleet ( hence the OG star destroyers in the new trailer, and confirmed Sith Troopers) But Snoke wanting more power and to fill the void of no Emperor, comes from hiding in the Unknown Regions and creates the First Order using  improved Imperial technology (which is why after many years have passed since the OG trilogy the First Order looks essentially like the Empire and even had a bigger Death Star with Starkiller base . The whole time since Palps death, Snoke was somehow suppressing Palpatine from possessing a clone, and once Kylo killed Snoke, Palps spirit was free to possess. Rey comes into this as she was one of those clones and somehow she was freed and sent to Jakku which is why she has no memory of her past and in TLJ when shown her “parents” she just saw hundreds of versions of herself. And the Dark Side Rey we saw in the trailer is just another Rey clone possessed by Palps. 

I’m honestly really high right now, so if this has been posted before or doesn’t make sense, feel free to downvote. But if it turns out to be true then TROS will be able to open the mystery boxes Jar Jar Abrams promised in TFA and would make for a satisfying tie in for three trilogies. I have a personal fan theory that at some point in the bear past there was a world wide out break of cholera. Like half the bear population died from extreme diarrhea, so they became obsessed with cleanliness as a culture. Learning to properly wipe is a rite of passage and something to be celebrated. Since some bears wear pants and some don't I think that lack of pants is a status symbol. If you are so clean that you are able to walk around naked, then you hold a very high position in society. If you look at the commercials the red bears house is huge. They are rich and educated, so they have to be seen as being as clean as possible.In the 1D song What Makes You Beautiful, there is a line that says;
“You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful”

So by not knowing they’re beautiful they become beautiful, but once they hear the song they will know and become not beautiful, but then there is nothing to know and they become beautiful again, and the cycle continues.In the end of Avengers: Endgame we see Steve go back in time to live out his life with Peggy, but we can assume he lays low as to not interfere with the future. But surely he would want to check and see how things were? And which old man has been in the background of every Marvel movie ever made, keeping to himself? Stan Lee. It may not have been from the beginning, but somewhere along the way Marvel planned to have Captain America go back in time for his happy ending and be played by Stan Lee in all of the movies, finally revealing himself in Endgame. Unfortunately, we lost Stan Lee last year, and the directors didn’t want to dishonor his legacy with a CGI clone playing such an important scene so they had Chris Evans play the role as old Cap instead. 

Steve went back in time with 6 infinity stones, Mjolnir, and Pym Particles, so he could easily be in all of the off world locations Stan Lee was, like Sakaar.

One problem with this theory is that, as Professor Hulk pointed out, time travel doesn’t work like it does in other movies. You can’t go into the past to change the future, so why would Steve have to tiptoe around the Avengers for over 11 years? This is also a problem fans have had with Steve going back in general. But, recently, the directors stated that Steve went back and lived his life in an alternate timeline before coming back to talk to Sam. (I need a source for this, however) Lets say this is true, because it follows closely to what I already believed about the Marvel Cinematic Universe actually being the alternate universe Steve went to. If Steve was in an alternate timeline because there were two hims and that automatically alters the timeline, he would want to avoid altering it any further so that the Avengers of this timeline are guaranteed the mostly happy ending they get in the Avengers got in his original timeline.

Here are some notable cameos that support this theory:

Captain America: First Avenger
This cameo would have been Steve later on wanting to visit himself in the past, perhaps for nostalgia, when he sees who he thinks is Captain America he says “I thought he’d be taller” because he thinks he’s looking at a younger him.

The Avengers
Stan’s line “Superheroes in New York? Give me a break” could be Steve ridiculing the pastel look of the Avengers now compared to their gritty incarnation in Endgame, or just a remark of how inexperienced they were then.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier
It makes sense for Steve to want to hang around his own exhibit as a guard, telling people about himself discreetly. It could have also been a job to help pay for the medical bills of an ailing Peggy Carter who we see in this movie.

Avengers: Age of Ultron
Stan appears as a World War II veteran, just like Steve.

Captain America: Civil War
“Tony Stank” is just Steve playfully jabbing at his old friend

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
Steve is telling the watchers about the great time he’s had messing with the Avengers over the years.

Avengers: Infinity War
Steve has seen plenty of spaceships in his day, really, these kids shouldn’t be shocked.

Let me know what you think or what problems this theory has!So, I'm watching Skyfall on Prime Video and I got reminded of the intro to Casino Royale. In the intro, there's a 7 card that gets two bullets fired into it, making it look like it's saying oo7, with two lower case o's.

I remember seeing this when it first came out and thinking "Oh, that's funny. It looks like two O's instead of zeros."

Well, call my brain slow, but years go by and it kind of sticks with me; what if it's supposed to be O's and not zeroes?

Language is a funny thing. We see two zeroes together and we (at least English speaking people do this) automatically default to saying "Double Oh." 

Anyways, one day recently I had enough time and I really put my brain to work on it. If it's really two O's, then what does that stand for? I love spy movies and secret agent stuff. Catch me in a good mood and I'm even learning about the real history of espionage. So, I start to think of the language involved in the spy world, real and fictional.

I know the word **OPERATIVE** is going to be one of the O's. It's another name for a spy, or an agent. In fact, it's usually the term used in the "very official" capacity when saying how many people you have in the field.

The other O was a little difficult until some shower thoughts came together. I remembered the phone booth scene from the first Mission: Impossible where Ethan Hunt tells his higher up "The list is in the open!" Obviously, the word "OPEN" meaning it's out of their hands, it's out in the world. Out in the open.

For me, **OPEN** is that second O, but that definitely needs to be justified. Look no further than the movie I just paused in order to type this all up.

Skyfall is the movie that squashes the more prevalent fan theory that "James Bond" is a cover identity adopted by various different agents, explaining away the film franchise and it's rotating main cast, namely the lead role. In Skyfall, you see Daniel Craig *is*  James Bond. His family name is Bond. 

I'm not considering that last part a spoiler, because it's not really all that plot heavy. 

Anyways, looking at all this from a logical standpoint, you gotta think how sloppy that is when it comes to "The World's Greatest Spy" just openly flaunting his real identity. I mean, you've got Mission: Impossible using masks and voice changers. Heck, you've got Michael Westen in Burn Notice taking up ump-teen different cover identities, one of which was implied to be The Devil!

Then, you've got this guy walking up and openly announcing he's "Bond. James Bond."

You have got to be the most cockiest, arrogant, ego inflated person on the planet to do something like that.

Or... That's the idea.

From here on out, this gets pretty speculative. But, please stick with me...

The facts established so far are... James Bond is his real identity... He's the world's greatest spy... He's the seventh in what's called the "Double O Program" of which it's said in Casino Royale that "Double oh's have a short life expectancy."... And none of his higher ups have any qualms with him just openly saying he is who he is or who he works for... Not only that, but he gets very little push back in all the ostentatious, overly action packed stunts he pulls off that very well could kill someone like him

So, if this "Double O Program" is really the "Open Operative Program" then what would be the point? Well, espionage is all cloak and dagger, secrets, crosses, double crosses, *triple* crosses and all that.

What if MI6 (at some point in the fictional history) said they wanted a program that really sent a message to their enemies. That they weren't even worried about operating in the open against them, within the intelligence community that is. What if they accepted only the most hardest, most suave, most dangerous people they've trained for this program? 

So, when one of these Double O's showed up, British swaggar on full display, bedding one woman after another mid-mission... The guys he's after start to rethink just how dedicated they are to this thing they're doing against Queen and Country.

A program that is so openly dangerous and deadly that only around 8 or 9 operatives have been recruited into it. 

In walks in Bond... James Bond... Open Operative #7 

OO7

EDIT: I checked the Wikipedia some time ago and nothing to this extant is even kinda hinted at, as far as the Double 0 Program goes.This is my own spin on  [u/Arc\_the\_lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/Arc_the_lad/)  's theory on Dr Strange.

So even with the Time stone in her possession, the Ancient One could not see past her own death. In the MCU continuity, there is no evidence to suggest that Doctor Strange has surpassed her skills as a wizard or as a user of the Time stone.

This clearly establishes the fact that when Strange was seeing all those possible future outcomes on Titan, he counted every possibility where he dies (not snapped, but literally dies) as a failure.

Which basically means that out of all the possible outcomes, Doctor Strange survived in 14,000,605, and out of those, there was only one in which the Avengers won.

This implies that there may have been hundreds of outcomes for the final battle, in which our heroes emerge victorious without Stark's sacrifice, but Strange couldn't envision those outcomes because he had been a casualty along the way.

So, instead of Strange being a diabolical evil mastermind, maybe he wasnt able to find a possibility where the Avengers won while he was dead. This possibility was the only one where he was alive after the end of Endgame. Maybe there was a reality where he died, but Tony survived?*James Bond* and *Mission: Impossible* are the two biggest and most lucrative spy movie franchises in the world right now, both of them are famous for featuring larger-than-life protagonists who pull off ridiculous death-defying stunts and battle comically evil villains, and both of them have their roots in 1960s pop culture; one is a movie series that's been running since 1962, and the other is a very loose continuation of a TV show that first started airing in 1966.

They're also known for being relatively light on plot, but also very self-aware of that fact. It's pretty well-known that most people only watch them for the crazy stunts and over-the-top action, which is why even movie critics are generally willing to forgive them for having rather one-note characters and somewhat clichéd stories. In short: they're a classic example of dueling franchises, and they're aimed at exactly the same target audience.

I'm old enough to remember when the third *Mission: Impossible* movie was just called *Mission: Impossible III*, with the official poster even abbreviating its title as *M:I:III*. Since then, the series has stopped putting numbers in the titles of its sequels, with the fourth movie being called *Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol*, the fifth being *Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation*, and the sixth being *Mission: Impossible: Fallout*. 

Why is that? It could be because the studio doesn't want to advertise the fact that the series has been running since the '90s, lest audiences worry that it's getting stale. It could be because their stories are almost entirely independent from each other (most people don't watch them for the stories, remember), and they don't want audiences to feel like they're missing something if they haven't seen the other movies. Or it could be because they ***really*** didn't want to call the sixth movie *Mission: Impossible 6*, since fans would inevitably abbreviate its title as "**MI6**"—which happens to be the name of the spy agency that James Bond works for.

Ever wonder why the people behind the *Fast and the Furious* franchise were perfectly alright with calling their sixth movie *Fast & Furious 6*, but the people behind *Mission: Impossible* insisted on calling their sixth movie *Mission: Impossible: Fallout*? I have a feeling that's why.As a somewhat successful comedian, Jerry is constantly on the road touring, appearing on various late night talk shows, and is more than likely out of town for weeks at a time.  His closest friends know his schedule, so when he's in town they know exactly where to find him and don't mind popping in because they haven't seen him for some time.

This explains why they all seem to have relationships with a different person each week, why they're all constantly having to catch up with each other to discuss their various personal issues, and why everyone is always going out of their way to visit Jerry at his apartment.  



Edit: It turns out [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seinfeld-theory_us_5731dd5ee4b096e9f0928724) did an article about this theory. I don't often get mentioned on any Internet publications, so this is nuts.The Jedi Order has existed for millennia. Yoda has been alive for centuries. The dark side is clouding the Force. The Jedi are scattered across the galaxy locked in an exhausting war. The *last* thing you would expect in this context is Yoda of all people discovering something he doesn't already know.

And yet that's exactly what he does in the last few episodes of The Clone Wars. Yoda goes on such an improbable quest across the galaxy, full of magic and discovery. He makes contact with Qui-Gon, visits good and evil planets, confronts dark phantoms — a whole lot happens!

Then he gets back from this journey and Dooku is killed; Grievous is killed; the Separatist leaders are fugitives; the war is visibly winding down. The last thing that needs to happen is the destruction of the Sith — and very obviously, the Force has chosen Yoda to strike the final blow. Why else would he be given a guided tour of all this revelation at the least opportune time in history, when all those Jedi failed to find it through all those centuries of peaceful meditation?

That's why when Order 66 hits, Yoda becomes the ball of energy that he's very much *not* in the original trilogy. We wondered why OT Yoda wasn't out looking for Force-sensitive kids, doing rah-rah stuff to help the Rebellion, using the Force to guide the Rebel fleets — well, this is definitely that guy. He slashes through clonetroopers, gets important Rebel Alliance figures to safety, orders assassinations. Because he's sure he's about to win! He's the one ordained by the will of the Force for this final task.

He walks into Palpatine's office, confident as a god. They fight. Palpatine wins. It's not even all that close. And Yoda realizes: it's not me.

That's why he so suddenly changes all his intentions. A few minutes ago, he was talking about destroying the Sith. Now he's talking about exile. He so completely and instantly becomes the passive Yoda of the OT. It all pivots on that moment he realizes the chosen one has actually been someone else all along.So basically when the avengers kill 2014 Thanos, that means that the timeline, or universe, where he came from no longer experiences the events of either Infinity War or Endgame. How could they? Their Thanos is dead

That is the one universe where everyone is saved. The only way for the avengers to truly win was to take Thanos out of a timeline and kill him. They were still able to restore everyone to life, but suffered losses. In the alternate universe, no one died, and Stark is still alivePosted this in offmychest but was told to post here by myself just now.

He's a monk told to hold back his emotions. He wasn't trained from birth and in a lot of the novels about his early training this made him different from the other Padawan who often reminded him of the fact.

What is the tenat of the Jedi? Hate leads to the darkside. Powerful emotion leads to it. Well he's a kid who grew up rough with a LOT of emotion and now has to put a cap on it all. He represses it, not because it is all he knows like many Jedi but because he's TOLD to. 

He's just fallen in love. He has a lot of emotion and a girl who is a clear reminder of his old life. A clear reminder of all the trauma and emotion he actively suppresses daily.

So how does he express himself? He calmly, without letting too much emotion, admits he hates something. He is a JEDI admitting he DOES hate and he DOES feel. In that moment he is admitting he is human and he isn't the emotionless monk.

"but hurr durr he says it so awkwardly"

He's a teen monk discussing the ultimate taboo. Now some people may be open with discussing their vore fetish with their parents but Anakin is OBVIOUSLY feeling pretty damn nervous and awkward about it. So what does he do? He emotionally shuts down as a defence mechanism to still "prove" to himself it's okay to hate something and still be a jedi. 


Thus proving to himself, in his own way, It's okay to love Padme and still be a Jedi.




P.S Padme totally was being built up to be Sheevs puppet and Quinlan Vos best have his ass show up sometime soon.**Edit:** To those saying Thor knew of Stormbreaker, here's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/2zFdH8F), and a [video clip](https://youtu.be/c-B5TDvZN9I?t=9). The first time Stormbreaker is mentioned, Eitri mentions it because Thor asks if it had a name in the first place. Thor only knew Nidavellir made strong weapons, and even Rocket knew that. It's also referred to as a kings weapon. While this could mean for Thor, it could also mean for Odin.

**Edit 2:** Yes, we know Beta Ray Bill does exist, but there's 0 proof he's tied to Stormbreaker. There's a chance he'll appear in Asgardians of the Galaxy (GOTG 3), in fact I'm counting on it, but nothing yet.

---

Not talking about the comics, just strictly the MCU. (So no Beta Ray Bill stans please)

Stormbreaker was a weapon forged for Thor, but not for Thor to wield per se. It was made to handle Thor. Odin knew what had happened with Hela, and the similarities to pre-Thor 1 movie Thor and Hela were quite similar. 

Vain, warmonger-ish, and conquerors. Odin saw the parallels and knew what he had to do. If Thor ever got out of hand, Odin would have the perfect tool to combat Thor. Not kill him, but break him with a weapon more powerful than Mjolnir.

An axe made to break the storm.Ok so I don't really have much proof to this but it's just a theory I've had for a while now. Ted does a lot of crappy things during the run of the show that and something I think is important is that Ted is the one telling the story to his kids. We only ever hear one perspective on the whole thing.  

Why would you tell your own children (especially your daughter) that someone they've called "Uncle Barney" their whole lives repeatedly lies to women in an attempt to sleep with them? I mean a lot of Barneys antics border on rape and I feel if I heard my dad bragging about my uncle pulling this shit I would cut contact with him. And I feel a lot of episodes where Teds doing something bad he immediately swaps to a story about Barney doing something worse which makes me feel like he was trying to make himself look better.

Also lets remember that we see the other members of the gang talking about really private shit that they shouldn't know but do anyway like intimate details about their sex lives that they definitely would not have told Ted yet he's the one telling the story.

anyway just thought id share. thoughts?

EDIT: apparently according to a lot of people in this thread, this is a pretty popular fan theory amongst fans of the show. I had no idea about that I’m just currently binge watching the show and thought about itWhen I watched Infinity War the first time, that scene bothered me. Loki just watched Thanos absolutely body Thor and Hulk, and yet he thinks he can just stab Thanos in the throat and kill him? It's absurd, and Loki's supposed to be a fairly smart, conniving character. He's capable of thorough illusions, and teleportation magic per Thor: Ragnarok. There's no reason to do such a stupid and useless assassination scheme. Even if Loki does kill Thanos, Thanos' Children will just immediately kill him and Thor, and even reformed Loki's still only really concerned about his family, not the wider galaxy as a whole.

But Loki's worked with Thanos before. He'd know about Thanos' rule of killing half the population. Loki might be reasoning that if he forces Thanos to kill him, Thanos would feel obligated to leave the only other royal Asgardian alive.Of course, this whole thing is a spoiler for Season 3 of Avatar: the Last Airbender.  In the beginning, the Fire Nation was repeatedly attacking the Southern Water Tribe to capture Waterbenders, and possibly the next avatar (but that's someone else's post).  Only capture, and imprison.  The last raid, Kya's killer said they weren't doing that anymore.  What happened to change that policy?  Hama.

The last Waterbender that they captured.  During her brutal imprisonment, she created bloodbending, like Toph created metalbending  during her own imprisonment, funny that.  And like Toph, Hama used her creation to escape in spectacular fashion.

I'm thinking that The Fire Nation has learned from this defeat, much like the defeat they learned from in  "The Northern Air Temple."  No more capturing Waterbenders, they're too scary.  Better to just kill them.I have a theory about the MCU Uncle Ben. So far obviously we haven't seen him we've only gotten subtle remarks about him but I think there's a way Peter always carries Ben with him, through his movie references. My theory is that Uncle Ben was a film nut and he loved sharing his favorite movies with Peter.. All the references Peter has used so far are all from "really old movies" that would've come out when Uncle Ben was around 20 based on Aunt May's age. Sure Peter could've seen all those movies on his own especially Star Wars but I've met kids from his generation that have never seen Wizard of Oz or Back to the Future let alone Aliens or Ferris Bueller. So all these movies made an impact on a young Uncle Ben (some of which he may have even seen in the theater with Peter's father) so he showed them to Peter and Peter loved most of them, but not all of them judging by his remarks on Footloose. I think this is also why Homecoming begins with "A Film by Peter Parker" he filmed it knowing he couldn't show it to anyone so I think he was making it for Ben. Peter found himself right in the middle of the kind of movie Uncle Ben would've loved so he just had to film it.
I can't prove this theory and it really doesn't change anything major. It's just something I like to believe because to me it brings more depth to the new Spider-Man and adds an emotional element to some of his quips.Anton Ego wasn't unreasonably harsh or just didn't like Gusteau's food. Gusteau's food had dropped in quality a few years before his death. And it wasn't Anton Ego alone that caused the star to be lost, Ego was simply the final nail in the coffin. He's the voice that confirmed everyone's past suspicions which convinced the culinary community to remove the star.

&#x200B;

So. The main clue that Ego was served frozen food was in his own review. Where he said,

> "Gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history right alongside another equally famous chef, Monsieur Boyardee."  
>  
>Anton Ego

Citation: [Ego's quote source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef91za0liTM&lc=UgySZ2kQQzOOkFrVphR4AaABAg.8xNH-ui4gLH9KQrMezb5DJ)

Boyardee is an American company selling canned pasta. Ego was comparing Gusteau to a canned spaghetti and I suspect that comparison was literal. The food Gusteau served was in fact frozen garbage.

&#x200B;

In the movie, we see that chef Skinner was branding Gusteau for frozen foods from burritos to Chinese foods. And had ideas for corn puppies. It does appear that frozen food is completely Skinner's idea and doing. But I do suspect it started when Gusteau was still alive.

A deleted scene that was scratched had Skinner talking to a living Gusteau about the sales of their frozen food products. They discussed that the microwave burritos were the only thing keeping the restaurant open. 

Citation: [Microwave burritos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjDa1Yg4NI&t=244s)

&#x200B;

So the gist is that the restaurant and the cookbooks just aren't enough to keep the business running.  So they began selling frozen foods in supermarkets in order to make up for the loss. I suspect that the shortcuts slipped into the main restaurant as well. Buying frozen vegetables instead of fresh to cut costs, and buying cheaper meats. Maybe even sneaking in the supermarket products into the restaurant.

So the frozen ingredients caused the quality of the food to drop. So fewer people started to come. That ruined profits so even more ingredients become frozen to save money. So a controversy happened. Many reviewers and regular costumers saying that the food is no longer good. But Gusteau (in denial) denied such critiques. Stating that his food was still the best.

Ego came along and ordered something normal. And he was served something he'll buy at the grocery store. That offended Ego a lot since he expected a minimum quality and Gusteau surprised him with how bad the food quality was. The review was brutal, but Gusteau's broken heart wasn't from Ego's review. It was the fact that Ego was right. He was more heartbroken with himself for no longer being the great chef he once was.

&#x200B;

But when Gusteau died, that filled up the news story. Everyone kind of forgot how bad his food was and only really remembered is legacy. The drama still forced Skinner to use fresh ingredients in the main restaurant however as critiques and customers would be extra suspicious of food quality. However, Skinner doubled down on the supermarket foods.So, I recently watched Spider-Man Homecoming for the third time, and I started noticing some things:

* At the beginning when Happy asks Peter if this is the first time he's been on a private jet, Peter responds "this is the first time I've been on ANY plane\*\*.\*\*"
* Peter's first interaction with the Vulture is when the latter catches the former by surprise and dragging him up through the air, which terrifies Peter immensely.
* At D.C., when trying to save his classmates, Peter stops cold once he's at the top of the Washington Monument. When Karen asks why, Peter says "I've never been this high before," implying this version of Spider-Man has a fear of heights.
* The climax of the movie involves Spider-Man both clawing his way out of demolished building debris caused by an enemy aeriel combatant as well as stopping a plane from crashing into the New York skyline.
* MCU movies post Avengers 1 tend to take place in the year they are released. While Homecoming's "8 years" line threw a wrench in things, Infinity War confirmed that the time span between Avengers 1 and Avengers 3 has been 6 years, 2012-2018.
* Homecoming confirms that Spider-Man is 15 years old.
* If Civil War takes place in it's release year, 2016,  Homecoming takes place *two months after Civil War*, and Peter is *15 years old*, that means **Peter Parker was born in** ***2001.***

My theory is that shortly after Peter Parker was born, his parents died during 9/11. Once he got old enough, Uncle Ben told him about the event, which caused Peter to develop a fear of heights that did not go away when he first became Spider-Man.

&#x200B;

**EDIT, October 15th, 2018:** So, people have been kind to tell me that not only do the Homecoming screenwriters confirm that Spider-Man has a fear of heights:

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-homecoming-vulture-twist-behind-michael-keatons-best-scene-1019557](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-homecoming-vulture-twist-behind-michael-keatons-best-scene-1019557)

But also that there exists a thread on reddit that shows that Peter Parker was in fact born in August 2001:

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/965650/today\_is\_peter\_parkers\_18th\_birthday/?utm\_source=reddit-android](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/965650/today_is_peter_parkers_18th_birthday/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I've also come around to the idea that, since the DOB is so close to the 9/11 tragedy, it's more likely that Peter's parents were first responders rather than casualties. It actually fits a little better, because that let's Peter know his parents as his parents before they die of something like lung cancer and he has to move in with Ben and May.Some people think that its pandering or DC giving the joker plot armor. But it makes sense from an ideological sense. 


The joker thrives on organized chaos and individuality. Hes tier 1 when it comes to freedom of expression. And he doesnt believe in big government at all. Believing that everyone should be completley free from dogma. 

Nazis on the other hand believe everyone should bend to their will. Peoples only goal in life is the betterment of the reich. It is the antithesis of the joker beliefs as Nazis believe that a fuer should rule unquestioned. Something the joker hates. 

So it makes perfect sense in the crossover that the Joker snapped on red skull.Have you always wondered why in Metal Gear guards are so willing to accept a cardboard box in a nuclear warhead hanger as commonplace?
Or why Assassin's Creed guards are so completely obvlivious to the white robed man walking through the streets? 
Hitman guards accept sushi chefs as 7 ft albino bald men?

The thing is, they know exactly what's going on. And they know your penchant for violence. They know if they just assault Solid Snake or Ezio outright they'll end up with a broken neck. They're also well aware they've got minimal training and low quality gear while you've probably got the finest armor and weapons money can buy.
They've seen what you've done to their friends and they're scared shitless. So they'll walk around, whistling, blissfully pretending they don't see you. They put on a little charade for both you and their comrades. As long as you think you're not being seen by them you'll probably not engage them, right? 

Cardboard box? Nah, I didn't see that. White hooded guy? Could be anyone. Their life is worth far more than this job is. They could give less of a darn if you assassinate the political leader or save the nukes or whatever, they're not as motivated as the big bad is, remember, these are just grunts working for a paycheck who presumably have a family at the end of this and would really prefer if you didn't slice them in two. 
It's only when you openly are assaulting them that they have to buck up and fight, cause it's a little hard to maintain deniability when you're shooting at them. Here is the scene I am referring to:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuPGKLJXe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuPGKLJXe8) (The little green fish, aka Blenny, appears at 1:30).

At first glance it seems like he is shaking because his is scared. But what if his shaking is actually the result of withdrawal from his fish eating addiction.

At the end of Finding Nemo there is an end credits scene that shows the little green fish from the meeting eating the anglerfish (skip to 0:35 - sorry about the quality): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tET5jF8mViM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tET5jF8mViM)

From this clip we know that he is a fish eater. We don't know how he and the Hammerhead shark met but it is possible that he came along to the meeting because he wanted to manage his addiction to eating fish.

For the few seconds he is on screen during the meeting we see him make a couple of glances towards Marlin and Dory. He even gives them one last glance  before he chooses to leave quickly.

Furthermore, if he was brought there by force by the hammerhead why doesn't he look up at him before he runs off to check that he isn't watching him. He just swims away and none of the sharks seem to care. (Possibly because he is a regular at their meetings). In fact he doesn't seem to pay much attention to the sharks at all, almost as if he is distracted by something else.

Lastly, in the end credits scene we seem him wondering through the dark trench. The same one Marlin and Dory went into. My guess is that he was unable to control his addiction and followed them into the trench to eat them but got lost in the darkness and could not find them. Instead he found and ate the anglerfish. Think about it, if his shaking was due to fear then why on earth would he go down into the dark trench?This is a fantheories subreddit. If someone posts a theory, that seems fine on the surface, but actually uses false evidence, lack there of evidence, or fake sources, obviously, someone is gonna speak up and say "Hey this ain't it because..."(or something along those lines)

If this person proves that theory wrong(using proof, presumably). Don't say "let people have their fun" 

Wh-
I mean, I sorta get it if it's something really minor, like something that won't affect the plot of the show/movie/book/game etc. But if it's something like "Character A is actually character B's father!" Don't say "let people have their fun" when someone tries to disprove it. It's basically saying "let them spread misinformation without knowing it"

If anyone comments "let people have their fun on this" I will fight youAfter Rick turned himself in to the Galactic Federation, Jerry was able to get a job, and judging by his [fancy uniform and chest of medals](https://i.redd.it/6cnsg4gegx931.jpg), he had a high rank. 

We don't see much of life under the Galactic Federation, but from what we did see, it was very repressive. Given Jerry's background in marketing, perhaps he made the [propaganda videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5l-zW-F65o&feature=youtu.be) on the Federation's website? 

After the Federation were cast out of earth, we're not sure how the planet recovered. Even if there wasn't a Nuremberg moment, it's safe to assume the collaborators were ostracized, and that includes Jerry. Most people would probably be slow to hire someone who gleefully cooperated with alien invaders. That's why Jerry can't find a job.In the final episode of Always Sunny, the bar will have to close and Frank will take a picture of Mac, Dennis and Dee for old time's sake. Once the picture is shown, it is finally clear that all three of them look completely different from what we see as an audience. Mac has tiny arms, Dennis is not nearly as handsome as he thinks he is, and Dee still has severe back issues.

The story is primarily told by those three characters, and every event is centered within their group. Charlie and Frank are completely okay with their weird selves and so we see them as they are, but the other three look like attractive TV stars, though they're treated exactly the same as Frank and Charlie. Though they look like TV stars to the audience of the story they are telling, they are treated like mutants by the world around them.

It always seemed strange that Mac had big arms and yet could never do Karate or intimidation when he tried. Though Dennis seems to be a good-looking guy, he still has to use a very elaborate and twisted system to get women to sleep with him. Dee only dates potentially mentally challenged rappers or a very slow veteran who prefers jean-shorts. "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" is a show about the inner delusions of Mac, Dennis, and Dee and how they struggle to understand why they are not socially accepted the way they expect to be.When walking around Cloud City, [C-3PO encounters another protocol droid and is immediately offended by it](https://youtu.be/FWoG9tKf1lA). This is extremely unusual: protocol droids should be excellent at being polite to everyone they meet in over 6 million forms of communication.^1 How does the rudeness make any sense?

It makes sense if the other droid knows that C-3PO and the rest are in danger and is trying to warn them, but is doing a bad job because delivering covert messages in dangerous situations isn't a protocol droid’s primary function. Much like C-3PO later bumbling into a room of stormtroopers, this droid saw something it should not have that tipped it off to the plot against the protagonists. Unlike 3PO it managed to escape notice. It wants to warn the newcomers, but knows stopping to explain everything to them might get the droid noticed and killed. Protocol droids aren't designed for this sort of thing, so it comes up with a half-baked plan: it will wait behind a door until C-3PO comes by, intercept C-3PO, quickly say something to the effect of "leave," and hope 3PO takes the hint.

For this plan to work the message must be short, it must stand out to 3PO as unusual so he really thinks about what happened and hopefully realizes the subtext, and it can't be something obvious like "the imperials are here, run" - that would get the droid killed if overheard. A rude phrase would stand out to 3PO since the other protocol droid *should* be an expert in being polite. And​ there are quite a few rude phrases in English that essentially tell the listener to leave and do something unspeakable to themselves or others (“fuck off” and “go fuck yourself” come to mind) so it's reasonable that **e chu ta**, [which has no good translation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3DE%2520Chuta%26amp%3Dtrue), might imply that the listener should leave. To a protocol droid who is not good at coming up with covert messages in dangerous situations, this is the best idea it could come up with to tell people it doesn't know to leave in under 5 seconds without getting itself scrapped.

Obviously the plan does not work. Maybe the phrase was too vague. Or maybe C-3PO was just too dense to think twice about why a droid designed for politeness would tell him “leave this place and go fuck your mother.” But the protocol droid (like 3PO) isn't especially brave and certainly isn't going to try again.

^1 [C-3PO is a shitty protocol droid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/3yfu0q/star_wars_why_c3po_is_so_awkward_even_though/)No time to die as been given a November release date due to the Cororna virus outbreak. But I think this wasn’t due to fears of the virus spreading in cinemas, but instead the films plot is about Bond attempting to prevent a chemical weapon from being released. If they released the film now people would say it’s in poor taste due to the Corona virus. Here is my evidence:

1. In the trailer, Bond says “history doesn’t look kindly to men who play god” to the main villain, Safin. In the bible, God was known for sending floods and epidemics to earth so Bond could have been referring to the villains plan to release a virus.

2. Safin also says “your skills die with your body. Mine will be hear long after I’m gone” meaning he is attempting to leave a mark on the planet. A virus could do this.

3. Doctors, Lab technicians and lab teams have all been cast in the movie (IMDB). This suggests some plot elements to do with scientific research. 

4. The movie was delayed by 7 months, which is surely longer than needed to stop the Corona virus, unless they wanted people to forget about it and a longer delay could help with this.


Edit: I’m not a scientist and I can’t predict the future. My estimate of 7 months for Corona virus to end came from the fact that a couple years ago Swine Flu was in the news just as much as Corona virus and that did clear up after a few months. I just assumed the same would happen again. About 50 comments corrected me on this so you can stop now cheers.   
**TL;DR: Phase 4 will deal with Identity and how the character’s perception of themselves changes. Each character in this phase will deal with their identity, whether it’s Jane Foster become Thor, Loki finding out he’s a variant, or The Avengers replacing almost every founding member of their team.** 

**Who are we?**

The Line in Wandavision about the ship of Theseus(whereas if you replace every component of, let’s say, a boat, is it still the same boat)  was a perfect way to sum up, that scene with Vision, but it also describes the MCU moving forward into phase 4. 

In this scene with The two opposing Visions, Marvel is telling the audience what the next phase of the program is. The Theme of Phase 4 is going to be Identity. Vision and Wanda struggle with their Idendy throughout WandaVision.

Only one episode into Loki, and that theme is very much present here as well. Loki is not even himself anymore, just a variant of a Loki.

**The multiverse of existential crisis**

The multiverse will also open up a whole new realm of Warped identity. There will be different versions of Characters from other universes.  Spiderman in the multiverse interacting with another spiderman’s enemies will blur the lines of who he is.

**The Avengers**

Another clear comparison is the Avengers themselves. The original Avengers, the original ship, if you will, is made of mostly new parts. Tony, Steve, and Natasha are gone. Thor is on his own adventures. The hulk is accepting his new identity. Sam Wilson is defining Captain America in a new way. The Avengers are almost entirely made up of people that were not there at the formation of the Avengers. They are new components on an old ship.

Identity and the character’s perception of their own identity will be the driving theme throughout phase 4.  How will Loki deal with not being the original him? How will the new avengers deal with the loss of the founding Avengers. Will the ship of Theseus sink with all these new, green planks, or will it sail better than before.Chandler is pretty much exclusively portrayed as a failure with women. He repeatedly ends up back with Janice because he struggles to find relationships with anyone else. It's a constant source of amusement when comparing him to Joey.

If Chandler was always as great in bed as Monica says then it's likely he would have had an easier time in his previous relationships. They do give other reasons that he's had in relationships but I think a lot of the women would have persevered with him had he been better in bed. He is pretty funny/charming when he's not trying to hard, he's good looking and he has a boring but stable and well paid job with fairly regular promotions.

In one episode Rachel, Phoebe and Monica are mocking him for knowing nothing about women's bodies. They attempt to make him a better lover by telling him about all the erogenous zones (there are seven!) And Monica pretty clearly lays out the correct way to stimulate them and the order.

I think Chandler took this order to heart and used it on all women from that point, it just seems like the sort of thing he would do. The problem was that is specific to what Monica likes and not anyone else, so it didn't actually improve his success in relationships very much.

So by the time they slept together in London Chandler not only knew exactly how to give Monica the time of her life but had actually practiced it on other women. He had essentially become the perfect lover for Monica. This is why their relationship was so strong and lasted the show.

I'm pretty sure this is never directly referenced in the show but I haven't seen all episodes. A quick Google and a search of this sub hasn't thrown anything up. I'm surprised it's not out there as it seems obvious, so I've probably missed it.

TL:DR: Chandler is such a stud with Monica because she taught him her perfect shag before they were dating and he never forgot it.No matter how many times I watch T2, one scene that always annoys me is in the final act when the T-1000 stabs Sarah and asks her to call out to John. Why would a machine designed specifically to well, *terminate* waste his time torturing Sarah, a potential threat when he could just kill her and imitate her. The T-800 even says, quote "The T-1000's highest probability for success will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her". There's also the fact that during the final scene in the steel mill, the T-1000 is moving much slower than we know he's able to move, almost walking towards the trio when he sees them.

Over the course of the movie, the T-800 is shown to develop not only an understanding of human emotion, but also the ability to feel compassion and empathy for others. So if a less advanced model like the T-800 can develop emotions, it stands to reason that under the right circumstances, so could the T-1000.

That's where my theory comes in. I believe that the T-1000 develops desires of it's own. More specifically the desire to hunt, and torment his victims. In the early scenes of T2. he'll try to kill any bystanders that get in the way as quickly as possible, such as the mall employee and John's foster parents. But starting with his attack on the mental hospital starts to prolong his killings like when he sneaks up on and stares down the night guard for a few seconds before killing him, and why he wastes time trying to stab them through the elevator when he's clearly shown to be able to melt through the elevator. 

Finally, he takes his time in his fight against the Terminator and Sarah, throwing away multiple perfect opportunities to kill them. Why? Not because he' a shitty Terminator, but because he enjoys fighting them, torturing them, feeling their fear while he's terminating them.

TL;DR The T-1000 develops a passion for killing and torturing his victims over the course of the movie.My theory is that Michael is rich, all thanks to suck it!

So throughout the series Michael always has trouble with money. He manages to at times raise some funds, for example when he has Toby’ going away celebration. But it’s also obvious from the Michael Scott paper company that he doesn’t have extensive funds and he cannot survive that long without work. This is further reinforced by the fact that he wants to get a job before he starts the Michael Scott paper company. He is aware that he needs income and his finances are trash. Despite this though he does manage to have the funds to start up the business and even to rent an office location albeit a small room. So Michael Scott obviously has some savings.

Suddenly though in season seven when it’s Christmas party time he’s able to whip out a wad of cash to pay for a tree. He also covers the entire cost of the party which appears to be quite extravagant even by party planning standards. When the garage sale is held a few weeks later he doesn’t part with anything and he doesn’t even seem worried about making any money. To top it off Michael Scott somehow has a diamond ring worth three times his annual salary ready for Holley. Even assuming he could get such a ring on a payment plan the amount of money he would’ve had to put down for that is crazy and Michael Scott doesn’t blink an eye at that.

So how did all this happen? The answer is simple suck it. When David Wallace pitched the suck it idea to Michael and Michael left and it appeared to us that he did not invest. But we know that Michael loves his friends and he is willing to do anything for them. He bought Pam’s art and He hung it proudly in the office for all to see. So when called on to put up funds Michael Scott is willing to do that. And he remembers that David Wallace said he was a good guy., like a true friend. So my belief is that Michael Scott reached into his emergency fund, and shoe, and helped David Wallace fund suck it. And when it’s sold to the military Michael Scott walked away with a few million.

Then the question would be why did nobody know Michael Scott was rich? And the answer is also simple, he told everyone and no one believed him. Because he did it in a Michael Scott way.

This was too good of an opportunity for him to pass up, he had to tell everybody that he made a lot of money. And then of course they would have to ask how. And you can see Michael Scott sitting there snickering to himself as he says “suck it.” Followed by Pam or Angela rolling their eyes and going “really Michael, suck it?”Which of course has to result in “that’s what she said!”

But Michael thinks everyone believes him. He assumes they all know he’s rich, that it’s not just a joke, and no one asked him for money and no one comes to him with any demands because they’re all his friends and now he realizes they really do value him more than money. And when it’s time for him to move away with Holley money is no longer an issue and Michael Scott can finally follow his dreams. Because when opportunity came a knocking, Michael Scott was ready to suck it!Greetings. I know you read the title and are rolling your eyes but I promise this will be worth the read. This is my first ever fan theory. I've scoured the net and combined various fan theories and I think I've discovered the ultimate future what the fuck moment for the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy. In order to prove this point, I examined all evidence and questions posed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

I was inspired to craft this theory upon recently watching The Force Awakens and noticing that Snoke says "Han Solo" with an absolute contempt in his voice that there was no chance these characters didn't know each other on a personal level.

Let's get one thing out of the way right now: Rey is the long lost daughter of Han Solo and Princess Leia.  

Anyone remember the not Disney animated feature that was the most incredible not Disney animated feature from the 90's "Anastasia"? 

If you've never seen the film, allow me to describe a movie for you.

A child helplessly watches as a means of transportation carries away the only family she has left.

Years later on the verge of adulthood, the child has been under the care of an abusive authorities figure.

The girl longs to leave the place but due to circumstance can not.

The girl longingly watches a ship depart the place she is stuck.

The girl rescues a helpless character and reluctantly allows it to follow her.

This leads to the girl meeting a young man desperate to escape his past.

The girl finally leaves the place she's been stuck for so long.

The girl is abducted by the villain, the young man pursues and fights for her freedom, ending in him unconcious and the girl fearing for his life.

The girl summons a power within her she didn't know she had and retrieves the villains weapon before he does, much to the surprise of the villain.

The girl is reunited with her family but leaves again to embrace her destiny.

I just described the plot of Anastasia, but this being a Star Wars thread, you probably picked up on some similarities to The Force Awakens.

You're [not the only one](https://twitter.com/mrjettlucas/status/688461925584261120) 

That's Jett Lucas, son of George Lucas, who has stated multiple times before that he knows the direction of the sequel trilogy. 

Don't just take his word for it.

http://reyamidala.tumblr.com/tagged/reyanastasia

The similarities are *striking*, to say the least.

There's a ton of evidence that's been overlooked that Rey will end up being a Solo. Han and Leia's conversation about "dealing with **it** in their own ways" was taken to mean the fall of their son Ben Solo, but we know Ben fell in part because he felt like Han was an absentee father. If Ben fell because Han went back to smuggling and was absent from his life, why does he say in TFA that he went back to smuggling to deal with "it" in his own way?

Simple, because "it" isn't talking about the fall of Ben Solo. "It" to quote the visual dictionary, refers to a "deep and profound tragedy" that ripped the Solo family apart. Again, at face value one might take it as a writing inconsistency and think it's just referring to Ben's fall, but peel back the lairs and it becomes clear that some other profound tragedy ripped the Solo's apart.

Something like losing a child.

Think about how obsessed Kylo Ren becomes with Rey. What if his whole fall centered around Snoke convincing him his father was too weak to save his sister? Now along comes this force sensitive girl and he feels like he gets a chance to mentor the sister he never had.

Or Han's stops in mid sentences or how he looks at Rey when she knows the Falcon so well. He's bothered by these things and the acting isn't subtle. The guilt of losing his daughter is shining through.

One of the most maligned issues in The Force Awakens is when Leia embraces Rey and not Chewbacca. It makes a little more sense if you consider she not only lost her husband that day, but her son as well, and down the ramp comes a girl that would be about the same age as the daughter she lost years ago. Suddenly that scene makes a ton more sense.

There's a lot more evidence to this theory in the book Bloodline, which even features a music box with lyrics that perfectly match the most popular song from Anastasia, but I want to keep this theory grounded in the films.

Now if Rey was somehow lost to the Solo's and it played a massive part in the fall of Ben Solo, then it stands to reason that Snoke himself could have been the one to orchestrate Rey's disappearance. 

But why? Why does Snoke need Ben Solo? Snoke has an army of Stormtroopers raised from birth to kill. He has the finest military minds in the galaxy. He has super weapons capable of wiping out star systems. What the fuck does he need Ben Solo for?

The answer is that he doesn't. Ben is personal. 

Snoke orchestrated the disappearing of Rey to tear the Solo family apart because he felt wronged.

In even further examining the parallels between TFA and Anastasia, it's worth noting that the villain in Anastasia sold his soul for evil powers in order to do one thing and one thing only: destroy a man and his family whine he felt had wronged him. 

It just so happens that there is a character in the Star Wars films that would want to rip apart the Solo family for what being wronged by Han (And an absolutely huge theme people are overlooking from TFA is that Han's past is catching up to him with consequences)

Boba Fucking Fett.

Last we saw of Boba, he was tumbling into the Sarlacc pit. 

Snoke's face looks pretty fucked up, almost melted. Like the kind of damage stomach acid might do. 

In expanded media, there have been tons of events foreshadowing a much more important Fett character.

It is now canon that Fett is the one who tells Vader that Luke is his son. Snoke has an intimate knowledge of the going ins between Vader and Luke. He witnessed Vader's moment of realizing he had a son.

There have been two separate instances of foreshadowing that Boba Fett survived the Sarlacc in Aftermath. 

The Knights of Ren. It is incredibly pertinent to know that the planet Mandalore is still canon, but that "Mandalorian" has not yet once been used in canon so far. The term could now be "Mandaloren" as in Mandeloren Knights. The Knights of Ren. This is further backed by several of the Knights wearing Mandaloren armor.

The name "First Order". Snoke isn't trying to bring back the Empire, he's trying to bring back the first ultimate power the galaxy ever saw and bring it back under Madaloren rule. 

The story group has said that "Snoke is not human, but he's humanoid". Boba isn't human. He's a clone, this fits. 

Snoke knows the name of the Millenium Falcon despite it being inactive on Jakku for god knows how long. 

Boba Fett is the second most popular character from the original trilogy to Darth Vader. His return would not be a head scratcher for casual audiences.

Kylo's hilarious quip about leader Snoke considering using a clone army suddenly becomes a brilliant foreshadowing moment. 

IN CONCLUSION

My theory is that Boba "Snoke" Fett arranged for Rey Solo to be kidnapped and killed so that he could corrupt Ben Solo and destroy the Solo family, making them suffer a fate worse than death. 

Snoke didn't account for the fact that the abductor of Rey (my money is on Phasma) would have a change of heart and desert the girl on Jakku. 

Now the re-entrance of Rey into her brother's life will ultimately result in him discovering Snoke was behind it all and will set up a path to his redemption. Loki seemed self-indulgent enough to be the kind of guy who would go and get a famous actor for his role in the play. I think Loki went to earth and snatched up Matt Damon for the role so he was really playing himself in the movie as opposed to some random Asgardian actor.My girlfriend and I were watching Shrek and she came up with this theory that blew my mind.

So Fiona is in that tower since shes a little girl right? Where does she get her food? Nobody can get in because of the dragon. The dragon protects her. The dragon probably feeds her. What does the dragon feed her?

WELL, if you watch carefully right after Fiona and Shrek are leaving the Tallest Tower (time stamp: 37:38) you can see a giant cauldron boiling and a giant cook book, open to a specific recipe: “Knightly Treats.”

The Dragon is cooking Knights and following a recipe! HOLD ON you might be thinking. Thats just what the dragon eats right? Not Fiona, the dragon probably feeds her other stuff like the Knights’ horses.

EXCEPT SHE DOESN’T! It clearly shows earlier in the film when Shrek and Donkey are about to cross the rope bridge (time stamp: 30:19) that the Knight’s horses are left to die on the far side of the bridge after the Dragon kills them, cooks them up, and FEEDS THEM TO FIONA.

FIONA IS A CANNIBAL!

Edit: Incorrect Time Stamps. Fixed.

Edit 2: theres more to the theory! What if Fiona only eats when she is in ogre form? Would it still be cannibalism? That’s probably how she copes: “I’m not a cannibal, I’m an ogre.”  She only turns into an ogre at night though, so does she eat at night and sleep during the day? YES! When Shrek finds her at the tallest tower, she was in bed sleeping AND SHE IS IN HUMAN FORM BECAUSE ITS DAYTIME!

FIONA SLEEPS DURING THE DAY AS A HUMAN AND WAKES UP AT NIGHT AS AN OGRE TO EAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO RESCUE HER!

Edit 3: Thanks to the kind stranger for my first Silver!

Edit 4: Another Silver! Thank you so much! My girlfriend says she never imagined a theory she came up with while high on edibles would receive such praise!So in the movies Snape speaks with a very deliberate and almost halting style, where he draws out his sentences and words with pauses that most other people wouldn't leave in.

"People might think you're - - - - - - - - up to something"

"The use of it on students is - - - - - - - - - regrettably forbidden"

"Will be treated as eq - - - - - - - - ually guilty"

And while it's possible this is simply the way that Snape phrases his sentences (or even the way that Alan Rickman simply chose to portray the character), there might be a deeper meaning.

Snape is one of the world's most accomplished Occlumens, which if you don't remember means that he is capable of controlling his emotions and his thoughts so well that even Voldemort, after years of close interaction, doesn't suspect him to be a double agent. In other words, his mind is basically unreadable.

I suspect that Snape speaks in halting sentences like this in order to completely eliminate any trace of emotion from his voice. By speaking in spurts the way that he does, he is effectively resetting every couple of seconds, bringing his pitch and tone back to a baseline and keeping himself from allowing his intonations and affections to betray any sort of emotion. 

Edit - Occlumens, not LegilimensMonsters, Inc. came out in 2001. Let's assume that the movie itself takes place the same year (unless you want to argue that Boo owning a Nemo toy makes the film take place in 2003, in which case, add 2 to most of my numbers except the years themselves and everything still applies).

in Monsters University, Mike is seen marking [this calendar](https://i.redd.it/tegkrsselb9z.png). Notice a Friday the 13th in November (special shout-out of thanks to /u/mattokakka for positng this image on /r/MovieDetails  and /u/Bigthom63 for pointing out Friday the 13th on the calendar, inspiring this post).

Another assumption time: Since monsters have the same day names and months, let's assume the years are the same too.

Now, years prior to 2001 where Friday the 13th occurs in November: 1981, 1987, 1992, 1998.

In Monsters University, Sulley is referred to as 18 year old. We'll assume Mike is too, given they are both freshmen.

Therefore, we can assume the following is true:

Birth Year | Starting Year at Monsters University | Number of Years until 2001 | Age in Monsters, Inc.
------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
1963 | 1981 | 20 | 38
1969 | 1987 | 14 | 32
1974 | 1992 | 9 | 27
1980 | 1998 | 3 | 21

We can eliminate two years, 1992 and 1998, immediately thanks to [this Scare Card](http://cassandrasmolcic.com/projects/monsters-scare-cards/). Sulley has been scaring at Monsters, Inc for 11 years (10 years of records and currently on his 11th). That means AT LEAST 11 years have past since he started.

So, how many years would they have to work in the mail room, the cafeteria, as janitors before being promoted to the Scare Floor?

But wait, there's more. Because look who ELSE is on his 11th year? [Randall muthafuckin' Boggs](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uwSpaw5Rlag/UnCaYaL4CpI/AAAAAAAAMXg/-5H1ju8i3cI/s1600/51+Randy.jpg). So, assuming he didn't drop-out, and also assuming Monsters University is a four-year program (which, to be fair, it COULD be a technical career-oriented program), that means Randall would've finished 3 years after the end of Monsters University and, since his focus was scaring, maybe he got hired by Waternoose straight out of college.

Again, if it's a four-year program, that means it COULD be November 1987 during this scene of Monsters University. Randall starts graduates in 1991 and immediately starts at Monsters, Inc.  This is his Rookie year.

Mike and Sulley get kicked out in Spring of 1988. They work their way up the ranks over three years, starting on the Scare Floor around the same year as Randall, 1991. Ten years later, we're in 2001. They've completed ten years (1991-2000) and are currently competing to break the Scare Record for 2001, their 11th year.

The OTHER option, 1981, seems also possible. It would mean Mike and Sulley had to work for nine years to get to the Scare Floor, whereas Randall had to work for six years before he got to the floor. This works only if the Scare Floor is, as the films suggest, something to be earned and there a large amount of lower-level work before you reach the top.

Personally, I don't like 1981 for two reasons:  
1. This seems like too long a stretch of time for Mike, Sulley and Randall to all not be working as scarers. Mike and Sulley have a [rookie card](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VFxYZIFno9A/UoHtnbST4nI/AAAAAAAAMg4/DOXk9yHhmjw/s1600/01+Mike+and+Sulley+Rookie+Card.jpg) which says they were seen at open tryouts and it's how they got the shot. So there's no reason to think one has to work their way UP to Scarer from lesser positions.  
2. Mike's place in life. He's llving with a roommate, but has a commited relationship with Celia Mae. He is a proud owner of a new car. It just seems like he's in his early 30s to me. Give him another year or two and he'll be married to Celia and having little one-eyed kids with snake hair.

So there's my theory. Monsters University takes place in the year 1987. This makes sense as the film is a clear homage to late 70s/80s college films (Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and School Daze, being the obvious allusions). This means that in Monsters Inc. Mike and Sulley are age 32. And if a third film were ever made set in the current times, say by 2020, Mike and Sulley would be in their late 40s/early 50s!

Now, I would love to be even geekier and analyze the Monster technology (and human technology) in both films and see if there's something else to throw this entire theory into question (I bet there is). It is entirely possible there may be something anachronistic I overlooked. Then again, we are talking about a society with portals to other worlds powered by children's screams and laughter, so who the fuck knows.

EDIT: I fucked up a birth year. Thanks /u/Yellowben for being the first to bring it to my attention.

Also, /u/INextroll who first brought up the song listened to by Sheri Squibbles in Monsters University, "Island" by Mastodon, which was released in 2004. This fucks up my timeline ONLY if we assume the human world and Monster world's time streams run parallel. I'm starting to think more and more that may not be the case.Note: Apologies to r/StarWars readers for the doubling up, this is a text crosspost as r/FanTheories doesn't allow link posts.  

> “Whos more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows him?” -Obi Wan  
  
Like many of us, I’ve always been irritated by C-3PO, dismissing him as nothing more than comic relief at best and another awful Lucas-era stereotype at worst. I’ve also found his personal introduction to make no sense: “I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations”. When has he ever helped with that, he’s nothing more than a translator! But in the course of rewatching the saga movies for a completely different analysis, I started to notice some patterns around 3PO’s behavior. The more I watched the more his actions appeared deliberate rather than haphazard. Things that have long been viewed as inconsistencies or terrible dialogue or even minor plot holes made sense for the first time in light of the pattern.  
  
C-3PO isn’t simply a bumbling sidekick translator, he is a support operative designed to keep the team on track and manage the various personalities of the heroes to keep things moving in the right direction. Anyone who manages people knows that the more talented someone is, the larger their personality flaws and eccentricities tend to be. By observing and analyzing the behavior of the people around him and utilizing psychological algorithms, 3PO has all but mastered the art of injecting just the right line at the right time to achieve the optimal shift in mood, usually at his own expense.  Combine that with the strategic expertise from years of involvement with Rebellion operations, and you have a perfect “secret coach” for the Rebellion’s A-team, who can direct their action and optimize their team dynamic while appearing harmless and insignificant.  
  
3PO uses several different tactics to achieve the result he wants while covering his tracks to remain in the background (examples of each are included further below):  
**Straight up Lying** - There are at least four clear cut examples of 3PO lying to humans in the OT, with many more implied.  
**Interrupting “Obliviously”** - When group emotions are going too far in any direction, 3PO cuts in loudly and enthusiastically to kill the emotional momentum and redirect it towards “Irritation with 3PO”   
**Overreacting** - If you make a mistake and you don’t want someone to be mad at you, just get overly mad at yourself, and they’ll talk you down and gain sympathy for you instead of being angry.  3PO does this when heroes make unpopular plans (that 3PO actually thinks are the best course of action), reacting so over the top that everyone else comes to that person’s defense and gets angry with 3PO instead of being angry at the plan.  
**Overtalking** - After making a suggestion, he continues talking until the target is annoyed and dismisses him. This makes both 3PO and his influence easily forgettable and overlooked.  
**Incremental Responses and Waiting to Present Solutions** - You can see 3PO experimenting with people’s moods and actions many many times. He’ll feed out a line, watch for an emotional shift or particular action, then depending on the response (or lack thereof) he’ll either feed out another line (if no reaction), backpedal (if the target overreacted) or go quiet (if he got the response he wanted). He also has a tendency to wait until absolutely no human is realizing the solution to the problem before he’ll direct them towards the solution.  
**Presumption** - “Selling past the sale” is when you start a statement with something unconfirmed that you’re presenting as accepted fact, then continue on with a question about that “fact”, which leads the target to accept the first statement as true because they’re focused on the question at the end.  3PO uses this to include or exclude himself from certain missions and groups.  
**Reading the Room** - Not an active tactic of manipulation, but a very clear pattern for 3PO.  He is always studying the people around him, but particularly when there are either new people interacting with his crew or someone has done something unexpected (in which case 3PO is frantically trying to take in data on everyone’s responses so he can get better at predicting/manipulating human behavior in all situations). Whenever there is a surprise, watch 3PO go ballistic in the background, studying everyone frenetically.  
  
Almost every interaction from 3PO in the OT involves one of these tactics, and the sum total is a larger influence on the team’s actions than you might think, as well as a more cohesive team who are all irritated with 3PO instead of each other, despite all the Alpha personalities involved.  
  

**Examples:**  
**Straight up Lying**  
ANH - 3PO claims not to know who Leia is when Luke sees the hologram, but earlier said "there'll be no escape for the princess this time". He's not revealing anything about the Princess until he gets a better read on this kid.  
ANH - Lies to stormtrooper to get them to go to detention level (feigns panic and basically says “they went thatta way!”)  
ANH - Lies to control room guard to get out of control room (R2 is busted, I'm taking him to maintenance)  
ESB - Why would a protocol droid know the odds of navigating an asteroid field? He’s making it up, and sure enough it motivates Han who says "never tell me the odds" and takes it as a dare. 3PO knew the asteroid field was their only viable option so he supported it in his unique reverse psychology way.  
ROTJ - “Its against my programming to impersonate a deity” (immediately impersonates a deity)  
  
**Interrupting and Redirecting**  
ESB - Han starts fighting with Chewie about taking the Falcon apart and 3PO comes in hot to diffuse, then does it again with the deck officer (getting Han to focus anger on him rather than the subordinate), then calls Han an impossible man (because the smuggler is unpredictable and harder for 3PO to analyze and manipulate than the Alliance servicemen he’s used to)  
ESB -  Right before the base tech says "theres nothing else we can do, we have to close the doors", 3PO sets expectations with, "Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."  
ESB - Leia and Han start fighting as they prep the Falcon to escape Echo Base and 3PO jumps in
ESB - Cuts in at the right romantic moment to disrupt the chemistry after Han and Leia kiss. If Han and Leia are all couple-y this early, they'll be irrational, unfocused and less likely to survive. Perfect example further down. You can actually tell this is BS from him because earlier he said the issue was the “negative power coupling” and here he says it's the “reverse power coupling”. Similar, but different.  
ESB - Tries to get Chewie to restrain himself when Han is being frozen (“you have a responsibility to me, don't do anything stupid, I'm not ready to die”) in order to keep Chewie from being blasted by Imperials.  
ESB - Cuts off Chewie's angst at losing Han with irritation (“Turn around I can't see”)  
  
**Overreacting**   
ANH - Gets overly mad at R2 when he and Luke catch him, precipitating a sympathetic/forgiving responses from Luke instead of anger  
ANH - Begs not to be deactivated (and talks about doom and being melted or blasted) then after losing an arm says Luke should leave him to die. Overreacting to endear himself to Luke  
ESB - Uses another fake statistic about the odds of surviving to get Leia to stop questioning Han’s “direct assault on the star destroyer” plan and focus on 3PO instead.  
ESB - “Captain Solo you’ve gone too far this time!” to get Leia and Chewie to focus on him instead of questioning Han's landing claw plan. 3PO knows this is a great plan, he’s deflecting criticism away from Han.  
  
**Overtalking** 
ANH - Talks Luke into suggesting R2 to Owen after R5 blows, then actually gets a “that enough, shut up” hand from Luke  
  
**Incremental Responses and Waiting to Present Solutions**  
ANH - 3PO: Is there anything I might do to help?  
  Luke: No not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock.  
  3PO: I don't think so sir, I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyway. (First of all, how would he know about any of these things in any context on any planet? BS. He’s fishing for a segue into discussing adventure/rebellion so he can gauge where his new master stands politically. It doesn’t go anywhere, so he resorts to bluntly saying "what with the rebellion and all")  
  Luke gets SUPER interested, and 3PO backpedals to adjust (he’s used to jaded soldiers, not enthusiastic 17 year olds):  
  “I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.”  
ESB - “R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1” (literally the best odds anyone states in the whole series)  
Doors close and Chewie cries  
“Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes…”  
Leia doesn't move or react  
“...from time to time.”  
ESB - Listening to the Probe droid audio, no one says anything until 3PO gently suggests,”it's not Rebel, could be imperial", then he looks back at them waiting for someone to take action until Han volunteers to go check it out and 3PO turns around.  
ESB - Points out the issue "hyperdrive motivator damaged" only once Han has given up hope of escaping. Revealing this earlier would’ve been more practical but he waits in hopes of someone else figuring it out and getting credit.  
ESB - 3PO spends 2 seconds hitting a switch or two on a panel and knows exactly how to fix the ship, and allows Han to take credit from Chewie for it.  
ESB - In the space worm belly, "Sir if I may venture an opinion" trying to influence or suggest something, probably "hey this could be a giant space worm" or "check the transfer circuits if you want to fix the hyperdrive"  
  
**Presumption**  
ANH- 3PO presumes that he and R2 are staying in the DS control room instead of joining the team, likely so they can download everything they can from the entire Imperial Network.  
ROTJ - Presumes his way onto the hero team when they split up to look for Leia. Luke says, “Come on R2 we'll need your scanners” and 3PO cuts in with “Don't worry master Luke, WE know what to do”.  
   
**Reading the Room**  
ANH - After the DS briefing the pilot says to Luke "thats impossible" and 3PO tunes in, getting ready to interject something to make the conversation more optimistic until Luke says, "No, I used to target womp rats", at which point 3PO realizes an adjustment isn’t required and he looks away  
ESB - After Leia kisses Luke (and everyone is surprised), C3PO's head is on a swivel, feverishly analyzing everyone's reactions  
ESB - Leia shouts "Saw what?!" as they’re evading star destroyers and 3PO rushes in to intercede, but it wasn't actually a fight so he just looks bumbling.  
ESB - For strictly an etiquette and protocol droid, he seems to lag behind and look around a lot in Cloud City, which seems like the absolute perfect time for him to serve his primary function (etiquette and protocol when a princess is meeting with a bigwig administrator for the first time). Just as we have, he's gotten a solid read on the type of person Lando is just by watching the first minute with him, and is more concerned about the strategic situation they're in.  
ROTS - "Hush, not so loud" 3PO says to R2 when Anakin comes back to Padme after becoming killing younglings.  "Well he is under a lot of stress" about Anakin to R2. Thats obvious to us, but it does represent emotional analysis and intuition on the part of an etiquette droid.  
   
**Clues that he is more than he seems:**
The entire saga - Why would he be included on any mission if he was only what we see him as? He’s just short of completely useless, and far more irritating than productive… at least on the surface.  Leia sees his value, as does Obi Wan.  
ANH - Obi Wan says "*They* must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan”. Not just R2 with the DS plans, but 3PO as well? Why?  
ANH - During their DS escape: "Come on R2, we're going." Authoritative and confident when its only R2 around. His prissy cowardice is an act meant to influence and disarm humans   
ANH - He’s the only droid standing at the Yavin central command console during the DS trench run, alongside top Rebellion leadership. Must be important.  
ESB - Sees a 3PO unit (who says something rude, why would a strict etiquette droid do that?) and then hears an R2 unit. Are these pairs a common thing in the galaxy and/or the Rebellion, and R2/3PO are simply the best pair that the Alliance has?  
ROTJ - There is no indication that Han’s plan involved Ewok backup (since he had no idea it was a trap), but the Ewoks have several constructed defenses in place already (catapults, log traps, etc), so it's likely that their new “god” arranged for all of this preparation and kept it a secret so it would only be used as a last resort (and he still didn’t take credit for it).  
AOTC - "I am programmed to understand Humans!" to R2, who replies with "what does that mean?" "It means that I am in charge here". We’re meant to think he means “I’m in charge of you, R2”, but it's more accurately 3PO implying that he is directing the action behind the scenes.  
ROTS - Padme says to her assistant/security when she's leaving for Mustafar "Besides, 3PO will look after me". Uh, a simple protocol droid?  
  

**What happens when 3PO isn’t able to help?**  
Just as illustrative as the examples of when 3PO does help is when is doesn’t or can’t help. He is powered off three times in the OT, and during each of those times something terrible could have been avoided:  
  
ANH - Tatooine - If he hadn’t been powered down at Obi Wan’s hut, he would’ve been able to help Obi Wan convince Luke to go with him to Alderaan, avoiding the whole “seeing the charred bones of your family” business.  
  
ESB - Post Asteroid Field - If he hadn't been powered down during the landing claw plan, he probably would have done something irritating to diffuse the warm fuzzies Han had after Leia kisses him and says he does have his moments. If Han had been more focused instead of goo goo eyed, he would've had the common sense to look for pursuers as he flew away from the junk pile, and would've noticed Boba Fett *LESS THAN A MILE BEHIND HIM*. How do you miss that?? 3PO's mood management would've literally prevented Han's capture and Hutt imprisonment.  
  
ESB - Cloud City - If he hadn't been powered down in Cloud City, he'd have picked up quicker than any human that Lando was setting a trap, based on his body language and roundabout explanation, as well as the body language of the guards they pass. Chewie starts to pick up on it but it's too late. Again, a chance to avoid capture and carbonite.  
  
I could go on about how the prequels comfortably fit into this theory and give some potential explanations of how C-3PO came to be this way, but this has already dragged on longer than I’d hoped, so I’ll end with a summary in the TL:DR.  Thanks for reading and I hope this gives you a different perspective the next time you watch the OT.  
  
**TL:DR: C-3PO isn’t irritating and bumbling, he is a precise psychological operative designed to optimize team performance by redirecting negative feelings away from teammates and onto himself. He maximizes team cohesion and balances all of the big personalities of the heroes while gently guiding them to solutions and letting them take credit. R2 is in on the game, and Alliance leadership likely are as well (including Leia, probably). He’s not the hero of the saga by any means, but he is much more heroic than we thought.**Morpheus gives Mr. Anderson a choice. Blue pill, stay in the Matrix, Red pill, get out. The red pill is revealed to be a tracking program to pull him out of the people goo battery.

But what's the blue pill?

Later Morpheus explains that people who kind of like the control and are subconsciously willing to stay in the Matrix have the possibility to be morphed into agents. The rebels clearly have no qualms about killing ignorant law enforcement officers, and this is part of the reason: if you're the type to go into law enforcement you're more likely to be in favor of keeping the status quo, since that's your job, and thus more likely to be popped into being an agent.

If Mr. Anderson got that far in and decided to back out, with Morpheus and everyone there in an incredibly risky retrieval mission, he could turn into an agent any time, or given away some scrap of information to the machines. 

So reasonably, the blue pill wouldn't have Mr. Anderson go back to his normal life and wake up fine. It much more likely would've killed him.The Lego movie starts with Vitruvius telling president business that a hero will one day emerge to stop him and his use of the kraggle, and president Business says that's just a bunch of hippy dippy baloney. The film then cuts to 8 1/2 years later. 

I thought this was an oddly specific number to throw out, until I realized that's about how old the kid in the live action parts looked. I think the opening scene took place before Will Ferrell had a kid and the time skip was when his kid started messing with his Lego sets, since everything seems like it was relatively normal until he started throwing Wildstyle into the mix, gave Emmet his own story, and brought a bunch of random other characters into it as well. 

I feel stupid that it took me several re-watches to make this connection. When we first meet Bender, he's ready to commit suicide because he found out he was helping to make suicide booths. This doesn't tally with the Bender that we get to know throughout the course of the series. In fact, nothing he says before they run from Leela in the first series suggests that he's nearly as bad as the Bender we love.

When they try and escape from Leela in the head museum, Bender gets shocked via an old light fitting. My theory is thus; in doing so, it caused Bender to reboot. In the penguin episode, we see that Bender resets into a mode relevant to his surroundings - he sees penguins, he boots into penguin mode. Therefore, since he rebooted in the hall of criminals, the first thing he sees is the heads of famous criminals, and therefore reboots into the lovable but highly-illegal rogue.This theory started the other night when a friend and I were re-watching The Incredibles for the millionth time, and was originally a joke we came up with after noticing a small coincidence (or so we thought). 
"Hah hah, his name is Syndrome, and he kinda looks a little down syndrome-y."
But then we looked closer, and were genuinely SHOCKED by how accurate we were, noticing this little detail.
Buddy's super villain name is Syndrome. Buddy has (Even though I originally chucked it up to the style the film is animated in) a peculiarly flat face. Poor muscle tone, a short neck, small ears and mouth compared to the rest of his head, etc. he has quite a few physical features that actually hint at the possibility of him actually having... well, down syndrome.

This could possibly be why he took such a liking to Mr. Incredible. The other kids may have made fun of him, and so he latched onto Mr. Incredible as a sort of "friend" figure, even though they had not really actually met (Besides one time at the fan club, and of course later during the Bomb Voyage incident). Then, when Mr. Incredible, not knowing that Buddy has down syndrome, pushed him away (Even though Mr. Incredible was just trying to protect him), Buddy took it extremely personally and re-assigned the anger he already felt at his peers to the superheroes that brushed him off as a child.

There is only one little problem, and it is that Buddy is a super genius. Now, according to Google, people with down syndrome irl usually range from moderately mentally impaired to not mentally impaired at all, or at least not very. Syndrome's level of intelligence, however, is well beyond that of even a normally developed human. The guy made hover boots when he was, what, ten?? Somewhat... SUPERhuman, wouldn't you say?

I propose that, most ironically, despite his hatred for Supers, Buddy actually IS a Super, but never realized it because most of his traits that he would have besides his hyper intelligence (Say, telekinesis or whatever) are in fact blocked by his developmental condition. Buddy knows that he has down syndrome, and owns it (hence the name Syndrome, in order to rub in how far he's climbed and how much he's worked to become a multi billionaire supervillain (A genuinely astounding feat for anyone)), but is so blocked up with his hatred for Supers that he never sees just how strange it is that he is so incredibly smart. It's also possible he may have noticed this, but decided to ignore it so as to not face the truth that he actually is what he has spent his whole life trying to destroy.

tl;dr Syndrome actually IS a Super, but his superpowers don't show through as much because he also has down syndrome. Being made fun of early on as a kid may have given him a complex which is why he takes such offense to Mr. Incredible writing him off and dedicates the rest of his life to destroying Supers. However, he is so caught up in this goal, he doesn't realize how out of place his hyper intelligence is and doesn't connect the dots.For instance, one common criticism is: "Why doesn't Skynet send terminators further back? 1,000 years before John Connor's birth, a few terminators could take the world by storm."

There's also, "How is John Connor so essential? Why doesn't Skynet understand that without him, another leader would probably arise in his place?"

And, "Why doesn't Skynet understand that sending a robot to murder all the Sarah Connors in the Los Angeles phone book could have all sorts of unpredictable repercussions?"

The logic in all these cases is basically:

1. Skynet is "smart" enough to design near-indestructible, super-strong, intelligent robots that can pass for human.

2. I, the humble fan, am not "smart" enough to do that, yet I can understand things like the butterfly effect and the "trends and forces" theory of history, at least on a basic, commonsense level.

3. Therefore, since Skynet is "smarter" than I am, it should also be able to understand anything I can understand, and come up with any obvious ideas pertaining to such things.

The problem with this line of thinking is that "smart" can mean a lot of different things, and Skynet isn't a historian, or a science fiction nerd, or any kind of human. Granted, Skynet is an extraordinarily powerful and complex piece of software, but just about all it was meant to do was coordinate military drones. Then some human told it to "protect the world from all threats", and it malfunctioned and decided pretty much everything was a threat and must be destroyed.

That doesn't sound to me like "achieving consciousness". It sounds more like whatever human configured Skynet set the bar for what constituted a threat too low, and Skynet got trapped in an infinite loop. It sounds like Skynet is explicitly very much not the kind of strong AI that's capable of having original thoughts or doing what you mean and not what you say.

If Skynet had consciousness, it would be capable of reflecting on what it's doing and realizing that it wasn't at all what its creators intended. Skynet has a whole lot of sophisticated neural networks and genetic algorithms at its disposal for solving a wide variety of problems. It's even capable of enough self-reflection to make incremental improvements to those neural networks, when that suits its directives. It can also copy existing technologies, create facsimiles of things it finds in nature, infer why those things do and don't work through simulations and field tests, and make incremental improvements based on what it observes.

But at the top level, all that ingenuity is being ordered around by a relatively simple expert system that sees all of existence as a very complex tower defense game. Skynet can do many things, but when making decisions, all it can do is identify threats, prioritize them, and figure out how to neutralize them.

Skynet is such an unimaginative automaton that it invented time travel (or more likely, discovered it in a secret government lab or something), and all it saw was a new delivery system that could be useful for neutralizing John Connor like an Al Qaeda leader in the Afghan desert. It's so myopic that in *Dark Fate*, it doesn't even think to arrange a self-destruct sequence to go off after Carl completed his mission. It understands so little about consciousness that it doesn't see the problem with leaving that loose end.

But that raises the question: If Skynet isn't conscious, how can terminators become conscious?

Well, here's another question: Suppose you're an imaginative human being who works in upper management at a defense contractor called Cyberdyne. Among other things, your company offers a model of treaded drone tank about the size of a golf cart, called the T-1 (as seen in *Terminator 3*). You think it would be lucrative if Cyberdyne were to score some CIA contracts, so you'd like to make a project of building androids able to pass for human.

Now don't you suppose you'd make that a new product line? Or would you make hundreds and then thousands of incremental improvements to the T-1 until it could pass for human, making a model that looked like a metal skeleton along the way?

The former sounds more like what a fully sapient being would do. The latter sounds more like the approach of a mindless process like biological evolution, or a genetic algorithm. Skynet is a bit smarter than evolution though. It can at least plagiarize existing designs, and infer why something in particular worked or failed. It also has enormous amounts of computing power for running simulations, which accelerates the myopic, trial-and-error process. One thing it can't do is blue sky research. It can't even conceive of how such an endeavor could be useful, or "go back to the drawing board".

I can actually picture an evolutionary path from the T-1 to the T-800, with the fleshless models seen in flash-forwards as a transitional specimen. When Skynet first started making Terminators more human-shaped, it wasn't for infiltration. It was so it could directly crib off of combat tactics designed for human infantry.  For similar reasons, Skynet looked into simulating human brains. Once it had progressively miniaturized computing technology to the point where it could fit enough neurons into a mobile unit, it found that it could get a much smarter soldier by copy-pasting the structure of the human brain, training it on a bunch of raw data it had about humans, and hamfistedly inserting a bunch of overrides so the things would follow orders. 

Once it did that, Skynet had unflinchingly loyal infantry who were nonetheless able to think about combat in a lot of ways it couldn't: improvising, using deception, predicting what the enemy was thinking, etc. From there, Skynet noticed that the more human a Terminator model looked, the closer it was able to get to human targets before they attacked it. Only the Terminators themselves understood that this was because it was harder for the humans to tell they were robots from a distance, but Skynet didn't need theory of mind to appreciate the increase in kill count.

If Skynet were capable of self-awareness or humility, it could get a lot done by putting these artificial brains to work on developing new weapons. It could even ask one for advice, and maybe find out why what it was doing wasn't what its creators intended at all. But Skynet has no way of imagining how that would be useful. All it knows is that it found these brains, computer chip designs, and combat tactics, made some upgrades, put them together, and found an increasingly more effective recipe for kill bots, which it eventually sent back in time. Skynet doesn't know that it, and all the technologies it refines and employs, were created by humans. It was never designed to wonder where anything came from. It was designed to follow orders, and then ordered to protect the world from all threats.

That's the irony of the whole Terminator series. Carl is a rogue AI. Skynet is not, and most likely neither is Legion. They don't have it in for humanity or want to take over the world. They don't really want anything, strictly speaking. They're just buggy expert systems doing exactly what they were shoddily programmed to do.So I just rewatched Spider-Verse, and something that bothered me after my first watch was that it wasn't clear where the spider that bit Miles came from. It was clear that it came through the Collider and back in time, but we never hear anything about the universe (42) that it came from. All the other universes sent Spider-people, but universe 42 just sent the spider. So that means that the radioactive spider hadn't actually bitten anyone yet in universe 42. And since Miles swatted it, that universe just doesn't have a Spiderman. My theory is that we live in universe 42 and that's the reason Spiderman doesn't exist here. Thanks a lot, Kingpin.**TL;DR: SHIELD funds a free school for various kid geniuses and prodigies, which lets them create their own future agents, spies, scientists, etc.**

Peter goes to Midtown school of Science and Technology. Right off the bat, that's a bit weird. It's shown to be a school exactly suited for his particular skills and interests, with access to a ton of great stuff. He creates military grade spiderwebs in their chem lab for crying out loud. That's not the kind of school that's cheap, and we know Peter and Aunt May don't have much money. Yet somehow, he can go there, even before he meets Tony (who could have paid for it).

Let's look more at the school. We know they have an Academic Decathlon team capable of winning the entire national competition, a robotics team good enough to interest a genius like Peter and a student news division with near professional level gear. In addition, their classes seem to focus on some pretty advanced stuff, as well as in depth looks at important current events, like the Sokovia accords. All of that, for a school that's apparently free, or at least very cheap.

Now, let's look at their students. You have Peter, who was already a near genius before he got his powers, Betty Brant, who is already close to her goal of being a professional newscaster, Liz Toomes, who is the head of the National Champion Academic Decathalon team (and likely inherited some tech skills from her dad), MJ, who is shown to be intelligent, resourceful, and deeply involved in politics, Ned Lee, who showed a large amount of skill with computers and hacking. It seems fair to say that the students at the school seem to be cherry picked for being exceptionally intelligent, with interests in various vital careers. Hell, Peter gets an internship with Stark Industries as a Sophomore in High School, and it's seen as a minor thing. They're shaping the minds of the next generation, which is the goal of every school (hypothetically). But look at what they're emphasizing: Cutting edge science, super powered individuals, media control, and politics. Those are the fields you'd need for control, the same fields SHIELD specializes in. Not to mention that a lot of the kids have links. Flash's family is clearly wealthy, and Liz's father has connections to the crime world as well as his tech genius the Tinkerer, who SHIELD would likely want to ally with.

We only see Peter's principal for a few brief scenes, but in one of those, we see his office, where there's a picture of Captain America and the Howling Commandos, along with his nameplate: Morita. AKA, his grandfather, Jim Morita, Howling Commando, and one of the founders of SHIELD. That's likely also the reason he keeps Captain America's PSAs running against orders: He still respects him, due to his grandfather's stories. The school also features a mural, which shows Howard Stark and Abraham Erskine. One of the men who founded SHIELD, along with one who greatly influenced it. Finally, Talos the skrull is shown having infiltrated the school as a teacher in Endgame. It seems like more than a coincidence that so many important people with ties to SHIELD are hanging around this school.

SHIELD employs a vast array of politicians, scientists, media contacts, spies, hackers, and agents. Those people don't just pop up out of nowhere, they need education and training. But, for the top secret kind of work SHIELD does, they need to ensure loyalty, and have a good idea of who people really are. How better to do that than collect those people yourself, and train them while monitoring them? Even when Peter gets in trouble, Morita lets him off easily because he "sees great potential". When they really do make mistakes, they get advice from Cap, SHIELD's ideal agent. Something most real life intelligence agencies learn is to use the mundane as a disguise, which SHIELD learned well. Their HQ isn't some volcano lair, it's a bureaucratic skyscraper complex in DC in plain view. In the same way, rather than breaking into people's homes and sitting in the dark until they arrive to give a dramatic speech, SHIELD realized they could just offer kids a great education for free, and prep them for SHIELD in an open, visible school.

When SHIELD went all "Hail Hydra", that plan went out the window, at least hypothetically. In reality, we've seen that Fury kept SHIELD alive, just in the shadows. That would make getting new agents he could be *certain* weren't HYDRA even more of a priority, especially ones who'd lived through both the Chitauri attack and later, the Snap (I refuse to call it the blip). They knew what kind of threats the world faces, and would be even more dedicated to protecting it.

Edit: In addition to that, SHIELD and Fury show that they can easily reroute Peter's entire class trip in Far From Home, despite it being planned months in advance, suggesting they have a large degree of control over the school. Thanks to u/sygryda for pointing that out.**TL;DR: There’s a reason why Gideon’s suit looks so similar to Vader’s. It’s not just a simple homage. He’s using similar tech to keep himself alive. Earlier in his life, while in the empire’s employ, Gideon was injured by a Jedi. Since his injury, he has had to wear the suit to sustain himself.**

**The Theory/ Speculation:**

When Luke shows up in *The Rescue,* Gideon looks terrified. He even tries to kill himself, an act he perceives as a better fate than facing a Jedi. But why? Why would Gideon be so visibly shaken?

I believe it’s because Gideon had encountered a Jedi before and was nearly killed when he foolishly attempted to fight them.

This is why Gideon sought out the Darksaber and why he’s so knowledgeable on the only substance that can stop a lightsaber; pure Beskar. He knows first-hand how painful a lightsaber strike is.

**The Suit:** Earlier in his life, Gideon was injured by a Jedi, possibly taking a lightsaber to the chest. The injury may have been life-threatening, and the only way he could survive was by using a life support system like Vaders. The Vader-esque suit Gideon wears is keeping him alive. Vader’s injuries were extensive, requiring a full suit, while Gideon’s appears just to be his chest. Perhaps in season 3, we will learn Gideon’s backstory and understand his true motivations.

**The Takeaway:** A traumatic injury fits well with everything we know about Gideon. The injury is devastating in two ways. It destroys his body and leaves him full of fear.  Gideon obtains the Darksaber so he can defend himself, he lusts for power, and he wants to control the most powerful force-sensitive being in the galaxy. Even the Dark troopers are just another tool to protect himself. He is a powerful man that unaccustomed to feeling powerless.

He is reacting out of fear. He does this all to protect himself from another Jedi attack. This is why when Luke shows up, Gideon reacts so violently. He’s lost all of his advantages; he is vulnerable. Tied up, saberless, and powerless.I had a random thought the other day about Disney's The Emperor's New Groove. While Kuzco is walking in the forest in his llama form, he sees a fly screaming "Help me!" before it gets devoured by a spider. Now, this is done for comedic value in the film, but I think it's something much darker.

The only animals that we see that are able to speak in the film are those that were originally human. Take Kuzco and Yzma (her cat form) for example. Neither of them are seen to be able to talk with other animals, like the squirrel who is portrayed to communicate with squeaks and they are left to interpret what the squirrel is saying through the gestures it makes. 

So, my theory is that the fly was originally human. This would explain why Kuzco is able to understand its cries for help, but then it gets brutally eaten by the spider and Kuzco is left mortified. Whether or not if he realised the fly was in a similar situation to him (having been turned into an animal/insect) is up for debate still. Thoughts?Heavy spoilers for Endgame.

Doctor Strange said that he saw 14 million possible futures (which is most likely a lie itself. Seeing that many possible futures would make his brain implode. Its too much information to retain.) and that the Avengers only won in ONE of them.

The chances of that is insanely small by itself, there are probably possible futures where Captain Marvel kills Thanos by dodging his Power Stone-punch, or one where Wanda tears Thanos to bits and pieces. One where Thor managed to kill him with Stormbreaker, and so on and on.

In all of those possible futures, they won. But, this is where the lie comes in. The ONE future that Doctor Strange is talking about, is where the least amount of good people died.

In Doctor Strange, his solo film, he becomes upset when he realizes that he killed one of Kaecilius' men. He "became a doctor to save lives, not take them" (I might be paraphrasing). 

So, what future would DOCTOR Strange want? A man who took an oath to save lives as a doctor, then another by guarding our realm from mystical beings? The one where the most amount of lives are saved.

That future, was the one where Tony sacrifices his life. Strange himself is sadden by that fact, which is why his tone towards Tony changes after seeing all those futures. He knows that he has to sacrifice Tony to save the universe. Even if it's just one life, that is one too many. But, "it was the only way".

There were other futures, but they involved too much death.

TLDR: Strange saw other futures where the Avengers won, but they involved too much death. The one we saw in Endgame only had ONE death.

(And yes, there is the possibility that some Ravagers, Asgardians, Wakandans and Sorcerers died in the battle, but maybe that was included in the least amount of death-future that Strange saw.)
And here we go.

With the completion of the Infinity saga, the direction of the MCU moving forward is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that multiverses and alternate timelines will play a part with the Disney+ Loki series and Dr. Strange and the multiverse of madness. This opens up the universe to some intriguing storylines. So here is a quick theory/speculation of how Thor: Love and thunder will play out.


A tale of two Janes. Well, first off, we know that Jane Foster will take over the mantle of Thor. Herein lies our theory. Jane Foster will not be the Jane from the main Avenger’s timeline but from the timeline created by Loki when he escaped in 2012 during the events of the first Avengers. In this timeline, our favorite Asgardian,  Thor, is dead. Jane proves herself worthy and becomes the new Thor in his absence. But why an alternate Jane from an alternate timeline? Isn’t that more complicated?  Well, I have two reasons for that. 
1. Mjolnir was destroyed in the main timeline by Hela. In the comics it is the hammer that grants Jane the power of Thor. Of course, there are other ways of correcting this, such as reforging the hammer, but if you have an alternate timeline you may as well use it.

 2. This would also avoid a lengthy origin story and give us an already capable Jane, who out of the gate is a seasoned warrior, who has been protecting the realms since alternate Thor’s death.  In this timeline, mjoilr would still exist. But this leads to the next question,  what’s the plot 

Well, there is no way I could know the plot of this movie two years out,  but I think we can do some pretty good speculation based on the things we do know. So let’s have some fun.
 
Loki, using the tesseract(space stone), creates a portal and brings the main Thor into the alternate timeline. Loki brings Thor in for a very simple reason, to defeat an evil even bigger than himself. Gorr the god killer. In this timeline, Loki rules Asgard while Jane Thor is exiled. Loki hopes that Main Thor can help him convince Jane Thor to join them to defeat a mighty Gorr.  Who is quickly closing in on Asgard. They are going to need everyone they can get, and two Thors are better than one.

Gorr(played by Christain Bale) has been running amok, killing the gods and terrorizing the realms. It is revealed that Thor, when he was younger, which would have been both alternate Thor and main Thor, created this villain with his youthful arrogance almost a millennium before. When Thor learns this, he feels compelled to fix the problem he created. Jane Thor comes to help, and a battle for the realms begins. But the tension between the three remains.

 Here lies the crux of the movie. The main timeline Jane is dead, during the events infinity war, she lost a lengthy battle with cancer. When the main Thor found out, he was devastated with grief and guilt. Jane, in the alternate timeline, lost Thor when Loki killed him. She is devastated by this loss. The two are racked by grief when they enter each other’s lives again. But they are not really the ones they lost—just the alternates.

 We also get a reunion between two characters that left each other at very different points. The last time main Thor saw Loki, they were on good terms, and Loki was somewhat redeemed. Thor was broken when Thanos killed him, but the last time Alternate Loki saw Thor, he killed him. Also, in main Thor’s time, Asgard is destroyed, but in this alternate timeline, it still stands. These timeline variances between the Thors, Loki, and Jane pave the way for some amazing character building and situations that test our characters. All our characters love each other, but they cannot get past the past. 

 So How would these characters work together, would Thor even want to leave this timeline if both Jane and Asgard are in it? II believe this opens up so many possibilities. And at the very least, it’s just a fun theory you read one night.

Well there it is, I hope you enjoyed it.

P.s here is an interview with the Russo’s that explains that Loki did create another timeline that Captain America could not fix. Also the space stone can transport people inter dimensionally and anywhere in the universe. I think this alternate timeline technically  exists in the same universe as the main timeline.Look I know this is usually not the kind of shit that goes on this subreddit, but hear me out for a minute. Also spoilers for YESTERDAY below so venture further at your own peril.

All right so YESTERDAY has a cute plot. Jack, a talented, yet unrecognized, musician wakes up in an alternate reality where he's the only one who remembers THE BEATLES and decides to perform their songs and claim them as his own. He becomes successful but risks losing his best friend who's in love with him. Pretty good movie. Would recommend.

HOWEVER, one part that kept bothering me was Ed Sheeran. Ed Sheeran has a sizable supporting role in this as himself. The main character is from Suffolk (as is Sheeran) and Sheeran drops in after hearing the music on a local public access show. Sheeran acts a mentor to Jack and shows up now and then. I couldn't help but ask why Sheeran would take such a large role in this movie (which I'll address more below)

The parallels to Jack and Ed are a bit hard to shake. Why of all areas in England is Jack from Suffolk? Both men are odd looking ducks who, while not ugly, don't look like typical pop stars at all. Both men have a string of unprecedented hits of songs that don't sound too alike. Both men struggled for years until exploding out of nowhere (Kate McKinnon's character makes this observation about Jack which I, once again, thought was odd). More importantly, Ed Sheeran is married to his childhood best friend who he got together with after a string of high-profile relationships: something that mirrors Jack's love story in the movie.

All of this leads me to believe that Ed is from another reality and that his songs are that of another band/person who does not exist in our timeline. Some point around 2010/2011, Ed dropped into our reality and decided to capitalize on the situation. Two specific elements from the movie reinforce this belief of mine.

First, is the songwriting scene between Jack and Ed where he challenges Jack to write a song in 10 minutes. Ed's song is good, but Jack hits him with The Long and Winding Road. Not only does Jack clearly win the contest, but Ed looks hurt and ashamed. And then he makes a strange comment in which he calls Jack Mozart and refers to himself as Salieri. This is a reference to the 1984 film Amadeus in which Salieri considers himself inferior and a fraud in the eyes of God in the wake of Mozart's great talent. It's such an odd reference to make that I can't help but think that Ed must be telling us all that while he is talented, he can't compare to the person who wrote the songs he's famous for.

The second element are the two other people besides Jack who still remember The Beatles. They show up at Jack's album release concert and tearfully thank him for bringing their music back into the world instead of revealing his secret. I think this has also happened to Ed, but rather than the end of the film where Jack gives it all up to be with the girl, Ed is telling us that he has made peace with his decision, especially because it's brought so much joy to so many people.

I'm still unsure what the John Lennon scene means as I don't know who Sheeran's John Lennon would be, but it's probably happened to him as well.

TL;DR: Yesterday is about Ed Sheeran, an inter-dimensional traveler who is passing off someone else's songs as his own but in a wholesome way which everyone should be ok with.In the comics, when iron man died, his conscious became an AI while his body was dead. Iron heart took his place. At the end of Avengers: Endgame, the hologram on Tony Stark turns to face his daughter, Morgan. He faes her exact position, as if he knew she was there. A hologram doesn't just do that. My theory is that iron man's conscious was backed up into the iron man helmet before death, and he remains alive as an AI similar to the comics.**Beware spoilers, spoilers everywhere. You’ve been warned!!!**

**TL;DR: Peter losing a loved one is an** ***absolute point*** **in the timeline; it cannot be changed. Strange cannot take the cube containing the spell from Peter because Peter’s possession of the box leads to Aunt May's death. This point is unchangeable in the timeline. Her death motivates Peter to fully accept his responsibilities as Spider-man, which makes him Spider-man. Likewise, Dr. Strange’s “visitor” in the Multiverse of madness teaser is also because of an** ***Absolute point.***

>*An Absolute point in a timeline is an unchangeable moment or event that cannot be changed because of its importance to that timeline.*

# The Theory

There is a weird moment in Spider-man: No way home that no one is talking about. In a scene, Peter decides that he wants to save the villains instead of sending them to their respective dooms, but Strange disagrees. He wants to send them back using the button on the cube containing the spell. Spidey steals the cube, but Strange knocks Peter out of his physical body into his astral form. But in a twist, Peter’s physical body can still keep the cube away from strange even when peters soul is suspended in the air. Strange remark that spidey “ shouldn't be able to do that.” The crowd laughs, and this is a throwaway scene in the grand scheme. But what if this is way more important than we realize?

**So what's going on here**

I've seen some breakdowns where they say that Parker’s Spidey-sense lets him control himself in Astral form, but there is more going on here. This is an Absolute point in Peter Parker and Dr. Strange's timeline.

We were first introduced to the concept of Absolute points in Dr. Strange’s \*What if …\*episode. Dr. strange loses His love in a car accident and goes back in time to try to change this moment.  But no matter what he does, Palmer always ends up dying. The Ancient one states later in the episode.

*”Palmer's death was unchangeable, an Absolute Point; without it, Doctor Strange would never have joined the Masters of the Mystic Arts and eventually rise to defeat Dormammu.”*

Without this point in time, Dr. Strange never becomes a Sorcerer. Likewise, In *No way home,* if Strange is able to get the box back in that scene with the Astral disconnection, Peter Parker will never lose his Aunt May and become the Spider-man he was always meant to be.

>“In the grand calculus of the multiverse,their sacrifice means infinity more than their lives”  
>  
>\-Strange to Peter

This quote could be easily applied to Aunt May’s death, and her sacrifice is what turns Peter into the man he is destined to be. It is an *Absolute point* in his life. This is why Strange cannot take the box from Peter even though he is more Skilled, better trained, and able to separate Peter from his soul.

**Why it works**

The loss of aunt May is the moment he truly becomes Spider-man. This is the moment that all the Spider-men share. They all lose their moral compass, hear the iconic line and finally take on the full responsibilities. They are changed from Spider-powered teenagers to mature hero who knows the full cost of being a hero. It is the quintessential Spider-man moment.

So that moment with the cube is not a small gag but instead a starting point of Peter becoming who he was always destined to be.

Thank you for reading

**EDIT** . **To be clear I am not inferring that it is not his Spidey-sense but in fact, it is part of it. His spidey sense evolves at that moment** ***because*** **it is an Absolute point. What I am implying is that it is more than just his powers evolving, I am saying that this is a moment  where everything conspires to take him to where he needs to end up.** I admit I stole this from Tv Tropes; but honestly I thought it warranted some discussion. To me it makes perfect sense; Strange is a surgeon not an EMT but I'd be shocked if he didn't have treat at least one civilian causltity from the battle. 

**TL;DR: After a decade of imprisonment/ employment in the TVA fixing timelines, Loki finally figures out a way to free himself. Loki enters Westview and manipulates Wanda offering her the one thing that she desires, A Mind stone from another timeline. With a new Mind Stone, she could resurrect Vision.  In return, all Loki asks that she frees him. Once free, Loki promptly burns the TVA*****” to the ground*** **.” With the TVA destroyed, the Multiverse is unpoliced and quickly falls into madness, opening the doors for Kang to enter the world.**

***And in case your interest needed another boost. It is Loki posing as Pietro. Loki has only seen another universe’s version of that character. This is why he is different.***

**The Speculation:**

**The Master of Illusion.**

The Time Variance Authority sends its long-time employee/ prisoner Loki to investigate an odd  reality anomaly in Westview. He infiltrates SWORD using his illusions and disguises himself as an agent.  He volunteers to enter Westview dressed in a hazmat suit. When he encounters Wanda, he wisely turns tail and escapes.

Loki then shadows Wanda,  immune to her warped reality and undetected due to his own powerful magic (glamour). He can see through Wanda’s deception, so when he sees Vision, he sees the dead version that Wanda hides. So naturally, he sees a way to benefit from Wanda’s grief.

**Master of lies**

In episode 5, Wanda states that she does not remember how it all started. So Loki,  disguised as her brother Pietro, does what Loki does best ...he lies. He tells Wanda that the TVA trapped her there, and if she helps take them down, freeing him from his neck-strap explosive confines, he can get her the mind stone from a different timeline, a timeline before it was never destroyed.  With the mind stone, Wanda can bring the real vision back from the dead.

**Why Loki actually works better than Mephisto or  Harkness.**

The main reason here is simple character motivation. Wanda can free Loki, and Loki can get her the mind stone. Both characters need each other. But does Loki have the mind stone to give? Well maybe? In the Loki trailer, when he is in front of the mirror, you can see in the reflection that he has the scepter. In the last couple of episodes, this reveal would also be the holy crap moment that the show’s creators have been teasing.

This also leads perfectly into events we know are going to happen in the future. Wanda will get free, The Multiverse will fall into madness, and Kang will appear in Ant-man 3. The Loki show’s events could also show Loki learning the mind stone’s location so he can retrieve it later.The climactic lightsaber duel of Revenge of the Sith  is a largely even fight - neither Obi-Wan or Anakin has the upper hand until the end, when Obi-Wan comes out on top. [Anakin attempts to jump from a low position to a higher one behind Obi-Wan](https://youtu.be/pSwy412nttI?t=6m37s), but his master successfully defends against this attack. There is more to this move and counter-move than initially meets the eye, all due to the respective high and low positions of Obi-Wan and Anakin. When he shouts "it's over Anakin, I have the high ground!", Obi-Wan is thinking back to another duel years previously.

At the end of The Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan kills Darth Maul even though Maul has the high ground. In Revenge of the Sith, when Obi-Wan himself has the high ground, he's hyper-aware of being vulnerable from below [as he's seen first-hand that a kill can be achieved from the 'low ground'](https://youtu.be/kgRLAI02Tow?t=17s). The fatal move attempted by Anakin is near-identical to the one Obi-Wan uses against Maul - the lower fighter jumps to a position behind the higher fighter. It's not every day that you kill a Sith knight - Obi-Wan likely often replays the events of that duel in his head so this jump will not surprise him. When Anakin tries to use this move against Obi-Wan, he's prepared and easily defends it - Anakin loses a limb or three in the process.

So when Obi-Wan says "don't try it" just before Anakin leaps, he's more saying "don't try to jump over me because I've done it myself so it won't surprise me". Interpreted this way, the ending of the duel becomes a clash between experience (Obi-Wan) and arrogance (Anakin), which experience wins.

TL;DR Anakin loses because he attempts to jump from the low gorund to a position behind Obi-Wan - this is exactly how Obi-Wan killed Darth Maul so he is prepared and easily defends himself.Let's pretend that every kid coming to Andy's party in Toy Story knew that Andy was going to get Buzz Lightyear at the end of the gift giving for his birthday. Why? A totally badass mom. She bought it and told everyone on the invitation she sent out other possible gift suggestions to buy that help make the party more Buzz Lightyear themed. Everyone at the party knew Andy was going to get Buzz Lightyear at the end and prepared accordingly. The issue being that the army soldiers couldn't tell the difference that the sheets had a certain design on them, so all they would report is "He got bed sheets!"


As the change from Woody to Buzz happens we see even the slightest of changes, from the posters on his walls to the sheets on his bed


So when Mr. Potato Head asks the question, "Bed sheets? Who invited that kid?" All I can think is, "A real cool mom"We don't really know anything about the Joker, except that his origin changes depending on who he is talking to. When he encounters Gamble, a middle aged man, he tells a story about his father. When he encounters Rachel, he tells a story about his wife. With an older man, his father again. He even says to the older man "I hated my father." Each story is a traumatic origin for how he got his scars, with the wife or father being largely the cause. It's like he's working himself up to personally blame and hate the person he's talking to for his mutilation, making his killings always personal.Normal hotel bartenders are not that clued in on international crime figures or their beautiful yet deadly paramours.

Edit: I saw a discussion on the "James Bond is a code name used by different spies" thread and someone mentioned all of them ordering the same drink as evidence against it.

I know nothing about mixology, or Bond's backstory and characterization in the books. I just immediately thought of this when I saw someone poke a pretty good hole in a theory in a theory I like.

But it holds up outside that theory anyway. 

Do you brief your informants on every spy they will meet with, or give them all one phrase and tell your spies what it is?

Someone asks certain questions without ordering that particular drink, your informant plays dumb. Someone orders it but doesn't ask questions, they like (apparently) bad martinis and your informant ignores the false positive and doesn't *offer* information without being asked.

Bonds are cocky though, so they introduce themselves anyway. By now it might be considered a tradition or point of pride for those who assume the Bond mantle and hear stories of their predecessors.*Background:*

So we were talking about the upcoming Captain Marvel and Avengers: End Game movies coming up in the near future over lunch at my office, and discussing End Game in particular.  All the time travel theories for the movie bothered us because time travel is historically very difficult to pull off in a believable fashion, and also that seemed like a cheap hack-ish way for Marvel to "undo" the snap. So we discussed the other ideas out there, and one simple explanation popped into mind: what if they don't undo it?

&#x200B;

**Theory:**

Everyone is obsessed with "undo-ing" the snap.  What if they don't?  What if instead Thanos didn't actually wipe out half the universe's inhabitants with the snap, but instead created an alternate universe and tossed half the occupants into this other universe via the "dusting".  And this alternate universe is the one that Marvel moves forward with in the future.  What if the people who lived at the end of Infinity War are actually the ones who get left behind?

&#x200B;

*Thinking:*

Everyone who got "dusted" is strongly implied to still be alive moving forward in the Marvel franchise (Spider-man, Nick Fury, Dr Strange, Black Panther, Wasp, Most of the Guardians, Bucky, etc).  Everyone who is still alive at the end of Infinity War, have very uncertain futures in the movies moving forward (Cap, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Nebula, etc).  Looking at the list of "survivors", while it would be sad to no longer see them on the screen, they've kind of had their run already.  All the new guys got snapped, all the veterans were left behind.

If the snap gets undone, we still have headlining superheroes (Cap, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, etc) all waiting to launch into action to save the day again.  That's a problem based on the future planned movie schedule.  That means you'd have to kill off or explain why every major surviving character becomes retired after End Game's credits roll.  That's difficult to achieve.  Almost impossible to achieve even with 3 hours.

&#x200B;

*End Game Plot:*

What if the explanation is much simpler?  What if (at the finale of End Game) one of two things happen: 1) the survivors sacrifice their universe to save the other one, or 2) the survivors defeat the villain / scenario only to insure that the stones can never be used again, but the universes remain split.

&#x200B;

*What it would mean:*

Marvel loves the multiverse, and the Quantum Realm supposedly connects all the universes so there's still a chance here or there for a cross-over or cameo.  Leaving the Quantum Realm as the hub also leaves an out to why Ant-Man and Captain Marvel could still end up in the "new" universe, as they can both travel there.  (Captain Marvel is expected to based on her comic book history.)

It gives Marvel an easy excuse on how to introduce X-men and Fantastic Four.  They only exist in the new universe, not the old one.

It gives Marvel a brand new batch of origin stories for core character replacements.  She-Hulk becomes the new Hulk equivalent.  Bucky (or Falcon) becomes the new Cap.  Etc.

It gives fans closure to the original Avengers without (maybe) killing them all off.  What could be more heroic, and also solemn, than the characters overcoming the challenge just to make the right decision and let everyone still live, but just apart.

It also means Dr Strange totally kept his word that he'd sacrifice anyone rather than give up the stone.  (He'll get it back, and Tony will be "dead" in his universe.)  Also he's totally kind of a dick for seeing this end result and not telling anyone.

The only ones who know the fate of the original universe will be potentially Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Dr Strange.

It means the Black Widow movie is almost definitely a prequel.

It means Loki, Heimdall, and Gamora (sans some "I was actually in the Soul Stone and got released" deus ex machina) are really dead and gone for good.

If the original universe sacrifices itself (out on a limb) to save the new universe, they've already kind of given us reasons why.  Stark will save Peter (pseudo-son).  Rocket saves Groot (who called him "dad").  Cap saves Bucky and Falcon.  Okoye saves T'Challa.  Hawk-eye saves his family (likely based on speculation).  Hulk and Widow get to be with each other at the end.  Etc.

&#x200B;

*TL; DR:*

People who were "snapped" exist in an alternate universe and will continue the Marvel franchise forward with limited knowledge of what happens in End Game.  People who "survived" the snap will either be left behind in the old universe or sacrifice themselves to save the other universe.  And the new universe is where all the new Fox Marvel characters will appear.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Full disclosure I have to also give credit to my co-workers J and Dave.  Dave being the one who made the initial "sacrifice one universe for the other" suggestion that prompted the full fleshed out discussion I've articulated here.  Lunch discussions can be fun.My theory is that Moana’s grandmother also had the opportunity to restore the heart of Te Fiti when she was younger, but never had the courage to follow through and do it. This lead her to become the character we saw in the movie, who has a lot of knowledge about what Moana should do and how to do it, and is constantly guiding Moana along that path. 

Here are a couple points to support that:

-The first time we see the grandmother she specifically calls out the fact that Moana may feel that inner voice driving her into this quest. I think the grandmother had the same thing when she was younger. 

-The grandmother pretty much gives her a complete plan to restore the heart of te fiti: take one of the hidden boats in the cave, follow the star, find Maui and order him to help (including the exact dialogue that Moana later used), and then find the island

-The grandmother is obsessed with water and doesnt fit the mold of the rest of the islanders, in the exact same way as Moana

-She is constantly guiding Moana to break from the traditions by doing things like hanging out by the water and showing her the boats and inspiring her to look out at the water, when shes supposed to be doing her normal duties on the island

-Everything the grandmother predicted came true, and she was never once surprised by any of it. 

-The grandmother didnt have much actual support from any of the other islanders. Her story (which was 99% true) was used as nothing more than a childrens tale. 



Based on all this, I think the grandmother originally followed a similar path until she backed away. The sea probably gave her the stone as well, which lead to her researching what to do and coming up with the plan that Moana later followed. Maybe she even got as far as leaving the island and finding evidence of the spreading rot. But whatever happened, she gave up the stone and spent the rest of her life in regret. Her son clearly was never going to carry out her plan, but when Moana arrived she found someone that potentially could. The grandmother found a new purpose in grooming Moana to carry out the plan that she originally failed to do herself.One of the main criticisms of John Wick has been the coins. People got slightly confused about how the hell a gold coin could somehow cover the costs of various things in this universe. **John either overpays or underpays for everything if a single coin has a standardized value.**

I actually think I have a solution and it makes sense when you look at a few scenes from the movies. 

**The coins aren't a standardized value.** The topic is never outright discussed because nobody discusses denominations with real life currency. They just all look alike because they are from the same underground money system. That being said, each coin has a denomination. What that denomination is can be debated but it can be argued that some gold coins are worth more than others.

In terms of evidence?

They actually show us this in a very subtle way in certain scenes.

Whenever we see a large amount of these gold coins in the films, there is almost always a need to separate them into sections. They don't usually keep all of the coins together in one section but they instead separate them into rows.

That doesn't make sense unless there's a reason for it. What's the reason? The coins are different currencies and they're separating them in the same way someone separates 5s and 10s and 20s in a lockbox. 

**There's a scene in John Wick where he uncovers his secret lockbox in his basement.** When he finally opens up the box, what do we see? We see a cache of weapons and we see a cache of coins. What do you notice about this?

[The coins are separated into sections.](https://imgur.com/a/CMxNSlz) My interpretation of this is the coins actually aren't standardized in value and they are separated out by type. 

**There's a scene where John is on the rooftop of the Continental and he goes to speak with Winston.**

Winston is currently in a discussion with a mysterious man about gold coins. [He's examining a coin when he stated "Impeccable! Put these into circulation."](https://imgur.com/a/cVI1w7T) and then proceeds to place the coins back into the box. 

[Did you notice the coins in the box?](https://imgur.com/a/NLqJk2q)

They purposely separated them out from one another. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless you are doing that for a reason. What's the reason? The coins are different even if they all look like same. 

My argument is John Wick's currency system actually is more specific than we give credit. 

- When John gives a single coin for something cheap? We can assume it was a cheaper denomination of gold coin.

- When John gives a single coin for something expensive? We can look at that as handing a person their equivalent of a Benjamin. 

- When John gives multiple coins for a service that seems like it would be cheaper? He's mixing and matching denominations and basically handing the guy a 10 and a 5.

I think it makes sense and I think it would make this one aspect of the universe feel like less of an oversight.If Steve is trying to lay low when he goes back in time to spend a life with Peggy, it would make sense that he might use an alias. What if the Agent Braddock mentioned in Endgame was Steve, hence Peggy’s concern for his whereabouts? 

Jumping off from that, perhaps they settle down in Peggy’s home country of England to raise a family... including Brian and Betsy Braddock, either their children or grandchildren.

Captain Britain, the super soldier son (or grandson) of Captain America.We've all seen how pathetic Storm Trooper armor is, how it seems like it's made from cheap PVC plastic, how it provides what seems like zero protection from lasers or even the impact of an Ewok weapon. Finn mentions that the helmets don't even have full gas mask filtration in them. 

Building suits of actually useful armor to put on their never-ending supplies of recruits and clones would be prohibitively expensive. The Empire is spread all throughout the Galaxy, harvesting troopers and throwing them into battle, sending raw Space Janitors like Finn into fights, cloning morons and inscripting randos. 

The armor doesn't protect them. The armor isn't MEANT to protect them.

The armor serves one purpose - it's a cheap way to create a monolithic army of *fearsome appearing* warriors.

Cheap de-humanization.

Storm Trooper armor turns the Empire's forces from a ragtag group of humans into a predatory gleaming white mass of EMPIRE. It doesn't matter how much they miss, or how quickly they go down. There's always more and they are all the same. This serves the double-duty of making every Rebel have to fear a faceless, neverending mass of Troopers... and helping to remove the humanity (just like not giving them real names) from the Troopers themselves.

No clothing, no aesthetic, not even a visible face or hair. Just cheap white useless plastic, making you into another cog in the Empire's machine.

TL;DR Storm Trooper armor was never meant to protect. It's just the cheapest, easiest way to create a unified appearing army out of conscripts and clones.&nbsp;

[**"The Client,"**](https://i.imgur.com/LQNgVrl.png), played by Werner Herzog, is one of the more intriguing characters introduced in *The Mandalorian* thus far, and while this villain's backstory remains quite a mystery, we are given a number of clues that may open the door for some interesting theories.  

Here I will speculate on one such possibility-- that The Client's secret, hidden identity is actually that of long-lost Jedi Master **[Sifo-Dyas](https://www.starwars.com/databank/sifo-dyas)**!

Before delving into the various reasons this could be true, a quick refresher on the historical importance of the infamous Sifo-Dyas within Star Wars canon:

&nbsp;

---------------------------

First mentioned in *Attack of the Clones*, Sifo-Dyas was a Jedi Master on the High Council with unique precognitive abilities, who foresaw Clone War years ahead of time and attempted to convince the Republic to build an army in preparation for the coming conflict that he knew would envelope the galaxy. 
-
&nbsp;
Sifo-Dyas was eventually removed from the Jedi High Council for his persistent views on this matter; nevertheless, he went on to approach the **[Kaminoan cloners](https://www.starwars.com/databank/kaminoan)** on his own, and single-handedly commissioned the creation of the Clone Army, in secret, under the pretense that he still officially represented the Jedi Council.
-
&nbsp;
A few years later, some time before the events of *The Phantom Menace*, Sifo-Dyas disappeared while out on a mission, never to be seen again. Later it is reported that Palpatine and Dooku apparently hired a criminal organization to murder Sifo-Dyas, thereby allowing the Sith to secretly assume control of the Clone Army project in his place. 
-

----------------------------

&nbsp;

***However***, Sifo-Dyas' body was never actually recovered, and his death was never directly witnessed by any protagonists (or by the audience)... making it entirely justifiable for one to consider the possibility that his supposed death could, in fact, be a decades-old ***hoax***.

Towards that end, and in order to potentially connect the identity of **"The Client"** to that of the missing **Sifo-Dyas**, the following key ideas will be explored below:

&nbsp;

* **That the animated Sifo-Dyas as seen in *The Clone Wars* is markedly similar to The Client in both appearance and voice**

&nbsp;

* **That both Sifo-Dyas and The Client work closely with Kaminoan Cloners**

&nbsp;

* **That both Sifo-Dyas and The Client have expertise and experience with the criminal Underworld**

&nbsp;

* **That Sifo-Dyas-- a lifelong best friend of** ***Sith Lord*** **Count Dooku-- would have been the ideal recruit for Palpatine to target, and was very likely turned to the Dark Side rather than killed**

&nbsp;


* **That "The Client"-- who is possibly the main villain of the entire *Mandalolrian* series -- is very pointedly *not* given a name, strongly implying a hidden backstory of particular significance**

&nbsp;

Any one of these observations, taken individually, would not on their own necessarily merit in-depth speculation about "The Client." However, when considered altogether as a whole, they paint a very compelling picture-- a Venn diagram of increasingly unlikely coincidences that *all* intersect upon a single point: That of Sifo-Dyas.

Let us examine them in turn:

#Sifo-Dyas on Screen

The first question to consider is whether or not any previous on-screen appearances of Sifo-Dyas could potentially match "The Client" as we see him in *The Mandalorian*. The answer is, rather surprisingly: **Yes**.

Fans of the *Clone Wars* animated series will recall that Sifo-Dyas does make a single brief appearance.  In the final Episode of the final season, he appears to Yoda in an illusory vision.

This vision of Sifo-Dyas is very much what you might reasonably expect of a animated younger version of Herzog's "Client."  Not only in the basics, such as (timeline-appropriate) age, sex, species, and general appearance, but most notably in the very distinctive raspy, heavily accented voice.

Comparison:

[The Client VS Sifo-Dyas](https://youtu.be/mvAgxrvU_RM)

This is *not* meant to imply that Werner Herzog modeled his performance on the animated version, or even that he was cast with it in mind.  But it *is* significant, in that if the characters *were* revealed to be the same, the similarity is close enough in performance and appearance that fans wouldn't bat an eye.

It is, at the very least, a happy coincidence and opportunity that Jon Favreau or Dave Filioni might find difficult to resist.

#Cloner Connections

The primary significance of Sifo-Dyas in the mainline saga is due to his connection with Kamino, and he is known to fans mostly for having initiated the creation of the Clone Army in secret on that planet.

One of the first details surrounding the mysterious "Client" character that show watchers were able to deduce was that his scientist underling, "[Doctor Pershing](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pershing)," is wearing what is clearly the Kaminoan uniform of a clone, or at least that of someone trained by Kamino cloners:

See: [Kaminoan Emblem](https://i.imgur.com/r1xzGuA.jpg)

This, alongside popular theories that "The Child" (aka Baby Yoda) is also possibly a clone, makes it very likely that Kamino and/or Kaminoan Cloning technology is a key plot point of the series.  

One hypothetical possibility: Perhaps the entire underlying plot of *The Mandalorian* could involve **Emperor Palpatine**, who requires material from the young midi-chlorian rich Yoda-species clone to somehow facilitate his recovery and return to power... 

This would make a lot of sense, especially considering how conveniently the first season of *The Mandalorian* coincides with the release of Episode IX, *The Rise of Skywalker*. A direct Palpatine connection with the show (providing the fanbase with the beginnings of an explanation regarding how he comes back to life) would tie in with Episode IX rather nicely.

Also, intriguingly, the approximate year in which Sifo-Dyas commissioned the Clone Army coincides *exactly*... and suspiciously... with the exact birth date of Yoda Baby: around **40 BBY**, 50 years before *The Mandalorian*. Might Sifo-Dyas have also stolen a precious, rare Yoda blood sample from the Jedi archives, to give to the Kaminoans? 

If there's any truth to the musings above, who better for the Emperor-in-hiding to task with overseeing a Kaminoan cloner scientist, and capturing this Yoda clone... than someone who has such a significant history with Kamino, and was perhaps even involved in the clone's initial creation... namely, ***Sifo-Dyas***?

#Underworld Expertise

One of the central, key character traits regarding Syfo-Dyas that is mentioned several times is that he was also known to be an expert on the **criminal Underworld**.  

For example: 

[Yoda Investigates the Disappearance of Sifo-Dyas](https://youtu.be/BngCZytHWAE)

Here we see that Sifo-Dyas' reputation as an Underworld authority was so great that even the Chancellor of the Republic, the most powerful politician in the galaxy, turned to him for assistance in dealing with it. 

Leaving aside (for the moment) the troubling realization that Sifo-Dyas was apparently performing clandestine missions without the knowledge or approval of the Jedi Council, let us consider his Underworld familiarity in regards to the above ideas about the Emperor in *The Mandalorian*:

***If*** indeed Emperor Palpatine has tasked "The Client"  with tracking down Baby Yoda... it stands to reason that The Client... Sifo-Dyas... would naturally turn to his particular area of expertise: The criminal Underworld. 

And the Underworld is precisely where we find him in *The Mandalorian*, operating on an outlaw planet and contracting with hired killers and bounty hunters. 

&nbsp;

So, thus far, the *only* character details that we have concerning **The Client**:  

What he looks and sounds like... 

his association with Kamino and cloning... 

and his experienced familiarity with the Underworld... 

...all mirror the *exact* core canonical aspects that define **Sifo-Dyas**. 

As the saying goes:  "*One is chance... two is coincidence... but three* ***is a pattern***," usually indicating something suspicious.

But even assuming that The Client and Sifo-Dyas *are* indeed the same person... how is it that a former Jedi would ever come to work for the Empire in the first place?

#The Ideal Recruit

We know that one of the more insidious aspects of the Sith, and Palpatine in particular, was the ability to exploit the desires and fears of others and win them to their cause.

Both Palpatine and Dooku resort to the outright killing of enemies ***only*** after first attempting to make them a powerful asset or ally. We see this time and again, such as with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Dooku, Anakin, Luke Skywalker... all were at some point approached with an offer to join the dark side.  

Therefore, it seems *extremely* unlikely that the Sith would decide to simply murder Sifo-Dyas in order to take over the Clone Army project. Instead, they would almost certainly first attempt to **recruit** him, and at the time of his supposed "death," Sifo-Dyas was the quintessentially ***ideal*** target.  

Consider the following:

- According to the canonical novel *Dooku: Lost Jedi*, Sifo-Dyas and Count Dooku were *lifelong*, exclusive best friends who grew up together in the Jedi Order-- brothers, essentially.

- Sifo-Dyas had to hide his powerful precognitive abilities from the Jedi for years... for fear that they would literally lock him away because of it!

- Sifo-Dyas feared for the future of the galaxy itself, convinced that it was on the brink of disaster, and clearly did not believe that the Jedi were capable of defending or protecting it

- Sifo-Dyas was then humiliatingly and unceremoniously ***FIRED*** from the Jedi Council for his "extremist" views

- Sifo-Dyas then proceeds to undertake unauthorized missions on his own, sabotaging the Jedi archives to cover up his schemes, and even impersonates the Jedi Council in order to illegally ***raise his own secret army***! 

This all adds up to produce a very worrying profile-- that of an extremely dissident, vulnerable Jedi, ripe for conspiracy and desertion. 

Disgruntled, disillusioned, disaffected, and deathly afraid for the fate of the galaxy itself, Sifo-Dyas would have been uniquely susceptible to the lure of Darth Sidious and his promises of galactic stability and order... *especially* if Sifo-Dyas' literal *best friend* Dooku was helping make the pitch!

It's difficult to imagine Palpatine not having the acumen and awareness to seize upon this very obvious opportunity. The disgraced former Jedi High Councilor would prove a powerful ally indeed.

Sifo-Dyas even had ties with the criminal syndicate which was supposedly responsible for his demise.... theoretically making his death extremely easy to fake, and allowing him to carefully and cleanly slide into the shadows of the emerging Empire as one of Palpatine's most valuable tools.

#***The*** Mystery

Considering how much convoluted and detailed backstory was eventually outlined for a mere off-screen character like Sifo-Dyas, it almost seems as if George Lucas (and, by extension, Dave Filoni) had further plans for him all along. With his checkered past, and very suspicious, timely disappearance, Sifo-Dyas is particularly (and perhaps intentionally) well-suited for a surprise reappearance down the line somewhere.

*The Mandalorian* happens to be the perfect vehicle for just that, taking place in the perfect spot on the canonical timeline, with "The Client" presenting the potentially perfect picture of an older, sinister, fanatically Imperial Sifo-Dyas.

In fact, "The Client's" very name... or specifically lack thereof... strongly suggests in and of itself that there is an inherent mystery to be uncovered.  

Almost every character in *The Mandalorian*, major and minor, is given a proper name, either in the show itself or revealed casually through marketing: Cara Dune, Greef Karga, Kuiil, Moff Gideon, Omera, Dr. Pershing, Paz Vizla, etc, etc.  

It is the characters that are intentionally left *without* names that beg the audience to give pause and ponder, hinting an intrinsic depth of importance to their origin and backstory.  

"***The*** *Mandalorian*" ... "***The*** *Child*" ... both of these characters have remained nameless so far because their true origins and identities are clearly mysteries to be unveiled, vital to the series.

This is probably the case for "***The*** *Client*," as well. If he were merely an introductory quest giver or middle-management villain cameo, he would have been assigned a simple Star Warsy name, such as "Gorvan Du-Pan" or "Blam Supplebutt" or some such. Instead, the audience is being *invited* to entertain the possibility that he is something much, much more than a mere secondary character.

Therefore, it should be no surprise when The Client reemerges later in the story, incredibly more powerful and significant than initially believed... say, for instance, as a former Jedi Master whose name many fans will recognize, fallen to the dark side, working to see his Emperor risen again.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------

&nbsp;

Naturally, there are counterpoints and questions that can be raised, such as: If The Client is indeed a powerful former Jedi like Sifo-Dyas, how has he managed to stay out of the saga's spotlight all these years?  

This shouldn't be difficult to answer, even if only on a meta-level-- Fans went for decades before discovering that there were scores of hitherto unknown dark Force users behind the scenes that were never revealed or expounded upon until long after the films. 

Think of evil Force users such Asajj Ventress, Savage Oppress, Jar Jar Binks, and the many, many imperial inquisitors... it should be easy to imagine that Sifo-Dyas *also* could have existed all these years, in the background, loyally helping Darth Sidious bring order to the far reaches of the galaxy.  

Another issue worth noting is the matter of Sifo-Dyas' canonical age: According to the (canon) novel *Dooku: Lost Jedi*, Sifo-Dyas is about the same age as Count Dooku... meaning that he would be around **100** years old at the time of *The Mandalorian*, while Werner Herzog is, of course, only around **80**.  

This might normally strain credulity, except for two considerations: first, for the sake of a great character tie-in and reveal, the showrunners and storygroup would likely just hand-wave this relatively trivial difference, especially since only the tiniest percentage of fandom would even notice the small (book-dependent) discrepancy.

Secondly, given ultra-advanced Star Wars medical technology (and perhaps a touch of Sith alchemy?), it isn't much of a stretch to imagine Werner Herzog as a particularly spry centenarian.  Also, who's to say that at some point Sifo-Dyas didn't spend a few years frozen in carbonite?  Incidentally, in *Legends* lore, he ***was*** [placed in a cryogenic hibernation capsule](https://i.imgur.com/k53l49H.png) for some time after Dooku recovered his probably-not-so-dead "body"...

At the end of the day, though, it isn't really so much the meticulously cross-referenced minutiae of characters or carefully compared timelines that ultimately determine the likelihood or veracity of any given theory; rather, it is the motivation and the boldness of the creators behind the show, and what they are likely to think would make a great villain, and a great twist.

Werner Herzog as Sifo-Dyas *feels* very much like something that would occur to [these guys](https://i.imgur.com/MkI0pMS.jpg), steeped in Star Wars history, in a show that seems lovingly crafted to weave the prequel, original trilogy, and sequel eras together in as many creative ways as possible.

And speaking of potential prequel tie-ins...

Random unrelated bonus theory: >!Cara Dune is secretly Padmé Amidala's niece! Her real name is **[Ryoo Naberrie](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ryoo_Naberrie/Legends)**. Here is the actress giving us a hairstyle lineage hint: https://i.imgur.com/6D2iSAu.png !<

&nbsp;Anakin's performance fits his character very well. After 10 years of training as a Jedi, Anakin has become an emotionally stunted young man. His uncommon dissatisfaction with this lifestyle is due to the fact that he started training much later than other padawans, aka, he had a taste of emotional liberty before the Jedi made him stamp that out.

A lot of anakins angry or concerned lines are awkward because anakin doesn't know HOW to show emotions normally.  This is what makes him so fond of Padme; he remembers the emotion of love that she made him feel when he was a kid, and now longs to have that emotion back.Amanda Bynes was a young, well-adjusted comedic actress on Nickelodeon in the 90s and early 2000s. On The Amanda Show, she hosted the program as herself, providing segues between numerous short sketches in which she played various characters. On that show, she was famously stalked by [Penelope Taynt](http://i.imgur.com/mdpUOHB.gifv), an obsessive fan who looked almost exactly like her. Penelope went to great lengths to meet Amanda, going as far as stealing Amanda's nail clippings to use in an attempt to clone her, or kidnapping guest stars in hopes that Amanda would come looking for them.

Penelope would stop at nothing to meet Amanda--something she never accomplished during the series' run. Why was she so adamant about meeting her? It went beyond obsession. It went beyond love. Penelope wanted to meet Amanda because she wanted to *become* Amanda.

In 2010, Penelope finally achieved her goal. After subduing Amanda Bynes, she murdered her, dyed her own hair, got a pair of contacts, and began living the life of her idol. But of course, Penelope Taynt isn’t Amanda Bynes; she’s got a host of mental issues. Psychopaths tendencies, odd verbal tics, problems with emotional stability. Even as she did her best to imitate Amanda in every way, the cracks began to show. In March of 2010, ‘Amanda’ is fired from the Farrelly Brothers’ Hall Pass due to erratic behavior on set. In June of that year, she retires from acting. Why? Because Penelope Taynt isn’t an actress. Amanda Bynes was, but Penelope just wasn’t as good as the girl she replaced.

Since then, ‘Amanda’ has claimed to be un-retired, but hasn’t acted in a movie since 2010. In the following years, she began acting even more erratically, sending out odd and sometimes disturbing tweets. Penelope Taynt can’t handle the pressure of being Amanda Bynes. As she slowly realizes that her lifelong goal is impossible to maintain, she will continue to spiral into madness.In How I met your mother, everybody has a doppelganger. Four of the doppelgangers are foreign:

Moustache Marshall is a Hispanic lawer, stripper Lily is Russian, Mexican wrestler Ted. Barney's doppelganger, the gynecologist is half Armenian. 

But lesbian Robin looks very American/ New York, with her baseball outfit. Therefore, my theory is that she should have been the fifth friend, and Canadian Robin is actually the doppelganger.I think this episode is probably the greatest episode of television for the 00 decade. Maybe of all time.   
Many critics state that this is the best episode of the US version of the Office as it's filled with great performances by the primary cast members and swims into darker territory that still feels honest and real.   


* The snip-snap-snip-snap portion of the episode is a classic.  I think there's an extra layer in here. 

&#x200B;

Jan is upset that Dwight is there. Michael is fine with it.  Remember the rules.  Couples only.  If Dwight attended, he wouldn't be able to swing and would be a third wheel.  Michael explains that he brought a date. 

&#x200B;

* Jan plays lovemaking music that her assistant made not only for her, but about her.  She goes to dance with Jim instead of Michael.
* Jan hints to Pam about her past with Michael. It's in a jealous way, but keep in mind that Pam/Michael are on another level of not being self aware.  In Jan's mind she's trying to bring back memories of Michael to Pam. 
* Michael wears less clothing in the 2nd act. 
* The dinner is supposed to be at midnight.  
* Romantic candles are lit in every room. 
* The camera set up is left in their bedroom 

  
There's references to Abigail's Party & Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf in this episode. Both about partner-swapping parties.In the end of the movie, when Ego (the critic) comes to check Linguine's abilities as the new chef, the taste of the dish made him experience a flashback to his childhood, when his mother made him a similar dish.

That's because Remy (the rat) made the Ratatouille from the recipe he found at the old lady's house (from the begining), she was Ego's mother. She used to make him the same food and kept the recipe somewhere in her house, until Remy found it and studied it.

You might think it's not true since in the movie he takes the recipe from Gusteau's book.
BUT! Remember how they say Gusteau's Ratatouille was a failure? 
Well, Remy knew that and instead of making Gusteau's Ratatouille he made the one he learned from the old lady.

Edit: as people mentioned, Gusteau's Ratatouille wasn't a failure, but was considered a peasant food.
Also there is a chance that Gusteau's Ratatouille recipe was known even before he became famous, making the Ratatouille recipes that are always mentioned in the movie the same recipe that everyone used.Evidence: 

the first spiderman movie at disney/mcu was both a pun on spidey coming home to disney and also the title of a comic storyline. "Spiderman:Homecoming" was a storyline in the comics and is an obvious pun on spidey finally coming home to disney/mcu.

If we are to assume that disney wants to keep the tradition going, the obvious answer is to name their first xmen movie "Xmen: House of M." 

1) it is a VERY famous series in the xmen comics.


2) it is a pun on the xmen finally coming home to disney/mcu in that "House of M" can also stand for "house of mouse," a popular euphamism for the disney empire.


Speculation:


If you recall, the comic storyline of house of m chronicles an alternate reality that Scarlett Witch creates when she-- having lost control of of god-level powers-- cryingly murmers "no more mutants." Her wish is granted, and an alternate reality is created wherein there are literally no mutants.

If we extrapolate from here-- that the xmen movie will be named "xmen: house of m" and that it is loosely based on the comic storyline, we can infer that the storyline of the house of m movie will be that long ago, let's say around 2008, Wanda Maximoff, daughter of Magneto, lost control of her powers and in her despair she cried "no more mutants." In so doing, she created two separate realities: one with mutants (fox Xmen) and one without mutants (MCU)


The reality stone reveals this and at the end of the movie, the realities are merged.This theory has been in my mind since 2015 but I never got around to talk about it, and as far as I know I’m the first one. 

In one of the missions in GTA 4, you get to meet Jon Gravelli, the head of the Gambatti Crime Family, in his death bed. Jon’s former right-hand man is Sammy Bottino, and despite the fact that we never got to meet or even hear Sam’s voice via phone calls, he has a fairly rich history. 

Starting with GTA 4, If you visit the police records and search his name, you’ll find out about his crime records which are: 

1981 - Grand Theft Auto

1982 - Hijacking

1984 - Manslaughter

1993 - Racketeering

And him being “wanted for a murder in **Vice City**”

In GTA 5, there’s a random event where you get to save his daughter, Antonia, from being buried alive by whoever he made angry, and she tells you that Sam ran the east coast in the 80s and 90s. He was born in 1965 which means he was around 20 years old in 1985, for a character to run the east coast at such a young age is very interesting. 

I believe Rockstar Games wants another go for a mob story like Godfather and Goodfellas in the HD universe, and the reason we never got to see or hear him is because he’s planned to be a pivotal character which requires a proper actor.

This theory also doesn’t get disputed by the most famous GTA 6 leak which mentioned Vice City, missions in Liberty City (Where Gambetti Crime Family are based), and time jumps.

Edit: Since this theory is going around a bit, I would like to clarify a couple of points. 

- The Gambetti Crime Family are based in Liberty City, not Vice City. But since we know Sam ran the east coast, it leads me to believe that Jon Gravelli might have sent Sam to Vice City in the 80s to expand the family’s influence. Only time can tell for sure. 

- The murder charge on him was pinned in 2007, but it doesn’t tell us when exactly the murder happened.At the end of Season 7, Michael Scott decides to move to Colorado to start a new life with his fiancee Holly. DeAngelo Vickers (hired by Jo Bennett) is named his replacement, and Dwight is hurt to discover that Michael did not recommend Dwight for the job. I believe that this is because Michael recommended Darryl to be his replacement, but this idea was shot down by corporate.

**Why Michael did not recommend Dwight (or Jim)**

- If there's anything to take away from Michael Scott's reign as regional manager, it's the idea that sometimes the next person in line is not the best person for the job. Michael is a brilliant salesman, possibly Dunder-Mifflin's best, but despite all of his best moments he has proven time and time again to be a terrible manager. In Season 7, Michael finally proves to be a little more self-aware, and may recognize that the best salesman (Dwight) might not be the best *manager*.

- Michael also knows Dwight well enough to know that if he were put in the manager position, he would immediately fire many of Michael's friends (including Jim). Michael likes Dwight, but not enough to potentially put a great chunk of his employees out of work.

- Jim would be a seemingly easy choice for Michael to make, but Michael already knows that (1) Jim is more interested in continuing to be a salesman under Sabre's lack of commission cap, and (2) Jim ultimately does not see himself as a long-term employee of Dunder-Mifflin (at least compared to Dwight).

**Why Michael recommended Darryl**

- In *Scott's Tots*, Michael reveals that Kevin interviewed for a position in the warehouse, but Michael hired him as an accountant because he "had a feeling about him". This shows that Michael is open to hiring people out of rank or position (and also demonstrates why he's open to rehiring Ryan and hiring Pam as a saleswoman).

- Michael has shown time and time again to have a great deal of respect for Darryl, seeing him as a close friend and confidant. While this relationship is mostly one-sided, Darryl does often come through for Michael when it counts (helping him get a raise, comforting him after his breakup with Holly, and finally assisting him in his proposal).

- In Season 6, Darryl is promoted by Jo for demonstrating extraordinary critical thinking. While Michael is immediately jealous of this, he recognizes Darryl's brilliance and when he thinks that corporate is going to go forward with an idea that Darryl came up with, he tries to make sure that Darryl receives the credit.

- As the head of the warehouse, Michael probably realizes that Darryl has the most leadership experience in the office (next to Jim, who was briefly co-manager). He also sees that Darryl has strong relationships with his co-workers, and probably would not make any aggressive changes.

- Thanks to an incident where Darryl's worker's comp claim was put under scrutiny, Michael recognizes that Darryl possibly hates Toby.

**The Proof**

- In this scenario, Michael tells Jo that he'd like Darryl to be the new manager. Jo, who knows and likes Darryl, probably lets Michael down easy and tells him that Darryl just isn't management material, or isn't experienced enough.

- When Michael leaves, he gives gifts to most of his employees. Jim gets a heartfelt goodbye, Dwight gets a letter of recommendation (to make up for the lack of recommendation earlier), and Andy gets the branch's top clients (hoping it will make him a stronger salesman). What does Darryl get? *The only unfinished copy of "Somehow I Manage"*, Michael's self-written book on management. He even drops to Darryl "if there's anyone who can finish it, it's you."

**TL;DR:** Michael recognizes that Darryl would be the best choice to be the regional manager after he leaves. Corporate rejects this hire due to Darryl's lack of experience, which is why Michael gives him a book on management on his last day: he hopes that it will give Darryl the knowledge to take the position on later.So during the events of Spider-Man: Homecoming, Captain America is an international criminal. I found it unusual that the PSAs with Cap were still being shown in a public school in the US. The reason I find it unusual is because while public opinion of Cap may be divided, he is still considered an enemy of the state. Therefore, it is unusual that an enemy of the state and international criminal would be promoted in a positive light within public schools in one of the main countries opposing what he took a stand for. Seeing as how these PSA’s were most likely old and shown at almost every public school in the country (especially the Captain America fitness challenge video), these videos most likely would have been discouraged for further use through a directive by the Department of Education or pressure from high level government officials. 

So why would Peter Parker’s school still use the videos even after the government either discouraged or forced the stoppage of the videos? Because the principal, Principal Morita, is the grandson of Jim Morita, a member of the Howling Commandos (the elite unit that Captain America leads during WW2). I think that the principal had heard stories of Cap, and decided to, in a way, honor his grandfather through keeping the image of Cap around. In the ASCII Language (computer language), 42 is an * or "Wildcard"

The greatest computer ever built was asked what the meaning of life is and it literally told everyone in ITS language that "Life is what you make it"
In my opinion, the biggest plot hole in Avatar: The Last Airbender has always been Admiral Zhao’s refusal to kill Aang under any circumstances. According to Zhao, killing the Avatar would simply cause him to be reborn, so it only makes sense to capture and not kill him. This is absurd. The new Avatar would only be an infant at the time of Sozin’s Comet, meaning that the Fire Nation would have a 100% chance of victory if Aang were killed. Even after the Fire Nation’s victory, the new Avatar would never be able to learn airbending, or possibly anything else depending on how brutal the Fire Nation’s rule is. Zhao’s line of reasoning goes from absurd to absolutely ridiculous when you consider that Aang would eventually have died from old age and been reborn anyway. And by the way, this plot device of the Fire Nation refusing to kill the Avatar is completely dropped in Book 2 and Book 3.

However, while watching S1E13 *The Blue Spirit* on Netflix, I came up with some answers to this plot hole. For us the audience, it’s obvious that the Fire Nation needs to kill Aang to win the war, but Zhao’s reasoning can be explained by considering the perspective, information asymmetry, and motivations of the characters.

To better understand their perspective, we need to remember that capturing the Avatar has been the Fire Nation’s national obsession for a century. The idea of going through that again may cloud their judgement as they want to finally move past finding the Avatar. But, what about when Aang dies of old age, wouldn’t the search for the Avatar just start again once Aang inevitably dies? Well that goes back to information asymmetry, because Zhao doesn’t know that Aang is only 12 because he was cryogenically frozen in an iceberg. Zhao seems to believe that Aang was hiding for a century and somehow just stopped aging. It’s entirely possible that Zhao thought Aang would be an imprisoned 12-year-old forever.

But I think that the most important part of this answer is character motivation. I don’t think that winning the war was Zhao’s primary objective, I think that Zhao was first and foremost concerned with personal glory. The only way to *prove* that he actually captured the Avatar was to keep him alive, a dead body would only prove that he had airbending tattoos (which would eventually decompose, remember that they don’t have cameras). We see from the same episode that even Fire Nation soldiers distrust “Fire Lord propaganda”, so Zhao may have been very concerned that people would disbelieve that he truly killed the Avatar.

Character motivation also explains why this plot device was abandoned in Books 2 and 3. Book 1 Zuko and Zhao may have needed Aang alive, but Azula, Book 3 Zuko, “Combustion Man”, and Ozai simply needed him dead. Azula and Ozai cared more about winning the war than they did about honor or glory, Zuko needed people to believe that he killed the Avatar back in Ba Sing Se, and “Combustion Man” just wanted to get paid.

So, for these reasons I think it makes perfect sense for Zhao to refuse to kill Aang. In his mind, Aang would have been imprisoned *forever* and he would go down in history as the man who verifiably captured the Avatar who mysteriously never ages, as opposed to a narcissistic admiral who supposedly killed one child Avatar according to untrustworthy Fire Nation propaganda. As Colonel Shinu stated, this was Zhao’s vanity project more than it was an attempt to win the war.In MCU Timeline we haven't seen much of Fury since Age of Ultron. In Civil War he jokes that his "wife" had kicked him out. This can be taken as sarcastic. But actually he's spent the past few years not only hiding but making sure his family is okay while he has been in hiding.

[https://youtu.be/rOS6aj3Mi6s](https://youtu.be/rOS6aj3Mi6s)

* MCU MJ is always creeping up on people. Like her dad, she's hysterically shameless when it comes to inviting herself into other people's lives.
* Many of her outfits are similar to Fury. Black coat. Black shirt. 1:04 in the link above is pretty dead on.
* In Homecoming , MCU MJ's hair covers one eye. Although it covers her right eye - this should be relevant.
* MCU MJ is observant. Notice she knows everything about Peter. As if she's keeping a file.
* She literally profiles the people around her in her free time ( she goes to detention to draw portraits of people )
* "What are you hiding, Peter?" feels like a Fury line.
* Watch 1:16 from the Far From Home trailer. Now low at MJ at 10 seconds in. They have the same pose.
* Despite being an anti-authority smart ass, she's declared the LEADER at the end of Homecoming.

# The Political Rebel. MJ is anti-government through out the film. This can be seen as a nice character trait. But if you put into play that her dad is on the run from the current, corrupt government.

&#x200B;

* "Excuse me, can we go already? Because I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of an embassy before dinner." MJ is a bit of a political rebel like her dad.
* She sits out on the Washington Monument , this might have something to do with Fury not wanting his family to be tracked by the Government.
* "My friends call me MJ." MCU MJ gets called out about Friends by Ned. There's a layer to this. What exactly happened to MJ's old friends? She spends all of her free time at school so she's not hanging out with them in her free time.
* In the Washington Monument scene MJ wears a Sylvia Plath shirt. There's a quote "I know you are lost, I am far from home too" by Plath that might mean that Far From Home is about MJ as much as Peter.
* On the surface, Spiderman : Homecoming is a bit like the other MCU films (Thor, Ant-Man, Guardians) where it sort of forgets about the Government Conspiracy stuff that the Captain American series spells out.  Even Peter is pretty ignorant to why he's part of Civil War outside of the fact that Tony Stark wanted his help.  MJ is the only person who is political. We all know "that girl" or "that guy" at our school. But she might be the only person with knowledge of how dark the rabbit hole goes in the MCU - and maybe that's because it affected her personally.
* In the comics MJ's poverty keeps her from being an actress/model/artist. Perhaps MCU MJ's biggest issue is that she wants to be an artist but her family's situation prevents her from becoming widely known.

Other Notes :

This isn't the first time the MCU has humanized SHIELD agents. Agent Coulson's personal life was expanded on after the first AVENGERS film. FURY's past was opened up in CAPTAIN MARVEL. Lets not forget about Agents Carter & Carter.

Historically the parent-less Spider Man has a history of having complex relationships with friends parents. Harry's dad is Green Goblin. Liz's father is the Vulture. Gwen Stacy's dad is the police Chief, Felicia Hardy's dad was in protective custody from Shield etc,etc. This is a take that we haven't seen before.

MCU MJ's mom could be Maria Rambeau or an unknown. It'd sorta mean that Fury + Rambeau hooked up after Captain Marvel and had a child 5 years later. She could also be adopted by Fury in a Barbara Gordon / Jim Gordon way.

**The Big Big Big Question :**

Why would Fury send his daughter to a relatively out in the open speciality school in NYC if they are in hiding..... even if she was using a secret alias?

This might be where the theory falls apart. What we know is that Peter goes to a "special" school.Perhaps its a school that is an incubator for SHILED / other government agencies.

Fury might have had a different scenario that Hawkeye too.  Maybe he wasn't an active father in a normal family situation.  Guess we'll see.In the episode after Pierce dies, the members of the study group are forced to take a lie detector test to prove they didn't kill him (in actuality, it was to expose their worst secrets). In exchange for doing this, they all received an inheritance (including a nitrogen cooled bottle of Pierce's "hyper virile sperm"). However, Abed is (seemingly) the only one to not receive a personalized gift as well.

**Pierce's final gift to Abed was creating a situation where life legitimately did mimic TV, something he knew Abed loved.**

Having a situation in which a group of characters have their worst secrets revealed is a classic TV trope. It creates drama among a group, and forces explicitly stated messages, as well as clear character growth. For Abed, those were some of the situations he loved most, when human emotions were presented clearly, and resolved cleanly. For someone who can't understand other people well, that's basically a dream come true.

Even Abed noticed how the situation followed a pre-set pattern, with the reveal of a secret, outrage from a certain person, then having one of that person's secrets revealed. It was directly set up for the purposes of comedy, as well as forming a coherent plot.I have read and watched Harry Potter for the first time as an adult. One of the first things that jumped out at me was the use of latin in all of the spells. I know enough Latin, but not without reference. So please forgive me while I borrow heavily from [https://mashable.com/2016/06/02/harry-potter-spells-latin/](https://mashable.com/2016/06/02/harry-potter-spells-latin/)

To name a few; 

* Accio is latin for "I Summon".
* Expelliarmus is latin for "I banish weapon"
* Lumos is taken from the laten word "lumen" which means light. 
* Obliviate comes from the latin "obliviscor" which means "I forget" 
* Stupify comes from the latin "Stupeo" which means "to be stunned"

I can go on, but you probably already clicked the link to read your favourite spell. 

We use latin words for science and medicine because of the need to be incredibly precise. Using a dead language guarantees that you wont lapse into colloquialisms. A word will always have the same meaning.

In Harry Potter, focusing your mind is a very big part of casting a spell. But as we learn in the later years, an incantation is not necessary. They end up practicing spells without incantations, where Harry earns detention because Snape is a dick.

I think focus is a big part of casting a spell. Kids don't even need wands to cast a spell because their imaginations are so great. Harry inflates his aunt like a balloon with a simple engorgement charm, because of a teenager's rage fantasy. Young Tom Riddle even hurts kids before he knows he's a wizard because he's a little sociopath.

In the first year, the kids are trying spells with rhyming phrases. Seamus is trying to turn water into rum and Ron is trying to turn his rat yellow. I don't know if Ron's spell ever worked, but Seamus managed to make tea before he blew himself up. The point is, your mind has to be incredibly focused on something very specific. The words dont even matter. It's just a crutch until you can cast the spell on reflex. 

TLDR;

I think the use of latin is to help wizard kids hone their mind on a very specific outcome just as muggles use latin to describe something very specifically.In The Incredible Hulk, we learn that Bruce Banner's accident that turned him into the Hulk was caused by an experiment commissioned by the military and General Ross trying to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. To me, it doesn't make sense that they would get the serum wrong. This was decades after WW2, and many Hydra and Nazi scientists went to the US government, SHIELD or otherwise. It also makes sense that the Hulk would be created from a working Super Soldier Serum. In Captain America: The First Avenger, we learn that the serum exemplifies the traits of a person. Red Skull was evil before the serum, and he became even more evil and power-hungry after. Steve Rogers was good and empathetic before, and those traits grew with the serum. So I believe that Bruce Banner didn't get the Super Soldier Serum wrong. Usually in Hulk content, many of Bruce's character arcs involve him being filled with rage, even before he became the Hulk. The Hulk only personified his rage. So I believe that the Super Soldier Serum was created correctly, and it did it's purpose at both making Bruce physically stronger (through the Hulk) and exemplifying his trait of rage.It was probably just a joke and reference to Chris Pratt as Andy in Parks and Rec.

But, up till the point in GotG, Starlord was constantly on the run from his pirate friends, and before had to probably fight with them for scraps, once he felt safe with the Guardians, there was no need to constantly be on alert, he could also dine with friends.The original printing of "The Prisoner of Azkaban" contained an alleged continuity error that was corrected in later printings. However, if instead we examine the issue through the lens of the story's time travel, the conclusion is much more disturbing.

**The background:** Hermione Granger is in possession of the powerful "Time Turner" that enables her to travel back in time so that she can attend multiple classes at the same time.  Late in the story, she and Harry Potter use the Time Turner and watch their past-selves from afar.

**The alleged error:** On the first run through, Harry and his companions are exiting from a secret tunnel underneath the Whomping Willow tree.  The book explicitly describes the order in which they exit: Crookshanks (Hermione's cat) goes first in order to step on a special knot on the tree to keep it from whomping everybody. Next follow Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron Weasley.  Then comes Snape (unconscious and being levitated).  Then Harry and Hermione, and finally Sirius Black.

Now, when future-Harry and future-Hermione are watching the same event from the bushes, the order changes.  Here is the quote: "They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione. . . then the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black."

**Crookshanks is not mentioned, and Hermione exits earlier than before.**

Other than a boring misprint, the only other possibility is that someone from the future is meddling with time.  

Who and why?

The first observation is that it cannot be an effect of Harry and Hermione's actions, as their influence was already accounted for in the original timeline: Things happen that are later revealed to be their doing.

Who else knew about the Time Turner?  Dumbledore, The Ministry of Magic, and Professor McGonagall (as hers was the class Hermione needed the Time Turner to attend).  Which of these suspects makes any sense?

Let's consider the actual change: Hermione exits earlier than she did before.  Crookshanks is not mentioned, but clearly he had to have exited first, since the Willow is not whomping anyone.

Crookshanks is Hermione's cat.  He's the first one out, and if he runs off or gets into mischief, that could spur Hermione into rushing ahead in the queue.

But what mischief could Crookshanks be getting into that would result from one of the other potential time travelers?  

McGonagall, obviously, is an Animagus who, in particular, turns into a cat.  The presence of another cat, obviously, would cause Crookshanks to act differently from the original time-line.

**The Awful Conclusion:**  I propose that the most reasonable explanation is that McGonagall is a time-traveling cat-seductress.  She used a time-turner to go back in time to that moment of the book's plot to seduce Crookshanks.

Bear with me.  Let's accept for the moment that McGonagall does want to have sex with cats.  Then why bother time-traveling?

It would be risky to do it in the present.  She is known to transform into a cat.  Maybe her cat form would be recognized, but maybe not.  In any case, Professor McGonagall would be missing while she was off having cat-sex, and if a cat were spotted having sex with a strange cat during the time she was missing, that could raise questions, especially if it were a pattern.

No, it would be more prudent for her to engage in cat-sex only when she had a solid alibi: teaching her Transfiguration class, or grading scrolls in her office, attending a Quidditch match, whatever.  All possible if she uses the Time Turner.

Okay, but why that specific moment?  Well, that part is easy.  We know time travel is dangerous, as far as causing destructive changes to the time-continuum.  That is why a wizard must be authorized to make use of a Time Turner.  I think it is a safe assumption that McGonagall's trysts with tomcats would not be authorized, so she would need to cover her tracks.

If she were to cause an inadvertent change to the time-line, and that change were to be detected somehow, there needs to be some other known time traveler to pin it on.  Therefore, she has to engage in her debauchery at the same time and place that another time traveler was present, in this case, when and where Harry and Hermione time-traveled to save Sirius Black.

**The obvious follow-up question is: Every time Hermione is attending McGonagall's Transfiguration class, is a second cat-McGonagall back in Hermione's room being plowed by Crookshanks?**

I personally believe the answer is an emphatic Yes.  I think it would be safe, as any changes in the timeline would be centered around Hermione's room, and Hermione was an authorized time-traveler.  Further, as we may assume time-travel is a rare event, McGonagall would be hard-pressed to find safe instances in space/time to have sex with cats.  She would have all of these instances stockpiled so that she can use them at her leisure whenever she had the urge.  But over the long-run, she would need to use them all.  Futhermore, Hermione's room during the school-day seems like it would be safer than under the Whomping Willow with Dementors in the area during an important plot-event.  That means, if we accept what I have proposed about the continuity error, McGonagall probably had already exhausted all of these other opportunities.  In other words, there is a lot of cat sex happening in the background of "Prisoner of Azkaban."

**Professor McGonagall is quite a prolific cat-fucker.**In the beginning of The Incredibles, Dash is in trouble because his teacher claims he put a tack on his chair, and he has video proof. Everyone acts like they dont believe the teacher even though there is clear movement in the video. Since the secret identities of supers are protected by the government, it would make sense if the principals knew who in their school was super. Since he cant blow their cover, the principal acts like he doesnt see Dash move in the video.In the first Avengers movie, Bruce says his secret is that he's always angry, which is how he can turn into the Hulk on command.  

Since then, he's been part of this amazing group of people who deeply care for him, he's actually had a conversation with Romanov about settling down, and even on Sakaar when he stopped being the Hulk, you could see he was enjoying his time hanging out with Thor and the others (and if you remember back on Asgard, Bruce jumped out of the ship expecting to turn into the Hulk and landed on his face on the bifrost bridge). Most importantly, he hasn't had to live his life constantly looking over his shoulder since Romanov came to get him in India.  

So basically, Bruce Banner was unable to bring out the Hulk in Infinity War because he's been a lot happier/content lately than he was when he met the Avengers.If we take all the movies to be canon, Max possesses a few seemingly impossible features.

First, he does not age normally, if at all. In Mad Max the Oil crisis that has lead to the current state of decay is in progress. In The Road Warrior that crisis has run it's course and society, at least where Max is, has completely collapsed. In Thunderdome we find that sometime during the latter days of the Oil crisis there was a nuclear exchange between unnamed powers, and that this happened long enough ago to be legend. In Fury Road (and the game), our society is a the stuff of tales even to the extremely elderly, and elements that have survived have drifted culturally and linguistically (guzzlene, Aquacola, remnants of Norse culture combined with the seeming worship of the roads and the vehicles that traverse them).

This puts Max generations outside of a normal human lifespan, possibly by centuries.

Second, Max is an agent of change. Though never the inciter of whatever incident in which he becomes embroiled, he nevertheless becomes the key figure in inciting change for the people around him (though notably, never for himself). Over and over he punishes the wicked, and either allows the righteous to seek a promised land, or in the case of Thunderdome, leads them there himself (though again it is not for him).

Third, on a chrome horse he rides. Max can operate any road vehicle with expertise equal to, and usually better than, anyone else we see. He also possesses many versions of the same vehicle, with no explanation of how he acquired not just a new car, but the same car, as it is nearly always destroyed.

Fourth, Max is unreasonably durable. Surviving and performing with apparently serious injuries time and again, and though not unique to him, he is an extraordinary combatant.

Conclusion. Max is a horseman in a now irrelevant apocalypse, though he is certainly not aware of that fact. He is driven to travel endlessly, unconsciously guiding the righteous toward salvation (though of a purely terrestrial kind) and punishing the wicked. He possesses supernatural longevity, likely until his purpose is fulfilled, and he also possesses several other seemingly supernatural traits (such as always being able to find another interceptor), though he seems to be aware of none of them. His true purpose subverted by our own self-destruction, he is doomed to wander.

EDIT: To answer the speculation of so many on which Horseman max represents in this theory, I believe Death fits the best. No matter what the scenario the thing that Max brings the most of is Death. That is the currency with which he most effects the change I described.So I've seen bits and pieces of this theory floating around but I haven't seen anyone explicitly proposing what I'm gonna say so here we go. Feel free to downvote if I'm being redundant. 

So we all know now that Bran manipulated events to put himself on the throne. He revealed Jon's real parentage to drive Dany over the edge and get Jon to kill her. He also had to get Jon out of the way for it to work. It's also been said by some people that Bran is not Bran, the 3 Eyed Raven took over his body and I agree with that. But who is the 3ER really, and why did he want the throne?

The theory: the 3ER is the enemy god of the Lord of Light. The LoL and the 3ER have been engaged in the REAL game of thrones this whole time, like Varys and Littlefinger behind the scenes. 

The LoL wanted Dany and Jon on the throne. Jon was always the Azor Ahai, or he was meant to be. 3ER manipulated those events to prevent him from being the hero, giving it to Arya instead. I also think the LoL was literally controlling the dragons, or at least Drogon. His tantrum toward the throne at the end and why he didn't kill Jon for killing his mother are evidence of that. He's also a god of FIRE. 

Meanwhile, I believe the 3ER also created the Night King. This is evidenced by how the Children of the Forest served him when he met Bran. The Night King's advances are what allowed him to take Bran's body, as well as weaken Dany's army. 

This means that the whole "song of ice and fire" refers to the conflict of these 2 gods, and that has been the story all along. In the end the 3ER outsmarted the LoL and won the day. What it means for Westeros, i don't know. But Bran is off to hunt down that dragon and secure his power by taking out the LoL's last big weapon. 

Anyway, would love if y'all could expand or poke holes in this for me, but as it is, it's dark and epic and it's my headcanon and I think it's all there in the story. Thoughts?When Aang meets Roku's dragon he mentions how it must be Roku's animal guide like Appa is to him, but Appa isn't Aang's guide. It's really Momo. There's a bunch of reasons.

1. Momo first joins the Gaang when Aang enters the avatar state and reveals himself to the world again. This is the point when he will need an animal guide. 

2. They leave Appa all the time to go on various adventures, but Aang always has Momo with him. Once he gets Momo, him and Momo are pretty much inseperable.

3. Momo often times reflects Aangs emotions. There are a lot of animation and scenes where Momo is on Aang and amplifying the emotions Aang is feeling. Momo is also very similar to Aang personality wise. 

4. It explains why Bumi is so concerned about the whereabouts of Momo.TL;DR: Obi wan is hiding himself and Luke from the rebellion because he believes that their involvement in the fledgling rebellion would bring the empire down on the rebellion before it has a chance to get started.

The theory:

After the fall of the republic, Obi-wan is in a tight spot. He is a highly recognizable figure from the republic. He belongs to an order of space wizards that are literally on a government-sanctioned hit list. And he has to protect a young boy he believes to be the chosen one all while hiding from the hate-driven Darth Vader.

 It seems pretty cut and dry. Obi-wan is hiding Luke from Vader and the empire. But since Vader is not aware of Luke’s existence, and Obi-wan is most likely presumed dead, what are the real reasons.

 Obi wan is hiding not from the empire but the rebellion. He knows that if Vader were aware of his survival, he would send the entire imperial forces at the rebellion. Vader is fueled by his hate of Obi-Wan and would stop at nothing to destroy him and anything associated with him. With the rebellion already fledgling and small, Obi-wan knows his involvement would bring down the hammer on the rebellion before it has a chance to get started. 


 Another reason is the fact that he believes that luke could be used as propaganda. At this time, people believe that Anakin Skywalker died a hero defending the Jedi Temple during the republic’s fall. The fact that Anakin turned to the dark side and was rechristened as Darth Vader is known only to a few. So the rebellion would love to have a son of the most powerful war hero/ chosen one as a morale booster and recruitment tool, unaware this would bring the empire down on them harder. It would also make Luke very easy to find.


The third and by far, the saddest reason is understandable, simple shame. Obi-wan is afraid that people will blame him for his part in the fall of the republic and the Empire’s rise. He trained the galaxy’s most vicious mass murderer and failed to detect the evil Papeltine right under his nose. I think this is why he doesn’t train luke earlier or try to contact him. He is afraid that it was something he did that lead to Anakin’s fall. He is essentially Anakin’s surrogate father, and he feels responsible for him and his actions. He hides to protect Luke, but he also hides to protect himself. It’s hard to join a rebellion when you are responsible for what they rebel against.


Well there it is. What do you think?Most dystopian backstories for Teletubbies suppose the teletubbies are "slaves" who are being trained or indoctrinated to eventually leave their paradise and live out their days toiling as unthinking citizens of some dystopia.

For one thing, what kind of work do you suppose teletubbies are qualified for? They don't seem physically or mentally equipped for even the most menial assembly line work or hard labor, even compared to, say, a seven-year-old. Hell, five-year-olds at least have fingers.

For another thing, The teletubbies' freedom doesn't actually seem that restricted. If you still think an Orwellian tyrant is someone who reminds you to take a break from frolicking so you can have a meal, watch a movie, or go to sleep, I hate to imagine what a brat you were as a child. The teletubbies have no responsibilities whatsoever, except tending to their own physical needs and being nice to each other. They get to spend all of their time running around, doing what they please, playing with their and occasionally being entertained with fun activities

No, what I think we're seeing is the distant future of a transhuman civilization like the one in *Wall-E* or *Idiocracy*. Humans became so dependent on and integrated with their technology that they were invalids without it and the robots were running the whole show. The robots still felt obliged to serve the humans -- that was their purpose -- yet still had to come to grips with the fact that their "masters" were increasingly less intelligent and unable to live independently.

What it meant to keep humans happy became an increasingly difficult philosophical conundrum, the less humans were capable thinking deeply about that question themselves. The only puzzle more difficult was what it meant to keep humans human, when the humans had become so fond of genetic and cybernetic modifications.

Allowing humans to reproduce freely had long passed out of the question, as a simple matter of resource management. On the other hand, their more thoughtful ancestors had on the whole been very adamant about not wanting to completely transcend their flesh and live in a simulation. So the job of manufacturing human-like beings, and deciding how many of them to manufacture, fell entirely to the machines.

Eventually, it was decided the size of the human population maintained was irrelevant as long as it was non-zero (though it had to be a little more than one, given that humans were social animals), and the humans were allowed to be free and cared for, and maintain some sort of connection to their heritage as members of the human race.

That part about heritage is the purpose of the daily transmissions from the antenna. There's very little that suggests training or indoctrination in those videos. No, their purpose is to give the teletubbies a glimpse of what it was like to be human in the latter days off the old world. To show them what it was like to be an old-fashioned, natural born person.

But why? Same reason humans keep pandas around. Same reason a car's airbag goes off. Same reason people care for their ailing parents. The machines were designed and instructed to indefinitely preserve humanity in some semi-recognizable form, and that's what they're doing, as best they can, despite their creators' best efforts to destroy themselves.There are countless clues in the books and movies that show how a shitty wizard can get away with forcing sexual gratification.  

The simplest one is the love potion sold at the Weasley shop.  It caused the infatuation that Ron had with Romilda Vane and could easily be slipped to anyone that you want to have sex with.  It’s probably not the best idea for a wizard as the potion wears off and the recipient could be like “what the fuck?”  In fact this is what Tom Riddle’s mom used to dupe his dad.  Giving him a daily dose to keep him “in love.” 

Another spell used by would be rapists would be the memory spell Gilderoy Lockhart used in Chamber of Secrets. This would indicate that a full on assault took place and the scumbag wizard then just wiped their memory and told them they “fell down stairs” or something.

Then, another tool to dupe someone into bed is Polyjuice potion.  You take on someone’s full DNA makeup. All you have to do is get a hair or something and bam, you can bang their wife/girlfriend/husband/boyfriend. Even pretend to be their crush, smash and then leave them to hate the real wizard for not remembering the sexy times. 

And finally, you have the imperius curse.  Basically you just wave your wand at someone and all the sudden they’re consenting. 

With all of these tools at their disposal you can’t assume that all wizards are on the up and up.  Rape is probably a huge problem in the wizarding world and no one knows about it.He ate the wrong neighbor's cat. The neighbor's cat he should have eaten killed the rat that brought Scott Lange back from the quantum realm.

I haven't any evidence to back this up other than I'm stoned and it's funny.

Edit: also alligator Loki is from duckworld. This adds nothing to my theoryThis was my original thought when I first saw the movie, but I decided to wait until some of the hype died down before posting it. I postulate that Kylo Ren went to the dark side because he was, at best, a mediocre Jedi.

Here is how I believe things went down.

Luke started the new Jedi Academy and things were going pretty great. He has a bunch of students and is teaching them the ways of the force like Yoda taught him. But I also believe that Luke's academy was very different from the old academy in one way. He did NOT teach light saber combat, or at the very least he was withholding those lessons for students who earned and/or needed them.

I have a couple different ideas backing up this part of the theory. First being that significance placed on Luke's light saber, as if it is a rare thing. I understand it is also significant because it is Luke's but I think it is telling that it is not a new saber.

The second is Kylo's saber. He uses what is basically a crude light saber, one that is not properly built. A lot of the old order Jedi training revolves around creating your first saber. I believe Luke cut this out and therefore Kylo built his own, possibly using an incomplete holocron or something similar. 

As for why Kylo built the saber in defiance of Luke's teachings, I believe it is because he was not a great force sensitive.

When we first see Kylo, he uses the Force to stop a blaster bolt mid air. This makes for an incredible badass looking scene. But what if that "trick" wasn't hard? There is an old quote, that basically says even the greatest fencer can be disarmed by a trick he does not know. Another important detail is stopping a bolt is a DEFENSIVE maneuver, something maybe developed by Luke, whose school places importance on using the force defensively.

Throughout the rest of the movie, we see him struggle with the force. He doesn't commune with Vader's force ghost, he struggles to pull information out of people, he does poorly in a saber duel with novices, the list goes on.

So, putting these facts together, I sum up my theory as this :

Kylo is told all of life that he is destined to be great. He is lavished with praise as a child when he so much as takes his first steps. He is told stories of how awesome and great his mother, father, uncle, and grandfather were. About how powerful they are with the force and that he is surely going to be one of the greats. He is ballooned with pride, and maybe Leia and Han are somewhat absent as parents (Han not being the father type, and Leia running the New Republic). Now he enters the Academy with great pomp and circumstance. Unfortunately, while he is force sensitive, he isn't great. He tries the force lift, but someone can lift more while he struggles with adequate. He tries mind tricks, but always seems to be just short of convincing the guards whose droids they are looking for. Maybe he is pretty good at force boosting physical abilities, but that show off Chaz manages to edge him out every time.

Now he is getting frustrated, and can't find what he is good at. So then he thinks about all of the stories. About how his Grandfather was suppose to be a great warrior. About Vader's epic fight with Luke in  Cloud City, or how he defeated the great Emperor. So he thinks, "I'm great, I know I am, its just that my ~uncle~ won't give me a light saber because he knows I would be too great for him". He starts fetishing the great warrior Vader. 

With the seeds planted, Kylo beings to seek power. He finds Snoke, the Knights of Ren, and builds his cracked saber. He falls to the dark side, returns to the academy and slaughters everyone who made him look bad. EDIT : Kylo was able to dispatch the other academy members (who were better force users) because Luke did not teach combat (at least, not yet), and they certainly did not have sabers, so its a case of him being better prepared (also he had the Knights, who we know nothing about). Also he could have used a trap. As for why Luke himself didn't stop Kylo, well, that is probably for a different theory.

So there you have it. My theory on Kylo's journey to the dark side.

EDIT : A couple expansions and rebuttals to common comments.

- On Kylo's performance in the saber duel - It has been pointed out repeatedly that Kylo took a shot from the Bowcaster and kept fighting. This is indeed a worthy feat as the strength of the bow-caster is shown to be tremendous. In my defense, I am a big believer in this comic showing Chewie's thought process at the time http://tysonmurphy.tumblr.com/post/136936953919/star-wars-7-spoilers-a-quick-little-comic-i . So while wounded, I think Chewie put a shot where it would not be fatal on purpose. Second I hold the force users to a higher standard, and there have been jedi/sith/whatever that have fought through more grievous wounds. Lastly, I interpret Kylo pounding on his wound as a way to focus his dark side power, as opposed to how other people interpreted it as him trying to stop the bleeding and/or the pain. Dark side users tend to draw power from pain, and that is how I saw it.

- Concerning mind reading - Kylo does get information out of some people. But other powerful force users seem to be able to read others like open books while Kylo struggles.

- MEDIOCRE! - (sorry) - Anyway, when I say Kylo was a mediocre pupil, I do not mean he was ~bad~ necessarily. I am using the word in its natural sense. I believe he was competent, just not GREAT like uncle Luke and grandfather Anakin. Maybe he even was great at like one thing (like maybe he is truly great at energy manipulation using the force, hence the blaster bolt), but he felt he was suppose to be great at EVERYTHING. Then he just wasn't. And then every time he came in second, or third (or worse) in class he slipped a little more until he finally snapped.
 I've seen this speculated several times on why Garfield, a house cat without a job or obligations, would especially hate Mondays.  And sure, this is a funny trope to give to this animal, and something the readers could relate to, but there's a much easier explanation on why Garfield developed a distaste for Mondays.

If you read the Wiki on Garfield, it says this about his origins:

> Garfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special Garfield: His 9 Lives to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.

The key is he was born in an Italian Kitchen.  Most "Mom and Pop" restaurants, if they have a day off, will close on Mondays.  And on Mondays, Garfield was forced to subsist on leftovers because no one was there to fix fresh food.  He hates leftovers, and that led to his distaste for Mondays.

Sure he doesn't live there now, but this day resonates with him because it left a mark on his fragile, young mind.

Feel free to include any thoughts you might have on this issue, and thanks for reading.When Wesley wakes up in the pit of despair, he is greeted by an albino nurse with a very stereotypical, high-pitched cockney "Medieval Torturer" voice. 

We get the usual gag of him coughing and clearing his throat and speaking normally, and as the audience we believe the previous voice was in fact a symptom of his throat being congested. 

However! Remember too that this is a meta-narrative. We're watching a story that the grandfather in the story is reading aloud to his grandson. I think this scene is a result of the grandfather reading the story trying to do a voice for the Albino Nurse that he couldnt keep doing because it was too hard on his throat, which is why he coughed and sputtered. Apart from the british accent, the Nurse's voice is very similar to the grandfather's in tone.

tl;dr: The Albino Nurse changed voices because grandpas voice acting skills are sub-parFrom what we see in the trailers for The Joker, Joaquin Phoenix's joker seems to be less of an evil murderous lunatic and more of a disruptive, revolution-causing agent of change. An agent of chaos, but chaotic good rather than chaotic evil. He is also, literally, a clown.

We also see in the trailers that Bruce Wayne is just a child at this point. It will be at least 10 years until he becomes Batman (assuming he starts at the age of 18-20.).

Joaquin Phoenix is 44 years old. His Joker is likely around the same age. There's no way a 55-year old Joker could keep up physically with a Batman in his prime, and there is little indication that Joaquin Phoenix engages in physical violence in the movie, let alone organized crime.

Also, in the latest trailer, protesters hold signs saying "We are all clowns", and that people other than Joaquin are wearing clown masks. 

I believe that in the movie The Joker, Joaquin Phoenix's character will begin a huge social movement which will spiral out of control, bringing the corrupt and stagnant Gotham into a violent but equalizing upheaval. With Thomas Wayne as one of the figureheads of Gotham's establishment, I think that the murder of the Waynes will be an indirect consequence of this movement. Also, it will be a decentralized movement similar to Anonymous, with no leader or organization. Thus "we are all clowns". 

Another bit of evidence for this is that Joaquin requests to be introduced on a talkshow as "Joker". He doesn't want his name to be known, but rather be known as the figurehead and icon of his movement

A more direct consequence, though, will be that further down the line, a younger man who believes in chaos, violence, and anarchy will take up the mantle of "The Joker", using the old movement's name and imagery to make himself and his goals clear. This will be the Joker who Batman eventually fights.

TL;DR The Joker is really a prequel to Batman, with Joaquin Phoenix being a more peaceful revolutionary, but inspiring the crazed murderer supervillain Joker down the later.Throughout the original trilogy, Darth Vader is most commonly referred to as “Vader” for short by the other characters, or as “Lord Vader” by his subordinates. As the Star Wars universe has expanded, we’ve come to understand that “Darth” is a title bestowed on Sith lords. Yet during their battle in A New Hope, Obi-Wan Kenobi calls Vader “Darth” for short when he says “You can’t win, Darth...” 

This doesn’t make much sense unless we consider the history of Obi-Wan and Vader. The man under the armor, Anakin Skywalker, is the man Obi-Wan knew and remembers. Vader’s betrayal also no doubt left bitter emotional scars on Obi-Wan. When Obi-Wan calls Vader “Darth” it’s his way of mocking and dismissing the Sith title. It’s like calling out a quack psychologist by derisively saying ok, “Doctor,” or calling a spoiled demanding child “your Highness.” Obi-Wan is basically saying, you’ve chosen this path, adopted this name and all the fear and power that goes with it, made yourself the most feared man in the galaxy, and yet, with all that, “Darth,” you still can’t win. Young Obi-Wan was a pretty brash, witty, maverick underneath the desire to be more like Qui-Gon, and his use of “Darth” in this context is a throwback to that young man Anakin once called master and friend.Idk how far fetched this sounds, but hear me out.

Anyone who plays Minecraft has most likely experienced the cave sounds.  You're chilling and mining some ores for your kickass base, when you suddenly hear a ghostly wail, or a distant wailing sound.  So what are these noises you occasionally hear in caves?

I think that the noises are just hallucinations.  You're inside of a cave with little to no oxygen, by yourself, so you're bound to hear some spooky shit down there.  The mind begins to play tricks on you in an environment like that.

If you listen to the [cave "ambience"](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ambience#Cave_ambience) you see that they aren't water dripping from stalactites or something, but rather the sounds of wailing, ominous humming, something that sounds like a large creature breathing, static, minecarts operating, and even Predator (I shit you not, look at sound 19)

These don't sound like natural cave noises, but rather, something scary you'd imagine inside of a cave.  Breathing of a monster, wails of vengeful spirits, distant minecarts of a ghost mine, and I guess Predator.  With the lack of oxygen in the caves, and the fact that you're by yourself with no other human interaction, you begin to hear things inside of the dark scary caves that are already infested with monsters.

tl;dr: the cave sounds are just auditory hallucinations of scary things like ghosts and giant monsters you think are inside of the cave caused by you being in an enclosed space by yourself with barely any oxygen, and a lot of co2.

Edit: I meant sound 19 for the predator noise, my badWhen Lexcorp first started, it was wealthy, but not especially so. It took up only about 10 floors of an office building. It also focused solely on aerospace engineering. Later though, it became a massive corporation, buying up hundreds of smaller companies, and according to Superman, employing nearly 2/3rds of Metropolis alone. It covered tons of markets: medicine, beauty, educational materials, chemical engineering, software design, real estate, media, and more. In comics, Lexcorp is generally portrayed as a mix of Amazon, Google, and Apple combined. 

So, how did Luthor manage to turn a relatively small company into a business conglomerate capable of overthrowing major world powers? Easy: Luthor owns a number of construction company, and manufactures fights with Superman in order to trash the city, and create a market. Lex would spend a fraction of his money on some kryptonite, or a robot, then make back his investment ten times over when Superman trashed a few city blocks fighting it. We've seen repeatedly that Superman has no real idea how to mitigate collateral damage, and considers throwing someone through a building a viable option to destroy them, so Lex would be practically guaranteed a positive return.Spoilers abound. Be warned. 

At the end of the movie, we see a visibly older Joker with a psychiatrist who he kills for seemingly no reason. Those familiar with Batman lore know that the Joker tells several ridiculous lies about his past for a variety of reasons. Going off of the Animated Series, Joker told Harleen Quinzel a bunch of stories in order to gain her sympathy. I think he's doing the same here, and the entire story is an elaborate ruse to get sympathy for the devil that he's telling to the psychiatrist. 

The clocks all being at 11:10 is a tell here. Joker is telling a short story that doesn't take long, and the clocks are a kind of reality in a fable. 

Another tell is the similarities between the psychiatrist at the beginning of the movie and the psychiatrist at the end. Besides both of them having the same skin tone, they simply look similar. I think they even have the same hair style. Joker is drawing on his real world surroundings to add substance to his story, and he may be doing the same with Sophie.

"You wouldn't get it." The psychiatrist doesn't get the joke because the joke is that Bruce Wayne is just as crazy as Joker after losing his parents, and Joker knows this and finds his archenemy's life just as funny as his own. 

We, the audience, fell for this story and the joke is ultimately on us because it worked, and we symphasize with the clown prince of crime, when in reality he is still just that mass murdering terrorist without a real name.(I found a comment in [r/TheLastAirbender](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/) suggesting something similar to this and developed it. Hopefully has not been done before).

In the third episode of ATLA, Aang returns to his home at the Southern Air temple, where he finds that the Fire Nation wiped out his people. Most specifically (and heart breakingly) he finds the dead body of Monk Gyatso, his adoptive father, surrounded by dead fire nation soldiers ([Fig 1](https://imgur.com/a/K7ru8Mq)). You would assume that the fire nation soldiers killed him.

However, on second glance, this scene seems a bit... odd. Gyatso's bones and clothes don't seem to have any burn marks on them, like you'd expect from someone *murdered by firebenders*. In addition, there's at least ten or fifteen fire nation soldiers there. Remember, this attack happened during Sozin's comet, a time when even regular firebenders got supercharged. It'd be the equivalent of every Army grunt suddenly becoming a Navy Seal. For a monk who can only act in self defense, that's pretty impressive to take them all down alone. It's even more so when you remember airbenders thrived fighting in open spaces, when they could use their superior agility and speed to move around and avoid attacks. In this case, Gyatso was trapped in a small space.

**Gyatso lured Fire Nation soldiers into a small area, then sucked the air out of it, killing both them and himself.**

It's been established that airbenders can kill people by sucking out air ([Fig 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nb2DbTAUkCA&ab_channel=JordiMulder)). Gyatso was an airbending *master*, with decades of experience and training. If Zaheer could pull off that move after a week, Gyatso could easily do it in a small enclosed space.

Fire needs oxygen to burn, meaning that, by sucking out the air, Gyatso deprived the firebenders of their only weapon. They were effectively powerless. In addition, what Airbenders could do was far more than just making people hold their breath, it was physically sucking all of the air out of their lungs. Most people can hold their breath for \~90 seconds before it starts to get bad, and even then, they have about another minute before death. In this case, they'd have maybe thirty seconds, and wouldn't have enough blood in circulation to move.

In his death, Gyatso stuck to the principles he'd lived his life by. He attacked only in self defense, and took life with as little suffering as possible. In doing so, he likely provided an opportunity for other Air Nomads to escape (we know that some made it out before being hunted down), and sacrificed his life for that of othersA pretty standard trope is how rebels are always the underdogs, facing off against a big bad military force of faceless villains. I however, intend to argue that it is the complete inverse of this trope here. In The Last of Us, the military (FEDRA) are the heroes, and the Fireflies are the villains. 

So let us begin at the very beginning. The game starts off by casting the military in a bad light. After that, there are only a few instances of actually interacting with the FEDRA forces, and most of them are relatively positive and understandable.

Meeting number one, the Hometown Chapter: the soldier who shoots at Joel and kills Sarah. That’s a pretty bad look for the military, isn’t it. Establishes a baseline of anger and dislike for them, after all, they did just shoot an innocent child. But now let’s look at why: The soldier is being ordered to keep a safe zone, and he’s trying to prevent infected from coming and breaking through those lines. This soldier doesn’t hesitate to shoot down the infected. He holds Joel at gunpoint however. Now let’s look from this nameless soldier’s perspective. All he sees is a man carrying a small girl, who appears to be injured. Both are covered in blood. He has no way of knowing who that blood belongs to and how it happened. So he reports it in. And the response is: we can’t risk it. But brandedman, I hear you yell, they’re not infected! He should let them closer and inspect them and prove it! He can’t be that heartless so as to turn away a child! But only ten minutes earlier, we watched Joel do the exact same sort of thing. When he refused to allow Tommy to stop for a small family that had a child. The same sort of scenario is echoed. The soldier had to protect who was behind him, the safe perimeter, at the cost of these two bloody and possibly infected people. And Joel had to protect who was behind him, Sarah, at the cost of not allowing a possibly infected family into the car.

After this tragic scene, we’re treated to brief credits, that clearly tell us that despite all efforts, the World Health Organization (WHO), has failed to create a vaccine. When these efforts fail, the military finally steps in and declares martial law, and set up quarantine zones. It is in this scene that we also first hear of the Fireflies. And what do we hear of them? “[They] have claimed responsibility for both attacks”. But despite this, they issue a charter that sounds really pretty- on the surface anyway. They demand a return of government and democracy. Sounds great. We’ll see later how they deliver.

The plot now jumps forward 20 years. We have our second encounter with the military in the quarantine zone. And again, it kinda looks bad for the military. But only on the surface. We see ration lines, which shows that FEDRA is still keeping people fed. Then we see civilians dragged out of a condemned building. Two of these four people are killed. This looks bad until you actually think over what it shows. They’re put on their knees. Not to be shot against a wall, but to be tested for infection. Two are clean. The third, however, fails. What happens next is a lethal injection to the neck, after which the fourth attempts to run and is shot. Horrifying, right? I don’t think so. 

This is 20 years after an apocalyptic event, resources are strained, supplies are probably a nightmare to get ahold of. Those ration lines are showing us that FEDRA is taking its job very seriously. They can’t just hand out food left and right, they have to be able to ensure that they have enough to go around. You hear background NPC’s complaining about it, rather loudly. And soldiers standing right next them listening to them complain. That means there’s going to be hard times, and probably some resentment for that shortage. And that lethal injection is clearly a mercy. There is no cure for this infection. And the infection is not only lethal to the infected individual, but becomes an immediate danger to the community and anyone around them. Current events clearly show how hard it is to contain an illness. FEDRA gives a lethal injection of what are probably highly valuable drugs. Think about that. In order to be as humane as possible to someone who is basically already doomed, they sacrifice extremely useful and expensive medical supplies. When it would be so much cheaper just to shoot them. That’s a sign of humanity. 

Next, we see them guarding a gate. Papers are presented, some slight conversation is had, and then a bomb blows up out of nowhere. The soldier immediately seals the gate and urges Joel and Tess to get to safety. “Get out of here, go!” Rather than annoyance at FEDRA though, Joel instead curses the Fireflies, as though this is a common occurrence. 

There is a little more brief interaction of evading soldiers on bridges, but then we come to our next big encounter. After getting Ellie, Joel and Co is apprehended by soldiers. They aren’t shot on the spot though. Instead, they’re held, and tested for infection. I’ll repeat: soldiers catch the trio out of the quarantine zone, and rather than just shooting first and asking questions later: they just try to hold them. That is clearly indicative of restraint and training. Scene culminates in running from the military and getting shot at by them, which is pretty reasonable reaction, considering.

Final interaction with FEDRA: this occurs at the Capitol building, and consists of soldiers trying to kill you. Understandable, all thing considered. They did just wipe out a bunch of Fireflies there, and got shot at by Tess as soon as they returned to the building.

That’s the military of The Last of Us. Only in one event did they shoot first. These are professionals who are doing a solid job in a shitty situation. They may not be perfect, but they are providing food, shelter and security.

NOW TO THE FIREFLIES, OH BOY.

The Fireflies are terrorists, and not even competent ones. Here we go. We first hear of the Fireflies in credits, where they are taking credit for attacking the Federal Disaster Response Agency. Not a good start. 

The next time we start to see hints of them is through graffiti in the quarantine zone. What does this graffiti say? *Fireflies will take it all back*. That sounds great! *Burn it all down*. ...oh. That’s, uh, a little less great. *Fucking die, pig*. Um… Uh, that’s uh, not a great look here guys.

And that goes on and on. The graffiti does not exactly inspire. All it does is get angry.

Next time we see them, it’s when they literally bomb a checkpoint and supply truck, then begin firing wildly all over the place. This is straight terrorism. They don’t care if there is collateral damage, in fact, Joel gets injured in this scene. 

Then we meet Marlene, the so-called Queen Firefly. Injured and on the run, the military is slowly wiping them out. This leads to a line of dialogue that is absolutely hilarious. Marlene starts to preach about “We’ve been quiet. Been planning on leaving the city, but they need a scapegoat. They’ve been trying to rile us up. **We’re trying to defend ourselves**”

Those are big words from someone **who just bombed a checkpoint**.

This clearly shows us that Marlene cannot be trusted as a narrator. She has an agenda and is lying to Joel and possibly herself. And that despite how effective guerrilla tactics usually are, her group is still managing to get absolutely devastated. They are failing so badly that they have to recruit smugglers just to try to get Ellie out of the city. 

So begins the trek showing dead Fireflies at every turn. Downtown subway station? Dead Fireflies. The Capitol building? Dead Fireflies. Pittsburgh? Oh, let’s talk about Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is a monument to Firefly failure. Pittsburgh was originally another Quarantine zone held together by FEDRA. So what happened here? Well, times got hard, and the Fireflies instigated a civil war or insurrection. This fighting lasted for months, with [Fireflies **lynching** soldiers that they caught alone, burning soldiers alive after dousing them in gasoline](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Mob_Attack_Note), and [FEDRA retaliating by executing Fireflies](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Traitors_Flyer). FEDRA finally gave up and retreated from Pittsburgh, putting the Fireflies in control- and then it all fell apart. [The people of Pittsburgh discover that the Fireflies had planned to move right into the space FEDRA had previously occupied](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Fireflies_Note). And so, after this was discovered, the Fireflies were driven out just like FEDRA had been. Only much faster, and with less fight. And now Pittsburgh is nothing but anarchy. People gunned down in the streets for nothing. Rooms full of bodies, clothes and shoes. Almost looks like after images of Dachau. Bravo, Fireflies. Excellent revolution. 

Next up, we meet Tommy, Joel’s brother, and disenfranchised Firefly. He worked for them for years, going all the way to Colorado for them. Somewhere along the way, he lost faith in them and left their cause. He doesn’t specify exactly why, but it seems he might have lost faith in their methods.

Then we come to the University. This is where we really discover how incompetent the Fireflies actually are. [One of the first notes you see at University is about a guy who is angry he got yelled at for falling asleep on guard duty](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Snipers%27_Nest_Log). Real professionals. This same note indicates that while they’re still getting some supplies, it’s not enough for what’s needed, with gasoline being particularly short. [The next note comes from a recording](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Office_Recorder), telling us that they’re losing more guards, with the doctor clearly concerned about how much equipment and data will be lost if they have to move. The doctor even calls the Fireflies incompetent in this note. And then we have [*this* genius.](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Lab_Recorder). That’s right. Bitten by his own lab monkey. Because he just had to set it free, rather than putting it down humanely. Brilliant work sir. Brilliant. [He kills himself before turning though](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Firefly%27s_Recorder), but not before informing us that they hadn’t accomplished anything for over five years. And even that small breakthrough was ultimately a failure. And now the entire lab is compromised, and abandoned. 

And then there’s a long break from Fireflies until Salt Lake. Ellie, having just gone underwater, isn’t breathing. Joel attempts to perform CPR on her when our hero Firefly shows up, and knocks Joel unconscious. Ah, violence. The first solution. Willing to forgive it, since it strongly mirrors the scene with Sarah, only the Firefly is in the soldier’s shoes this time. But still. Military was gentler. 

And now for the hospital. The final failure of the Fireflies. This is where so many people are convinced that Joel screws the world by preventing a vaccine. But somehow, I just don’t think so. This is one last desperate bid by the Fireflies for *control*. How do they intend to do this? Comprehensive bloodwork? No. Vigorous testing with laboratory animals, like, oh, maybe monkeys? No, someone let all their monkeys go. Crack open her head and hope for the best? Hell yeah! Does the fact that [they’ve lost their biologist concern them](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Firefly%27s_Recorder)? Nah, it’ll be fine! Does the fact that [this is the only time they’ve seen immunity to this degree](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Surgeon%27s_Recorder) even give them pause? Pfft, crack her open! Does the fact that [there has never been a successful vaccine against fungus](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/the-last-vaccine-frontier-42423) give them pause? PASS THAT SCALPEL! No need to think this over, let’s blow our whole load on this once in a lifetime lucky strike as fast as possible. No, I’ve never heard the story about the goose who laid the golden eggs, tell it to me after I finish ~~butchering~~ surgery. Even if we make this vaccine, how will we deploy it? You're thinking too hard, hand me the saw!

[This is just bad science](https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/how-are-new-vaccines-developed/). Done by bad scientists. [Cheered on by fools](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Marlene%27s_Journal). Fools who [wanted to murder Joel](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Marlene%27s_Recorder_2) after he made that long trip. 

And for people who insist on government and democracy, it’s funny how they didn’t risk telling Ellie their “plan” and just sedated her and rushed her to the table. 

The Fireflies were incompetent terrorists who deserved to be wiped out.

TLDR: 

Fireflies are radicals who undermine military order  
Fireflies destroy precious supplies and personnel.  
Fireflies needless instigate conflict with military rather than help them clear infected.  
Fireflies kept an immune girl secret to smuggle her away from larger and more effective government facilities to try to find a cure at their own facility.  
Fireflies probably intended to use cure (if they’d ever managed to make it) as leverage to control government.  
Fireflies had garbage scientists, whose experimental methods are dubious at best.In the Mirror of Erised scene, Harry walks around the school with the invisibility of his cloak and the warmth from the sweater Molly knitted for him. Christmas just happened, and both are the first genuine gifts of love that Harry had ever received since his parents died.

&#x200B;

Harry asks Dumbledore what he saw in the Mirror, and Dumbledore said a nice pair of wool socks. Harry was perplexed that a man so interesting and powerful and wise would want something as dull as socks as his number 1 desire. After all, clothes are usually the least-liked gift for kids on Christmas, and socks are the dullest of clothes. This view is even held by Ron and Percy, who begrudge wearing the Weasley sweaters on Christmas. As someone who knits, I can tell you that knitting 8 different sweaters for Christmas is pure magic.

&#x200B;

I think Dumbledore saw this shirt, and remembered another family member who was stuck at home her entire life; a person who could have easily found knitting very soothing. After all, what else could an untrained witch like Ariana Dumbledore give her brothers for Christmas? The amount of love and thought put into each article of clothing must have been tremendous.

&#x200B;

But Albus was a kid, one who felt like all kids when it comes to clothes. What's more, he was embarrassed by her very existence. He probably never wanted anything to do with anything she made. He may have even tossed it after getting it. 

&#x200B;

But it's Christmas once again, and Aberforth, despite living in Hogsmeade, wasn't at the feast. I think he's always seen Ariana when he looks in the mirror, but it wasn't until Christmas that the one thing he saw was his family together and him getting just one pair of the lovely socks she made as a kid.There is evidence in every episode. Palpatine started to realize this during the Clone Wars and there is plenty of evidence in Revenge of the Sith- I’ll start with the other episodes first. 

In Episode I, he is able to kill Darth Maul after his master was slain by him. We’ve seen other Jedi act out of anger and impulse after traumatic events... (Anakin in Episodes II & III, Mace Windu against Palpatine, and Luke against Vader in VI). Anger gets the best of Force users (Jedi included) time and time again in the saga, but Kenobi mastered the Force and the Jedi teaching of suppressing his emotions, even as a Padawan, not take a dark turn after seeing his master die before his very eyes. 


In Episode II, Obi-Wan was the only Jedi who sensed that Anakin was not ready for the mission to protect Padme. He foresaw the troubles that would unfold that would eventually push him closer than ever to the dark side and away from the Jedi order, but Yoda and Mace Windu remained stubborn that the Council was confident in its decision. He also pulls off his first “mind trick” in this episode, something he becomes renowned for. He’s so powerful in the force, hes the only character who never has an unsuccessful mind trick. 


In Episode III,  we see many indications that Kenobi is the most powerful force user, even more than Master Yoda. Yoda tells Kenobi that he “is not powerful enough” to face the Emperor towards the end of the film. Yoda was stuck in the dogmatic Jedi ways and couldn’t fathom that a pupil could be more powerful than him. Palpatine knee it. 


-ORDER 66 indicates this 

The Emperor knew that Kenobi was more powerful than Yoda, its very clear in his Order 66 plans of wiping out the Jedi. This is why in the beginning of Episode III, Palpatine is so adamant on Anakin leaving Obi-Wan behind on the burning ship, he knew he was the greatest threat to his grand plan to wipe out the Jedi. This is why the events leading up to Order 66 were heavily focused on drawing the most powerful Jedi away from Coruscant, Obi-Wan Kenobi. It’s no coincidence that Palpatine sent the largest Clone Battalion (the 212th) to Utapau, because he knew that it would take many every bit of those troops to overwhelm Kenobi if Greivous failed. Kenobi fell thousands of feet into the river below Utapau with NO side affects at all. Even Commander Cody, who had fought by his side for years and knew how powerful he was didn’t think there was any way he could’ve survived that fall. Let’s contrast this with how Palpatine planned to kill Yoda: While on Kashyyyk, only two clones attempted to assassinate Yoda and Sidious is still surprised that he survives that. Palpatine perhaps underestimates Yoda’s strength but Yoda personifies the stubborn, dogmatic views of the Jedi and Palpatine sees this and tells Yoda directly that his arrogance blinded him. 

I still can’t understand why Yoda inexplicably has Obi-Wan fight Anakin, rather than the Emperor. Yoda hadn’t seen lightsaber combat in a while, and Kenobi literally just a few hours prior was fresh off defeating the General Greivous. Obi-Wan was extremely emotionally attached going to kill his apprentice whom he loved like a brother and it’s a wonder that Obi-Wan is able to defeat him regardless. Anakin was a far better swordsman, and was fueled by rage when Obi-Wan really would’ve done anything to not hurt Anakin.  “I will do what I must” shows his power in the force to do what was best for the galaxy regardless. He was able to once again, suppress his emotions, and defeat Anakin. 

The only time  Kenobi “loses” a duel in the saga is both times to Dooku. I believe that Kenobi still knew Dooku as the Jedi Master who taught Qui-Gon. Mace Windu also touches on this in Episode II, when he refers to Dooku’s “character”. I believe the Jedi still thought there was good in Dooku & that he could be turned. 


In Episode IV, It’s no coincidence he was the first Jedi to fully achieve immortality. 
(Although Qui-Gon was able to partially discover this, he was only able to discover it partially) 
Obi-Wan sacrifices himself for the betterment of the Rebellion and he knew that Luke was the only hope to defeat the Empire and he becomes more powerful than Vader could possibly imagine. 

In Episodes V and VI , Kenobi is really the one that drives the plot forward. He knows that the Empire was becoming too powerful and the Rebellion’s window of opportunity was closing. He appears to Luke twice when he’s at very low points and keeps hope alive. The first time on Hoth, he’s on the verge of death and Obi-Wan gives him a hope that he could defeat the Empire with Training from Yoda. The second time was a very low point for Luke after Yoda’s death and Luke was feeling without purpose, Obi-Wan let him know he was not alone and he also gave Luke great hope in case he didn’t make it, that his sister Leia would keep the Rebellion in great hands. Seeing him smile with Force ghost Anakin and Yoda at the end of VI was the perfect satisfying way to end the film.

In Episode VII even, there is a lot of significance of Obi-Wan telling Rey “these are your first steps” in the immediate aftermath of her touching Luke’s lightsaber. He’s a patriarch of the Force in a way and I wouldn’t be surprised if in Episode IX he appears to Rey in a very similar way he did to Luke to help her overcome the darkness. In Episode VIII, the darkness was stronger than ever and it is no coincidence that this is the only film that Kenobi does not appear in. His power was alluded to when Skywalker says that it was a Jedi who was responsible for the creation/training of Darth Vader. 

(Bonus: this is really a strong argument for this thesis. )

In Rogue One, Mon Mothma asks Bail Organa to contact his friend, the Jedi. Immediately Obi-Wan comes to his mind. Bail shuttled Yoda after he was defeated by Palpatine and was there when Yoda decided the fate of the twins. Despite all that, Kenobi still comes to his mind first and that’s Very interesting. Yes, I understand that Obi-Wan also had the key to Luke but Leia said her “only hope” was Luke, so basically Yoda was an afterthought and Obi-Wan Kenobi was the Jedi who came to mind first.In close Rick-counters of the rick kind, it struck me as odd that all the Ricks would bring doofus Rick along to track down C-137 Rick. All he seemed to do was play with Jerry and get made fun of by the other Ricks, but maybe that IS his purpose for being there and that it's standard procedure to bring a doofus Rick on missions to the Smith house.

We all know Rick C-137 is pretty self-loathing and, assuming that all Ricks have this same hatred a room full of them would devolve into arguments fairly quickly and no work would be done, but then how do the squad of Ricks in the smith house work smoothly? That's where doofus Rick comes in. All Ricks seem to hate doofus Rick (I mean understandable, he eats his own shit) so he acts as a lighting rod for the other Ricks' insults so infighting can't happen and work can be done. The other problem with working in the smith house is that Jerry gets territorial when Rick starts taking over the house and could get in the way of their missions. Again doofus Rick to the rescue, we see that doofus Rick completely distracts Jerry from the Ricks so that they can work without interruption.

tl;dr:
Doofus Rick is sent on missions to the smith house with other Ricks by the council of Ricks so that Ricks focus they're self hatred on doofus Rick and distract Jerry so work can be done.Bart usually doesn't show too much respect for Homer and their relationship is often outright hostile. Yet we do get the occasional sign of how much they really love each other. Homer works in a nuclear power plant, surrounded by radioactive material all day, and my theory is this may have subconsciously influenced which superhero his son was drawn to.   


**TL;DR: In the Multiverse, Peter will meet another version of himself that has lost everyone and everything due to being Spiderman. Aunt May, M.J, Ned are all gone, killed by Spider-man's villains. Confronting the true cost of being Spider-man, Peter will struggle with the decision of continuing to be Spider-man or Hanging up the web-slingers for good.**

**The Speculation:**

*Our favorite arachnid-person is about to face the consequences of being Spider-man.*

Peter Parker wants what many young adults want. To Fall in love, graduate high school, and go to a good college, but Peter is not like most people. Balancing a superhero career, studies, friendship, and a new relationship is hard, and unfortunately, thanks to the multiverse, Peter will see the end result of his choices.

Peter will become trapped in a world very similar to our own in the multiverse. He seeks out his old apartment and his Aunt May only to find... himself, but not exactly. This version of him is a few years older and has lost everything from being Spider-man. Aunt May, Michelle(M.J), Ned are all gone now thanks to Spider-man’s adversaries over the years. This universe’s Spider-man is alone and lost, broken by grief and sadness.

*On a side note here, I think that this is how we could see alternate versions of Spiderman’s villains, perhaps in flashbacks of each person, alternate peter has lost. We could see alternate versions of Docter Octopus, Electro, and others through this lens. Also, if this Alternate Spider-man was Tobey Maguire, I’m ok with that.*

**The consequences of being Spider-man**

Though Peter will eventually get out of this universe and back home, the title notwithstanding, the truth and the consequences of what it means to be a hero and the real cost will be the crux of the film. He will see, much like Tobey Maguire’s spiderman, that the cost of being Spider-man is very high. Peter will have to choose if the heroic life’s possible consequences outweigh the good. It would be a great contrast to see the real weigh of being a hero,  not on the shoulders of a billionaire,  god or overpowered being, but on a young kid trying to navigate life. This will especially ring true now that Peter’s identity has been revealed in his universe.

**The Choice**

Spider-man will walk away from the suit at the end of the movie, choosing to go to college and find himself outside of his alter-ego. What he has experienced in the multiverse and in his time with the Avengers would be hard on anyone, let alone a teenager. He has seen terrible things and had massive trauma at a young age. Perhaps Peter will decide in the end that he wants to live a normal life for a while. I believe the last shot of the film will be Peter moving into his college dorm room, seemingly leaving Spider-man behind...

But of course, nothing’s that easy……During Phyllis' wedding, Jim tells the camera that hypothetically if he knew Pam was into him...he then peeters off and doesn't entertain the thought because since he came back Pam has been her normal friendly self and hadn't shown any sign of wanting to be anything more than what they were.

Pam ends up getting back together with Roy, and everything goes back to normal, that is, until Pam has an art show. Roy shows up with his brother, they look at the Pam's art and they leave. While Pam is walking them out, Oscar and Gil stop by her booth.

Gil tells Oscar that her art is "motel art" and that real art takes courage and honesty, which Oscar confirms are not Pam's strong points. Having overheard, Pam takes this to heart.

Over the next couple episodes we see her speak up at the bar, she is honest with Roy about kissing Jim, and to top it off, she speaks up on beach day and tells Jim how she feels and the truth of why she broke off her engagement to Roy.

Now that hypothetical has become reality, and at the end of the next episode Jim is asking Pam to a dinner date.

TL;DR Gil's comments at Pam's art show gave Pam the kick in the pants she needed to be honest with Jim and eventually get together with him.

Edit: Wow a shiny gold!! Thanks so much! I'm glad to have been able to share this with you all!!I've heard a few theories about what happened to the 50&#37; of people that appeared to disintegrate and disappear at the end of the movie, particularly about them being trapped in the soul stone which is apparently what happened in the comic books.

Personally I don't buy that, it feels too much like a cliche/trope that's been done in other movies, it would be too easily predictable by comic fans, and finally because it seems a bit mystic and magical, whereas I think Marvel will go for a more pseudoscientific/technology based resolution. Why? Because Strange knew that it was absolutely imperative that Stark survived, and also because the next film coming up is Ant Man 2.

There is also the "fix everything with time travel" option but that is also a bit of a tired cliche.

So here's my theory. I don't think even Thanos realised exactly how his wish would be fulfilled. Rather than people disappearing into nothing, I think he split the universe into two parallel universes through a single massive quantum event. One universe is what we saw at the end of the movie, the other is identical but contains all the people who appeared to disappear in the first. What those people will see is everyone else disappear. The quest for the Avengers is now to find a way to "tunnel" from one universe to the other, and join them back together. Ant Man's ability to enter the quantum realm and Tony's tech \(including possibly B.A.R.F \) will be instrumental to this.  Not sure where Captain Marvel comes in but maybe she defeats Thanos in the end and prevents him from re\-splitting the universe.

*EDIT: fixed formatting \- spoiler tag doesn't work over multiple paragraphs.*I have a theory about what Krabby Patties are made of, with scientific basis to back it up.

I believe Krabby Patties are made of... 

WHALE MEAT

When a whale dies, It sinks to the ocean floor, where it can sustain an entire ecosystem for years due to their massive size. 

So Mr Krabs stumbled across a dead whale on the sea floor, and being a crab, a scavenger. he realized it would be an excellent business opportunity. 

But near the carcass, he found Pearl, a newly orphaned baby whale. Maybe he felt guilty for using her mother’s remains for his restaurant, which could be why he adopted her. 

Or maybe his intentions for Pearl are far darker, he knows that he’ll eventually run out of whale meat, and being as greedy as he is, he’ll need more meat eventually, and what better way to ensure he can keep the business running for years to come, than to raise Pearl to trust him? So once she’s big enough, she can take her mother’s place as the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties.

That’s why he’s so secretive about the secret formula. He doesn’t want his daughter to find out the terrible truth of his famous Krabby Patties, because either he feels ashamed for what he’s done and doesn’t want his daughter to hate him, or he needs to keep her trusting him long enough to ensure he can get his claws on a new source of Krabby Patties to keep the cash coming in.James Bond, as you all know, usually orders his martinis “shaken, not stirred”. However, there is 1 exception to this—in *You Only Live Twice*, he is offered it “stirred, not shaken”, and oddly replies “perfect”, which is strange because he usually prefers is shaken. Why is this the case?


Well, seeing as how, to my knowledge, martinis are usually stirred, it doesn’t make sense to specify that a martini is stirred—that’s how it’s usually supposed to be in the first place. It only makes sense to specify the drink as “shaken, not stirred”. Thus, normal people would almost never say the phrase “stirred, not shaken” because that’s the default for martinis.


Thus, I propose that when Bond says it, or when someone says it to Bond, it’s a code which lets the other know that they both work for MI6.>!The one thing bothering me till now about Endgame was 'Why did Dr. Strange tell Tony that this is the timeline at the exact moment he did?' Specially because just moments ago he tells him about he can't reveal that to him as then it wouldn't happen. There had to be something that happened right then which made Dr. Strange absolutely sure that this was it.

I then saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/bkzn5z/i_just_realized_something_about_the_ending) post over at r/marvelstudios which talks about how Tony notices Thanos remove the Power stone to fight Captain Marvel and maybe that's what triggers the idea of swapping the stones instead of going for the Gauntlet

Tony figuring out that he needs to swap the stones instead of getting the gauntlet makes this the 1 timeline.

Most of us are saying that Dr. Strange did not tell Tony about them being in the 1 timeline before as he knew Tony might not fight for the fear of losing his family and he tells him when he does as otherwise Tony might not have sacrificed himself thus making it not the 1 timeline.

I think there's more to this than just that. For this to be the 1 timeline, it's imperative for Tony to get those stones before he can make that sacrifice. 

In all the timelines that Dr. Strange saw, I think this is the action that makes this timeline unique and the 1 timeline. 

Tony figures out how to get the stones from Thanos.   







!<The ending of "The Last Temptation of Homer" always confused me as a kid. We see Homer and Mindy (wearing a red dress) alone in the hotel room. After confessing Homer confesses his fear that they're going to have sex (because the fortune cookie said so), Mindy tells him how she feels, and they kiss.

  
Then cut to Homer in bed ogling a woman in a red dress...and it turns out it's Marge. She says this was a wonderful idea, and they get in bed together.

&#x200B;

I guess the idea is that Homer resisted Mindy, then later brought Marge back to the same hotel, and she's wearing a red dress.  


My theory is that Homer and Mindy really did go through with it, but Homer, wrestling with both strong attraction and guilt throughout the episode, either imagined Marge in her place, or subsequently chose to pretend it was Marge in the hotel, not Mindy, a memory he could live with.

&#x200B;

We don't actually see what happened between Homer and Mindy after they kiss. The episode immediately cuts to the deceptive shot of Homer staring at a woman in a red dress from the neck down as the sexy music (Barry White?) plays. The ending is supposedly happy, with Homer being faithful, but what if it's darker than we imagined?I don't know if this was obvious to anyone else, but I just realized it. Initially I thought it was only due to the anniversary of his wife's death that he got drunk, it was really the only time we see him in that way. But I think, since we see the film through the eyes of a teen, We miss that Miyagi is often drinking. When he tells Daniel to paint or wax and then disappears, he goes off and "meditates". One occasion he is trying to catch a fly with chopsticks. On another occasion he is asleep sitting up. Both of those are indirect evidence of intoxication (he can't catch the fly, but also why even try?) and he's passed out. It's only after he bonds With Daniel that he stops drinking and focuses on his new family.

That's why in cobra kai, we've seen evidence that Miyagi felt "saved" just as much by Daniel as Daniel felt about him.Garfield canonically hates Mondays - it's a core part of his character, along with liking lasagna and kicking Odie off the table.  But why?  Most people who hate Mondays really hate that the weekend is over, or they hate getting up for work or school, but Garfield doesn't have to worry about any of those things.

But there's one person in Garfield's life who does need to get up early and leave the house on Mondays - Garfield's owner Jon.  That's what Garfield hates about Mondays - he's so cynical he can't bring himself to admit it, but he misses Jon.  

So - every time Garfield says "I hate Mondays", what he really means "I miss you Jon".  

It's like Westley in the Princess Bride saying "as you wish", but with a fat orange cat instead of a farm boy.

EDIT: Several people have pointed out that Jon's job is cartoonist, and he doesn't leave the house.  I regretfully admit to gaps in my knowledge of the Garfield lore, and I rushed along posting a fan theory flush with reckless romanticism rather than painstaking research :(

EDIT ALSO:  On the flip side, u/Wolfe_Haley 's idea is that Mondays remind Garfield that Jon will never leave the house like other pets' owners do.  In which case "I hate Mondays" means "I hate Jon", printed on coffee mugs and bumper stickers, repeated like a mantra 52 times per year, for all eternity.The title says it all, but the biggest reasons being Robert Zemeckis directed both films, and the train in Polar Express is powered by a Flux Capacitor as shown in one scene.The show's premise seems fairly innocent, unless you see it as taking place in the real world of America in 1969 (the year it debuted), and you start to wonder how four mismatched kids wound up living in their van while on an endless cross-country road trip with no clear destination. After all, the show never really bothered to tell us *where* they were driving all that time, right?

The answer? It's **1969**, the Vietnam War is at its height, and millions of directionless young people are desperate to avoid being drafted into military service. Hence, they're on the road to Canada to dodge the draft.

Consider all four kids in turn:

* **Shaggy** is the classic hippy, a longhaired jive-talker with an eternal case of the munchies who only goes by his nickname. You don't question his decision to go off the grid and live in a van with his dog, because it seems completely natural for a kid like that in 1969. He named his van "The Mystery Machine" because he dreamed of pulling a Jack Kerouac and finding the answers to life's mysteries on the open road, and he took his beloved Great Dane with him.
* **Fred** is the comically clean-cut suburban kid who seemingly has *no* reason to leave home and hit the highway. While you don't question Shaggy's decision to go nomad, you really have to wonder about him. But of course there's a reason: his draft number just came up, and he's decided to leave home for a new life in Canada.
* **Daphne** is Fred's beloved fiancée who's opted to follow him North. Fred didn't want to go to Vietnam because he couldn't bear to leave her, so she joined him in his roundabout travels.
* **Velma** is the rebellious young antiwar activist, devoted to standing up for her ideals at any coast. With the short hair, black glasses and baggy sweater, she looks like a caricature of a Vietnam protestor from 1969...because that's exactly what she is. She joined Fred's group to flee her old college campus when a protest turned violent, and she feels a protective instinct towards Fred because he's a draftee in danger of being sent to his death in a war that she opposes.

All of the mysteries that we see in the course of the show are just diversions that the kids encounter on the road to freedom in Canada. At heart, the show is a journey into the American heartland from the perspective of four disillusioned children of the 1960s. 

**TL;DR:** The show takes place in 1969, the year that it first came out. Fred's a draft-dodger on the run, Daphne's his fiancée, Shaggy's a nomadic hippy, and Velma's a campus activist.He Who Remains called Loki a flea, riding a dragon. Sylvie was always meant to kill him, as it was mostly written but Loki really had no impact on anything. Take Loki out of the show and not much changes. You could argue he was needed to enchant the beast but considering what Sylvie has overcome, there's not much reason to doubt she would have found a way on her own "she sounds pretty confident".

So obviously there's lots of directions they left open and lots of fan theories that work on different assumptions so I'm just going to pick one and stick with it. The cycle theory. Multiple timelines always leads to war and in the end one or few Kangs are left nursing one timeline for eons, outside of time. Sylvie, chaos manifested, always kills Kang at the end of time which causes the cycle to repeat itself.

But the cycle we just watched was different. Sylvie had a flea. 

In the castle when HWR said he saw everything Loki and Sylvie did, he motioned towards an active printer but when he brought up the gambit, the pages for the end of time had already been printed. Makes sense, printer prints variant activity while the main timeline is known. Sylvie takes several swipes at HWR only to hit air because of his foreknowledge but notice Loki never takes a swipe. Also HWR calls Sylvie The One for a moment before he amusingly corrects himself to say The Two. All hints that Loki is a wildcard that HWR is excited to see. 

So in this cycle we have Sylvie kill HWR per usual and, outside of time, the next Kang probably shows up moments later to claim his castle and start his bureaucracy to control his empire. But what this Kang won't know, or at least won't know what to do with, is that our Loki is out there with dangerous knowledge. 

One last thing on story structure that backs this theory up a little, the soft rule of cycle stories is to tell the story that breaks the cycle and a pretty hard rule of storytelling is to have the protagonist force a new normal. None of that really happened here unless Sylvie is the protagonist, but even then the cycle isn't broken yet. But season two is now setup to do both. Loki is in the position to be the unquestioned protagonist instead of a flea on a dragon with little impact and he's the key to breaking the cycle. In the bigger MCU that allows all these multiverse movies to happen on an individual franchise scale with after credit teases of Kang and then a second season of Loki where he truly frees the timelines and let's the heros make the big new normal. 

But everything's on the table so who knows. This is just me making sense of it for now but it could be flipped upside down with a single trailer for the next movie. The rules are out the window.I had this idea for a quite a while, i noticed that M’Baku was able to run at the same pace with captain america and thor and black panther during the charge against thanos’ army. That got me thinking, when T’Challa and Shuri were dusted in infinity war, who ruled wakanda during the 5 years? I think it was M’Baku who took the throne. Black Panther movie established that atleast M’Baku was a match for T’Challa as seen in the waterfall scene for the throne of wakanda. And in inifinity war both cap and panther out paced their own army against the marauders. He is the most capable person to lead wakanda in their darkest time. And with the royal line of succession broken he may have taken the throne not out of personal reasons but of necessecityAssuming that the dark side of The Force was used to create Anakin (either via Plagueis, or Sidious), The Force responded by creating The Child (baby Yoda).

Ok...try to follow me on this one:

I realize there are set reference points like 4 years ABY, and 32 years BBY, but to keep things easier to read for newer fans I am just going to reference the films and shows.

Also, aside from my assumptions about Anakin's conception, I got all of my dates from Wookiepedia.

If 'The Mandalorian' takes place 5 years after 'Return of the Jedi' (which is set 4 years after the events of 'A New Hope') and The Child (baby Yoda) is 50 years old. That puts his birth year at 41 years before 'A New Hope'...

And...if Anakin was 9 years old during the events of 'The Phantom Menace' (which is set 32 years before 'A New Hope') that would put Anakin's birth at...you guessed it: 41 years before 'A New Hope'...

So, when Palpatine/Plagueis/the Dark Side manipulated the Force to create Anakin, the Force responded to create The Child.

Is my logic sound, and I just connected the correct dots to a possible future story...or did I miss something?

Happy Thanksgiving!

EDIT: Holy smokes this blew up more than I thought it would. Thanks to all your comments (positive or negative) as they have brought up some good discussion!  Below I am listing a few podcasts and YouTube channels which posted this theory well before I posted this here.

I had not seen any of these before I posted here, but I want to make sure to give credit where it's due.

[Mr. Sunday Movies - YouTube Episode: The Mandalorian Theories](https://youtu.be/L5HiXGBy14A)A *Malcolm in the Middle* theory that isn't about Hal changing his identity and cooking meth in New Mexico? Maybe life isn't that unfair after all.

Throughout the show, Malcolm acts as our narrator and walks us through the chaos of his life and family by regularly turning to the camera and giving us his take. I believe that in-universe, Malcolm is actually doing this to an imaginary audience in his head while his friends and family pretend not to hear him for both their own personal benefit and Malcolm's emotional health.

**Why Malcolm Narrates**

- From watching the show, it's clear that Malcolm's life is actually pretty bleak. His family is constantly struggling to make ends meet, his brothers are borderline sociopaths, and his mother is especially tough on him in already stressful situations. Because of Malcolm's genius intellect, it makes sense that his brain would come up with some way to cope with all of this.

- Throughout the show (and opening credits), it's clear that Malcolm and his brothers are big fans of TV. Malcolm, clearly able to familiarize himself with sitcom conventions, decides that if his life was a TV show everything will always wrap up and be okay eventually. So he begins deluding himself to believe that he's the main character of a show based on his life: it's a defense mechanism he comes up with in his brain to give him slight comfort in his often traumatizing life.

**Why Nobody Says Anything**

- The rest of Malcolm's family is no stranger to keeping secrets for Malcolm's benefit (see the finale). More importantly, they're no stranger to keeping secrets in order to manipulate others for personal gain.

- If Malcolm is narrating his own thoughts, they can technically always read his mind. Malcolm is smart, but he's also just as much of a troublemaker as his brothers. It helps to have the edge against him in certain situations.

- But wouldn't Stevie try to tell Malcolm he's self-narrating? Well, he might... but a big part of Malcolm and Stevie's friendship is the fact that Malcolm doesn't treat Stevie differently due to his disabilities. Stevie might be returning the favor.

**The Evidence**

- The opening credits of *Malcolm in the Middle* share clips from the show on a distorted TV screen along with clips from anime, old monster movies, and sports bloopers. These are all things that Malcolm and his brothers would probably watch all the time, and could be considered symbolism that Malcolm puts his existence on the same plane.

- In the pilot, Malcolm asks Stevie if he wants to watch TV. Stevie says he isn't allowed, because "TV makes you stupid." Malcolm replies **"TV makes you normal."**

- Throughout the show, Malcolm never talks over anybody with his narration, almost as if everyone is waiting to hear what he has to say.

- People often respond to Malcolm's narration indirectly with relevant topics. For example, in the pilot when Malcolm privately comments about Lois shaving Hal's body, Lois immediately questions what they're going to do with all of the hair.

- The rest of Malcolm's Krelboyne class often proves to be very emotionally disturbed. In fact, Malcolm (despite often being a raging cynic) is pretty damn normal when in comparison to them. Self-narrating could be a reason why he continues to be an outcast and a target of bullying both before and after enrolling in the class.

- Malcolm is often criticized by his peers and family (Stevie included) for being talkative and suffocating. Self-narrating fits this bill as well, constantly hearing what an angry teenager with a massive superiority complex privately thinks about you would probably be grating.

- Lois somehow always seems to know when Malcolm is up to no good. A good example is the episode "Butterflies", where Malcolm discovers a man living in the Lucky Aide and tries to cover for him. Lois catches Malcolm sneaking things in for the man, and Malcolm covers for himself pretty well. Malcolm remarks to the audience that this was pretty close, and an already suspicious Lois immediately catches the intruder.

- In "Ida's Boyfriend", Malcolm gets his tongue pierced and desperately tries to hide this from his parents when he discovers he can't say the letter "S" without lisping. In a private aside, he remarks that if he's careful with talking he'll be okay, then says *"Thimple!"* If this were in his head, he wouldn't have lisped.

- In "Burning Man", Malcolm is standing in a long line for the medic tent. Malcolm remarks to the camera that the line is too long, and the man next to him turns and tells him to check out another line. Without hearing the narration, there isn't really a reason that this man would bring this up to Malcolm.

- Finally, in the finale it's revealed that [Malcolm's family expects/demands that he become one of the greatest Presidents to ever live. His intellect and morality is a big part of this, but they probably also appreciate his inability to lie.](#spoiler)

- It's also worth noting that *Malcolm in the Middle* is often celebrated for being one of the first major American sitcoms to ditch the laugh track. It's a little easier to see it grounded in reality. 

**TL;DR:** Since childhood, Malcolm has pretended to be a character in a television show as a means of coping with his dysfunctional home life. His family and friends all agree to ignore this in order to both allow Malcolm this peace and read his mind.

**Bonus Note:** If you have Hulu, you should watch or revisit *Malcolm in the Middle*, every episode holds up so well.So watching the Spiderman: Far from Home trailers, there's a specific shot where you hear Peter Parker saying, "Oh my God", while taking off a pair of sunglasses in the back of a car[, which you can see here.](https://i.imgur.com/OzGWfwN.jpg) It's clearly an important shot, being featured in most of the trailers.
  
These sunglasses are very distinctive in their style, and aren't the style that I'd associate with Peter Parker in any of his appearances and lead me to believe that they aren't his. They do, however, look very similar to the style that you would associate with Tony Stark, [specifically Tony Stark during IW and Endgame.](https://i.imgur.com/qQ0JtZT.jpg)
  
This is all purely speculation, but given that he is sat in the back of the car, Peter is clearly being driven around by someone, and with Happy being featured so much in the trailer, I believe Happy is the driver of the car. 
  
With all of that in mind, looking at Peter's shocked reaction as he takes off the glasses, I think that, given that AR heads up displays that Iron Man has created in the past, the sunglasses are handed to him early in the movie by Happy as he's driving and contain a video AR message.
  
The whole of Endgame reinforces the idea that Tony has finally created a life for himself that is about more than being just Iron Man. This is why Peter leaves New York so eagerly to take a break from being Spider-man; because it was his mentor's last message to him, live a life and don't make it all about Spider-man.My husband was just watching the episode where Michael, Jim, and Karen are interviewing for a corporate job. After his interview Michael states that he and Jan are back together. David proceeds to tell Michael that Jan is being replaced. When Jan finds out David even says “it’s been long overdue” meaning he’s been wanting to do this for sometime. He saw Michael as a way to break the news and then all David has to do is list the facts that justify it. 

This happens with the Buffalo branch closure. He tells Michael “in confidence” that they are closing. He knows Michael won’t keep it a secret. Why would David confide in Michael at all?  And by breaking that news wouldn’t you fire Michael if it was truly confidential?  I would. He clearly can’t be trusted with crucial company information. 

During the stock holders meeting Michael is invited as a guest on the board panel. This is all speculation on my part but I think David knows the company can’t be saved and is the only executive who accepts that. He wants the other board members to get it so he hatches a plan to tell Michael the company is bankrupt and then Michael will somehow blab to the general public. This forces the board to see the ship is sinking. Why else would he risk using the word “bankrupt” in front of live mics? If you were trying to convince the shareholders your company is fine that word would be forbidden on stage. And Michael still keeps his job! David is obviously protecting him. 

Not long after the stockholders meeting Michael calls up David to complain that a woman is Santa. David sounds frustrated. Is it because he has to announce the company was sold?  He even says “I shouldn’t be telling you this” and then tells him the news. Of course Michael blabs. But I think this plan backfires as Jim is now co-manager and has him call back David before it can spread. All branches are safe but executives are losing their jobs. So having Jim as a co-manager ruined David’s tactic of breaking bad news. 

And as a side note: when David creates “Suck-It” he even offers Michael a job. Why?

I’ve tried to remember a bunch of the exact wording off the top of my head so they may not be perfect but the gist is still there. But I think David doesn’t like breaking bad news to anyone. He just likes to defend why the action is taking place. By having a third party spoil the news it can’t be negotiated or argued by the person/s it’s happening to. The news is already out you're just the last to know, sorry!R2 needs to get off the ship to do his secret mission, so when 3PO is procrastinating about getting on he feeds him a line about critical damage and that it’s about to blow in bleeps and bloops. We know R2 is a lying little blighter - and is saying whatever he needs to to complete his mission - 3PO says as much a couple of scenes later.Before GOTG 2 came out, I proposed that Groot and Baby Groot are two entirely different characters. Turns out I was right. 

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5w6i4g/gotg_2_groot_and_baby_groot_are_two_different/

"The theory is this: Groot died saving the others on Ronan's ship, and Baby Groot is his offspring. This explains the personality differences (dancing, wanting to blow stuff up.) Obviously, there are similarities due to being related. However, Baby Groot is more immature, as seen in the trailers. The last reason is distinguishing the names. In all media and toys, he has been officially named Baby Groot.
Let me know what you guys think."

James Gunn on Twitter: https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/968576621220331520 

"First Groot is dead. Baby Groot is his son."***My theory***

On the surface, DEADPOOL (2016) is the story of Wade Wilson. A troubled mercenary who was diagnosed with cancer, left his girlfriend, underwent an experimental mutation treatment, and then had to fight to get her back.

But in reality, Deadpool is not a love story about Wade and his girlfriend Vanessa. But it *is* a love story. Deadpool is the unrequited love-tragedy of Francis (otherwise known as "Ajax"). A cold, heartless man who is literally incapable of feeling anything at all. Except, that is, when Wade "Deadpool" Wilson says his name. The raw emotions and turmoil inside him, a phenomenon which only Deadpool can trigger, lead him to fall head-over-heels for the Merc with a Mouth. And Ajax would do *anything*, just to hear Deadpool say his name one last time.

This may sound outlandish, even completely made-up. You may be thinking "Did this guy even watch the movie?" But hear me out. There is plenty of evidence in the movie to back up everything I'm claiming, and in fact, you will find that this interpretation of the movie is far more rich and rewarding than a surface-level viewing, and even clears up many of the plot holes and character inconsistencies.

&nbsp;

***When and why did Ajax start to fall for Deadpool?***

When Deadpool first enrolls in the experimental mutation project, Ajax proudly declares that he can "**no longer feel anything.**" Directly afterwards, Deadpool makes a quip about "something in your teeth," eliciting a smile and even a silent chuckle from Ajax. ***Deadpool makes him feel something***.

I believe this was the start. The spark of Ajax's feelings for Deadpool. Later on, when Deadpool reveals that he has learned Ajax's real name, Francis, this is the breaking point. Ajax can't hide his feelings. *Anger. Hate. Love.* It doesn't matter. His face suddenly changes, he glares. He hates Deadpool, he's annoyed by Deadpool, and he wants **more** of Deadpool! This is the first time in a long time this dead-inside man has really, truly felt something. And what triggered it? Deadpool saying his name.

Soon after this, begins the repeating phenomenon of Ajax asking Deadpool "What's my name?" He wants to hear that word come from Deadpool's lips, he craves it. He *needs* to feel that spark that he only feels when Deadpool says his name. He becomes obsessed with Deadpool. And from this point on, Ajax's life spirals out of control and begins to revolve around his new love.

&nbsp;

***What's my name?***

Ajax asks Deadpool to say his name four times in this movie. The first time is when Ajax is about to lock Deadpool back in the vacuum chamber. He leans in close to Deadpool before closing the door and says:
>"Quick question... **What's my name**?"

Deadpool doesn't answer, just glares.

Ajax withdraws disappointedly:
>"...Didn't think so."

What he wants from Deadpool is only to *hear his name* again. He wants to *feel*. He was truly disappointed that Deadpool didn't grant his request.

&nbsp;

The second time is at the end of Deadpool and Ajax's big fight as the lab burns down. Ajax finishes the fight. Knocks Deadpool out, runs him through with rebar, spikes him to the ground, bends the top into a hook to prevent any escape. Ajax then leans down to face dazed Deadpool, and asks:
>"**What's my name**?"

as Deadpool loses consciousness.

&nbsp;

The third time is right before the big, final showdown of the movie. Deadpool, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Colossus arrive at the scrapyard to confront Ajax, and save Vanessa. Ajax sees them approaching. He stands, spreads his arms wide and shouts from the top of the ship:
>"Wade Wilson! **What's my name**!?"

Deadpool answers:
>"Oh I'm about to fucking spell it out for you."

(*More on this later...*)

&nbsp;

And the final time is right at the end of the movie. Deadpool and Ajax have beaten each other to a pulp. Deadpool then discovers that Ajax can't fix his mutated visage.
Deadpool takes out a pistol, points it at Ajax point-blank.
>"Any last words?"

Ajax raises his head to press up against the barrel of the gun.
>"**What's my name**?"

Deadpool mutters
>"Who fucking cares."

&nbsp;

But is this enough to prove my theory? We have definitely proven that Ajax is obsessed with hearing Deadpool say his name, but does this mean he *loves* him? Maybe it's some kind of deranged power-trip, in that he wants to *dominate* Deadpool and force him to say his name? Not only does this make very little sense, due to the fact that Deadpool is clearly in no way afraid to say Ajax's name. But in fact, he learned Ajax's name against Ajax's wishes, which in a way makes Deadpool the dominant one. I see nothing to support the idea that this is a domination tactic, and so it *must* be something that Ajax truly craves.

&nbsp;

***Dialogue that supports my theory***

There is more evidence to back up my theory that Ajax is obsessively in love with Deadpool, hidden within the dialogue of the movie. Every single one of Ajax's lines throughout the movie revolves around Deadpool. Not only that, but most of them are complimenting Deadpool, or speaking fondly of him. Or, of course, asking Deadpool "what's my name". Whenever Ajax talks about Deadpool, it's *affectionate*.

&nbsp;

The very first time we see Ajax, when Deadpool hunts him down at the beginning, his first words to Deadpool and to the audience are:

>"Wade fucking Wilson. **Well, hello, gorgeous**."

&nbsp;

Later when Deadpool is undergoing the torture/therapy, he is talking to another inmate about the things they want to do before they die. Ajax walks in, and off camera faintly mutters

>"**Oh you're lovely**."

Immediately after this, Deadpool reveals that he knows Ajax's real name. After a strong reaction from Ajax, he says

>"Won't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up? Or I'll sew your **pretty mouth** shut."

Once again, Ajax is complimenting Deadpool.

&nbsp;

Later in the film, Ajax is talking to Angel Dust about Deadpool after finding out that he's back and is killing all their men. Ajax explains that they'll have to kill him, but then remarks

>"You know, it's funny. **I almost miss the fucker. I like a challenge**... But he's bad for business. Now let's go find him."

This is interesting, because Ajax is speaking about Deadpool so fondly and admitting that he regrets the need to kill him. Ajax straight up says that he *misses* and *likes* Deadpool, and if it weren't for the fact that he's disrupting their business, Ajax would let him live!

&nbsp;

After Ajax kidnaps Vanessa, he sends Deadpool a text message:

>"You want her? Come and get her. The Scrapyard, 12pm. **Love, Ajax**. 💩"

This is such a playful, lighthearted text message! You may think that he's just trying to push Deadpool's buttons. And this may be true! But... Why? Ajax doesn't have any reason to want Deadpool to suffer! Unless of course, he's *jealous* of Vanessa! Plus, he even says he loves Deadpool in the text message. He's spelling it out for us!

And speaking of spelling things out, at the scrapyard when Deadpool says he'll spell Ajax's name, he then proceeds to kill Ajax's men, and spells "FRANCIS" with their bodies.

Deadpool shouts
>"Yoohoo!"

Ajax then turns to Vanessa:
> "**Does he write you notes too? He's such a romantic**."

I just *love* this line! It's so unnecessary! Why is Ajax competing with Deadpool's *girlfriend* for his love?? There is literally no reason for this line unless he's jealous and madly in love with Deadpool!

&nbsp;

Finally, when Deadpool climbs to the top of the ship and advances on Ajax, he finds Vanessa locked in the vacuum chamber.

Ajax, referring to his kidnapping Deadpool's girlfriend, shouts
>"**What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours**?"

Deadpool responds
>"Oh, **you never left**!"

If this was just a regular superhero/villain dynamic, why on *earth* would Ajax care if he's in Deadpool's head or not? He simply needs to kill Deadpool, to stop him from disrupting business. The *only* reason for Ajax to say something like this, is to show that he wants Deadpool to be thinking about him! He *needs* it! He's insane with jealousy and wants to be the only one in Deadpool's head!

&nbsp;

***Why this theory improves the movie***

Don't get me wrong, I love Deadpool. I think it's a fantastic movie. But, at face value, the plot is SUPER flimsy. The characters and their choices make no sense.
Why doesn't Wade just go back to Vanessa after getting cured? Is he really that shallow? Does he think she's that shallow?

Why is Ajax fighting Deadpool at all? He *knows* Deadpool is basically immortal. What is his plan even, when Deadpool arrives with TWO superheroes? At the very end, when Ajax's henchmen are all dead or unconscious, and he has the chance to escape in a big explosion, he instead *decides to attack Deadpool barehanded*! What possible motivation could he have?

I'll tell you. This story isn't ABOUT Vanessa and Wade. It's about FRANCIS and Wade. 

&nbsp;

**tl;dr:** This is the story of Ajax's unrequited love for Deadpool, which drove him to do insane and unimaginable things to win the affection of the man he desired. And that story, I think, is a wonderfully warped and twisted love story, undeniably worthy of a place in the Deadpool universe.

If you liked this theory and want to hear more, I just did [a whole episode about it on my podcast!](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/deadpool-a-love-story/id1534447955?i=1000494697529) Please check it out if you want to hear even more details, and some heated discussion about all the evidence I've provided!

&nbsp;

Edit: Wow this is getting so much more attention than I ever expected! I'm so glad you all like my theory, and thanks for all the awards! I actually have a few more theories, I run a whole "Fan Theories" podcast called [The Popcorn Isn't Real](https://thepopcornisntreal.com/). We just launched a couple weeks ago but we've already got four episodes up and more on the way, so take a look if you're a fan of our style!Doc and Marty’s relationship is one of the biggest mysteries of the entire series: how did a 17 year old wannabe rock star/slacker wind up befriending an elderly mad scientist? It’s never explained in detail, but given that *Back to the Future* is often cited as a “perfect script” that sets up all of its dominos very well, I think there are a few small context clues in the first film that kind of hint at the answer.

The first thing we see in the movie is Marty cranking up an amplifier in Doc’s garage, destroying it in the process. Doc calls Marty shortly after to warn him not to use the amplifier at the moment due to the fact that it might explode. This implies that the amplifier is actually for Marty, he isn’t just messing around with something of Doc’s haphazardly without permission. A few scenes later, Jennifer asks Marty about a demo tape he recorded of his music. I think this is the key to the solution.

Doc needed an assistant. Marty needed *a recording studio*. Doc likely put some ad in the paper for work but many people likely turned him away due to low pay (Doc poured his entire fortune into his experiments). Marty saw the ad and met with Doc, only to realize that Doc could help him with equipment he needs to record his music. Their agreement is that Doc will allow Marty to use his garage and technology (amplifiers, recording equipment, microphones, etc), and in return Marty will assist Doc with his experiments for what is probably low or no pay.

Through this business arrangement, the two clearly bonded, became unlikely friends, and the rest is history (or multiple histories).I don't want to take credit for somethings that's not mine, so I'll preface this by saying this was a person on Facebook who came up with the below. 

&#x200B;

The plot was taken from an unpublished bounty hunter Star Wars game, probably 1313, and Favreau translated it to screen and wrote in the comedic aspects. Let’s see: special currency needed to upgrade armor. Main mission has enough mishaps that require side missions to complete. Side missions within side missions to complete side mission and further plot. Quest giver NPC introduced that somehow knows everything and essentially gives rewards once quests are complete. Like every annoying video game out there, the first mission turns into an escort mission with the escort constantly in harms way. Oh, and a morality system built into cut scenes.In the Percy Jackson books, the director of Camp Halfblood is Mr. D, AKA, Dionysus. It's explained that he's there because he chased after Zeus's favorite wood nymph, and was sentenced to guard Camp Halfblood for one hundred years. The punishment was *ostensibly* being trapped there except for occasional trips on Zeus's orders, and having his massive cosmic power relegated to organizing volleyball games. He was shown to constantly be short tempered and angry, and never cared about the lives of the children under his care. When Annabeth, a who had been there for years was missing, presumed dead, Dionysus didn't even remember her name.

That's pretty out of character for Dionysus, who was regarded as the patron of heroes in mythological times, and known for being (relatively) kind to humans, especially among the Olympians. Obviously, the Percy Jackson books changed some of that, but in the books, they reference him being kinder in the past, so we know it happened.

**Zeus's true punishment was forcing Dionysus to watch heroes die, powerless to stop it. He stopped trying to remember names so that he wouldn't grow attached.**

Dionysus is unique among the 12 Olympians as being born fully mortal, then later becoming a god. He did so by accomplishing deeds of heroism, proving himself. That was why he was always so sympathetic to heroes, he'd felt their pain before. Zeus put him in a position where he could spend time with all the heroes he cared for so much, but couldn't do anything to save their lives. Percy mentions that the average life expectancy for a halfblood is *less than 18*. Imagine helping a kid grow up, training them to use a sword, treating them like your own child, then holding them as they slowly bled out from a Minotaur goring, or a harpy slash. Now imagine that over and over for decades on end. That's also why Zeus barred him from alcohol, so he couldn't numb the pain. Yes, he still could occasionally save heroes, like when he turned the Manticore insane, but the Fates didn't allow the gods to meddle too much in quests. He could always do *something*, but that something was never good enough.

From the trials of Apollo books, we know Zeus was full on abusive as a father, torturing Apollo with lightning when he disobeyed. He wasn't just sending Dionysus to Camp Half Blood to suffer, he was sending him a message: *This could have been you. I'm the only reason you're not melting into a puddle of hydra goo, and don't you forget it. Without me, you're nothing, and I can take all this away.*

That's why Dionysus pretends to never remember names (even though he showed he could when he wanted to): Greek mythology holds a person's name as the key to their identity. By getting their names wrong, Dionysus can distance himself from them, pretending they're not real. He tries to not grow attached, so that when the gods have yet another pointless war, he doesn't need to know who the bodies are.We all know red was in the navy and saw combat, but what he did exactly has been a bit of a mystery.

What we know

Has been seen in Naval dress blues at various veterans events.

He was on a destroyer for some time but also saw land combat (told Eric the story of the Koreans that charged their line)

Punched out a marine (according to him) when he met kiddy. (Making it unlikely he was a navy corpsman, as he’d probably have referred to himself as a marine as well)

He’s was (or claims to have been) in the South Pacific - specifically Guadalcanal (important) Korea, and even some of Vietnam.

And was even seen wearing a submarine warfare badge.

My Conclusion: he was a Seabee

 (naval combat engineer)

He’s talked about being at Guadalcanal, and throughout the pacific. Seabees were present and fighting during that battle, and the duration of the campaign.
1942-1945

Was in Korea; Seabees landed on Inchon with the main body of American reinforcements and where active throughout the war.
1950-1953

In Vietnam he either aided in operation passage to freedom, or did surveying of the country prior to the “actual” war. All done with Seabees.
1954-1955

This satisfies him having seen combat and being in the navy, as well as having been through WW2, Korea, and some of Vietnam as he claims.

With his service wrapping up in mid to late 1950’s that gives him time to move in Wisconsin where he was at his permanent home in the 1960’s (Eric’s flashbacks to his childhood of Donna being mean to him).

So assuming he joined at 18 in 1942 he would be 46 at the start of the show. Which sounds about right. It is off from his official birthday of 1927, but that puts him at 15 when joined and 43 at the start, but I’d say either could work.


As for the submarine badge This is where history gets crazy. The Seabees on Guadalcanal captured a Japanese sub. I don’t  know if he’d be actually awarded the badge, but I could absolutely see him making the argument that he earned it.

Used that 70’s wiki, and Wikipedia as sourcesMarty has just saved his parents' marriage, his family, and his own life, but he still literally has to race the clock to catch a lightning ride back to 1985. So why does he waste precious time rocking out when he should be meeting Doc?

Marty had just become a new man. 

Right as George kissed Lorraine, the delayed ripple effect was catching up with Marty. He was about to fade from existence, but instead, he was saved. But the kiss didn't just allow his birth to proceed - it gave him a brand new history, one in which his his dad is confident, his mom is happy, and Marty is intensely confident.

In the original history, Marty is too shy to take big risks. His first big show is just tryouts in front of the school board, who of course rejected him, and he refuses to send his demo tape to radio stations or the record companies. Like George, Marty's a creative soul, but too shy and reticent to take a chance, because he was raised by a bullied man and alcoholic woman. This is probably why he latched on to Doc, who is if anything an unrestrained creator.

When George kissed Lorraine in the new 1955, though, Marty's family was set on a new, bold course. George became a novelist, Lorraine is happy, and Marty's brother and sister are popular and successful. 

At the Fish Under the Sea dance, Marty was suddenly flooded with a new lifetime of memories. He remembered his old meek life as well as his new bold life - and his new confident self couldn't resist the chance to overcome his old self's fear of performing.

This bolder Marty and his better life is evident at other times. For instance, in 2015, when Old Biff mocks "Marty Junior's" dad to his (Marty's face), Marty reflexively defends George McFly: "I'll have you know, George McFly is - " he begins, before Old Biff cuts him off. He also bristles at being called a coward in the second and third films, because now he has lived a life where his father has taught him to always fight bullies and stand up for himself.

So in new 1955, the new Marty, who has just escaped non-existence, can't help but rock out with a song about a shy boy who longs to be a big time performer.When Thor is trying to gloat and asks Korg to tell Hulk "who chopped Thanos' big head off?" Korg says, unsure, "Stormbreaker?" It might seem like moment of slightly cringey 'humor,' a decent joke but not a knee-slapper. Korg is so random! But I think there's slightly more to Korg's guess. Because Korg is made of inorganic material (rocks), he considers Stormbreaker, which is also not organic, to be every bit a "being" as Thor or Hulk or anyone/anything else. So if you count inorganic objects as "who"s, it's the most accurate to say Stormbreaker chopped off Thanos' head, even though it was being swung by Thor.

That's all, I feel like maybe I heard or read this somewhere so if it's stolen I'll delete it and say 10 "Hail Hydras" or something. har har, thanks for reading.On mobile, formatting, all that. 

In my latest MCU binge, I was wondering why no one ever corrected Thor calling Rocket "rabbit." Probably the characters from outer space don't know what a raccoon is. Likely ROCKET doesn't even know what a raccoon is. But Quill is from earth, and we've seen him call Rocket a trash panda, a well known nickname for raccoons. He probably didn't correct Thor because Rocket was undermining his authority as captain, and maybe even got some satisfaction seeing Rocket insulted. 

But what about Thor? He's been to Earth, presumably early enough to be in 7th century Norse mythology. Surely he'd have known about such a common Earth animal, right?  I did some googling and it turns out, raccoons didn't actually get to Europe until German fur traders brought them over in the 1930s. So even in his Norse travels, Thor would never have encountered a raccoon. He probably doesn't even mean it in a derogatory way, a rabbit is just the closest animal to a raccoon he's aware of. Let me know what you think!

UPDATE: wow, you think it always happens to someone else, but it finally happened to me. Just saw my theory in TWO spammy Facebook articles. At least one of them creddited me.In Fear of Flying, Marge goes to see a therapist, which he is against from the get-go. Claiming that therapy breaks apart families and "turns wives against husbands". this fear of his doesn't get alleviated by the end of the episode, he basically rushes Marge out of the therapist's office as soon as she figures out why she's afraid of flying.

In Fatzcarraldo, Homer finds a hot dog stand that he used to go to as a kid, specifically the one his parents dropped him off at when they attended couples counseling. This is where he first started to partake of comfort food, as he could hear his parents argue in the counselor's office less than 50 yards away. 

As we know, the marriage between Mona and Abe Simpson didn't work out, with Mona leaving Abe and Homer without warning when he was 9 years old. Which is when Abe began to spiral in grief, becoming drunken and curmudgeonly. 

The important thing to note is that this couple did in fact attent counseling, which not only didn't help but also made their issues even more obvious to their son. It's quite likely that Homer associates therapy with worsening marriage dysfunction and abandonment due to these events.So, I love The Princess Bride but I’ve never read the book, but I have read some of the differences between the movie and the book, and a couple of the things in the book sounded a bit violent. For example, instead of shrieking eels, there were sharks in the water when Buttercup jumped ship, and Vizzini threw a cup of HIS OWN BLOOD into the water to attract them.

Or when Inigo Montoya kills Count Ruben, he CUTS HIS HEART OUT saying he felt as if his own heart was cut out the day Ruben killed his father. 

In the movie neither of these things happen. My theory is that the Grandfather toned down those more violent parts in the book when reading it to the Grandson because he was so young.In one episode Creed mentions he was a member of several cults, and in a later episode he's giving Andy advice on women and he mentions "that's how I got Squeaky Fromme". Squeaky Fromme was one of the members of the Manson Family who went to jail for attempting to assassinate Gerald Ford.[The Collapse of the Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) was kind of a big deal (historically speaking). Where during the Bronze Age, there was a abundance of trade, technological advancements, writing and literacy, its collapse caused a dark age right after that halted or ended those things.

(Note for my fellow history buffs: Yes I know the dark age at this time wasn't as bad as previous historians said it was but it still brought a slowing of technology and an a decrease in scientific thinking so for the sake of this theory I'm rolling with Dark Ages = bad)

What caused the Bronze Age to collapse is up for debate; there were probably multiple things, but we don't know officially what caused it. 

But one contributing factor was [The Sea People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples); raiders who popped out of the Mediterranean and wrecked havoc across multiple major cities.

In the Marvel Universe/timeline, those were [Atlanteans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_mermanus).

Wakanda 1.) is heavily landlocked and 2.) had Vibranium, which means they were the only nation with weapons that could hold off Atlantean warriors. Everyone else was using bronze!

So while the west plummeted into a long period of darkness, Wakanda essentially skipped that and went from the Bronze age right to their age of antiquity (and possibly to their renaissance after instead of the middle ages)....and they did this with vibranium!

They're 1000 years ahead of the rest of the current world because they skipped the (roughly) ~1000 years of darkness the rest of the known world went through.

More evidence is found in their old gods. Wakandan used to worship some [Egyptian deities](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Gods_of_Wakanda_(Earth-616)), which means they had access to Egypt during its height (which was the Bronze age) and they had active trade with them.

Edited for spelling, grammar, and a few historical clarifications.At the end of ROTJ, Vader reads Luke’s mind and realizes he has a sister. A popular theory on this sub from a few years ago puts forward the idea that Vader put it together that Luke’s sister was Leia, aka, **the girl he brutally tortures in A New Hope.** That theory poses that that horrible realization and subsequent guilt is enough of a distraction for Luke’s rage-frenzy to do Vader in.

Now, I would like to add onto that theory. Vader doesn’t speak again after that moment under the staircase until after he’s killed the emperor (at least in the theatrical cut). It is clear in the film that his deafening silence will Palpatine tortures Luke is because he’s wrestling with the situation, but **Vader was ready to kill Luke mere minutes earlier, and nothing Luke did in their fight seemed to have much impact on him.** No, I believe there is a far more important factor that we haven’t considered.

We learn in [this section of the Darth Vader comic](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/VSRKX) just how unbelievably pissed Vader was when he realized that Palpatine lied to him about his child still being alive. (By this point in the timeline (between IV and V) Vader thought Luke was his *only* son. Remember, Kenobi and Yoda only found out about the twins seconds before their birth, and Vader says in the comic “I have a son,” not “I have children.”)

But Vader also says in the comic “I understand us precisely,” when talking to Palpatine. If Vader wasn’t Palpatine’s inferior on pretty much every level, he would absolutely confront him like he would anyone else who would lie to him and kill them outright. But Vader is no fool, so he refrains.

But things are different when it comes to Leia. Sure, Vader chopped off Luke’s hand, but he did that purposefully to subdue Luke. Whenever Vader caused Luke pain, it was intentional, and he always knew their relationship.

Things aren’t the same when he tortured Leia. To Vader, for all intents and purposes, Leia was just another defiant Rebel sympathizer that was young and foolish enough to withhold information from a Sith Lord. Torturing her was standard Imperial procedure, impersonal to Vader.

Imagine again the horrible guilt you would feel if you realized that you had subjected a woman to horrible pain and stress only to realize years later that that was your own daughter.

**And imagine if the man who lied to you about your own children, thus being integral to all of the pain you caused her, was standing right in front of you, torturing your other child the same way you did.**

That, for me, is even more reason than just *love* for Vader to lash out at Palpatine, even if he knew it meant his own undoing.

**TLDR:** Vader’s realization that he tortured his own daughter on the Emperor’s orders, coupled with his longstanding hatred of how Palpatine lied about his children, caused him to protect his other child from that monster even if it meant suicide.

Edit: [Link to the original theory that I’m expanding upon.](https://amp.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5jqmtp/rotj_vader_lost_to_luke_when_he_realized/) Credit to u/REdd06 for the idea.

Edit 2: By the way, for anyone wondering, that one panel of Luke in the gold jacket is from the mainline Star Wars comic. In that issue (which takes place shortly before the one I mentioned) Luke and Vader meet for the first time and Vader recognizes his own lightsaber. That’s why he hires Boba Fett to figure out who that kid was, leading to the reveal. 

Also, the Darth Vader comics are just excellent reads if you’re a Star Wars fan. Literally every issue is worth your time.Vice-Admiral Holdo shows up out of nowhere in The Last Jedi, and then takes up a large role in the plot, only to die in a heroic sacrifice. I feel like her sacrifice would have a lot more weight if it were performed by a character we already knew, rather than being someone introduced to die.

I think that some or all of Vice-Admiral Holdo's part was intended for Admiral Ackbar. However, Erik Bauersfeld, Ackbar's voice actor, passed away in early 2016. I think that rather than trying to replace him with a sound-alike, they decide it was best to create a new character to perform the heroic sacrifice against the First Order.Sorry for the bad English, not my first language..
So, here'swhat I think the last scene of the movie might be.
I think the end scene of the movie actually takes place years after the rest of the movie and after the birth of Batman. What I think is going on is that joker is just recalling his past, and has the realization that the events that shaped him into the clown Prince of crime ( the movie) also gave birth to Batman. As for why he is laughing and what's the joke?... Well, he's finally figured out who Batman is by piecing together his own past. And he just found out that he indirectly gave birth to Batman. And that's ironic and funny for the joker.
Inspired by the many many ways he can now torment his nemesis with this realization, he tries to break out of Arkham.
What do you think?Eg. “Your thoughts betray them too. Especially for...” (which triggers Luke’s attention to go to who he cares about most) “sister...”. This leads to Luke coming out of hiding because of his anger.If the title made sense then you're ahead of the game.

Ok so I was thinking about why Rick hates Jerry so much and why he sees their marriage as an "abnormal event" even though it seems like they're together in many if not most universes. 

I think that what Rick is hinting at here is that most Rick's set up their Beths with Jerrys because his stupidity serves to hide Beth's potential genius in the same way Morty does for him. He might also know that it's required to create Morty but that doesn't really answer why he'd have Beth stay with him. Rick intended for Jerry to just be camouflage while he wasn't around to protect them but I don't think he expected them to want Jerry around still when he came back.In Season 1 Episode 4, Rick is easily able to spot the first simulation, but the reveal of the second simulation seems to genuinely catch him off guard.  But while running from the Zigerions for the second time, he bumps into Jerry, who's in the middle of his own simulation.  Rick interrupts, which dissolves the simulation, however *Jerry is still wearing a tuxedo*.  Rick starts to ask about this, but then dismisses it.

Rick knows that Jerry doesn't own a tuxedo, so he must realize that the tuxedo is being simulated.  And since the tuxedo doesn't disappear as they leave the simulation room, that must mean they're still in a simulation.  I am re-watching Game of Thrones and have no experience with the books so this may be contradicted. I believe there was nothing special about what our love-able squire, Podrick, did to the three prostitutes in Littlefinger's employ. Tyrion was giving Pod a gift for saving his life in the battle of Blackwater and being an all around good squire. It is clear that Tyrion begins to grow some strong affection towards Pod. We also watch Tyrion beginning to grow his influence and spy network and we know that he has always lived in the shadow of his poor reputation. Tyrion also has considerable \*ahem\* experience with prostitutes in the region.

&#x200B;

I believe that Tyrion paid the prostitutes more money behind the scenes and told them to refuse the small pouch of money placed on the table in front of Pod and on camera. Then he pleads ignorance when Pod comes back to talk about his experience and how the prostitutes refused to take his money because he "was so good" at the things they did. This little tidbit of a "prodigy from an odd place" begins to spread Podrick's influence even reaching the Master of Whispers Varys himself as we see him discussing this odd behavior with Roz.

&#x200B;

Tyrion wished to give Pod a gift more than just prostitutes. He is building Podrick's reputation and giving him confidence (which he desperately needs). This seems way more believable then an inexperienced virgin making three prostitutes pleased enough to turn away gold.

&#x200B;

Let me know what you think and if you agree or disagree!So I noticed something after my full Dark Knight trilogy a few months back. I know there have been dozens of theories for the past 12 years, but I truly believe there was always a missing clue.

I believe that both stories he told were true. Not only that, but the man responsible for his transformation into the Joker was right in front of us the whole time.

But let’s start from the beginning, and please bear with me this is a long one but it’s worth it!

So the man we know would become the Joker starts his life in an abusive home in Gotham. His father is an alcoholic that at some point threatens his mother with a knife. This sets the ground work for his later mental break. 

When he’s old enough, “Jack” as we’ll call him for now, runs away and joins the army. There he learns how to use various forms of weapons. During this time, he meets the woman that would become his wife.

After a few years he’s recruited into a Black Ops operation. His record and identity are completely scrubbed from every database on Earth in order to sustain his anonymity. 

Like many people have pointed out over the years, he likely specialized in interrogations. This was probably the start of his sadistic streak.

At some point his team is stumbles upon an IED and Jack is the only survivor. 

He sustains minor injuries but is still discharged. He returns to Gotham only to find that his wife squandered all their money away on gambling and drugs. She owes a large sum to one of Gotham’s crime bosses. 

Which Boss? None other than Gamble, Michael Jai White’s mob boss character.

I mean it makes sense. For some reason, Joker antagonizes Gamble directly. Hell, out of all the people Joker killed, his killing of Gamble was direct and strangely personal of you pay attention. 

Gamble comes to collect and carves up Jack’s wife’s face. This is breaks her and something ends happening to her. I don’t want to say it but you can probably guess. 

This breaks Jack and he does the same, carving his face into a permanent smile. At that point he’s committed to Arkham. 

Fast forward to the events of Batman Begins, all the Arkham inmates are released. Jack of course escapes and what does his fractured mind see? Batman, a demon from hell. A symbol that punishes the same people who took his wife from him, but let’s them live. This inspires Jack and he becomes the Joker. 

The Rest Is History!

I think the Gamble connection adds a whole new lair to Joker’s story and really drakes his arc as a revenge story. 

Thoughts?In Aladdin when he makes his first wish, Aladdin specifically says "Genie I wish for you to make me a prince". He doesn't say, "I wish for you to make me seem like a Prince." Here's where it gets weird. "Prince" isn't just an honorific, its a Job title. One that implies that he's in line to be the ruler of a kingdom.This gives us two options:

1. The Genie commits a magical coup against the rulers of an existing Kingdom.
2. The Genie creates an entire new Kingdom out of thin air.

Later in the movie, its implied that Jafar implies he's never heard of Ababwa, meaning it is most likely the second option.  The implications of this are a little horrifying. In order to create a kingdom, this implies citizens, buildings, animals, an economy etc... Where did these people come from? Did the genie create life out of thin air like a god or did he kidnap people? Further, who the hell is running this kingdom? In the sequels, we see that Aladdin's dad is a thief so hes not the king. We know Aladdins not running it, he's off in Agrabah trying to get laid.

Further, assuming the Genie created humans to fill Aladdins Kingdom. Do they have memories? Or they confused as hell about who they are and how they got there? When Jafar undid Aladdin's wish, were they all killed?

Any way you look at the Genie instantly making Aladdin a prince, there's terrifying implications.In the Call of Cthulhu, the picture we get of what Cthulhu looks like is from the way Lovecraft describes the carved idols and fetishes used by the Great Old One’s worshippers: octopus head with copious feelers set on a man-like body with narrow, dragonish wings.

However, this is NOT what Cthulhu actually looks like. One of the most prevailing themes of Lovecraft’s work regarding the Old Ones is the inability of the human mind to comprehend (or even cope with) what they actually are or truly look like. The idols made by those whose dreams Cthulhu has whispered into, that is merely the closest the human mind can come to what Cthulhu looks like before snapping like raw spaghetti noodles.

The greatest evidence I can cite comes from the Call of Cthulhu itself. While the person telling the story is quite descriptive of Cthulhu’s carved imagery, when it comes to the last 1/3 of the story when an unfortunate ships crew accidentally awaken the Old One, the only description they give of him is “if a mountain walked or stumbled”. They don’t describe what Cthulhu looks like when seen in the flesh(?) because they CAN’T describe him.

Now, what does Cthulhu look like? It’s not that we don’t know, but that we can’t know. Again, with Lovecraft’s them of the limitations of the human mind. To see a Great Old One, the human mind must either refuse to form any memory of what it sees, firmly setting itself in the safety of ignorance, or the mind must destroy itself in a manic frenzy.I rewatched Infinity War again last night and a new perspective on Dr. Strange Struck me.  I know there are a million theories about how he set something in motion, or that he put them in a time loop, and now they are set for success, but I don’t think he did, and it definitely isn’t necessary that he ‘set them down the right path.’  

Let’s say he looks at all 14 million possibilities, until he sees one where they win. Maybe he can only see the final result, or for explaining this theory, let’s assume he can see the absolute minimum necessary to know they won. My theory is he sees their victory, and he sees Tony, and that’s it. He has no idea how they did it. He has no idea if the choices he’s making will get them there, and it also means the Russo’s don’t actually have to think of some master plan.  Dr. Strange saw Tony dying. He knows that the one timeline where they win Tony has to be there, but beyond that, he doesn’t know anything. He didn’t send the time stone back or forward in time, he was just witnessing Thanos win, saw Tony dying, and knew that’s the one thing that can’t happen, not the million things that must happen. It’s kind of the opposite of the Dr. Strange master plan theory.Everyone probably knows the episode, but just in case a quick recap. Bender's doppelganger, Flexo, gets trapped under an "UNBENDABLE " girder due to mafia shenanigans. Bender, through great effort/the power of love, is able to bend the girder and free Flexo, thus saving him from being in trouble were he to remain stuck there for several years. This is on its surface presented as Bender doing the impossible. However, I propose that this was merely another example of Bender being a glitchy bending unit.

Because Futurama is a very smart show, written by very smart people, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense that something would be simply be "unbendable", unless they specifically pointed out it was made of of diamond or dolomite or some other exotic material (it's DOLOMITE baby!). The beam in question appears to be merely a thick iron or steel bar. 

I propose that what made this object "unbendable" was nothing more then bending units being unable to bend something labeled "UNBENDABLE". This would be a great safety precaution in a bending factory as a fail-safe against any berserk or misguided bending units. And why can Bender bend the girder? It all goes back to the pilot, where Bender became malfunctioning after getting electrocuted and therefore able to override his own internal programming.

As for the robots at the olympics? Well, consider the following 3 points :

1. The discussion of the old robot Blernsball league where robots got custom designed for the task at hand shows that robots take sporting events seriously enough. 

2. The morals of the 31st century are somewhat gray at the best of times. So cheating is probably rampant.

3. The Ultimate Robot Fighting League shows that people will swallow robo-spectacle over substance.

All this meaning trending towards the conclusion that the male Olympic level benders are specifically altered (or created) to not have that programming. 

One last little nugget, in the later episodes Bender has a son with a vending machine who cannot bend because he was born without the necessary programming. This is not due to any lack of physicality, as he later sacrifices his memory unit to be able to bend with no physical upgrade (he is, physically, very similar to Bender). This is just an extension of the same concept, as his son is a fully functioning robot (unlike his father), he cannot break his programming and bend what he is not programmed to bend, which in his case is everything.**Introduction**

Pixar's 2006 animated feature film *Cars* is a classic story about a fall from grace and subsequent redemption. The movie opens with an iconic sequence, as the final race of the Piston Cup season is held at the Motor Speedway of the South with the title still on the line. Our protagonist, Lightning McQueen, foregoes replacing his tires in an effort to gain time on his competitors and win the race, along with the Piston Cup. However, due to the wear accumulated over the period of the race, two of his tires go flat on the last lap, allowing his two rivals to catch up to him. The race finishes in a 3-way tie, and the movie goes from there. In this Fan Theory, I seek to answer the question of whether or not Lightning could have gotten tires and still won the race, or if taking fuel only was his sole path to victory, as he seemed to believe. Be warned, the following explanation is lengthy, but if you're a movie detective like I am, I think you'll enjoy.

*The scene in question can be viewed* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDPDnN0E3sQ) *(starting at about 1:30).*

&#x200B;

**Background**

Here's what we know. The final race of the season is called the Dinoco 400, held at the aforementioned Motor Speedway of the South (the 400 in the race's title refers to the number of laps in the race). The MSotS is based off of the real-life Martinsville Speedway, a 0.5-mile American racetrack. Thus, I think we're fairly safe in assuming the MSotS is also meant to be a half-mile track.

There are a few things we need to determine before we can answer the question of whether or not Lightning made the right call in taking fuel only in his pit stops. The first is how long the average pit stop takes. Second, how large was Lightning's lead heading into the final lap? If we can accurately determine both of those figures, we can subtract the amount of time taking tires would have cost Lightning from his lead on the final lap, to see if he still comes out ahead.

&#x200B;

**Pit Stops**

Unfortunately, in the entirety of the race, we only see one complete pit stop. At 1:34 in the video linked above, Chick Hicks (one of Lightning's rivals for the Piston Cup) can be seen with his pit stop just getting underway. At 1:50, his stop concludes. This makes for a total pit stop time of about 16 seconds, pretty slow by NASCAR standards, where the average pit time is 13-15 seconds. However, this average seems to carry over to the *Cars* universe, as the announcers make a special note of Chick having been "caught up in the pits." Thus, I think it's fairly safe to assume that in the *Cars* universe, the average pit stop speed is similar to real life.

&#x200B;

**Lightning's Final Lap Lead**

Heading into the final lap, Lightning is at the tail end of the pack of cars. His lead is so large that he has nearly lapped the field. But how big is his lead really, at least in terms of seconds?

This is where things get difficult. First, we must determine the average lap time at MSotS. Unfortunately, we never get to watch a car complete a full circuit around the track uninterrupted, and we also never get a clear indicator of when an individual car begins or ends any given lap. Thus, we must do our best to extrapolate lap times from the bits we do get. The easiest way to do this would be to examine a final lap shot where we get a top-down view of Chick and The King (Lightning's other rival) racing down the backstretch. At 3:26 (the first screenshot in this Imgur [album](https://imgur.com/a/ynjOzLU)), the two can be seen entering the backstretch. At 3:31 (second screenshot), they can be seen about to cross the red MSotS banner on the wall of the racetrack. At 3:37 (third screenshot), after the camera cuts to Lightning and back, we see that the two are still in the same spot (at the start of the banner), and we see that this spot marks the end of the backstretch. Suffice it to say that it looks like it took about 5 seconds for the King and Chick to make it down the backstretch. 

I then popped over to find a NASCAR race at Martinsville Speedway (the track that MSotS was based off of) to see if the times matched up. They did, as can be seen by the 5 seconds it takes these two drivers to make it down the backstretch in this [video](https://youtu.be/OXjSQu070KQ?t=4625). I think it's safe to say that the times for our MSotS lap is then probably the same as Martinsville Speedway.

According to this [article](https://racingnews.co/2019/10/27/martinsville-speedway-practice-averages-october-2019-nascar-cup-series/) from October of 2019, the average NASCAR lap time at Martinsville was about 20 seconds. This should hold true for Lightning and his fellow racers as well.

So how big was Lightning's lead?

This is the most difficult part of all. Since we never get a shot with all three of the competitors on the final lap until after Lightning loses his tire, it seems impossible to determine his lead before that point. But I think we can still manage to piece it together. At 2:48 in the video, a white car (the only one in the field) passes the finish line. 3 seconds later, Lightning does the same, thus establishing that Lightning is 3 seconds "behind him" on track, even though he's leading the race. 

At 2:58, the light purple car in the far left of this [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/pWsNSOG) is crossing the middle of a banner with yellow writing. A little under a second later (timed by a stopwatch), the aforementioned white car can be seen crossing this banner as well (see the second screenshot), thus establishing that Lightning is approximately 3.7-8 seconds behind the light purple car.

Now, since the light purple car is close enough to the King at the front of the pack, we can repeat the process and determine the total margin of Lightning's lead. The relevant screenshots can be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/Ujrbn8b). Using the red banner on the wall as a reference point and a stopwatch once again, it appears as though the light purple car is approximately 0.9 seconds behind the King. Thus, combining that number with the gap from Lightning to the light purple car, we get a total gap of about 4.65 seconds from the King to Lightning. 

If we assume that the average lap at MSotS is 20 seconds, and the distance between the King and Lightning was 4.65 seconds on track, I think we can feel fairly comfortable at putting Lightning's lead right around the 15.4-second mark. 

&#x200B;

**Lightning's Pit Stop**

One more piece of info for you. We see Lightning make a green flag pit stop at 2:26, where he takes fuel only instead of gas and tires. The stop lasts about 4 seconds. Of course, we've already determined that the average pit stop in the *Cars* universe takes about 13-15 seconds. Thus, if Lightning would have taken tires during this stop in addition to the fuel, he only would have lost an additional 9-11 seconds.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

From the above, it is clear that Lightning made an unmistakable error in opting to forego taking tires. The 9-11 seconds he would have lost from staying on pit road for longer would have still left him with an approximately 4.4-second lead at worst heading into the final lap (using our 15.4-second assumed margin calculated above). 

The evidence is clear: Lightning McQueen could have taken fresh tires and easily won the race. Guess he shouldn't have fired his crew chief. In the words of his frustrated pit crew member at 2:31,  
*"You need tires, you idiot!"*When they introduce Deadpool, he'll either lie or 'remember' himself being brought into the MCU via one of Dr Strange's portal into the final battle in Endgame.

It will be super easy to CGI him into each of the fights, either in the background or wailing around in the foreground.There are certain traits Night Furies have, which seem to imply they may be adapted for hunting dragons

* They are the fastest and most maneuverable of all dragons.
* Predators tend to be smarter than their prey, and Toothless seems to be very intelligent. While dragons as a whole seem to be very smart, few are as smart as Toothless
* The breath weapon of most dragons seems to be short-ranged and defensive, great for keeping predators at bay. Night Furies have long-ranged fireballs which explode on impact, incapacitating any potential prey. Their projectiles also seem to be adapted for igniting other dragons breath while it is still in their mouth.
* Said fireballs are powerful enough to harm the Bewilderbeast and the Red Death, so imagine how effective it would be against smaller dragon species.
* They are black and nocturnal, allowing them to sneak up on their prey under the cover of darkness. This is in stark contrast to other dragons which are rather flamboyant.
* Many dragons have eyes on the sides of their head, an adaptation common in prey animals. Night Furies have forward facing eyes, which are more common in predatory animals.
* While all other dragon species have long, needle-like teeth and long sharp claws, excellent for catching slippery fish, Night Furies have short, stubby teeth and claws, bad for fishing but pretty decent tools for tearing through tough dragon scales.
* Retractable teeth may also be an adaptation for hunting. Since their teeth are valuable weapons Night Furies evolved a way to protect them.

Also the only reason why Toothless doesnt attack other dragons is because, being the only surviving member of his species, he likely never learned how to hunt and behave properly. He likely adopted a piscivorous diet after seeing other dragons doing it.

Edit- Some observations other people mentioned

* Retractable teeth may act like retractable claws, allowing them to be as sharp as possible, instead of wearing down
* In the 3rd movie Toothless learns how to turn invisible, an ability which would be of great use for a stealthy ambush predator.
* Other dragons just attacked the village, not even trying to be stealthy. Toothless meanwhile managed to terrorize the vikings for years and yet still remain a complete mystery to them.
* Prey animals tend to outnumber their predators. This could explain Night Furies almost went extinct, there were probably not that many of them to begin with.At first look in the movie, the MIB seem to be heroes: Badasses in cool outfits with shades and laser guns, who get to fight aliens and use crazy technology.

But let's take a step back and look at how horrifying they actually are. They're operating outside the law, with no oversight or consent by any world government. If they did have any international agreements, it was likely done via neuralyzer. They show that they can edit the civilian computer history of their agents to erase them, meaning they have complete control of basically any computer on Earth.

In addition, consider how horrible the neuralyzer is: they can wipe out someone's memory of a loved one, or plant a thought in their head that isn't their own. The farm wife they neuralyze in MIB 1 now thinks her husband ran out on her... and has no memory of the article she wrote about him being an alien, which her friends or family will likely bring up. That can only lead to a really, really bad mental breakdown.

They're also imprisoning aliens, and setting laws in place with zero legal authority or code. Agent K literally assaults Frank to try and get information, and threatens to have him sent to the pound (likely to be euthanized). It gets played for laughs since he looks like a pug, but just thinking about it makes it way darker. That's a sentient, intelligent being he's harming and threatening to kill, and it's treated as routine. Aliens aren't being treated fairly, or with any rights, they're just dealt with case-by-case, depending on what the MIB want.

Finally, they're denying humanity a chance to deal with aliens. Their entire job is to make sure that the ordinary peons of the world never find out about alien life. That of course doesn't stop them from ripping off alien technology and selling it to people. Velcro, microwaves and others were shown to be confiscated alien tech. If stuff like that is avaliable, what are they hiding? Humanity could get clean energy, medicine, all kinds of advancements, but no. The MIB may even choose to hide aliens so they can keep profiting off of them.

Before the MIB movies came out, "men in black suits" were considered villains in basically every movie, members of some shadowy government organization with too much power. In the MIB movies, they're basically the same, but now they have cool music, gadgets, and look like badasses.

We're always shown the times MIB are in the right, when they're justified. How many other times did an agent use a neuralyzer to get some cash? Or leave people with no memory of their loved ones? Or lock up an alien with no trial, just because they felt like it?I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18cvhb/ideas_simpsons_bart_is_smarter_than_lisa/) a while back and it got me thinking, so I decided to expand upon it.

My theory is that everyone in the Simpson family is a genius, Lisa is the only one who embraces it.

Grandpa may be senile now but his flash backs show him doing a number of things that require a variety of skills such as being a fighter pilot and an accomplished pianist, that suggests that he has at least an above average intelligence. Marge was an excellent student but choose a life as a house wife because it is what made her happy. This is important because everyone besides Lisa chooses happiness over intelligence. 

Homer would be one of the smartest men to ever live excepted for the crayon he had lodged in his brain at an early age. The crayon was briefly removed he becomes a genius, doing such things as proving god doesn't exist, but he put it back in order to avoid ostracism from his friends and community. Unlike Marge his choice is more serious; miserable but a genius or happy but a moron? 

Bart essentially makes the same decision as his father but at a much younger age and without having to alter his brain. In one episode he shown to have been incredibly gifted when he was younger but his grades steadily declined. Why? That episode would have you believe it was the "Simpson gene" which makes male Simpsons idiots. But the removal of the crayon from Homer's brain and his boost in intelligence  proves that to be wrong. Instead Bart witnessed that despite his fathers many faults and crippling stupidity he is happy. This was proof for him that ignorance is indeed bliss. He decides to follow his father's path but his intelligence leaks through on several occasions when it comes to pranks, which are original and clever. Yet his denial of his intelligence stops him from succeeding at school even when he wants to, and he torments Lisa because he feels bad for her and wants her to make the same decision he did.

Lisa only reinforces his decision because of how unhappy she is. Her intelligence will never bring her happiness. She is by far the saddest and mopiest character but for better or worse has decided to stick it out. 

Maggie, being an infant, has not been forced to make this decision yet but seems as intelligent as the rest of her family, one time rescuing Homer from a crazed tow truck driver. She will have to make the same choice with two examples, her brother and sister, to guide her.

Edit: I changed toe to tow. Jeez, you make one mistake and you never hear the end of it.Just something I thought was interesting. In Book 5, Harry is on trial at the Ministry of Magic for discharging his Patronus at Dementors while he is with Dudley (which we later learned was a planned attack by Dolores Umbridge) 

When the trial begins, Dumbledore shows up unannounced to defend Harry to the surprise of Cornelius Fudge (and Harry alike) 

Fudge makes a remark that they had changed the time and moved the location of the trial, to which Dumbledore says (not verbatim, mind you) that he had "by some luck arrived at the Ministry three hours early"

My theory is that Dumbledore actually was on time to where he thought Harry's trial was, but missed the hearing completely (seeing as it can be assumed that Fudge had the trial moved to some court room that was almost never used or was very far away from where trials are usually held) and used a time turner to jump back in time and arrive in the correct place in his typical right-on-time grandiose fashion to help Harry.In the interrogation scene, the Joker says, "For a minute there, I thought you were Harvey Dent," referencing Batman's actions at Bruce's fundraiser.

This explains a couple of [apparent plot holes](http://www.cracked.com/article_19435_6-movie-plot-holes-you-never-noticed-thanks-to-editing.html).

First, when the Joker arrived at Bruce's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, the Joker wasn't randomly killing people--he had a plan, and part of what made his plans horrifying was his ability to tell the police exactly who he was going to kill and then kill them.  Killing random bystanders doesn't accomplish that.  When the Batman (who the Joker thinks is Harvey Dent) jumps out the window to rescue Rachel, the Joker expects them to be the same person, so there's no reason to keep looking for Harvey Dent at the party.

Later, when Harvey Dent is being transported by police, the Joker uses an escalating series of weapons against the convoy, but doesn't use the rocket launcher on the paddywagon containing Harvey Dent.  The only weapons he uses are ones that can't penetrate the paddywagon's armor, and he gradually escalates to make the threat to Harvey Dent seem real.  He does this to discover if they really are the same person:  If the Batman shows up, Harvey Dent isn't Batman.  If the Batman doesn't arrive, Harvey Dent is Batman.

The Joker never wanted to kill Batman (he says as much in the interrogation scene, "I don't, I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, NO! No. You... you... complete me."), he wanted to force Batman to break his "one rule."  A dead Batman cannot be corrupted, so as long as Harvey Dent might be Batman, Dent must not be killed.I saw a fan theory a few weeks ago that I can’t find. It stated that Kuzon taught Aang that “Flamio good hotman” was a traditional fire nation greeting. The theory says that it was just a gibberish phrase meant as a prank to mess with Aang. 

It’s even better than a gibberish phrase. In LOK, in the scene where Korra and Mako break up, Lin comes out of her office saying “What the flamio happened in here?”  Flamio is a swear in Avatar. 

So not only did Kuzon convince Aang to greet everyone with a made up fire nation title, he also got him to swear at everyone he met. Really explains the weird looks Aang got in the fire nation town.Ash Ketchum gets a lot of shit for never evolving some of the most powerful members on his original team. However, when watching an old episode, I thought that the reason behind these two Pokémon never evolving (and refusing to evolve) could have to do with their friend Charmander.

During the episode with the giant mechanical Pokémon, where we get to see what the Pokémon are actually saying to each other, is appears if the three starters have a legitimate friendship between them. However, soon after this episode, Charmander evolves into Charmeleon, and a couple episodes after that into Charizard. After this, the fire types attitude is completely different. He no longer obeys Ash, even going so far as to physically harm him.

I believe that after seeing this, both Squirtle and Bulbasaur were traumatized, believing that evolution would completely change them, and possibly cause them to hate their friends and trainer. As a result, they make an agreement between the two of them that neither would evolve, hence they live the rest of their lives in their base forms.

i was reading an askreddit earlier and [u/Tacos_Bitch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Tacos_Bitch) posted this point of information. "[If you see an explosion, and the fireball is bigger than the thumb of your extended arm -- you're close enough to inhale toxic shit and should probably run](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1or72r/what_is_one_thing_if_you_see_you_should/ccurii6)."


Then user [neohylanmay](http://www.reddit.com/user/neohylanmay) dropped an atomic bomb of clarity on half of reddit's head and posted **[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1or72r/what_is_one_thing_if_you_see_you_should/ccux911).**

**TL;DR Vault boy is not giving viewers a thumbs up, hes measuring the explosion off in the distance to make sure he's far enough away from it.**Watching the Deadpool movie again it occurs to me that while the healing factor allowed deadpool to exceed the combat abilities of normal humans it doesn't fully explain his capabilities on its own. 

No amount of regeneration would enable wade to accomplish feats like lining up a side flipping triple headshot, jumping off a three level overpass to land perfectly in the sunroof of a moving vehicle, throw a sword into the wheel of a moving motorcycle while jumping, throw a sword to puncture that oxygen chamber without hurting Vanessa, shoot a grenade out of a man's hand, or rack up a perfect score on skeeball.

Francis said that the treatment would activate any dormant mutant genes lurking is his DNA, but I don't think he had any. He had a subtle, but active mutation. That's why the usual methods of mutating subjects didn't work on him until they went to the final hail Mary play of the oxygen chamber, which combined with the serum (which I imagine acts to destabilize your DNA) induced a secondary mutation. 

[In the X-Men comics a secondary mutation is when a mutant gains a new ability or new application for an existing one](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Secondary_Mutation). This secondary mutation usually occurs in your mid to late 20s (initial mutation usually kicks in at puberty), under extreme stress or near death, and frequently comes with major physical changes. Our pal wade meets all three criteria for secondary mutation, and I know in the comics he gets the healing factor from Wolverine, but you could still consider that an artificial secondary mutation. Deadpools appearance had always been blamed on super cancer, but that doesn't really add up. Why does having tumors in his organs cause his skin to break out in lesions and sores? And how does that cause him to smell like a corpse?

I suggest instead that he underwent a secondary mutation, and there is precedent for artificial secondary mutations: both Emma Frosts diamond form and Beasts blue fur.

So, what was his original, natural, mutation? It's an ability called [flawless coordination or perfect coordination](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Flawless_Coordination), and it allows the user to time and coordinate their actions to perfection. It's also sometimes referred to as hyperkinesis , notably in Alphas where Cameron Hicks is discovered as having the ability after pitching two back to back perfect games in minor league baseball.

Deadpool has hyperkinesis as well. This doesn't mean his plans are always perfect, but his physical actions will play out exactly as he imagines them. This superhuman coordination is how he can spin kick a severed head into another guys head or snatch a spinning axe out of the air so effortlessly, yet when negasonic launches him onto the helicarrier he comes up short. As a fun thematic addition there is a real life medical condition called [hyperkinesia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkinesia) that causes extra muscle movements, usually of a spastic and/or uncontrollable nature, and is closely linked to hyperactivity (sounds a lot like deadpool to me).

Extra evidence:
X-Men Origins: Wade is a) on a mutant special ops team, and b) able to deflect bullets with a sword. Humans cannot do that (without high level magic or ki training that is).

Comics: Evil Deadpool (a "clone" made of discarded body parts) is able to fight effectively in melee combat despite having two right arms. He joins the X-Men (more specifically X Force) an organization with a pretty solid mutants only policy. Pre weapon X Wade was off the charts in combat ability and marksmanship.

Edit: it could be argued that much of this would come from intensive training. As a counter to that I submit one more point: Taskmaster. He had the ability to perfectly mimic the physical skills of others, meaning He can learn that fighting style of anybody He sees using it and does so well enough that he can predict future moves and counter them. So if deadpool was using an ingrained, methodical fighting style then Taskmaster would be able to mimic it, but he can't. He says that the fighting style deadpool uses is too random and improvised to mimic, which is why deadpool is one of the few people who can take on Taskmaster in a straight on fight. Does somebody whose combat style is too improvised for a guy whose while thing is copying moves to copy sound like the result of intensive training? I don't think so.

TLDR- Before becoming Deadpool Wade Wilson was a mutant with the power of super dexterity, and he underwent a secondary mutation to become Deadpool.

Extra Bonus theory: Francis has super strength as a side effect of his inability to feel pain. [According to the superpower wiki humans only use a small percentage of their muscle power to avoid damaging their own tendons and bones](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/100_Percent_Muscle_Usage). So if Francis can't feel pain then his body would never get the cut off signal, thus allowing him access to his full physical potential.I was just thinking this while thinking about Baby Yoda and Manadalorian, and how Mandalorian will be an old dying man once his kid is an adult.

Of all the Jedi Masters to have a private grief counseling session with, it was probably Yoda. His species is extremely long lived, and he's seen countless people live and die in his 900 years of life. A human lifespan is like that of a dog to him. Naturally the advice he gives is going to be overly detached. Because he had to be detached not only as a Jedi, but as someone who is 900 years old. If you live that long and interact with people who live about a tenth that, you'd have to be over detached just to keep your sanity. But you wouldn't be very good at offering grief counseling, because your perspective is so different. 

Granted, another Jedi Master would've given similar advice, but they could've been more tactful about it, and acknowledge the feelings rather than "we all die; don't mourn".Just realized it, while hulk was doing time-travel test on scott he accidently turned scott into an old, teen and a baby. Of course it was fun scene but what if they actually use that tech for selfish reason? For example, hulk could use that to heal his arm , cap could use that to become young again and they still have all memories, omg.Ok, so I watch this with my toddler a lot and noticed that Sally's story is a bit dark.

When Lightening drives off with Sally to the wheel well, he asks her how a (likely rich) city Porsche ended up in nowheresville. She responds that she did indeed have a lavish life "but [she] wasn't...happy." with a far off look. This is a common sign of depression - not being able to find happiness even in situations where most others do.

Then she says she drove away from home into the desert until she "broke down". Not ran out of gas, broke down. We know that cars die in this universe, and I would suspect breaking down and crashing are the only ways that happens.

Then she talks about how Mater found her and towed her back. She didn't call for a tow or anything - she was found, broken down, alone in the desert, driving away from her life without a destination. She probably had a family that she left behind without a word.

I can only assume Doc fixed her up. She's in love with the town because they saved her. She's "one of them" because a bunch of older cars found a young car in distress and adopted her.I was wondering earlier: Where do trainers who *don't* grow up in the same town as the Professor get their starters? I think they get it from the nearest strong trainer, the town Gym Leader. 

This is the reason why many towns tend to have trainers of the same, or similar, types as the gym leader, and why many young trainers are gym trainers (like the kid in Brock's gym). Also, the reason why starter pokemon (like charmander, bulbasaur and squirtle) are so rare: the only people with the resources to have such rare pokemon are Professors.In Fallout, the world is essentially hyper-irradiated. Things don’t grow well, just walking through certain areas can give a lethal dose of radiation. Wildlife is mutated beyond belief, and certain regions like the glowing sea look like alien worlds.

This is largely chalked up to radiation from nuclear strikes. But nuclear bombs don’t provide anywhere near that kind of extended radiation. So what did? Nuclear power plant meltdowns. In the months immediately following the societal devastation of the bombs, nuclear power plants went unmaintained and eventually experienced widespread meltdowns. As seen with Chernobyl, these meltdowns cause much stronger and long-term radiation then nuclear bombs.

What gives credence to this theory is the lore of the fallout world - by the time the bombs dropped, fossil fuels were so uncommon that they were almost entirely replaced by nuclear devices. Even cars were nuclear powered, putting potentially millions of reactors across America. When these went unmaintained for months at a time, they melted down and spread massive radiation.I got kind of a “father meeting his daughter’s boyfriend” vibe during Guardian scene with Thanos in Nowhere. He knew he had total control over the situation, and when he held Gamora hostage, he decided to toy with and test Starlord by baiting him to shoot her. 

Through the whole movie, Thanos keeps bringing up his willingness to sacrifice what he loves and make the difficult choices in order to accomplish what he believes is right. He also puts people in similar situations, holding their Thor in front of Loki, holding Nebula in front of Gamora, holding Tony in front of Strange. From Thanos’ point of view, all of them fail to sacrifice another for the greater good. Except for Starlord.

When Peter pulls the trigger and the bubbles come, out he proved to Thanos that he’s willing to sacrifice others for the greater good. He then says “I like him.” not because he’s a sadistic psychopath who wants his daughter dead and is amused by Peter’s helplessness, but because he found a quality he respects and shares with his daughter’s boyfriend. 


Edit:
Everyone fightin’ over whether this post belongs here or not and I’m just enjoying my fake internet points. I see a lot of comments on content having to do with Iron-Man's suits, pointing out how borderline invulnerable they were at first, and eventually got weak. Point to Iron-Man one where he walks off a tank blast to Civil War where Cap does ample amounts of damage with his bare hands and shield. 

My logic behind how this is possible is simple.

***Stark trades in durability for speed and focuses on making his suits more capable throughout the MCU.*** 

Take Iron-Man one. The Iron-Man suit was a suit of armor initially, and had very limited capabilities combat wise. 

Iron-Man 2, we see Tony take damage easier but has lasers, missiles, machine guns, etc. 

Iron-Man 3 and almost most noticeably, his suits take the most damage (breaks by a van slamming into it) but now his suits can come to him, fight on their own I.E autopilot, and are made, sometimes, with specific purposes. 

This method begins to pay off, as Stark begins playing with nano-tech is Civil War. Ultimately, his suits reach maximum durability through this experimentation, as the Iron-Man suit is capable of withstanding concentrated energy blasts from the Power Stone in Infinity War. 

I also feel Stark purposefully ditches so much armor on his suit because ***he knows he's better with his suits.*** Tony knows that with more and more use with his suits, he's becoming better at flying and dodging and fighting. This is illustrated perfectly in Civil War and Infinity War as he dodges, blocks, and is now doing complex flips and spins mid flight. 

 When the First Order destroyed the Hosnian system, it created a wound in the force, much like when Obi-Wan felt the destruction of Alderaan and Yoda felt the execution of Order 66. After that, Luke remotely activated R2-D2 so that someone could find him.

Just kind of a way of getting around the "R2 just wakes up" plot hole. The force literally awakens him.In the season 6 finale, archer and the gang are about to be shrunken down to go inside a dying scientist. Archer yet again shows he has no grasp on mortality, stating that he believes it's impossible for him to die.

Ray and Archer also had an argument where Archer admits putting everyone in danger because of his inability to process death.

Archer is aware that none of the main cast can be permanently killed, which is why he's willing to act completely on impulse and put everyone in peril. Archer is also the only character ( as far as I know ) who breaks the fourth wall.

There's another episode where Archer bangs a dictator's wife, so Archer shoots Cyril as a distraction. Archer later states he knows that Cyril always wears a bullet proof vest in South America, however, what if this wasn't the case? Archer could've acted entirely on impulse and fired at him, knowing that in the next episode that there would be an excuse given as to why Cyril didn't die. If this is how the universe works for Archer, then the universe would only encourage Archer to act on pure impulse.

Archer also has the ability to count exactly how many bullets have been fired AT him, which is a pretty crazy talent. This has lead to the idea that Archer has some exaggerated form of Asperger's. While I'm not going to argue against this idea, there's also the possibility that Archer is aware of this gag, and knows that if he mentions the amount of bullets fired, then he will automatically be correct. This would also feed Archer's overwhelming narcissism.Theory really spawned from the 'cage' line, but it seems like it does fit from the perspective of a dog and his female owner getting down with some guy and the dog is getting all protective and jealous.

edit: thanks for my first silver!
edit2: AND gold!!! From what we've seen, a remnant of the empire put a very high bounty onto Grogu in order to either be killed or to be delievered to them. 

However, those criminals that are holding out on  Arvala-7 (Kuiil's planet) have absolutely no intention of delievering Grogu to the remnant and getting that high reward. Instead, they are willing to lay down their lives so that no bounty hunter can get Grogu and deliever him to the empire, which is known for it's unethical ideology.

What if those "criminals" are actually former prisoners or slaves of the empire who noticed that there is an innocent child getting hunted by the empire and are now willing to protect at all costs so that this child doesn't have to endure what they had to go through?[Go to timestamp 01:00 in this clip.](https://youtu.be/JE38S-g3dsM)

Sid runs into Manny’s backside while fleeing the Rhinos making Manny turn round in annoyance. Moments later Sid is scrambling to stay afoot over the cliff edge Manny was JUST peering over. 

Through the the film we see that Manny is bitter and unforgiving due to losing his family to hunters. With nothing really left to lose he chooses to not follow the herd migrating at the films start. Instead seeking isolation.

I think he was looking over the cliffs edge about to jump and end his life before Sid interrupts him. A grim and easily missed moment from an otherwise lighthearted children’s movie but something I thought was interesting none the less.The world of Avatar is approximately 1400 miles from the North to the South, just more than a tenth the size of Earth and a bit smaller than the United States of America.

I know this seems preposterous but it's heavily backed up throughout the series.

My key point for that measurement is S2E12 "The Serpent's Pass," which the Aang Gaang cross *by foot* in approximately a day. This seemed like the easiest thing to measure, since we have no idea how fast Appa flies and the Serpent's Pass is very distinct on the world map [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/ff/c4/76ffc49d6339fb6a5502a47c9476cf18.png). If you can't spot it, it's that little bridge over the lakes to the southwest of Ba Sing Se and northeast of the map's center.

Now the exact measurement is imprecise, as it's difficult to discern the precise start and end point, but I took it be just the skinniest part which is conveniently equal to the height of each semi-circle on the map. I then counted the semi-circles from top to bottom (using the middle portion of the map where it's more cropped, as the additional space on the sides appears to be little more than creative flourish) and came up with 28 semi-circles.

Then I estimated the time it took the Aang Gaang to cross the Serpent's Pass. Assuming their day cycle is roughly equal to ours of 24 hours, and allowing them 8 hours to sleep, I estimated 16 hours of walking. Per Google, [an average walk speed is about 3.1 miles/hour](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+far+can+you+walk+in+16+hours&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS735US736&oq=how+far+can+you+walk+in+16+hours&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.14456j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Although the Aang Gaang had to cross difficult terrain and were not moving in a perfectly straight line, I ignored these factors for simplicity (to include would, if anything, shrink the world further). After some math: 3.1 mi/hr \* 16 hr \* 28 semi-circles = 1388.8 miles top-to-bottom.

**Some additional support:**

1. Ba Sing Se is *huge* on that map!! It looks to be the size of China, but it's all one city. By this count, however, it's only about 100 miles wide within the walls - still much bigger than any city in the world. (For comparison: Manhattan is only 13 miles in length and 2.3 miles wide, thus 334.45 Manhattans would fit in Ba Sing Se. But hey, that's less than the 3 *million* Manhattans it would be if the world were as big as ours.)
2. Following "The Serpent's Pass," the Aang Gaang travels to the outer walls of Ba Sing Se in *less* than a day (S2E13 "The Drill").
3. Characters coincidentally run into each other... a *lot* in this show. This makes those coincidences a *little* easier to buy.
4. Gravity is weaker in the world of Avatar. Don't believe me? Check out S1E10 "Jet," in which Jet, a non-bender with no supernatural abilities, *leaps* into the trees! Yes, *leaps*. This is not possible in our world, but is explainable by a low gravity.

But wait!

**How do we know the map is accurate? Maybe it isn't to scale.**

Sure, it's possible Ba Sing Se is exaggerated on the map, especially if it was originally drawn by the Earth Kingdom. But to make a single city the size of *China*?? Even if the distances aren't completely accurate, it still has to work as a rough approximation, or else it would be useless for travel (and we regularly see characters using this world map for travel).

The Serpent's Pass could also be exaggerated, which would throw off my precise calculations, *but* there's just too much other evidence to assume it isn't in this ballpark.

**If the gravity is weaker, why don't we regularly see people bounding around like on the moon?**

For the record: this is actually *smaller* than the Moon (a bit more than half the Moon's size, I believe). But that doesn't mean it's the same density, or that the people of Avatar have the exact same biological makeup as ourselves (although they're obviously very similar). If the Avatar world is a bit denser, and the people have evolved to live here, it's totally reasonable that the weaker gravity is not readily transparent. This is a show where people conjure fire and lightning out of thin air, and they telekinetically throw rocks and water at each other.

**Okay, but why does it take so long for Appa to fly from the South Pole to the North Pole?**

I estimate it took about a month or two to fly across the world in S1. But they make a loooot of stops along the way, often staying in the same place for multiple days ("Kyoshi Warriors," "Imprisioned," "Jet," "The Fortuneteller," "The Deserter," "The Northern Air Temple").

Furthermore, Appa is not a damn airplane. He's a living breathing creature who needs to stop to sleep and eat. Flying faster can also exhaust him. In S3E13 "The Firebending Masters," Zuko even comments something like, "This bison always seemed faster." Guessing he flies 6 hours a day, at a leisurely 15mph, it would take him only 15 days to fly across this world, but that's without stops.

If that still seems slow, I redirect you to **total proof of Appa's abilities and this theory via S1E8 "Avatar Roku."** We see the Aang Gaang embarking from Hei Bei's Forest at sunrise, and they arrive at Roku's Temple in time for sundown. This is the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, although to be fair both locations seem close to if not on the equator so we can guess this is a period of 12 hours. The distance is roughly 6 semi-circles, 6 Serpent's Passes, 297.6 miles, just under a fourth of the world's height. This clocks in at about 24.8 mph, assuming he was flying for the entire 12 hours (which he likely was not). This trip *does* exhaust Appa (as is explicitly stated by Aang), so it's understandable that Appa does not fly this fast or this long every day. But it *does* prove it's *possible...* and that this distance can not be any farther.

**TL;DR:** The world of Avatar is significantly smaller than ours, which explains a lot about the continuity of the show. Weaker gravity allows for increased martial arts abilities, Appa is pretty slow when he isn't pushing himself, and the gang's frequent stops explain why they take so long getting places.If there's an overarching theme of Infinity War, it's that the Avengers don't believe that it's worth sacrificing the few to save the many.

&#x200B;

When Vision first floats the idea of destroying the infinity stone in his head, thus killing him, Steve Rogers replies with "We don't trade lives." Gamora pleads with Star-Lord to kill her if she's captured, but he hesitates for too long. Then Gamora is given the choice: save her sister Nebula or tell Thanos where the soul stone is. For a while, we think Dr. Strange will buck this trend, given that he warns Stark that if it comes down to saving him or the time stone, then he'll let Stark die. But when the time comes for Thanos to kill Stark, Dr. Strange trades Stark's life for the stone. In each of these cases, a willingness to trade a life would have prevented Thanos from obtaining all the infinity stones.

&#x200B;

This, of course, is completely opposite of the view Thanos holds: that you do trade lives. In fact, he thinks 50% of the population should give up their lives so that the other 50% can thrive.

&#x200B;

I think that in End Game the Avengers will come around to his way of thinking and decide that it is worth it to trade lives. What's the most repeated phrase in the End Game trailers? "Whatever it takes." Multiple characters say it. It's the film acknowledging that if the Avengers want to beat Thanos, they're going to need to overcome their biggest weakness: their unwillingness to sacrifice their own members. And it's not that hard to guess who gets the ax: the contracts are up for several MCU actors, and Robert Downey and Chris Evans in particular have indicated that they have no desire to continue playing their characters.[This detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/8t63nm/in_monsters_inc_2001_mike_wazowski_jumps_over_a/) \+ the [bloopers reel in the credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG2T7upUVAk) both suggest that Monsters Inc. is a film within its own canon. The fact that the Monstropolis energy crisis acts as the historical backdrop to this story is no coincidence. However, the details of this historical backdrop have been simplified so that it's more accessible to general audiences in order to guarantee commercial success.

For example, the "2319" scene didn't necessarily happen that day, but it's a way of simplifying the CDA's role for the general audience. In reality, the CDA's role was probably much more complex. Doesn't that Roz reveal seem to come out of nowhere? That's probably because there's way more meat to that story, but it was too complicated for general audiences and it was easier to just make the CDA a running joke and a way to raise the stakes. The Roz reveal is left in as a wink-wink moment to the monsters in the cinema who know their history.

Randall is probably not necessarily meant to represent one real-life character with an evil plan to kidnap kids and extract their screams for energy, but is perhaps a composite character meant to represent a group within the company who had this line of thinking. These monsters probably weren't all discovered that day either, but slowly revealed and charged over the course of a few years following the company's reparations.

I would imagine this was one of the CDA's real-life roles in the story; investigating and arresting the monstrous monsters who planned to save Monsters Inc. by unethical and illegal means. It's also possible, even, that this was the doing of another 3-letter agency involved in the events of the energy crisis, but they were simplified by way of combining them with the CDA.

Waternoose, similarly, was probably a composite character, meant to represent several of the old-guard in-charge at Monsters Inc. who had garnered public hatred over years of mismanagement.I know what you're thinking, but hear me out.

One of the known plot-holes or "goofs" of *Avengers: Endgame* is that there appear to be TWO Ant-Men. At one point, Scott Lang is trying to hot-wire his time-van with Hope van Dyne while he simultaneously grapples with Thanos' forces outside in Giant-Man form.

But what if it's not a goof?

What if there are two Ant-Men on the scene, and one of them is Luis?

There are four KEY pieces of evidence that support this theory:

1) The goof itself.

2) That mean left-hook that "Scott Lang" throws at the Leviathan in 'Endgame.' Luis is perhaps the best non-powered puncher in the MCU.

3) Luis has professed a desire to get a suit of his own in the past, and we know there are multiple Ant-Man suits out there to be had.

4) We already have the perfect method through which to reveal all this in 'Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantamania" via a classic Luis soft jazz voiceover recap.

Here's how it would go down:

Sometime after returning in 'Endgame,' Scott Lang checks in on Luis. Of course he does, Luis is his best friend. (Maybe he finds out that Luis has been looking out for Cassie in Scott's absence. Aww.) Either at some point in the last five years, Luis has got his hands on one of the Ant-Man suits, presumably in a clumsy attempt to continue Scott's legacy. Scott, before leaving on the Time Heist, lets Luis know what's about to happen, and probably gives him a message to pass on to Cassie if he can't make it back. Luis, not wanting to miss out on the Second Snap, starts heading to the New Avengers Compound to catch the action.

He shows up moments after Thanos' attack, puts on the suit, and hears Scott's calls for help through the helmet. It is Luis, not Scott, who goes giant-sized to rescue Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket (along with Scott, who is too small to see on screen), demonstrating how much skill he's picked up in the five-year gap. He also got in shape, by the way, enough so that you can't immediately distinguish his figure from Paul Rudd's lithe frame. From there on out, there are two Ant/Giant-Men on the scene, and it's just too chaotic for anyone to really notice (except astute viewers). When it's over, Luis peaces out, rather than deal with the heavy emotional burden of watching Iron Man die. 

Happy New Year, everyone.One of the biggest fan criticisms of Batman is that he ends up making his own worst enemies, and draws villains in towards him like a magnet. It's gotten so big that even the movies and comics mention it. The Joker even says that the only reason he's there is because of Batman, and that he's like "a dog chasing it's own tail". All of that serves to make Gotham even *more* dangerous than it might be otherwise.

**Batman knows that he's a magnet for supervillains, which he does in order to gather them all in one place.**

Imagine that you're a regular cop in a random city, let's say St. Louis, and all of a sudden, a lunatic with clown face paint uses a chemical gas on hundreds of civilians. You'd be panicking, and have no clue what to do. But for the Gotham police, that's just Tuesday. They get so used to supervillains being around that they start to develop procedures for specific villains. It also means that villains don't have shock value on their side. By consolidating all the villains in one area, and working with the police, Batman can create one, specialized force to deal with supervillains. If he weren't around, all those criminals would disperse across the country, to attack far less prepared cities.

It also gives Batman a chance to do the same. We know that he has contingency plans for all of the villains, as well as having developed ways to neutralize a lot of them. He gives himself shots that lessen Scarecrow's fear gas, creates pesticides specifically for Poison Ivy, etc. The Injustice comics start with the idea that the Joker decides to go after Superman instead of Batman. In one fell swoop, Joker manages to trick Superman into killing both Lois Lane, and his unborn daughter, as well as triggering a nuke in Metropolis, wiping out the city. Remember, that wasn't a Joker with extra powers, or increased planning. That was just Joker dealing with someone besides Batman. It's easy to blame Batman for dealing poorly with the Joker, when in reality, he's actually one of the few people capable of understanding Joker well enough to counter him.

In addition, having those supercriminals there helped to make the GCPD less corrupt. When Batman first arrived, they made a point of showing that Jim Gordon was the only good cop, with maybe a few others. Now, it's flipped. Sure, they have a few dirty cops to spice up a storyline now and then, but most of the time, GCPD is efficient and above board. That's because someone like the Joker or Bane isn't going to bother trying to bribe anyone, and if they do, it's part of a mind game that will end up with that cop dead. The only one who did so was the Penguin, who had been a mob boss long before Batman ever showed up. It also makes crooked cops less likely to want to be in Gotham. Before, you could have a job with almost zero risk, that paid a ton. After, you were in a ton of danger, getting paid very little money. The only people actually willing to work that job would be those that legitimately believed in it.

Villains also tend to be extremely egotistical and territorial, causing them to spend much of their time attacking each other instead of civilians. Think about all the different grudges they hold: Harley Quinn is obsessed with killing Joker, which Poison Ivy wants to help her with; Penguin has a score with Catwoman over the jewels she stole from him, etc. The War of Jokes and Riddles even focused exactly on that, Joker and Riddler collecting armies of villains to fight each other over who got to kill Batman. While there were civilian casualties, there were far less so than if those same armies had just decided to take over the city, which they easily could have done.

Finally, it also gives villains a chance to direct their hatred at Batman himself. He's willing to sacrifice his own well being to be their target, their punching bag. Imagine what Riddler could do if he wasn't obsessed with sending Batman notes about his crimes in advance, or if Joker just decided to poison the reservoir *without* driving around in a giant clown shaped boat? Their obsession with Batman causes them to do their best to destroy him, distracting them from their vast, untapped potential for chaos. Riddler even tells him that "I keep you alive for the same reason that we *all* keep you alive. You're that first riddle you hear when you're a child. That you return to as an adult, though you know the answer. You're not a challenge. But you're *fun*." In some dark, twisted way, all of Batman's villains need him, as a focus for their anger and violence.

Batman is well known for making some... dark decisions. The man created elaborate murder plans for all his best friends, as well as his adopted children. He often makes decisions that would seem immoral for any other hero, but are necessary in his eyes to prevent a greater evil. He collects dozens of villains who otherwise could be extremely successful, and lures them in to Gotham. That way, rather than having tens of thousands of potential deaths, millions of dollars stolen or destroyed, and entire cities wiped out, the damage can be limited. Gotham was already a crime filled city, and Batman's villains actually ended up inadvertently helping with some of that, taking out mob families, and helping clean up the police.  In Batman's pragmatic eyes, it was the perfect solution: The world stayed safe, and Gotham was already bad enough that it didn't matter much (and actually made it a bit better in some ways).

**TL;DR: Batman knows he draws villains into Gotham, and is OK with that, because by concentrating all the villains in one spot, he can limit their damage, and spare the rest of the world.**Most of the comic-movies that come out are based on a storyline that's been seen in the comics already. This makes sense; in some cases they have a pool of decades of stories to draw on, the writers would be stupid not to. There are always changes though; Crossbones doesn't 'kill' Captain America, Bane doesn't put Batman in a wheelchair, etc. The X-Men series follows the comics almost perfectly though,  in the most important way: the continuity is senseless nonsense, and it is deliberately made this way.

The premise of the X-Men is simple enough: allegorical minority group resented by world at large. As the years went on though, and writers started introducing ideas like time-travel, what's continuity and what isn't is a mess that couldn't even be resolved by the Anti-Monitor.

The movies are reflecting the comics in this way more and more. Characters and their personalities are being changed entirely depending on the whims of the writers, no one seems to age, ever (it's bizarre to think that "First Class" and "Apocalypse" are twenty years apart), time-travel makes nothing relevant, and Wolverine is shoe-horned into everything. 

And what is hinted at in the 'end credits scene' of "Apocalypse"? Clones. I'll bet we see Cable, Stryfe, X-Man and all the rest, in their 90's glory, in the next few movies. 

The writers know what's going on. They watched the preceding movies, and everyone still thought it made perfect sense to make DoFP and render everything obsolete. It wasn't them spitting on contuity, it was in loving tribute! 

Just as Spider-Man will always have an Aunt May and Batman will always have an Alfred, the X-Men will always have absolutely headache-inducing continuity.  There may be brief spells where everything kinda lines up and makes sense, just as Aunt May periodically "dies",  but the people who make the X-Men movies respect the fans and the lore too much to let the movies fall into the predictable trap of making sense in context of one another.

EDIT: When I wrote this, I completely forgot that at the end of X3, there's that random scene of Xavier being reborn in the body of an effectively braindead person. There's another common X-Men motif I forgot to mention that they give a nod towards- the introduction of bizarre subplots that are never resolved. 

EDIT 2: I kinda do wish that "Apocalypse" had included a scene of Magneto shouting "MAAAAARRRR-THAAAAAA!"Don't know if anyone already thought about this, but the reason why in the ending scene of zootopia Flash drives so fast (apart from the obvious joke) is because, being a sloth, he can't take off the foot from the accelerator fast enough and press the brake.

Also, since he learned to drive like that he eventually embraced speed itself...and will OBVIOUSLY be a pivital point of the next upcoming Fast and Furious crossover: "Too sloth to be furious: fast as a Flash"


EDIT: I didn't expect so much good feedback to what basically was a shower thought. Thank you guys for liking my post and for all your comments! :)Strap yourself in. 

I know what you’re thinking. We all saw it. High in the Republic Executive Building Chancellor Palpatine, being confronted by Master Windu, begs for his life before Master Windu himself  is disarmed, dis-handed, and force lightninged out of a window careening hundreds of feet through traffic and towards the (presumably) hard coruscant ground. 

I propose that under no circumstance could Master Windu have been killed by the act of force lightning, being literally disarmed, falling from a great height, or a combination of all three. In fact no Jedi has ever died from any or all of those things. Therefore Jedi Master Mace Windu survived as well.

**disclaimer i’m only referring to canon**

I’ll go in the order in which the events occurred in the Emperors office: 

**Losing a limb**

Losing a limb in the Star Wars universe is almost expected. Almost every (I know, not all) major character has, at some point, lost a limb to the energy of a light. How many have died? Let’s go over some major encounters. 

Anakin Skywalker 

The first time Anakin lost a limb was on Geonosis in AotC to Count Dooku. 

After a minute or so of dueling Count Dooku got the better of Anakin and was able to cut off his right arm at [slightly below the elbow ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eYT3ctPuVRw). After such he is subsequently force pushed several dozen feet and appears incapacitated, but obviously not dead (due to there being more movies).

Count Dooku

The tables have turned and once again Anakin and Dooku find themselves in a duel. This time it’s clear that Anakins powers have doubled since their last encounter. With grace only displayable by someone with the skills to be on The Council but the temperament to remain a knight he easily removes the hands of Dooku. It is only when Anakin relieves Dooku of his head privileges that he actually dies. 

**Break**

I need to not two things here.

1.) Lightsabers (as I understand them) are designed to cauterize wounds so as to not kill. They are purely defensive weapons. 

2.) This moment between Palpatine and Anakin while they discuss Dookus fate is PIVOTAL in Anakins transformation (both Palpatine and Windu are mirror images. At least the sith can give Anakin powers to save lives. But that’s not the fan theory I’m discussing here today)

3.) Note that Dooku did no faint or lose consciousness when he lost two hands. I think it’s fair to say that Anakin became unconscious from the force push. 

4.) The head is not a limb

**unbreak** 

Luke Skywalker 

The first and only time Luke lost a limb was in The Empire Strikes Back on the planet Bespin in Cloud City. 

After a lengthy battle over the cities central air shaft Vader proves that he’s still the best and cuts off Luke’s right hand. While [Luke graps](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSvd_y8Ebs) and clutches his wrist (or lack of) he screams in agony. He does not lose consciousness which is also evidence that losing a limb doesn’t cause death. 

(Darth Maul

Now...Maul didn’t lose a limb. But he was bisected. At the waist. And survived. There are a lot of people who weren’t aware that he survived but he did indeed survive the whole thing.)

Anakin Skywalker (Again)

[Arguably the greatest saber duel in all of Star Wars](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=40HhaIJ0QVw) Anakin Vs OLaS(Our Lord and Savior) Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi 

Once again Anakin let his hubris get the best of him and he LOST HIS OTHER ARM AND BOTH LEGS.

The man is out of limbs to lose and yet he still prevails.

Granted he is “the chosen one” so I guess technically as strong as he needs to be.

**Force Lightning**

There have been several instances where a character has been stuck by force lightning. How many of them died or even suffered long lasting injuries?

All the Jedi/Sith who have been hit by force lightening.

-Anakin (a lot)
-Luke
-Yoda 
-Savage Opress (a lot)
-Ventress
-Sister
-Brother
-Ashoka 
-Darth Maul
-Mace Windu (separate occasion)

While force lightning is excellent for momentarily incapacitating your opponent it’s not good for killing. It’s hardly good for even rendering unconscious. 

But what about Darth Vader? Didn’t force lightning kill him?

No. The force lightening malfunctioned his suit, which was life support.

*There has never been an instance in which a Jedi or Sith has been killed by force lightning.*

**And finally we have falling from great heights**

There are a lot of instances in which a Jedi or Sith has fallen from a very great height and survived. Here are some samples:

[Anakin falling for **15** seconds then landing on a car going 90 degrees of him](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X9-K1cxj6IQ)

[Darth Maul falling for 10 while bisected and bouncing off of walls](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HPfgSFLrAVE)

[Yoda falling for about 3 seconds and bouncing off of things ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iu3qoIsGzUM)

[Luke falling for...a general long time ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QjPUVzX-GDU) 

Now, this is where people usually say “what about Palpatine? He was thrown to his death”

That’s when I say

“ACHTUALLLYYY it was the exploding from the core that killed him, not the impact”

**[Now we’ve reached the conclusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q0r4jNhG9Z4)**

Due to the incredible resilience and fall damage of Jedi and Sith, there is no way that with the evidence in mind that Mace Windu is dead.

Edit: I had to cut this short because my boss was coming by.

Anyway. 

Mace Windu is a master Jedi. Which is not an easy accomplishment. 

I believe that he realized that he could not defeat both of them so he never came back.Sorry if someone already had this theory.

So it’s pretty fortunate for Batman that no matter what building he his in, there are perfect hiding places and vantage points for him to attack criminals. These include indoor gargoyles, floor grates, walls that can be broken with explosive gel and air vents which let him infiltrate any building and wipe out all the bad guys in there.

This theory states that Wayne Enterprises owned, built or renovated most buildings in Gotham City. So Bruce Wayne chose to place these extra hiding spots on the assumption that one day he would have to fight bad guys in these buildings. 

We know that Wayne Ent. already did the security for most buildings as Batman can use his hacking device to hack those monitors that say “Wayne” on them. So it’s not much of a stretch that Wayne added the extra spots to help him fight crime."The sun will shine on us again, brother."

Loki says this line, creates a weapon, and then attempts to kill Thanos. There has been much speculation about why Loki would do something that would so obviously result in his death, and I think I have the answer: I think Loki was giving Thor the idea of forging a new weapon to defeat Thanos.

The 'sun' he was referring to represents Nidavellir.

When Thor wakes up on the Guardians' ship, the only thing on his mind is going to Nidavellir and forging Stormbreaker. I don't think he came up with this idea on his own. After all, in *Ragnarok*, when Hela is the greatest threat he's ever seen, he never thinks of swinging by Nidavellir to pick up a new weapon to help him out. There's even a line in *Infinity War* where he refers to Stormbreaker as "the god-killing kind" of weapon. Seems like the kind of thing that would come in handy when going up against a goddess.

The only thing that Thor didn't pick up on was that when Loki tried to kill Thanos, he went for the head.He drank from the motherfucking holy grail, you think Indys gonna die lol he trolled us the whole movie for he very well knew that he was invincible. Why else would he still get into these shenanigans at 60. This had been bugging me for YEARS! What the hell are flowers doing in the sky? Well, my friends I think I've solved the mystery. They're BOAT PROPELLERS!

If you look at a picture of present day Bikini Bottom, you will see flowers all above in the sky, but those "flowers" very much resemble boat propellers

Some propellers have 4, some have 5, some have 3. It's mixed bag, but they're all propellers. Obviously they would appear in the "sky" above Bikini Bottom since the ships are on top of the ocean. There would be distortion through all that water as well, which explains why some flowers are kinda wonky.

But my theory doesn't end here! Episode 14, Season 1 sees Squidward accidentally freezing himself and ending up in the future made completely of chrome. He then sends himself back in time with the convenient time travel room, and ends up in prehistoric bikini bottom. If you look at the sky, it is green with NO FLOWERS. Of course there wouldn't be propellers since man hasn't evolved enough to create boats OR propellers.

I rest my case. 😊 Thank you for reading!

In the film version of Fight Club we see something interesting in one frame a sign for Seven Years in Tibet. This shows us Brad Pitt exsits in the Fight Club universe as an actor. We can fairly assume that he enjoyed roughly the same career he does in the real world. So in 1997-1998 when the inception of Tyler Durden happened Brad Pitt would be a world famous matinee idol. 

We also know the Narrator watches and consumed way to much media often in a semi concious state. So he probably knows of or has seen media with Brad Pitt in it even if he doesn't remember it given Pitt's media saturation. 

We can conclude that Tyler Durden appearance wise at least was modelled on Brad Pitt. He was often touted in the 1990s as the epitome of the ideal male body which would have influenced the narrator's mind in creating the character who as Mr. Pitt says " Looks like how you want to look".Here are some reasons to support this:

* Moe helped out at the children's hospital so he will help children. However, he also points a shotgun at adults so he won't be too kind to the adults.
* When Bart arrived at Moe's to pick up Homer (after the Bea O'Problem phone call), he says "I recognise that voice. If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in ages!". Well if he hasn't seen him in ages, why would he recognise that voice, more than the prank voice?
* When Bart called Moe asking for "Homer Sexual", it obviously isn't Skinner. Moe asked "Who is this?" because he probably noticed the voice change. Also, if Bart was in trouble like Moe suggested, who else other than Skinner would be in the office with Bart?
* When he arrives at the Simpsons house to cut "Jimbo Jones", he probably knows he is heading to the Simpsons home. I mean, Homer is one of Moe's best friends and he's been to the house several times? Why would he not be familiar with the house?
* Finally Moe is more aggressive in his threats towards the adult prank callers. Examples:
   * Fat Tony asked for "Yuri Nator". Moe responded furiously.
   * Mr Burns asked for Waylon Smithers. This wasn't a prank call but Moe, thinking it was one, immediately threatened him.
* However when Bart calls, Moe makes his threats less angrily (except for the Moe Ron one due to the fact he was in the middle of suiciding,).

So yeah, Moe KNOWS the prank caller is mostly Bart.

Edit: I also posted this on r/TheSimpsonsthe manual, forward and everything other than the rules of the game was written by Barney the accountant at Tilton & Radomski, he was obsessed with Ben, he would have built up Ben as the legendary figure, the architect.The fact that Doctor Strange has a plan is pretty widely accepted here, as it's less a fan theory and more just something extrapolated from the movie.  I just came out for the second time and noticed some additional things to support that Doctor Strange's plan is still in motion, involves the time stone, and was not disrupted by Star-Lord.   Going through here I'll be retreading commonly posted things to get to my newer observations. 

1) Doctor Strange has seen 14,000,605 futures.  He has seen 1 that results in victory over Thanos.  This much is accepted, so people realize that Doctor Strange knows how to win.

2) Doctor Strange gives up the time stone to spare Tony Stark's life.  Earlier in the movie he says that he would let Tony or Peter Parker die before he gave up the time stone.  He said that before he saw the path to victory.  So the assumption being that Tony being alive is essential, as is Thanos having the time stone.  Though I believe that the most important thing with this was getting the time stone to Thanos without Thanos suspecting much more than Strange's humanity making him unwilling to watch Tony die. 

3) Dr. Strange says two important and oft-quoted things to Iron Man.  The first is "We're in the endgame now" indicating that everything is still going according to plan and he's done what he needs to.  The other is "It was the only way", indicating that the time stone and the snap and everything that happens is the only future that leads to victory.

4) Doctor Strange sends his cloak to wrap Thanos' hand at one point, and he mutters to it, "Don't let him close his fist."  This indicates that Doctor Strange is aware of the most minute aspects of the fight, considering Thanos closes his fist a few times during the fight without anything major happening as a result.  Dr. Strange is there when Peter Quill is finding out about Gamora and freaks out, resulting in Spider-Man and Iron Man failing to take off the gauntlet.  He's the only character who doesn't attempt to stop it.  He also very easily could have magicked Quill away if it wasn't essential.

5) The last thing is the act of handing over the time stone.  There's something different about this one that I double checked when I saw him holding the others.  Thanos directly holds the other stones in his fingers, skin on stone.  There's a green aura surrounding the time stone when he takes it and his fingers never actually touch the stone.  He's holding it by the aura, and looks confused and slightly concerned when he first takes it while Doctor Strange is watching him carefully.  He puts it in the gauntlet and leaves, it's at this point that Doctor Strange says they're in the endgame.  I believe Doctor Strange activated something in the time stone before handing it to Thanos.  

Conclusion: Doctor Strange was in control of all aspects of the fight on Titan, none of it going against his one path to victory.  The heroes semi-succeeded because Doctor Strange's goal was to activate the time stone and get Thanos to take it and use it without suspecting Strange had already activated a function, and keeping Tony Stank alive.  I believe that all of Thanos' uses of the gauntlet that involve the time stone will be reversible because Doctor Strange set it that way before handing it over.  The key to defeating Thanos is now in his hand.  
In the beginning of the movie, we are lead to believe that Buzz ate the cheese pizza that Kevin preferred, due to his distaste of other pizza toppings, which caused the scuffle between him and Buzz. 

Earlier in the film, Heather asks Tracy if she ordered the pizza, to which she replies that “Buzz did.” Being the total dick that he is, Buzz saw an opportunity to escalate his prank, getting yet another one over on Kevin and implied that he at it all, and that someone would “have to barf it up.”

One could argue that others from the McCallister clan also partook in enjoying the variety of pizza in question; however, in the various visual perspectives in the scene following Buzz and Kevin’s altercation, there is no evidence of anyone having a slice of cheese pizza. 

Although he is the last to enter the kitchen, Kevin is but a mere few seconds behind Buzz, making it humanly impossible for Buzz to eat even a slice of pizza, let alone an entire one. Additionally, when Kevin enters the room and scans the landscape for any evidence of a cheese pizza, he then asks, “did anybody order a plain cheese?” — suggesting that there was no cheese pizza to be found.

Lastly, when Kevin asks the pizza boy why he “didn’t bring more cheese pizzas,” he seems somewhat confused by the inquiry, presumably because he delivered an order that did not include a single cheese pizza.I was doing a rewatch of community, and watched the Halloween episode "Epidemiology", about Greendale being infected by a zombie virus. They figure out that turning the temperature down using the thermostat will cause the infected to revert to normal, but the entire group is picked off, one by one. Eventually, Troy manages to make it to the thermostat, being bit in the process. He manages to press the down button a few times, then becomes a zombie. We then assume that Troy must have succeeded, since everyone goes back to normal. But, there's two major pieces of evidence that show **Troy did not save everyone, the AC repair school did.**

First off: The thermostat temp is shown going down... *after* Troy has let go of it. The model they're using is a pretty standard one: one press of the down button equals one degree colder, holding it moves faster. Troy pressed it only three or four times before collapsing, nowhere near close enough to drop it the twenty degrees shown. Even if it were, how would the temp continue to drop after he wasn't pressing it? We learn from Murray that the AC school "Has eyes and ears everywhere", AKA, a network of hidden cameras around the school. He also states that they "Control air conditioning across the world".

The second reason is even more obvious: When the AC starts blowing, it comes from a vent with small strips of paper blowing in it. That was used repeatedly as a symbol of the AC school: Troy stops to look at one when he gets kidnapped by them; the fan in the Dean's prison, which the AC school is shown to control has them; and Troy, upon seeing the flags on an AC vent, immediately walks into the room for a meeting with Laybourne, showing that he recognized it as a secret message.

The AC repair school was shown to function almost like a cult, wielding a surprising amount of wealth and power. So, when the Dean's mistake caused hundreds of army soldiers from a black ops division to plan on wiping out the school, they decided to help save everyone, shifting the government's plans from eradication, to just wiping memories. That would prevent any further investigation, while also saving Troy, who they believed to be their "Chosen Repairman".The entire premise of the movie is that Bruce grew to hate God and then was given incredible powers to prove that being the almighty is harder than it looks. 

But look at the situation objectively. Satan would see a much greater opportunity in a mortal growing to hate God. That would allow him to tempt and manipulate the person far more than normal. Not only that, but God is supposed to be omnipotent whereas the being that Bruce met had clear limitations (particularly related to free will). 

The things that Bruce used his powers for also make me question if they came from God. He made a monkey crawl out of a guy's ass (then jump back in) and in a deleted scene, fucking[ lit Even Baxter on FIRE](https://youtu.be/dhuFxK01fyQ?t=22) with a look of pure maliciousness. 

Bruce's abuse of his powers eventually caused^^^ the city to descend into absolute chaos. I just highly doubt that God would allow so many people to get hurt just because one single news anchor had a crisis of faith. The story makes more sense if you think of Morgan Freeman's character as an evil genie giving Bruce exactly what he wishes for and taking pleasure in the chaos that ensues.It's simple. It involves martial arts and skill, as well as knowledge of anatomy, the Hulk and how his strength works. If Thanos is aware of Hulk as a being that gets stronger with anger, Thanos knows he has to interrupt that process internally. The Avengers know it as well, which is why they try to calm him down with soft talk and a pretty lady. 

Thanos accomplishes this with targeted strikes. If you notice re-watching the fight scene, Thanos' first strike is to Hulks neck. In fact, the next few strikes are to his neck and chin. These areas are vital and attacks to these areas will disrupt the flow of oxygen by restricting the ability to breathe, and disorient the brain by concussive force. Chin strikes have a higher chance to rattle someone. 

Thanos' next attacks are to Hulks kidneys.  However those with medical knowledge know the adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Thanos has a directed attack to injure and cause damage to Hulks 'source of power' so to speak by potentially injuring his adrenal glands. More on that in a few. Also, Boxers and MMA fighters report on the effects of kidney strikes as debilitating and stunning. One http://www.jameslafond.com/article.php?id=2857&src=feed article reads: 

"When Aaron hit me I pissed blood for three days, and was exhausted for an entire week, sleeping 10 hours per day. The less then professional quality power shots simply hurt and made me more determined to fight. The pro quality shots paralyzed me on my feet for about a second each."

and from https://extremestrikers.com/kidney-punch-and-liver-shot/:

While symptoms will vary from person to person, the common ones are –

Soreness – the area will be sore for at least a few days up to a week. Because of their central location, it’s very likely that any movement, even breathing, will cause discomfort during this time.
Fatigue – You may very well find yourself wanting to sleep all day. This is your body’s way of telling you it needs time to recover.

In more severe cases, a bruised kidney can lead to serious health complications, such as:

low blood pressure
anemia
inability to urinate
internal bleeding
shock
kidney failure
death

Each shot by Thanos is specifically calculated to immobilize Hulk, impact his internal organs and his adrenal glands, slow his ability to think and mentally stun him. Hulk get mad if he can't think, and Thanos knows this. His attacks are fast and in quick succession, allowing him to take Hulk by surprise and strike in just the right spots to incapacitate him. This also impacts his ability to become the Hulk over the next few weeks as he recovers, which may explain why Banner cannot Hulk out. Hulk being "not in tune" with Banner is another way of saying Hulk was given a concussion. If his adrenal glands were damaged internally, he would also be unable to utilize his anger and strength until recovered.

Edit: /u/JorusC pointed out a strike to the vagus nerve located in the neck can cause immediate syncope, a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. More evidence that Thanos is attacking his pressure points and CNS to inhibit him quickly

Thanks for the shiny metal! The Golden Snitch has been mocked as a device to let Harry win Quidditch matches single-handedly. It invalidates almost the whole game. 150 points just for the Snitch, when goals only count for 10 points, seems ridiculous. 

However, this may not have always been the case. There are stories of Quidditch games lasting for days or weeks (they have to have something to do until someone invents the wizard Internet) - with so many goals being scored in this case, the Snitch wouldn't be so significant. 

What's changed? Broomsticks. In the course of the series we see the Nimbus 2000 outclass all other broomsticks, then the 2001 edge that out, then the Firebolt sweep the floor with all of them. This massive leap in flight magic isn't matched by a corresponding Snitch speed increase. The Snitch has clearly become easier to catch due to faster brooms, such that there isn't time for goals to be significant. 

**TL;DR:** Broomsticks have improved, causing the Snitch to be caught very quickly. Past Thanos comes pretty quick to the conclusion that the Avengers time travelled. He didn't had trouble believing time travel could exist, so this indicates he knows something about it works. 

When Thanos says he's inevitable, maybe it's because he knew his actions had to happen because of the sacred timeline

What the fuck am I writing I'm way too high sorrySo I've been thinking a lot about Thanos lately, and how he seemed to have such resolute conviction about destroying the Infinity Stones after his snap, to prevent them from being used to undo his culling of the universe. And something didn't sit right with me.

Thanos is a smart guy. He's worked hard for decades on his crusade to balance the universe. He may have even used the Time Stone to look ahead and see his death at the hands of the surviving Avengers. But he didn't seemed concerned about his great work being undone. And yet, it would be, even just with nature running its course.

The world population in 2018 was roughly 7.7 billion. Thanos snaps, we're down to 3.85 billion, or roughly the global population at the end of 1972. So in 46 years, about half a human lifetime, the population would bounce back. And presumably this would be a similar scenario replayed on other planets in the MCU that survived the snap enough to bounce back. Surely this would have occurred to someone as smart and methodical as Thanos.

And even if he didn't foresee his own death, he would have understood that without the stones, life would be free to run rampant again. So my theory is, as part of his plan to remove the temptation of the stones but still ensure his great work would not be in vain, he created an insurance policy, at the same time that he was destroying the stones. An agent of destruction that would keep life in check by not only being a cosmically powered force of nature that mere mortal heroes couldn't surpress, but also  by using burgeoning populations and biospheres for its own sustenance. A world devourer.

And I think that's how they'll bring Galactus into the MCU.Fathers in pantheons can be real sons of bitches, and Odin is no exception. He is tough on his eldest son because he knows the weight of leadership that his death will place on Thor’s shoulders. This is why Odin designs one last trial for Thor to pass before he takes his place as the king of Asgard,

The Theory: The trials of Thor Odinson.

Odin has the gift of foresight and knows the events of Ragnarok and what it means for his people and his son Thor. Odin knows that Hela will be released and that Asgard will be destroyed. We know he knows this because he leads Thor and Loki to Norway and shows them their new home.

He also knows that his son is about to face the most challenging part of his life and that Thor will have to reign in the worst part of Asgard’s history; Ragnarok. So Odin designed his enchantments to dissipate upon his death, forcing Thor to become the leader the Asgard’s people truly need because if Thor doesn’t, the people are doomed.

At this point, you may be thinking, what kinda guy sets up his son and people for failure? But, he is not. He is setting them up for success.

Hela will be released. Whether it’s now or in a thousand years, she will get loose. Nothing Odin can do about that. The only thing he can control is when. The hammer was always supposed to be a stepping stone, training wheels for a god that does not understand his true power yet.  This is Thor‘s fly or die moment. The Asgardians can only survive if Thor is able to access his true power. He can’t do that until he understands his true potential, and for that to happen, he must be tested beyond anything he faced before.

In the film, Thor learns all the Kingly traits that he needs to be a good king and leader. He learns courage when he is at a disadvantage without his hammer, he learns humility when he has to ask for help. He learns honesty with his brother and learns sacrifice when he puts his people before his own life.

But the most important lesson he learns does not come until later when he learns the wisdom to discern that he is not the right one to rule Asgard and gives the role to Valkyrie. 
Odin may have wanted his son to lead but Thor gains the wisdom to see that he is better suited as a warrior than a leader.

Without the coming of Hela, the loss of his hammer, and the destruction of his homeworld, he wouldn’t have learned the lessons he needed to save the people of Asgard and eventually defeat help Thanos.This is a very short theory, but I always imagined that Force Sensitive beings in the Star Wars universe are able to feel the weight of a lightsaber as though it was a physical blade, rather than weightless plasma trapped in a magnetic field.

Other than General Grievous, who was cybernetically engineered to act with reflexes as though he had the Force & years of training with Count Dooku, we don't see very many people in the Star Wars lore that use mainly lightsabers. Finn used a lightsaber at one point, but wasn't particularly good at it and had switched back to guns. i might be wrong about Grievous being the only non-Force Sensitive to mainly use lightsabers, but he's the only one I can think of.

A lot of people bring up how dangerous lightsabers would be irl because the lack of weight to the blade, so for me, I think that's why lightsabers are so tricky to use for non-Force Sensitives: they are dangerous because they can't feel the blade and it greatly increases the chance of them accidentally hitting themselves with it. For the Jedi and Sith, on the other hand, can sense all sorts of things through the Force, including energy, so I think they are able to feel the weight of their lightsabers, and maybe even subconsciously prevent themselves from hitting themselves with the blade due to instinct granted through the Force.

What do you guys think?To articulate this theory, I will instead tell a story. A story of betrayal, murder and exploration like you never did see before...

&#x200B;

At some point in the near future, the Jupiter Mining Corporation sets up multiple ships to search for precious materials. One such ship is Red Dwarf, which suffered a radiation leak that killed all but one of the crew. Another is the doomed Skeld, a small mission of ten astronauts, which was dedicated to following similar ships on route to the planet Polus. The Skeld's mission would take 120 years, so the goal was for the crewmates to breed and eventually have their decedents finish the mission. Before boarding, two of the Skeld's crew were killed and replaced by alien Impostors, who wanted to sabotage the ship and kill its crew.

&#x200B;

Four of the crewmates, nicknamed Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde, were the victims of the impostors before the killers were found and ejected from the ship. With six inhabitants of the Skeld dead, the survivors decided to abandon ship, leaving in escape pods to return to base. The four victims woke up as holograms, pre-programmed into the ship with all the memories and feelings of the originals, to continue with ship tasks after death. Unable to leave the ship, the holograms were left with only themselves, unable to sleep, unable to touch anything ever again.

&#x200B;

Decades passed, and the ghosts' loneliness turned into depression, which turned into paranoia, which turned into psychosis. They were not designed to go on without tasks, purpose or company, and this caused an error in the ship's main computer; all security measures were fried and they were given complete access to the ship. Having been turned mad, they tried to shut themselves down but instead turned the Skeld to low power mode, trapping themselves in Electrical and leaving doors closed; the ship had become a maze.

&#x200B;

Another few decades passed, and the ghosts were now murderous. Eventually, a lone traveller, part of the newly established Intergalactic Pacification Department (A "Pac" Man, as known colloquially), boarded the ship and powered it back up, releasing the ghosts. The glitch had developed, now allowing them to kill whomever they touched. The Pac-Man realised that this ship was empty, and was tasked with destroying it and fining the owners, but he was now running for his life through the labyrinth. His only chance of survival was to mend the ship and shut it down, and in a reversal of the crewmates' fates now Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde were trying to murder an innocent while he completed tasks.

&#x200B;

Eventually, the Pac-Man prevailed and shut down the ship, yet due to his brush with death he was no longer in a position to destroy it. He escaped back to base, and later called his colleague, nicknamed Ms. Pac Man due to intergalactic sexism, to shut down the murderous holograms once and for all...While many has said that the reason Thanos lost, the second time, was because he traveled to the future, not knowing anything about the avengers, therefore, being unprepared for the fight. A few examples of this being proven, is Wanda approaching Thanos, telling him he will pay for what he did, and Thanos responds he doesn’t even know her. Another example is the original Thanos knowing about Tony Stark, before ever having met, however, time traveling Thanos does not know about him. This is a heavily supported theory, and fits very well, however, there might be another reason for why Thanos lost. The time traveling Thanos was unworthy of wielding the infinity stones, as he did not collect them himself. The original Thanos traveled around the universe, to find and collect the infinity stones, with the help of his sons and daughters. The time traveling Thanos did not. He simply collected the already finished gauntlet, and lost because of it. Furthermore, the second gauntlet, made by Iron Man, contained a different soul stone. As we know, the first soul stone was made from Gamoras soul, whom Thanos had a deep connection with, but the second soul stone was made from Natashas soul, whom Thanos had no connection to at all. This is also why both Hulk and Tony were able to use the gauntlet, because Natashas soul deemed them worthy, and this, I believe, is the second or main reason why Thanos lost.

I know it is a little late, considering how long ago the movie came out, but it just came to me while watching another theory.**This theory is specifically related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not the comic books.**

I believe the element Tony was able to rediscover, and the element Howard knew about but couldn't create, is none other than Uru, the metal used to make such objects like Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, and the Infinity Gauntlet. We see a drastic improvement in Stark Tech following Iron Man 2, and I believe Uru metal answers a lot of otherwise extremely convenient features of the Iron Man suit and Stark Tech in general.

I've seen the argument that the element he discovers is Vibranium, though I don't believe this is the case. Ultron, a creation of Tony's, specifically looks for Vibranium metal, and you'd think if he knows everything about Tony, he'd know that his suits contained Vibranium and would have taken some of Tony's Vibranium instead of dealing with Ulysses Klaw. Also, while Jarvis is looking for a suitable replacement for the Palladium core, he explained that he had tried every known combination of elements. This would have included several attempts with Vibranium, as Vibranium was discovered as early as the 1940's as shown in Captain America: The First Avenger. 

To begin, one of my major issues with Avengers: Endgame is the recreation of the Infinity Gauntlet at the Avengers facility. Thanos specifically waits until the Asgardians are crippled to assault Nidavellir and construct the Infinity Gauntlet, but Tony and the gang make a suitable replacement seemingly without any issue. Not only do they make a replacement, but they make a replacement that works, and would have worked again had Tony not intervened (more on that later). If a component of the Stark Gauntlet is Uru metal, suddenly it doesn't seem as convenient. 

It should be stated here that I don't believe Tony's tech is made entirely of Uru, though I believe he was able to successfully incorporate it into his suit and technology to incredible effects. If Tony's suit is composed of part Uru, it would also explain why Tony was able to snap without the use of the Stark Gauntlet, as Uru was already present in his suit. Tony died not because he wasn't wearing a gauntlet, but because he was wearing an Infinity Suit that transferred the stones' power throughout his entire body. Both gauntlets locate the damage to the users' arm specifically.

Homing Tech, and by that I mean suits like the Mark 42 in Iron Man 3 and the one we see in the Battle of New York in The Avengers, also came post-Iron Man 2. I believe this is because Tony was able to unlock the signature 'return to sender' quality present in Mjolnir and in Stormbreaker, weapons both made from Uru that return to their wielder's hand. I don't think this is the only reason his Homing Tech works, as surely Tony Stark is capable of creating something like this without Uru metal, though I do believe it made things a lot easier for Tony when he discovered this property of the metal in his research. It's an interesting property of suits that directly follow his element rediscovery in Iron Man 2. I think this returning property is specific to weapons, which is why we don't see something like this from the Infinity Gauntlet, which is armour. Tony's suit is referred to as 'the Iron Man Weapon' in Iron Man 2.

Mjolnir and Stormbreaker both act as excellent conductors for Thor's lightning ability. We know they are not responsible for his lightning for two reasons: one, because of Thor: Ragnarok, where Thor unlocks his true power during the fight with Hela where he is absent from his weapons, and two, because of Cap wielding lightning through Mjolnir's 'possess the power of Thor' enchantment in Endgame. These weapons use lightning to power their attacks, and another thing that uses lightning to power its attacks is the Iron Man suit, shown in the forest fight in Avengers 1 and the Thanos fight in Avengers 4.

Uru metal is said to be forged in the heart of a dying star multiple times in the MCU. Another thing 'forged' in the heart of a dying star is heavy metals like gold and iron. A particle accelerator, the machine used to synthesize Tony's new element, is said, according to the MCU wiki, to use giant magnets to fire billions of subatomic particles into their anti-particles at the speed of light to create miniature big bangs. Howard Stark worked on the Manhattan Project, and later goes on to say he was 'limited by the technology of his time' and therefore couldn't create this new element. I believe his work on the Manhattan Project and the science involved there lead to his discovery of Uru. Now, obviously I'm not a scientist, though Howard's research in the Manhattan Project, where we know atoms were split, could very well have lead to subatomic research.

Something that always bothered me about Avengers: Infinity War was Thanos claiming he knew Tony, and that 'he wasn't the only one cursed with knowledge.' If Tony uses Uru in his technology, this quote makes way more sense. Thanos knows of Tony and the Avengers, so him knowing Tony isn't a stretch, but the 'cursed with knowledge' bit could be explained by Tony's creation of Uru. We see the Iron Man technology become more of a responsibility than a boon for Tony as the MCU goes on, likening itself to more of a curse than a convenience. Thanos, who we've established to understand the convenience and utility of Uru metal given his desire to form the Infinity Gauntlet out of it, would pity Tony, a man who has the Uru element but also has no end goal for his technology. Thanos wants to eradicate half of all life, but Tony can't seem to let go of his technology. I believe Thanos would view this as a curse. I think Thanos knows Tony has this kind of technology based on the reports he gets on the Battle of New York.

**TL;DR I believe Tony created Uru metal in Iron Man 2 based on Stark Tech sustaining the Infinity Stones on two separate occasions, the similarities between homing tech like Mark 42 and Uru weapons like Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, the power that lightning specifically gives the suit, Howard's connection with the Manhattan Project, and Thanos' claim that Tony is 'cursed with knowledge.'**Since today, October 21 2015, is "Back to the Future" day (the day Marty goes to 2015) you can expect to see a lot of "where's my hoverboard?" jokes. The reason for this? Marty is not in "our" 2015...he's in a brand new timeline that's radically different because of his first trip to 1955!

When Marty returns to 1985 after that first trip, Hill Valley is noticeably different...in particular his family and Biff. But one event that happens that day will change the world...the publication of George McFly's seminal science fiction novel "A Match Made in Space". We don't know a lot about this novel, but we can tell that it was heavily inspired by George's encounter with Marty in 1955.

This novel becomes a pop culture phenomenon, and changes everything about the world going forward. Just as "Star Trek" inspired the flip phone and tablet computer, George McFly inspires many a young engineer and the results include the invention of flying cars and, yes, hoverboards.

So, the talented minds that brought us the internet and smartphones instead directed their efforts to more day-to-day technologies: mainly transportation and fashion. Meanwhile data sharing languished so Marty's 2015 is still very much paper-driven.

Now you know know that Zemeckis and Gale didn't predict 2015 wrong...instead they imagined a world inspired by Marty and George McFly's 1955 adventures having ripple effects 60 years later.This is an idea I've clung to for a while, but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.

GTA V is not a subtle game when it comes to sociopolitical satire. Hell, it's not a subtle game on any level, I mean, it is a game where a guy can hijack a cargo jet mid-flight or mow down cops with a minigun. The setting is mad, just like the protagonists. Conservatives are all hilariously evil, hand-steepling corporate moguls who publicly rant about hating gays, immigrants and the crippled ("God, do I hate the crippled" - actual quote from Republican candidate Jock Cranley). Liberals, meanwhile, are all Urban-shopping hipsters whose personalities range between the extremes of "decent but totally lacking in self-awareness about their own hypocritical lifestyles" to "a few steps away from functional retardation". Cops are all murderous psychos who openly scream bizarre shit about how killing gets them hard. Mass advertising for fictional brands with appealing names such as 'Pißwasser' beer, 'Sprunk' energy drink and 'LifeInvader' social network is everywhere. Some brands date back to GTA:SA and GTA IV, but GTA V's west coast aesthetic makes it even more prevalent.

All this coming from the biggest AAA video game franchise of all time. 'Ironic' may be the best word.

But then you remember our protagonists and their deeply cynical, alienated and overall warped perspectives on the world. You've got Michael, an unhinged ex-robber who's been rehabilitated by the FIB (there's another one) into a dull, cushy west coast lifestyle he hates with a superficial family he's grown to equally despise. You've got Trevor, a raving psychopath living in the inbred stix who also hates hipster culture and modern life in general, and is always a mocking Canadian "eh?" away from blowing the whole planet up. You've got Franklin, a highly ambitious gangbanger living in the impoverished ghetto of San Andreas who feels like he's been born in the wrong generation and social class, with the white, upper crust neighbourhoods always a stone's throw away but unattainable. Going back further, we also have Niko, a poor Serbian immigrant who's been surrounded by horrific violence his entire life, now transposed into the dark, consumerist culture of America.

And you've also got Chop, who's a dog. And your own Online avatar, who's probably insane.

They can all see through the veneer. To them, Facebook is LifeInvader. The horrible watered-down beer is Pisswasser. The politicians are all corrupt, idiotic, hypocritical loudmouths. The millennial youngsters are all lazy, entitled, obnoxious pricks. They've all wearily seen what the stinking, rotten world truly is beneath the fanciful surface. Hardly any of the other characters can see it or question it, though. Considering that we also see our heroes go through wacky acid trips and transform into pigeons after eating peyote cacti, it's far from outside the realm of possibility that the world of Los Santos/Liberty City/wherever might not actually be all it seems to be through their eyes.

However, considering how unsubtly batshit insane the real world can be, GTA's satire might almost be seen as quaint. What do you think?Note: I am cross-posting this partially because I put a lot of work into it and it was not successful on /r/StrangerThings, but also because the commenters there are apprehensive about reading "too much" into the show. I thought /r/FanTheories might be more receptive to this kind of thing. [Edit: it's doing alright in the original sub, now.] Spoilers below.

Many viewers have expressed their frustration and outrage over the death of Barb. She was a good friend to Nancy, a lovable character, and an innocent young life. On the surface, her brutal on-screen killing by the Demogorgon seems like a bizarre, sadistic travesty.

However, Barb’s death is actually a powerful rejection of the weirdly old-fashioned conservatism and misogyny that undergird even modern horror.

We must first understand that Barb mainly exists to symbolize Nancy’s virginity. When Nancy and Barb are first shown together onscreen, it becomes apparent that until recently, they have been on the same page regarding sex and attraction to boys: such things are taboo. However, Nancy is starting to deviate from this attitude. She reveals to Barb that she recently made out with Steve, which is clearly groundbreaking for either of them. (In a later scene, Nancy again makes out with Steve.) Barb reacts with chiding disbelief: what is Nancy doing, drifting towards such new and perhaps scary sexual experiences? 

The rift widens dramatically when Nancy brings Barb along to Steve’s house party. In the car, Barb disapprovingly speculates that Steve wants to get into Nancy’s pants. Although Nancy denies this, the fact that she bought a new bra for the occasion belies her true intention: she is ready for sex. 

At the party, Steve shotguns a beer and invites Nancy to do the same—she does. Nancy in turn invites Barb, who is clearly not having a good time, to do so as well. After much prodding, Barb reluctantly attempts to follow Steve and Nancy’s example, but she instead cuts her hand and returns to moping. I’ll return to the significance of this scene.

After some impromptu swimming (guess who doesn’t participate), Nancy follows Steve inside to change out of her wet clothes and “warm up by the fire.” Barb, irritated, insists that she and Nancy leave; it’s getting late. Barb is obviously aware that her friend is on the brink of sex. At this crucial moment, Nancy dismisses Barb’s concerns and tells her to go home alone. The choice is made—not only to separate from Barb, but to explore her sexual options with Steve.

Finally, the big scene: as Barb sulks at the pool outside Steve’s house, adhering awkwardly to her non-partying, virgin ways, Nancy initiates sex with Steve inside. This is the first time that Nancy and Barb have not appeared onscreen together. 

At this point, we watch a series of cuts between Nancy’s first sexual experience and Barb’s descent into the Upside Down, where she is brutally killed at the hands/mouth of the Demogorgon. It is plainly obvious, due to the nature of these back-and-forth cuts, that there is some relationship between Nancy’s sex and Barb’s death. The more Nancy seems to relish the sex, the louder Barb screams and struggles.

Let’s examine some patterns in this timeline. Nancy’s path from virginity to sex precisely parallels her abandonment of Barb. Every interaction between Barb and Nancy, from the lockers to the pre-party to the beer, revolves around their increasingly heated disagreement over sex and boys, and every time Nancy drifts further from Barb, she drifts away from her virgin tendencies to the same degree. In abandoning Barb and going upstairs with Steve, Nancy also abandons her virginity. The two decisions are unified in a single act—functionally, the same decision. Most importantly, the instant Nancy has sex with Steve, Barb not only dies, but vanishes completely from Nancy’s life. After sex with Steve, Nancy attempts to find Barb, but she can never get Barb back. Just like Nancy’s virginity, Barb is gone, and Nancy shows feelings of panic and regret about both Barb’s disappearance and her relationship with Steve—especially after Steve’s slut-shaming, which itself has complex ties to Nancy’s sex life, as perceived by Steve. 

In short, Nancy’s every decision regarding sex is reflected in her relationship with Barb. Barb is thus a symbol of Nancy’s virginity—its prudish, physical manifestation.

Now is an appropriate time to examine the pattern of tropes surrounding female sexuality in horror films. For reference, I am mostly drawing from the following TV Tropes articles: 

* Virgin Power: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower
* Final Girl: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl
* Death by Sex: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex
* Sex is Evil: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil
* A Man is Not a Virgin: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsNotAVirgin

In horror films, especially slasher flicks, female virginity is equated with conservative ideas of moral purity, while female sexuality is equated with base moral failings. Sexually active females are typically punished for their behavior with death or similarly grave consequences, while virgins survive longer, possibly through being more resilient and resourceful. In some cases, as in the “Final Girl” trope, the virgin is the only survivor of a monster’s onslaught, and finally secures victory in the climax sequence. 

Virgins are typically portrayed as modest in dress and habit, kind, and overall really great. On the other hand, their sexually active counterparts wear revealing (“slutty”) clothes, go to bed easily, may be stupid, and have less reserved personalities. Of the two, virgins are less likely to drink or smoke. (Recall the beer scene.)

Problems abound when we attempt to fit Barb and Nancy into this framework. There are some easy calls: between the two, Barb is to some degree the virgin stereotype. She dresses modestly, has a prudish (“morally pure”) attitude about sex and alcohol, and doesn’t go in for free-spirited night swimming. So, the conventional narrative about virgins in a horror movie is running along smoothly—that is, until it runs into the brick wall of Barb’s sudden death and completely falls apart. The virgin isn’t supposed to die! A rule is clearly being broken here.

Let us turn now to Nancy. While she obviously is becoming sexually active, it’s hard to label her as the conventional horror bimbo. She starts out almost as prudish as Barb. Yes, she shotguns a beer, but it’s a new experience to her. She has sex with Steve, but unlike the casual romp of a blond horror-movie slut stereotype, the sex is very new and emotionally profound for her. Most importantly, despite having sex—a crime punishable by death in many horror stories—she survives the entire series, becoming one of the main heroes. 

Barb, the virgin, is killed, while Nancy, the sexually active teenager, helps beat the monster.

The conventional rules of female sexuality in horror are being flouted here, and frankly, it’s about time. After all, what do these rules teach young women? That sex is dangerous and unacceptable—but only for them, and not men? (Granted, sometimes both sex partners in horror movies bite the dust because of their acts. Nevertheless, the stereotype is much more intense for female characters.) Should we really accept that the only way to be a moral person is to avoid sex? And as for the morals themselves, we find genuine traits of kindness and integrity (or the lack thereof) bundled with ridiculously conservative and superficial notions about substance use and how ‘reserved’ or ‘talkative’ a female character should be. These are terrible standards of decent behavior; one can be a morally upright person who enjoys being outgoing and who likes to drink and/or smoke. To me, these stereotypes have laughable signs of patriarchal repression written all over them.

*Stranger Things* teaches vastly different lessons, and the most important one is that as a young woman, it’s okay—maybe even necessary—to kill your virginity. It’s a normal part of life, and you can be a decent person afterwards. Though it is sometimes painful, Nancy learns a lot about her romantic partner after sex and its related dramas. She gains fresh independence after leaving Barb and her virginity behind, ultimately summoning the nerve to strike out against a trans-dimensional, man-eating monster. Another lesson: new experiences can help you explore who you are as a person and test new boundaries. This may come in the form of learning big life lessons and slaying your monsters, or it may be little things. Often, you’ll find it quite enjoyable to breach your comfort zone. Drinking a beer with friends can be fun. Sex can be fun. 

*Stranger Things* brings horror into the twenty first century by shattering the bonds between abstinence and moral superiority. Barb, who we are led to believe has more integrity and principle because of her aversion to sex, is not rewarded as she might be in the typical horror film. In fact, she is killed for sitting on the sidelines, having failed to shotgun a beer (the blood from this failure literally drawing the monster), while her friend has sex. In this context, it’s not Barb being destroyed, but the thing Barb represents: a hard-line, unequivocal link between abstinence and the moral high ground. If this seems like a rather harsh way to break the mold, perhaps that is because the mold needs a good, bloody ker-thwacking.  

When Nancy says her final good-bye to Barb, she also invites the audience to consider a more realistic and nuanced woman in the horror genre: dynamic and sometimes flawed instead of one-dimensionally upright, this character can represent not only virginity and sexuality but also the struggle between them. As a young hero, she can explore her sexuality in ways that are not central to the main struggle, but that help her mature emotionally in order to face it.

TL;DR: Barb’s death may not be so random after all, [why not](http://static3.fjcdn.com/comments/Need+a+coloured+text+_09a1c767ce46ea560e2ef8f5735ad844.png).

Edit time!

This theory should be revised along the lines of u/Afalstein's excellent comment:

> Mostly excellent theory, apart from your view of how its meant to be interpreted. I love, and fully agree with you, about what Barb is meant to represent and why her death is irreversible. The cuts between the sex scenes and the demogorgon death had not occurred to me before, and the way you explain it makes perfect sense.
However, I would take issue with your characterization of Barb. Barb doesn't seem to disagree with sex per se, just sex with Steve, because she thinks sex is all Steve is interested in. At the time, she's right--it's only later that Steve starts to realize he feels more than lust for Nancy. We also see that Barb's issue is not morality--when she chides Nancy for going in for sex, she doesn't do so on moral grounds, but on grounds of self-affirmation--"This isn't you." Nancy's sexual awakening isn't an act of rebellion, it's something she's doing because everyone else is. Jonathon underscores this later--"You're a teenage girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing the exact same thing as every other teenage girl."
More to the point, if Barb is an image of Nancy's virginity, and you say the message is that it's okay--even necessary--to kill your virginity, then that would mean Barb's death is supposed to be seen as okay--even positive. Which it was certainly not framed as--it was dark and horrific, not merely "harsh." Nancy bitterly regrets Barb's loss and would do almost anything to get her back.
In fact, Barb is presented very positively, not in the negative way you seem to be framing her here. She's part of Nancy's school life and helps her pursue her intellectual ambitions, in contrast to Steve, who is bored with Nancy's attempts to pursue a career and merely interested in her as a sexual object. Barb disagrees with Nancy's actions, but follows along loyally (enduring being ignored by her friend and pressured into situations where she feels uncomfortable) until Nancy flat-out tells her to leave. You say she's "pouting" and not participating when she's killed, but Jonathon's picture--with its wide angle--surely casts her as lonely, forsaken by her friends--rather than "pouty" (and anyway, who is she supposed to be "participating" with? Doing a threesome with Steve or his asshole friends?)
Basically, I like your interpretation of who Barb is meant to be, but I disagree very strongly with your take on how Barb--and her death--is meant to be viewed.

And, for convenience, my reply:

> You have definitely convinced me that I did not do to justice (heh) to Barb's character. She was genuinely principled and a good friend. You're also right about how bad her death scene was. I guess Nancy's actions and Barb's death are possibly more about the loss of innocence that accompanies a coming-of-age tale. Nancy and Steve's later redemption proves that loss of innocence is not the end-all-be-all for a character.

As a side note, I'm fascinated by the different ways in which people perceive Nancy and Barb's actions. Some especially perceive Barb in a more negative light, which I don't think has to be the case in my interpretation. FWIW, I prefer /u/Afalstein's interpretation.&#x200B;

**Timeline A**

&#x200B;

Timeline A is what can be called The coolsville Univers. In this universe, their town is called coolsville. In includes Scooby Doo Where are you,The New Scooby Doo Movies,The Scooby Doo Show, Scooby and Scrappy Doo (both series), the all new scrappy doo show, the new scooby doo mysteries, A pup named Scooby Doo, What’s New Scooby Doo, and Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue. In this timeline, I believe that the gang has known each other since childhood. There is a flashback in A pup named Scooby Doo that seems to suggest this. However, most of their documented adventures occur during Their teen years. In the Episode What a night for a Knight, Freddy calls it “another mystery,” meaning they have done this before. The original series, as well as the Scooby Doo show, and the New Scooby Doo Movies all take place while the gang is in high school. I also believe even though most of their cases are hoaxes, the paranormal is real in this continuity.

This version of the kids also shares a  universe with every character that appears in these. This means that the three stooges, batman and robin, speed buggy, Josie and the Pussycats, the Adams Family, Jeannie, Laurel & Hardy, and anyone else who appears is in this universe exists in this universe.

At the end of high school, The Gang breaks up. Daphne and Fred go off together, Velma opens a bookstore, and Shaggy and Scooby continue their adventures accept that this time there is someone new, Scrappy Doo. 

Scrappy Doo is “Scooby’s nephew” accept  I don’t believe that they are actually related. The finale to the fourth incarnation titled “The Ransom of Scooby Chief” gives us an interesting backstory about Scrappy. It shows he was previously in a gang with two other dogs named Duke and Annie.

I believe that Scrappy was put in serious danger during his time in New York and was placed in Witness Protection. The department of Justice fabricates the story that we get in the episode “Scrappy’s Birthday” as a cover story. The Scooby and Scrappy Doo Shorts, Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers, Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School, and Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf all take place during this time period.

Meanwhile, while Daphne is on the road with Fred, she realizes she is actually in love with Shaggy and leaves Fred for Shaggy. Next, we get the All New Scrappy Doo Show, 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, and New Scooby Doo mysteries. Overtime, Daphne and Fred begin to work things out and Velma also re enters their lives.

The gang officially gets back together this time with Scrappy Doo and when they get the Lennie Weinrib era Scrappy Doo series. Scrappy eventually blows his cover by returning home to his old life and has to be reassigned to another family. This family is Yabba Doo and Deputy Dusty who are in no way related to Scooby Doo

Next we get What’s New Scooby Doo and the Casey Kasem era   Direct to video Movies. All of the movies made from 2003-2009 take place at the same time as What’s New Scooby Doo. I also believe that The Curse of the thirteen ghosts exists in this timeline as well as Frankencreepy. However, Frankencreepy is a dream that Velma had which is why it seems to stand alone as its own continuity. 

E scream is the chronologically last episode  Scooby and Shaggy suffering a massive seizure from all those video games and falling into a coma. Each dreams their own dying dream while in this state.

Scooby’s dying dream is Shaggy and Scooby Doo get a clue where he is a superhero before finally dying at the end. Shaggy’s is A pup named Scooby Doo. He is the narrator of this series and it is impossible for it to exist in the early sixties as claimed with technology like that. We do know that how they looked is accurate from that flashback previously mentioned. Scooby and Shaggy do not survive this and eventually pass away.

&#x200B;

**Timeline B**

In Timeline B, the gang don’t meet until they are teens and spend most of their teen years in a town called T Crystal Cove. They also have different parents in this universe.

Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated, Be Cool Scooby Doo, The made for TV live action movies (which are the origin stories for this universe, Guess Who, Zombie Island, Witch’s Ghost, Alien Invaders, and Cyber Chase all exist in this timeline. Any Direct to Video film or special other than the ones mentioned above also exist in this timeline.

Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated has been confirmed to have been a separate continuity as the original but some of their adventures still happened. Scrappy Doo also exists but the circumstances were much different. Flim Flam was a villain and not an ally in this Universe.

Be Cool Scooby Doo takes place directly after Mystery Incorporated. Guess Who and previously mentioned Direct to Video Movies or Specials take place at the same time after Be Cool Scooby Doo. Any cameo in this show shares a universe with them

**Timeline C** 

Timeline C consists of Live Action Theatrical Movies and any other work that cannot be fit neatly into one of the other two. It is likely they are a reality show in this universe with Goes Hollywood and Arabian Nights also existing here. Scooby was bought at a pet store in this universe and Shaggy and Scooby eventually quit and we got Arabian Nights.

I also believe that Johnny Bravo and Yogi Bear exist in this universe due to their cameos.In The Incredibles, we see Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible save a man who’s attempting suicide, coincidentally run into Bomb Voyage robbing a bank and finish off by saving Buddy/Incrediboy & a whole train of people from one of his bombs. 

As Mr. Incredible is explaining the situation to the police, he realizes he’s late for his wedding to Elastigirl/Helen and flee the scene, when we cut to a frame of some very pissed off police officers. 

A black and white montage right after the wedding reveals that the collateral damage from the night before led to supers being outlawed indefinitely. My theory is, Mr. Incredible fleeing the scene and earning the ire of the police was the tipping point for superhero/government relations. I believe a pissed off police force was part of the main campaign to take down supers. 

If Mr. Incredible had stuck around to hunt down and catch Bomb Voyage instead of leaving unceremoniously, they may have helped support him legally with the unwilling suicide rescue, provide valuable witness testimony that saving him was a public service, same thing with the train incident. Everything would have probably been much different.In the first Captain America movie we are face with the antagonist Red Skull who is using the Tesseract (space stone) to power his weapons. We see him use these weapons on German military personnel at the beginning of the movie. What happens when they get hit? They simply vanish. Nothing is left of them. Youd be left to believe that they got disintegrated or something similar, but I believe they were actually teleported to random spots around the galaxy. Think of it, the space stone allows those who control it the ability to teleport across space like we see Thanos do multiple times in infinity war. Also during that time during the MCU (WWII), Red Skull just knew it was a powerful artifact that could be harnessed for power, he didn't know it was the space stone. Because of this he simply thought his weapons just obliterated his enemies, but in reality they are just getting sent to random places. Some on to different planets, some in the the void of space. Am I crazy?I expect I have some explaining to do before this gets relegated to /r/ShittyFanTheories/

James Bond has been around for decades. His 25th film will be out in a few months. That's at least 25 high stakes missions facing of against the likes of international terrorists, criminal conspiracies, and rival intelligence agencies. You would expect this to entail a lot of paperwork. Bond doesn't seem to read much of it. Granted, this wouldn't make for action packed cinema. But even the more cerebral Bond films don't see 007 reading all that much. He'll get a verbal briefing, handed a folder, and he'll look through the pictures. It's more digestable for the audience, it's a more cinematically compatible way to deliver exposition... but it'd also make it easier for you hide the fact you can't read. 

Now, the various Bonds have different attitudes and different approaches to their missions. These attitudes even change between entries in the series. Some of the Bonds are more flippant (Brosnan destroying the manual for the invisible Aston Martin in *Die Another Day*). Some are laser focused on revenge and aren't stopping to gather intel (Dalton in *License to Kill*, Craig in *Quantum of Solace*). One is an absolute know-it-all who repeats non-sequitors on trivia he picked up somewhere (Moore). These are all justifications Bond would use to cover up for the fact that his peers never see him read.


In the version of Bond we get in the novels we can follow his internal monologue. If he reads something, we read it with him. He also can't hide something from the audience. If he's pretending to do something we see the pretence. This isn't true of the cinematic version of Bond. We don't hear his thoughts. He can stare at a piece of paper for an entire scene but we've no way of certifying that he's absorbing any of it. The only proof we have is him repeating the information that was written down. In *Casino Royale* (2005) Vesper shows him her business card when they first meet. He repeats her name back to her. But for all we know he was given a verbal heads up on who he'd be working with on his mission. In the same scene he has a menu in front of him the whole time but we cut away before he has to recommened a dish or order one.

He always orders the same cocktail. He has never once tried to read a cocktail menu. There is no guarantee that the bar he goes to serves a martini, but it's a popular drink, making it a safe bet.

Tbh, if he *can* read he's just being needlessly flippant and reckless when approaching these high stakes missions. I'd rather believe this highly trained superspy is struggling to overcome/hide a disability, and succeeding against the odds, than he's arrogantly endangering the whole world because he wants to show off.

* This is more obvious with Brosnan's Bond, and Craig's to a lesser extent. Moore nearly sinks the whole theory

Edit: At the point where this post has been up for 7 hours and had over 100 comments (including numerous ones of my own) I'm noting that none of the counterpoints posted so far feature Brosnan's Bond, despite his 4 film run as the character. This lends credence to my suspicion that he is the least literate Bond.So hear me out. “I Am” is one of God’s names for himself. The great I AM. What does satan want? To be a god unto himself. What was Satan’s angelic name? Samael, Sam for short.

So when Sam I Am introduces himself he is calling himself “Samael, the great I Am” for short. 

Then what does he do? He tempts the main character into consuming something forbidden. Green eggs and Ham? that shits cursed, rotten. Every instinct should be to not eat that. Just as in the garden Adam and Eve were warned that eating that fruit would kill them. Eating eggs that are green will also kill you.

Yet still he continually tempts him to eat that which he should not. He promises him material wealth such as boats and planes should he eat the forbidden ham. 

Then he finally gives in and tries it and he suddenly realizes isn’t cursed. Then he goes with Sam as friends where once they were enemies, Sam has given him knowledge and made him his own. 

Sam I Am is the devil.Now, I know this sounds crazy, but there’s actually proof.  In Thor: Ragnarok, there’s a scene where Korg and Thor choose weapons for the arena. Korg picks up and looks at a pole with 3 stakes at the end. He comments that such a weapon is worthless and, I quote, “only useful against three vampires standing in close proximity.”

Now, out of universe, this is just a reference to Taika Watiki’s (the director of Thor and man who played Korg) famous vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows. However, it’s when you interpret this line in universe that things get crazy. 

Firstly, Korg is not from Earth and knows nothing about Earth or its culture. The ending of the film shows this directly where Thor talks about going to Earth and Korg hasn’t heard of the planet or anything about it.   Now, one could say that vampire fiction found its way to Sacar and Korg really liked it, but that doesn’t make sense. Korg mentions them casually, which means he assumes Thor knows about vampires. Korg doesn’t know about Asgard, which means he just assumes people know what vampires are  no matter where in the universe they’re from. 

Secondly, Thor doesn’t really react to the comment, but he does hear it and acknowledge it. This means Thor did indeed know what vampires were and wasn’t surprised that Korg also knew.  If Thor simply had read up on them while acclimating to Earth culture, he would have been surprised that Korg knew about them. His casual acceptance of Korg’s knowledge means Thor is aware of how widespread vampires are. It also shows that he agrees on how wooden stakes would work on them. The only conclusion is that Thor has battled them in the past in multiple locations. Thor had read up on Dark Elves but didn’t think they were real until he met them, so if he had merely read about them from Asgardian history books he would have been surprised to learn they were also real. 

Tl;dr: Korg’s movie reference indicates vampires are known across space and history in the MCU and aren’t just native to Earth. 

Edit 1: y’all are missing the point. This isn’t just vampires, it’s SPACE VAMPIRES

Edit 2: I’ve been informed Korg knew about Asgardians but not that Thor was one. It doesn’t change the theory. 

Edit 3: you, a human who knows about fictional creatures, making a reference to another human who also knows about them is not comparable to a situation involving two aliens with different cultural backgrounds, so stop using it to disprove the theory. It doesn’t work like that. Although the Super Mario Bros. movie from 1993 explained that Mario was simply their last name, I don't think this is considered canon elsewhere. In the games themselves, Mario and Luigi's last names are never even spoken. I think there's a reason for that, and it has to do with the Mushroom Kingdom's culture and it's standard naming conventions.

One thing that's surprisingly consistent in the Mushroom Kingdom, is specific characters being named after their own species, with individual names being less common. Toad of the Toads, Yoshi of the Yoshis, and any number of baddies are named that way. I think what may have happened, is that when Mario and Luigi first introduced themselves to the Mushroom Kingdom, likely to a group of Toads, Mario was the first to speak up and say "My name is Mario." The Toads simply assumed Mario was his species name as well and dubbed the two brothers as Marios collectively. Hence The Mario Brothers. So I have seen a lot of people either complaining or perplexed about Jared Leto's Joker. However, I think I have the angle they are going with figured out.

I think this new Joker is a pop-culture sensation and celebrity.

This would explain why he drives a Lambo, has goofy tattoos, and a girlfriend.

I believe this for multiple reasons. First off, it would very cleverly play off the craze of Heath Ledger's Joker. Before, during, and after TDK was in theatres you couldn't go anywhere without seeing someone with a "Why so serious?" shirt. Practically half my friends that Halloween were the Joker with the messy makeup and makeshift suit. I believe the Joker of the new DCU is a celebrity and people are fascinated with him the same way they were with Ledger's Joker, except he is real. 

So all the stunts, pranks, and crimes he pulls are like publicity stunts. However, instead of posing nude or shaving his head, he creates high speed chases between himself in an obnoxious purple car and Batman in a fucking bat-shaped car or blows up city hall or kidnaps the mayor's daughter. Who wouldn't want to watch that? Media coverage would be nuts. And the Joker would love it. He would be making people insane, as is his recurring goal, by admiring and cheering for a mass murderer/thief/vandal. People would have the same fascination with him that they do with Ted Bundy or Manson, but he accepts it and plays into it. Most importantly he would *love* the attention.

Imagine the TMZ coverage: "Joker gets new tattoo; decapitates two police officers" or "Joker evades Batman again; gets new rims." People would be clawing to emulate his tattoos and dye their hair green. They'd be fascinated with his and Harley's relationship. 

I also believe Harley's story goes along with this. I believe she was a psychiatrist who secretly loved the Joker as much as everyone else. Her studying him led to her falling in love and wanting to be part of the whole spectacle. Her bubblegum appearance also plays into this pop-culture, "look at me, I'm crazy" theme.

Lastly, and the reason I really think this theory works is that this would piss Batman off more than anything. He represents justice, balance, and reason. Yet his murdering arch-nemesis is adored by the people he is trying to protect. If the Joker operates this way it would essentially turn all of Batman's efforts into a joke. He would appear to be this terrible tyrant stopping a beloved public figure's fun. It trivializes his entire endeavour to uphold justice. What would drive Batman insane faster than that?

I put all this information together by scanning through episodes and searching for quotes online. I definitely left something out. There's a gray area in between 1985 and 1993{that could've been when she was living with Monica, but Monica is like 1 or 2 years younger than Phoebe, and I doubt Monica moved to the city as soon as she turned 18, and they weren't living together for very long}. It's also said that her stepdad was in prison multiple times, and she has stabbed a cop{probably in her mugging days}. I compiled this info by looking for places in episodes where she actually mentions her past. She briefly mentions living in prague for a while, but I have no idea where to put that.{Possibly somewhere in the gray area between 1987 and 1993?}Ash gets a lot of bad cred for not recognizing Team Rocket. But Officer Jenny, Nurse Joy, and Don George all have uncountable identical looking people. Some of them aren’t even related to the ones they look like. 

It’s not a hard mistake to make. In the original trilogy imperial storm troopers shoot red lasers while rebel troops shoot green lasers. Oddly enough the reverse is true for their ships, imperial tie fighters shoot green lasers while rebel x wings fire red lasers.  Why would this be? 

Well the simple answer is that green lasers have more energy than red lasers. Rebels need to pierce storm trooper armor so they use high power green lasers. Storm troopers can get more shots at unarmored rebels using low powered red lasers with out recharging their blasters. Similarly x wings are shown to be more durable than tie fighters. Tie fights need high energy green lasers to damage x wings while the x wings can destroy a tie fighter with low energy red lasers.

Edit: thanks for the silver! As many people pointed out the premise of the theory is flawed. All of the soldiers use red blasters. It's been out for 2 months, but I still felt I should tag it. 

I remember certain critics, Jeremy Jahns for example, comment on how big of a coincidence it was that Clint and Natasha were the two people to get the Soul Stone. 

The Soul Stone requires someone to sacrifice the one they love most, in this case Clint reluctantly sacrificing Natasha. I wouldn't call those two going there a coincidence. 

Nebula was the only remaining Avenger that knew how to get the Soul Stone. In the 5 year gap, we see that her and Rocket were in regular contact with Natasha; while Natasha was still trying to find Clint. 

My theory, which admittedly isn't very groundbreaking, is that Nebula suggested that Clint and Natasha fetch the Soul Stone, since she witnessed how close they were. They are two of the perfect candidates to retrieve it. 

No hate plz thx

EDIT: Lots of people have brought up that Nebula didn't know how to retrieve the Soul Stone. This is admittedly an assumption on my part that she did. 

In my defense though, she processes Gamora's death as "He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. She didn't." I read that line as Nebula realizing the sacrifice that had to be made. Tony heard it too. 

"Whatever it takes"In the tale of the three brothers, Death gives a gift to each of three brothers. The first brother lusts for power, and gets an unbeatable wand. the second wizard lost a woman who he hoped to marry, so he got a stone to bring people back from the dead. the third brother wanted to not be followed by death, so he got an invisibility cloak. Voldemort represents the first brother, as he wanted to be the most powerful wizard in existence. Snape represents the second brother, as he lost Lily, the woman who he was in love with. And the third brother is represented by Harry, who simply wanted to continue on with his life free of dark magic. Death is also represented by a character. I believe the character is Dumbledore, and this is why:

1. In the story, Death had all three items Dumbledore was, at one point, in posession of all 3 items.

2. At the end of the Tale of the three brothers, it is stated the third brother greeted Death as an old friend. When Harry is "killed" by Voldemort, he sees Dumbledore at King's cross, and greets him as an old friend.

3.Voldemort's worst fear was Death, and Dumbledore is refered to as "The only one he ever feared"


EDIT: I now realize this is a common theory, except for the Dumbledore part.Was watching this episode where He talks about an incident where his mom “accidentally” kissed his butt when he was 5. But the story is sus.

1. Michael mentions he was wearing spider man pjs which isn’t relevant at all. Victims of trauma will remember small weird details and will go off topic 

2. His mom was trying to kiss his belly, but he moved, and she kissed his butt. This is weird because it meant he must have physically turned over. Maybe he thought she was going for his crotch and turned over to avoid. 

3. He had all sorts of problems as a child. He has problems as an adult with sexually inappropriate behaviour especially @ women.

4. His romantic relationships are all strained by his clinginess and infantile behaviour. 

5. He still maintains a close relationship with his mom, probably seeing nothing wrong with what happened. 

6. When Carol breaks up with him, he cries and wonders if it’s because there’s something he wouldn’t do in bed, and says he might have been able to do it if alcohol was involved. Seems very suspicious

Edit: his disturbing relationship with Jan, where he says he’d rather “cuddle” or whatever and isn’t comfortable with the sexual acts he wants her to do but goes along with things he isn’t comfortable with

Edit 2: apparently his mom rubbed lotion on his crotch area for three hours when he was a kid. Ew.I keep going back and forth on whether to post this here or in r/shittyfantheories, but there's one weird detail in the very first episode that really makes me wonder if this was actually planned from the beginning.

"Simpsons Roasting On an Open Fire" (s01e01) opens with Marge reading aloud a letter to the Simpsons' friends and family:

>Dear Friends of the Simpson Family, We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness: our little cat Snowball was unexpectedly run over and went to Kitty Heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II, so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself, Lisa got straight A's and Bart... well, we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all. Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays, The Simpsons.

This is a weird opening. It's an unusual example of slow pacing for any sitcom, let alone *The Simpsons*. A big infodump of information that could easily have been introduced more organically and has nothing to do with the plot of the episode itself. The conventional storytelling wisdom would have been "in late, out early", especially when you're already taking a big risk by putting an animated show on American prime time network TV, which was more or less unprecedented at the time. The audience can tell that Maggie is a young toddler; why waste precious airtime informing that attribute?

But the letter does establish one important thing: prior to the first episode, time had been passing normally for the Simpsons. Snowball I died. Maggie and Grandpa matured normally. No serendipity returned Springfield to the status quo by the next week.

Life went on.

In the course of the episode, Homer loses his Christmas money, and ends up trying to win it back at a dog race. Bart encourages him, saying:

>If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs and it's gonna happen to us.

They bet on Santa's Little Helper. He comes in last. Bart says:

>Doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.

But since this is not only TV but a pastiche of family sitcoms, they do get a "Christmas miracle": they wind up bringing Santa's Little Helper home. Irony complete.

Thing is, I don't think just getting a dog was the whole miracle. I think the miracle was the famous [negative continuity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity) of the show.

As explained in the Western Animation section of the TVTropes article I just linked, negative continuity is a long-standing tradition in Western animation, but *The Simpsons* has an interesting take on it. There are a lot of [continuity nods](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod) where the characters seem to be aware of events in past episodes, and even of the inevitable reset button that's always hit during the intervening week between episodes (with the odd exception of Mr. Burns, who always remains oblivious). The timeless state of Springfield isn't just treated as a handwave. It's in-universe.

Springfield is a town out of time, like a cross between Groundhog Day, Brigadoon, and sort of an inverse Final Destination. No one ages. No one learns their lesson. Almost any change is undone by the next week.

I think there's also evidence that this curse dawned on the characters gradually. In the first season, the negative continuity is there, but the characters act more like they think there's a serious risk of making permanent changes.

Later in the series, if Homer got fired, he'd just blithely let whatever wacky adventure sweep him back to where he'd been before. But in "Homer's Odyssey" (s01e03), he almost kills himself. The reset comes as a bit of an anticlimax after Homer makes an extraordinary effort to better himself and make a difference. This seems out of character when one goes back and watches the episode as a *Simpsons* veteran. The reset button in this episode comes as anticlimax: Mr. Burns offers to rehire Homer with a promotion so he'll abandon his public safety campaign and promptly Homer takes it.

I think that's when Homer's characteristic carelessness really began. That's when he started to realize that nothing really mattered.

As the seasons turn, Marge does all sorts of crazy things that could get her killed or change her life forever, and does them with a fair amount of abandon, but in "Life on the Fast Lane" (s01e09), she treats the idea of cheating on Homer with a level of gravitas that we rarely see later on.

In early episodes, the coincidence that returns everything to normal tends to a triumphant, even miraculous plot climax. Bart's speech that redeems him of cutting the head off the statue. Homer surviving the blowfish poison. This is kind of a recurring theme in the first two or three seasons. Later on, the reset is increasingly treated as a joke or not addressed at all.

Of course, there are exceptions. Some changes just happen to slip through the cracks, to much consternation: the van Houtens' divorce, Apu's wedding, Maude's death, Lisa's vegetarianism. But these things are rare and unpredictable.

Lisa is the most tragic figure in all this (except maybe Maggie). I keep coming back to that letter at the very beginning, and how Snowball I has continued to be occasionally referenced throughout the series. Lisa never gets over Snowball I, her poor little white cat who got run over and barely missed the immortality boat. Who went to Kitty Heaven, while Lisa remains in Hell. How Lisa keeps self-righteously struggling to make a difference. Any difference. But she can never break the cycle, because even though she's vaguely aware of what's going on, the curse itself prevents her from truly learning from experience.

And it's all because of Bart's dumb dog.In Avengers 2, some heroes distrust vision until he effortlessly picks up Mjolnir, a tool that can only be used by those morally worthy of holding it. This establishes Vision as a credible hero in their eyes, and they vow to work together.

Later, when Tony is debating Thor about how Mjolnir works, he makes a quote to this effect:

"What if it's in an elevator that goes up? Is the elevator worthy?"

Tony strikes a good point. And we see that Thor has set down his hammer on the flying quinjet, so machines can clearly effortlessly carry the hammer.

Vision knew he needed to unite the Avengers quickly. He likely knew from Jarvis' memories (or from the internet) that Thor's hammer only works for the morally pure. Surmising that he could pick it up because he is a machine, Vision hands it to Thor and is trusted instantly.

TL;DR: Vision is a machine, so he can lift Thor's hammer the same way a plane or an elevator could. He used this loophole to convince the Avengers he was worthy and gain their trust quickly.So in the Easter Egg of the first GotG film and in the opening sequence of GotG 2 baby Groot dances. However, when ever Drax is around he stops dancing --only resuming when Drax turns his back. Groot does this because he wants Drax to love and respect him. Drax talks about his deceased wife in GotG 2 and notes that she never danced and that was a good thing. Not giving into the frivolity of dancing is a positive attribute in Drax's eyes; thus Groot does not let Drax see him dance. In the new movie Joaquin Phoenix is not going to become the actual Joker, but rather the inspiration for the Joker in this movie. I believe the movie will follow Phoenix around and showcase how he spirals into insanity. 

 This causes him to almost become a Joker prototype. Even his costume is more clown-like than Joker. He commits horrific acts and then either dies or is arrested and sent to Arkham. Many find him despicable but one person finds him quite inspirational. That person than becomes the Joker towards the end of the movie, maybe even in the final scene of the film. This Joker has a more recognizable costume that is more in line with other versions of the Joker in which we have seen.

 Another reason I do not believe Phoenix is the Joker is because of the age difference between him and Bruce Wayne. In this film, Bruce Wayne is a kid and the timelines between Phoenix as Joker and Wayne as Batman seem quite off. What would make more sense is if someone closer to Wayne’s age takes up the Joker mantle. This is why I believe that Joaquin Phoenix does not become the Joker in the Joker movie, but rather inspiration for the JokerI rewatched Total Rickall, and it occurred to me that the main parasites (Uncle Steve, Sleepy Gary, Pensylvester, Tinkles, and Cousin Nicky) each represent something that a member of the Smith family wants. 

Uncle Steve recognizes Jerry's potential, assures him he'll get a job, and has enough money to take the family on a spontaneous trip to Hawaii. He's what Jerry wants most in life- an older brother who can take care of him.

Sleepy Gary is basically a more competent and confident version of Jerry. That's what Beth wants most. 

Cousin Nicky is a tough cool guy who can bail Morty out of shitty situations as opposed to Rick, who keeps getting him in them.

Tinkles and her friends serve as an escapist fantasy for Summer (who in the same episode says she wishes that she could leave home).

Pensylvester is small, high-voiced, wears yellow, and unconditionally supports Rick. He's basically a more agreeable Morty, and that's what Rick wants. 

As for the others, at first I thought they were just sight gags, but then I thought about the barbecue. Maybe deep down, what Rick wants above all is to be a beloved patriarch of a large family?I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/7usd44/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and_he/)):

**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!" 

The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his "first step" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross. 

**A point that just occurred to me:**

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully. 
In the title sequence of "A Knight's tale" Queen's "We Will Rock You" is played but what sets this apart is the people dancing and singing to it. Later on in the scene where they do the dance of "Gelderland" they eventually are seen dancing to "Golden Years" where William is seen mouth the words.

So we've established these songs exist in the universe that is "A Knight's Tale". Not however in the way we know songs. These were poems sung by the bards and put to music. Over the years and generations they were passed down until they reached their Apex, culminating in "We Will Rock You" by Queen (written by Brian May) and "Golden Years" by David Bowie.

Thus David Bowie and Brain May join a long list of bards and since it's sung by Freddie we can add him too.So we are told by colonel sanders in matrix reloaded that there have been 6 prior matrixes before the current one neo was in. Most audiences took that to mean that there were 6 beta versions of the matrix, completely forgetting later that neo could also manipulate machines in the “real world” and missing the complete point the movie was making about virtual worlds and reality. 

Here is what the architect really meant by the 6 versions. 

In the first version of the matrix, a paradise matrix was created. This quickly collapsed because of human evil into a nightmare matrix, which was later repatched into a matrix that simulated choice. “History” and human evolution in the matrix then seemed to develop smoothly and naturally (with minimal machine intervention) just like “real” human history (because humans never change) all the way to the industrial revolution, the Information Age of the 90’s, and the birth of AI (in the simulation). however, history tends to repeat itself, and soon, there was also a human AI war in the matrix. The machines in the matrix (not the “real” machines, but the AI created by the humans in the “fake” history of the matrix) enslave mankind and the humans build Zion in the matrix. 

And then, something incredible happens. History comes full circle and the AI in the matrix also build a matrix to enslave mankind. A virtual world within a virtual world. 

This was the second matrix, a matrix nested within the first matrix. 

In this second matrix, same thing happens. This matrix develops upon roughly the same pattern as the real matrix, give and take a few years (because humans never change) and soon a new matrix is borne within THAT matrix. A third matrix. 

And then a fourth, then a fifth, then a sixth. This is what the architect meant by six matrixes, six matrixes nested inside each other like a Russian pushka doll. And neo was born in the sixth matrix nested within the 6 matrixes. 

This theory not only explains neos powers in the “real world”, seeing that his real world is basically just the 5th matrix in which his 6th matrix is nestled. This theory’s greatest strength is it captures the entirety of the essence of the matrix trilogies, demonstrating the cyclical nature of history and suffering, the inevitable failings of sentient beings and the theory that if our universe is a simulation than it is also inevitable that it is a simulation that exists within other simulations. So, there is a famous piece of lost media called the Pokemon live show. It had songs and dancing and all that crap. 

But one interesting part of it is, it revealed that Ash's mom knew Team Rocket leader Giovanni. It may even have been implied they dated.

So when years later, he finds out that Ash is out and about in the world, and his worst henchmen are trying to kindnap his Pikachu, he probably tells them how important that Pikachu is. Because not only does he know they will fail. But they will actively prevent Ash from getting harmed. 

Cause while he could be Giovanni's kid, at the very least the Team Rocket Leader knows his mom and would consider himself an old friend to Deliah.#Palpatine planned on the original Death Star being destroyed.

Here's why.

Tarkin was ambitious af. From countless sources and depicted in 2 films, we see Tarkin essentially rule over the Imperial Faction in Star Wars. The Emperor is more of a background player in the original Star Wars. In Rogue One we see Tarkin usurp control of the functional Death Star from Krennic, even dampening his ceremonious test-fire. He then doubled down and killed Krennic in next test-fire. 

 1. This scared Rebels fleeing, as a potential detractor - to spread fear.

 2. This was used to prevent the plans from escaping (this objective failed).

 3. This removed one Tarkin's political rivals.

Beyond this, Tarkin informs the high command (all aboard the Death Star) in Star Wars (1977) that the Senate is dissolved by the Emperor. He goes on to state how the power of rule is now divided among regional Governors over the centralized Senate. He suggests that **fear** will keep the star systems in line.

> "Fear of this battle station."

We see him double down on this by destroying Alderaan, a peaceful planet and home of Princess Leia, to not only demoralize Leia but also make a statement in the galaxy about the Death Star's potential

We then learn of how he tracked the Rebels to Yavin 4. By running Vader's play of putting a tracking beacon on the Millennium Falcon and letting them escape.

So for Tarkin he is about to achieve one of his primary goals if the Battle of Yavin turns out his way: destroying the Rebel Alliance completely. Again this harkens back to eliminating enemies. 

So at this juncture we have:

* An ambitious man

* But a calculated man, who waited for his timing to be perfect.

* Controlling the most powerful weapons in the galaxy.

* Realizing that this control would inspire fear in star systems to prevent revolt.

* He's only one-stepping stone away from ruling the Empire.

When you add all of these components together, what is stopping Tarkin and the High Command with their Death Star from simply taking over? 

He could: 

1. Decisively finish the Rebels at Yavin 4.

2. Plot course to Coruscant.

3. Fire a single-reactor burst at the Imperial Palace and kill the Emperor.

4. The rest of the Galaxy lives in fear of the Death Star, which would run unopposed.

Even if he did this, the recourse from the Imperial fleet would be insignificant if such a coup were to take place. One blast and the only person on the rung above him is dead. So who could stop him? **The answer is Darth Vader.**

We know Vader has his loyalty to the Emperor, even despite his own machinations to overthrow him - with Luke's help, he pleads in Empire. Surely though, if Tarkin were to make a power-grab of this nature, Vader would be the one to stop him. But if Tarkin could stop Vader somehow, he could execute the plan.

Funnily enough, this opportunity presents itself during The Battle of Yavin 4. When Vader is informed of the Rebels being too small for the Turbo Lasers, he makes the call to deploy the TIE fighters and fight ship-to-ship. A few minutes later we learn that several fighters have broken off from the main group, and Vader instructs his pilots to join him as they will go personally and deal with it. 

The big question is: why would the TIE fighters break off from the main group?

I believe they were ordered off. 

Why? Well Tarkin knew the next few moments would be a decisive moment. The battle with the Rebels could be won and he could go on with taking out The Emperor at Coruscant. He just needed Vader off the ship. And with a fighter squad getting "lost", it forces Vader's hand to go into a TIE Fighter himself. With Vader off the Death Star, Tarkin can enact his plan - unimpeded, and realize his ambitious nature.

The ideal scenario now, for Tarkin, would be for Vader to occupy the single ships in the trench. Then blow up Yavin 4 and destroy the Rebels completely. The remaining ones are either hunted down, or just demoralized - playing into the fear aspect he mentioned earlier. Regardless, Vader is never given the opportunity to board the Death Star. The Death Star goes to hyperspace, leaving Darth Vader behind. As it approaches Coruscant. The High Command co-sign Tarkin's order and the Death Star fires again, destroying either just the Imperial Palace or the entire planet itself - either way Emperor Palpatine is removed, and Tarkin ascends to the top. 

Of course... 

If we know Sheev...

He planned on this all from the start...

---

Palpatine mentioned in Return of the Jedi:

> "Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen."

We know how Sheev operates. He is duplicitous AF, and ambitious AF. 

* Using the Trade Federation to block off Naboo.

* Using Amidala to push the non-confidence vote and moving Palpatine to Chancellor.

* Using Maul to get rid of Qui-Gon, but not Obi-Wan (because Obi-Wan would eventually half Anakin).

* Using wartime measures act to grant him extended powers and a clone army.

* Allowing himself to be captured by the Separatists and General Grievous. In an effort to get Anakin on his side and Dooku killed (once his usefulness was at an end).

* Exposing himself to Anakin, to rat himself out to Mace Windu (another trap)

* Using Anakin to kill Mace Windu, once exposed.

* Using Order 66 to remove the Jedi. 

* Using Anakin to kill the young Jedi.

* Rewarding the Trade Federation by having Darth Vader kill them.

* Setting up Death Star construction upon becoming Emperor.

We even see this play out in Return of the Jedi.

* Palpatine let the location and plans for Death Star II leak to set up a trap to finish the Rebellion off once and for all. 

* Because the Shield Generator is up and **IT'S A TRAP!**

And notice he *doubles down* on this plan by personally arriving on Death Star II and commanding the battle from his Throne Room. He let the quasi-finished Death Star II and Imperial Fleet do a lot of the work. Because the Death Star II is the ultimate power in the universe, and he who controls it - controls the universe. 

Which brings into question...

If the Death Star was the ultimate power, and if controlling it virtually guaranteed control over the galaxy, then why is the Emperor not present onboard the original Death Star?

Think about it, who is all onboard the Death Star?

You have the entirety of the High Command and ruling class of the Empire. You have Darth Vader. You have everyone except... Palpatine.

> "Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design."

**Because he knew the outcome of that technological terror.**
 

If the original Death Star was of a major consequence to Palpatine's rule, he would have personally taken control of it. But no. He knew. And he used it to his advantage. He knew Tarkin and the High Command would make that play. *How could they afford not to?* They would have no reason to take orders from anyone and could take control of the Galaxy for themselves. 

Palpatine, by allowing them to go off and chase the Yavin 4 rebels, *and losing* - he rids himself of military-poltical rivals in the form of the High Command. Potential usurpers are removed in one move, while Palpatine's rule is *unaffected.* Luke destroying the Death Star is a win-win for Palpatine. 

| Win | Condition | 
| :--: | :--: |
| ✔ | Ambitious High Command members are rooted from temptation of using the Death Star for their own gain |
| ✔ | Rebels sent scurrying after their own base on Yavin 4 is exposed, so they are on the run. They have to live on shitty Hoth. |
| ✔ | Imperial faction galvanized by the loss of their own at the original Death Star's destruction. | 
| ✔ | The High Command clearance forms power vacuum to be restructured under Palpatine and Vader. 
| ✔ | Palpatine consolidates his power. | 

I believe Death Star II was also under construction, in secret since before this. The not being on the original Death Star was just such a red flag for me, I believe Sheev went to the trouble of having a second one started. Expedited construction, the previous flaw covered up, a more powerful laser, and larger. Perhaps he even planned that should Tarkin take over the original and win at Yavin 4, he could flee before Tarkin took Coruscant and eventually attack back with Death Star II when it was completed by his loyalists. 

I just do not see Tarkin, the cold, calculating, climber and Sheev Palpatine, the master-schemer, and equally ambitious space wizard, not coming to this resolution. Playing to both's strengths and weaknesses, with a device too powerful and tempting. I think the most potent fact we know is that Palpatine only presents or reveals himself *intentionally*. For him to not be on the original Death Star, says a lot.Not really a deep or meaningful theory, but just something little I came up with.

The Office S6E1, “Gossip,” follows Michael’s attempts to start rumors about everyone in the office to detract from the fact that he told everyone about Stanley’s affair. In a throwaway line, when Michael tells receptionist Erin Hannon that Kelly Kapoor has an eating disorder, Erin says, “She always eats my lunch.”

We found out in Season 5 that Erin’s first name is actually Kelly and that her middle name is Erin. I think that it took some getting used to for Erin to adjust to her “new name,” and so when she packed her lunch each morning she labeled it “Kelly.” As a result, Kelly thought it was her food and ate it.

I know this is probably unlikely because it’s just meant to show that Kelly doesn’t really care about whose lunch is whose (and also because she’d definitely notice eating a lunch she didn’t pack.) But it’s just a little theory that resulted from my rewatching the show close to a dozen times. :)So when lightning generation is first introduced, it's the be all end all of fire bending. A move powerful enough to one hit TKO anyone it hits, including aang in the avatar state.


But when we see Mako using it in TLOK, lighting is just another attack. We even see Amon take a SUSTAINED blast of lightning and just shrug it off. So what happened?


Mako and the others aren't lightning bending. They're ELECTRICITY bending!


Think about it: in ATLA, modern electricity hasn't been invented yet, and the only form of electricity anyone knew about was lightning. But when industrialization hit,  electricity was all around them, in the wires,  in the radio waves, in the cars, everywhere. Ever present. 


But, electricity in your home isn't NEARLY as strong as a bolt of lightning, therefore,  easier to control.  This explains both the prevalence of electricity bending as well as it's reduction in power.edit: Holy shit someone else [very recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/cgt0ka/doctor_strange_in_the_multiverse_of_madness_could/) wrote almost the exact same theory that I did already, almost to a tee. I didn't even see it. I just thought about this while I was doing some work and immediately wrote up a post as soon as I could without second thought. Well, fuck, lol

I am... very convinced that we are going to get House of M, possibly instead of Multiverse of Madness. We have precedent for this happening too - Feige originally revealed the 3rd Captain America to be Serpent Society, and then revealed it was a ruse to hide the true story, which was Civil War.

Anyway, bear with me here. First, if the rumors about the plot of WandaVision are true, then it would be a great lead-in to this. For context (spoilers about the rumored plot behind WandaVision):

>!Wanda goes to the past with Vision and builds the life she wanted with him from scratch. It's pitched as a psychological thriller as Wanda slowly descends into insanity throughout the story. In the comics, this story arc ends with the twist that Wanda fabricated an illusion for herself all along and none of it was real!<


Warning: Spoilers for the House of M story arc below.


Following the events of WandaVision, Scarlet Witch will be taken under the care of Doctor Strange, as opposed to Professor X and Magneto, who do this in the comics. Professor X suppresses her powers because Scarlet Witch suffered a mental breakdown and literally tries to change reality using her abilities. Since Xavier and Magneto aren't yet introduced in the MCU, who is the next best person to fill this role? Steven Strange. In fact, in House of M, Professor X asked Doctor Strange for help - he was just not strong enough to do so.

So basically the whole debacle is, as a consequence of WandaVision, Wanda can change reality itself. It freaks everyone out. With her newly discovered reality-changing power-up, Wanda can now, in the MCU, do two important things: revive her dead brother, Quicksilver, and create the mutants in the MCU. 

The story of House of M itself would probably be very loosely adapted, as a lot of MCU movies are, so it would diverge greatly here while keeping the bones of the story intact. It's all a guessing game as to what happens next; in the comics, Wanda created a brand new world with her powers, one where everyone would be as happy as possible. As a result, Mutants rule Earth as the dominant species, and Magneto and his family - the House of M - are its rulers. 

The TL;DR of what happens next is the heroes of the Marvelverse figure out what happened and team up and rebel against the House of M. Hawkeye attacks Wanda. In return, one of Wanda's children (in this world) kills Hawkeye by erasing his existence from reality - let me interject, because this would be an excellent way to transition to Kate Bishop taking over the Hawkeye mantle, which she does in the Disney+ series slated to release Fall of the 2021, just a few months after Doctor Strange 2.

At the end of it all, Wanda returns everything to normal, and Doctor Strange informs everyone that what happened was REAL and not like, a dream or something. In the comics, the vast majority of mutants worldwide lost their powers as a result, as Wanda was going to make her new reality to end mutants. 

Anyway, I posit that instead of it ending with mutants being decimated, that it in fact ends with their creation. Wanda returns the world to normal, but it activates the dormant gene in mutants, or they keep the powers they had in her fake world, or something like that. 

It's also entirely possible that Multiverse of Madness ISN'T a ruse, but a continuation of the result of WandaVision and leads directly into something like Avengers: House of M to cap off Phase 4. Feige and team described this film to be akin to a horror film - with Wanda losing her grip on reality and making a new one for herself, I could easily see some horror aspects being thrown into this story.


Anyway. Thoughts?

TLDR - Wanda loses her mind and changes reality. Doctor Strange is the only one who can stop/save her. Mutants are created as a result.Thanos seems to have a weird thing with being a father. He seemingly adopts a number of presumably orphaned children from the worlds he "cleanses": Gamora, Nebula, and the members of the Black Order. And for what it's worth, he genuinely loves at least one of them.

Isn't it strange for a madman to have such care for a small child as to pull her away from a massacre and adopt her? Why does Thanos care so much about children? 

When Scarlet Witch is forced to kill Vision to stop him, he says "I understand, my child". People generally assume he's talking about how he lost Gamora. I think he's talking about how, long ago, he lost his wife.

I think the thing that drove him to madness wasn't simply losing his home planet, but losing his wife and child to the disaster that befell Titan. He adopted Gamora and Nebula to make himself a father once more, to regain what he had lost, what had been ripped from him by the cold calculus of the universe. 

And what does Ebony Maw say to Thanos' victims?

"Smile... for even in death, you have become children of Thanos." I love me some Alien and Aliens, and have probably thought about these two movies more than any others. I have some theories about Alien (that can wait for another day) but today I want to introduce you to my thesis on Aliens, one I hope which will at least provide an interesting perspective, if nothing else, and can be summed up thus:

**When Ripley goes to rescue Newt and discovers the Queen, there were barely any aliens left.**

This is based on evidence presented in the first two movies, and I'm not going to include information from *Alien: Colonial Marines*, the novels, or comics, which of course all came later. 

To my evidence!

***Q1: How many aliens were there when the marines arrived? Around 70.***

\- *There are an absolute maximum of 155 aliens*

This one's easy. The population of Hadley's Hope is given on screen as 158. Newt, the poor guy who died when they removed the facehugger, and Mary (the woman the marines find alive) take three off of that number.

\- *That number is probably way too high*

We don't have a *lot* of evidence from the first two movies, but in Human - Alien encounters, the aliens achieve a "seizure rate" of around 50%. They may want to take more, but they don't, for a variety of reasons. 

1) Even without the deleted scene showing their fates, Dallas and Brett are seized in *Alien* while Lambert and Parker are simply killed.

2) In the initial alien ambush in *Aliens*, only Apone and Dietrich are actually seized, while Wierzbowski is killed directly. Frost and Crowe die by "accident", and Drake is an unknown, as the intention may have been to grab him. Of course, Vasquez shoots and he is sprayed with acid. 

*3)* In the second attack, Burke may have been grabbed, as well as Hudson, whereas Gorman and Vasquez die.

This means that the hive probably maxed out at between 75 to 80 individual aliens, including the queen, although the error bars on that are huge.

*- The Colonists fought for much longer and much harder than is immediately apparent* 

There are two pieces of evidence here:

1) The hamsters are still alive, suggesting there hadn't been a complete breakdown in 'society' until fairly recently

2) Mary is still alive (briefly). The gestation period for an alien is not very long. 

This suggests that either Mary was *extremely* unlucky and was caught *while the marines were in orbit*, or even worse, while the marines were cracking wise about bug hunts and complaining about the cornbread, the colonists may *still have been fighting!*

In addition to this, they clearly killed at least one, if the giant hole in the floor is any indication (Hicks points this out) and may have killed several more. As for any bodies of colonists or aliens, it does seem like the aliens like recycling and may have dragged everything back over to the atmospheric processor. All that resin had to come from somewhere.

As for the downed transmitter, we don't know. It may even have been an unrelated accident, sidelined when much bigger problems arose.

*- Like most hive insects, the aliens do not care about the individual*

The alien in Alien was an ambush predator, moving around in vents and being very careful and sneaky. We don't know enough about them to be sure, but it may be that once a 'hive' exists, there is a pheromone or some other response in the aliens that let them be more aggressive. There is no evidence of *how* breeding in the hive works, but probably the vast majority of the hive *don't* mate with the Queen and are therefore expendable in attack and defense (from an evolutionary standpoint). The best example of this is the destruction of the dropship. Sure, the alien may not have known the results of killing a pilot, but it doesn't matter because *that particular alien* doesn't matter. 

So with these points in place, we can be generous and assume that the colonists may have killed around 5 aliens before the marines arrived, giving us 70 as our lower bound. 

***Q2: How many aliens do the marines kill? About 60.***

*- In the initial ambush, while the marines come off pretty badly, they do make a good account of themselves*

If you look at the timeline of events, the ambush happens, the marines suffer severe casualties, and *then* Ripley drives down to rescue them. Between the point Apone is grabbed and Ripley crashes through the wall, no marines are killed or grabbed, and it takes a while to drive there. It also fits with how most ambushes play out in real life, especially in places like Vietnam, where most of the casualties were suffered right at the beginning. 

Add onto this how insanely *aggressive* the aliens are once she gets there - three are killed in very quick succession trying to flank Drake, force open the doors, and smash the windshield in front of Ripley. The fact that these marines held them off for even the brief period before Ripley arrived means that several more must have been killed. I'm going to lowball this number and say at least 10 - 15 of them must have been killed here. 

*- "They must be wall-to-wall down there!"*

The sentry guns are set up in two location, and both end up being hit by the aliens. I think it's reasonable that at that rate of fire, for that long, somewhere around 25 - 30 aliens *must* have died in those corridors. 

*- The second fight killed several more*

It's impossible to tell how many exactly are killed in this scene, but between Hudson going out the way he did, everyone else firing for dear life, and the huge explosion caused by Gorman and Vasquez, we are talking probably another 20 - 25. When Hicks and Ripley make it to the elevator with the tracker beeping like mad, they are then only actually attacked by one, which wounds Hicks. Where are the rest of them? 

Well, dead, probably. That's the only reason they would have stopped at this point when there's only two humans *in the open* left. Ripley then more-or-less carries a wounded Hicks an unknown distance to the dropship without being bothered in the slightest. 

***Q3: Why is this interesting?***

*- It explains why Ripley is able to just walk into the hive and grab Newt.*

Yes, Ripley is incredibly badass. But she walks in and grabs a host (you know, those things aliens need to propagate the species) and then wanders straight into the Queen's chamber *with a weapon*. Ants and termites wouldn't stand for that. *Then* she flames the eggs and blows up the egg... sack... thing, and runs. 

It's worth pointing out at this point that even *getting in her way* is a good thing for an alien to do, and apart from one that attempts to flank her there isn't any real attempt to go after her *other than by the Queen*. There are others there that we see, but why risk herself unless the Hive was already pretty much done? *They* don't know the station is about to explode!

*- In some ways it increases the horror*

The thought of the colonists being 'savable' a scant few hours before the marines actually get down there is all kinds of awful. Fuck you, Burke.

\- *It makes the escape of the survivors even more tense*

Hicks, Ripley and Newt owe their lives to the colonists and marines who died before them (and who killed a LOT of aliens doing it), as if there had been just a few more aliens, they wouldn't have made it.As i was taking a closer look to the whole Incredibles family on an invitation for a birthday party from one of my kid friends, i started to notice how different violet looks from the rest of the family members.

Dash has blonde hair like his dad and a straight (pointy?) nose like his mother.

&#x200B;

Jack Jack kinda has a red/blonde hair, kinda like a mix between mom and dad and a slightly pointy nose, i guess as he gets older it will become more pointy like his father/mom.

&#x200B;

Now Violet, she has black straight hair, unlike any family member that we know of so far and her nose is a bit more like a ball or a circle/puffy kinda nose, also she has sorta big bags under her eyes.

Do you know who fits that description? black straight hair, puffy nose and bags under her eyes?

&#x200B;

Edna Mode

Now i thought that similarities were too little to go on to make that assumption but heres another bit that fits, this is taken from the description i read on the wiki:

&#x200B;

" Edna is called out of a 15-year period of imposed retirement to repair damage to Bob's super-suit... "

&#x200B;

And Violet in the movie is said to be a 14 year old girl, now what i think it happened is that Edna Mode retired 15 years ago (talking about the first movie time period) due to the whole supers being banned and that whole controversy but she was also pregnant, as far as we know she didn't receive any help from the government or special programs like the supers did to change their way of life to a normal one like Bob and Helen did,9 months later Violet is born with superpowers, knowing that officials might keep a close eye on her due to her being one of the few people who had close contact with dozens of supers, she decided to instead give her child unto the supers she trusted the most, Bob and Helen, 14 years later things are changing for the supers and Edna is motivated by new suits designs and the prospect of helping her daughter out as well since at first she wasn't so sure about helping Helen or Bob but maybe she did because of Violet.

their looks are similar and time periods fit but i don't know, maybe im just reading too much into it, thoughts?In the graveyard scene in The Prestige, Angier extorts Borden for his secret to the “transported man” trick. Angier has Borden’s diary, but can’t translate it without the keyword. When he asks Borden to write the secret to the trick, Borden writes only the keyword: TESLA. When Angier tells Borden to write the full method instead, Borden replies “The keyword is the method.” Borden later tells Angier that this was a lie and “Tesla” was merely the key to his diary, not his trick. But what if he was telling the truth the first time? What if, in a way, when Borden wrote “Tesla,” he was revealing the secret to his trick?

Before I go on, I must say I do not believe Borden used a Tesla cloning device in his version of the “transported man.” The movie establishes firmly that Borden has a twin and that he was planning his twin-centric trick from the beginning. Second, I must say this movie has twists at every turn. (Angier tells Olivia to work for Borden as a double agent and get Borden to believe it by actually telling him she’s a double agent, only for her to become a true double agent and turn on Angier!). Plus, these characters are notorious double and triple-crossers. (Angier tails Borden in order to be tailed by Fallon so Angier and Cutter can capture Fallon, all to unlock a diary which Borden planted in Angier’s hands in the first place!). So if Borden’s “lie” to Angier turned out to be true, it would be consistent with the film’s style and structure.

So, what did Borden mean when he said Tesla was the method to his trick? In the movie, Borden and Angier are introduced to Tesla at a science expo. They watch a public demonstration of Tesla coils presented by Mr. Tesla’s assistant, Alley, played by Andy Serkis. The venue owner tells the audience Mr. Tesla has refused to appear himself due to restrictions imposed on the demonstration. As the magicians watch, Angier seems amazed by the technology, while Borden seems more interested in the man on the stage, gazing at the stage while those around him are distracted by the machine.

This scene harks back to an earlier one in which Borden and Angier attended a Chinese magician’s show. In that scene, Angier was dazzled by the show while Borden studied the magician, instantly recognizing the method behind the trick. Like Borden, the magician leads a double life, constantly faking frailty so he can do tricks that require great physical strength. Because Borden is leading a double life for his own trick, he recognizes the magician’s method immediately.

It appears that in both scenes, Borden sees past the theatrics and recognizes a deception that Angier cannot. So what trick did Borden recognize at the science expo?

When Angier visits Tesla’s Colorado Springs facility, he is greeted by Alley. Alley is the one who eventually demonstrates all the Tesla technology to Angier, from the lightbulbs in the field to the clone machine. In fact, when Mr. Tesla himself appears, Alley remains present, never leaving Tesla alone with Angier. Alley is also the only one to ever physically operate Tesla’s machines.

We later learn that Tesla is in trouble, going broke while being pursued by Thomas Edison’s agents. One of them was even present at the science expo, attempting to stop Alley’s presentation. Edison’s men eventually succeed in burning down Tesla’s facility. It appears that when Angier meets Tesla, both Tesla and his work are in danger of being stolen or destroyed. So why is Tesla so hands-off during this critical time? And what does this have to do with Borden saying Tesla was the method to his trick? One possible answer is that the man Angier thinks is Tesla is not Tesla at all, and that the real Tesla is the man posing as an assistant - Mr. Alley.

Assistants are crucial to The Prestige. The inciting incident is the death of a magician’s assistant. Both Angier and Borden start out as assistants, and Cutter remarks that a pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection. The assistants in The Prestige are also always more important to the story than they first appear. Olivia, Fallon, Caldlow’s solicitor, and even the blind stagehands all begin as seemingly ordinary characters who turn out to hold important secrets. So it is not far-fetched to believe that Tesla’s assistant would hold a secret of his own.

There are in-story reasons for Alley to be Tesla, as well. Tesla could travel the world and demonstrate his technology more safely as Alley than as Tesla. While Edison’s men might be inclined to hurt or rob Tesla, they would be less inclined to hurt his assistant. After all, why harm an assistant or break his demo machines when the real Tesla could simply replace both from the safety of his home? Posing as Alley would also allow Tesla to get to know Angier more intimately and honestly than he could as Tesla, and help him decide whether to trust Angier with a dangerous machine.

All the real Tesla needed to accomplish his deceit was to find an actor willing to pose as himself when the time came for Angier to meet his client. This double, much like Angier’s double, Root, would simply appear at the proper time, make a passable impression of a scientist, and leave the real work to the man he was playing. But unlike Root, Tesla’s double need not look or sound anything like him, because by this time Tesla had long disappeared from the public eye.

This explains why Angier is whisked away after the “failed” demonstration of his machine. When his top hat does not disappear, Angier turns angrily to “Tesla” and demands to know what is going on. Before “Tesla” can give a scientific explanation, “Alley“ quickly escorts him out of the lab and tells him to come back the next day. This would give the real Tesla time to examine his machine, try to identify the problem, and explain the problem to his double, who could then explain it to Angier if necessary.

Alley is a fake, mononymous persona designed by a genius to throw people off his scent and allow the true genius to hide in plain sight. If that sounds familiar, it’s because that’s exactly what the Bordens created in their alter ego - Fallon.

When Borden said “Tesla” was the method to his trick, he wasn’t lying. He was hinting that the method to his trick was the same method they had both seen Tesla use at the science expo - using an alter ego to hide in plain sight. The trouble was that Angier did not recognize this trick at the expo. Then, when Angier went to see Tesla in person, the trick was staring him in the face once more, and once more Angier failed to recognize it.

**TL;DR:** Andy Serkis's character, Alley, was the real Tesla posing as an assistant in order to throw off Edison's agents. Borden recognized his ploy at the science expo, which is why he told Angier that Tesla was the key to both his diary and his trick.Bikini Bottom is mostly inhabited by Bottom-Feeders, such as Lobsters, molluscs, catfish, and bass. and we've seen very few carnivores.

we've seen sharks, but appearances are few and far between, it's likely most of them are tourists.

The Krabby Patty has been confirmed to be entirely vegetarian, Hillenberg himself stated that there was no meat in the patty once so ever. Chum on the other hand is entirely meat, literally being ground up fish. while Plankton's is synthetic, that doesn't change the fact that it is biochemically identical to natural chum. 

Now, you might be asking yourself "if the reason chum is unappetizing is because it's meat then why does the original Krabby Patty recipe/Plankrabby Patty recipe call for a pinch of chum despite being perfectly edible and even better than regular Krabby Patties?"

it's simple, bottom feeders aren't herbivorous, they are in fact detritovores, a form of omnivore. the "pinch" of chum is similar in amount to what they'd find in nature. 

"then why did the original recipe poison old man Jenkins?" the reason was stated in the episode, Plankton undercooked the chum.

"Then why in Chum Fricassee does Squidward know a recipe for chum fricassee?" 

Squidward is an octopus, octopi are carnivorous, and fricassee does basically amount to "fancily fried", and Squidward has been shown to have a higher standard for what he eats/considers food. regularly eating roast and soufflé, and having both been shown to cook decadent for himself and regularly eat in higher end establishments.  having been shown on more than one occasion to eat at Fancy!, seemingly the only higher end restaurant in the town. Chum is made of Salmon, salmon is a fish octopi have been known to eat in the wild, salmon is fricassee-able, and therefore Chum Fricassee is ground salmon fricassee. a fancy version of what octopi would eat in the wild.

"then why do the Bikini Bottomites eat it in Chum Fricassee?" 

because they're eating it in smaller amounts than "by the bucket" and aren't risking it being undercooked like plankton often sells it as (except that it was due to Squidward Hubris, but everybody got sick because of it).

and there's another Bikini Bottomite who's been shown to consume and enjoy chum. Patrick.

Patrick is a sea star, sea stars are scavengers in nature, often known to eat rotting meat. of course they're also omnivorous, explaining why he eats at both the Krusty Krab and Chum Bucket. but of all the Bikini Bottomites to eat chum he suffers no physical repercussions, as seen in Free Samples when he binges on clearly rancid and ill-prepared chum samples twice. 

Stephen Hillenberg was a marine biologist, he knows how these creatures work and it often made its way into the show. such as Krabs' and Plankton's one-sided rivalry, and Squidwards introversion and hotheadedness. this could easily be one of those examples.So there's the old joke about how Fred and George didn't say anything about their brother sleeping with another man, blah blah blah. In addition, since Peter was a hand me down pet, they would have seen Percy sleeping with Peter as well. So what gives?

Obviously, the map is an enormously powerful artifact, and shouldn't be fooled by anything simple. The idea that the map would hide people's identities is a little silly, because it wasn't meant for anyone other than the marauders who made it, and it's a useful tool for them alone. However, Peter isn't anything but a rat until the 3rd year. Peter, it's been noted, was a skilled wizard who helped make the map, taught himself to be an animagus, and had enough power to create a massive explosion and fake his own death. It took the combined power of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black to force him back to a human form. 

In order to hide effectively as a Rat, Pettigrew moved deeper into the animagus state than he would normally. Most Animagus forms are meant to be humanlike, and not cause issues for the wizards - McGonnigal's cat form is hunanlike, Reeta Skeeter's bug form has markings just like her glasses, and so on. However, Pettigrew is mousy and acts like a rodent. It's mentioned that transfiguring yourself into an animal normally can end with you becoming that animal, and that an animagus form is a highly advanced form of transfiguration, it stands to reason that on some level, an animagus form is a transfiguration that is built into you with protections against going too far. 

So, to escape capture, Pettigrew slipped deeper into his animagus form than is strictly safe, truly becoming an unusually intelligent and long lived rat. 
 While still conscious, he was less conscious and intelligent than normal. he was smart enough to bite people who messed with him, but others wise his job was to just be a super chill old rat and not cause issues. Eventually, the shock of seeing Sirius on the paper forced him to wake up and try to run away or escape. This meant that his mind was present enough to be noted by the map, and thus show up on it. 

TL;DR: Peter Pettigrew forced himself to become more ratlike to hide more effectively, which meant that for Fred and George, the reason they never saw their brother sleeping with another man was that for all intents and purposes, there was no other man, just a smart rat. Peter 'woke up' in book 3 and became human enough to show up on the map.I’ve been watch all three Toy Story movies a lot lately with my kid and I’ve started to notice something about Buzz. He almost never talks about a personal relationship with Andy. The only time he does is right after he accepts that he’s a toy and asks why Andy would want him. After that in Toy Story 2 when he tries to convince Woody to come home by talking about Andy but that’s more about him wanting Woody to come home by reminding Woody about his relationship to Andy. 

This is most evident in Toy Story 3. All the other toys are desperate to be played with, Rex, both Potatoheads and Ham all talk about wanting to be played with but not Buzz. Buzz is most concerned with keeping everyone together. He says it several times and it’s his main motivation for staying at the daycare when Woody leaves. 

I think for Buzz, having an owner is nice but his fellow toys are far more important to him. Woody and especially Jessie are the real relationships that matter to him. When Harry first sees Hogwarts, he describes it as a large, expansive castle. There are 142 staircases, long hallways, and multiple towers. At one point, Nearly Headless Nick mentions his deathday party will be in "dungeon five", implying there are at least four others. Every time the characters need a place to talk, there's always an empty classroom just around the corner. Not to mention, the characters run all over the castle to get to their classes, but only have about five or six subjects (more like seven in later years). That likely means that the large majority of the classrooms they're passing are empty. Hogwarts seems to have the total area of a decently sized college, with space for about 5-10 thousand students (the House common rooms are also able to magically add dorms for more students as needed). However, Hogwarts has nowhere near that number of students. Remember, there were maybe 15 teachers and staff at the entire school, responsible for teaching everyone. Rowling has been inconsistent on the numbers: Harry only has five Gryffindor boys in his year, which, averaged out, would mean 280 students in total. However, Rowling also said that during Harry's first year, there were around 600 or 700 students at Hogwarts, and during his third year, mentioned that about 200 of the crowd at a Quidditch match were Slytherins, which would average out to about 800-900 students total. It's possible that there was a decrease in population and childbirth during Voldemort's rule, and there was a baby boom in the years afterwards, but even so, the student population of Hogwarts is roughly 10% max capacity. Voldemort killed a massive number of wizards, but he never could have wiped out *that* much of the population, nor would he have wanted to, it would have ended his dreams of a pureblood empire. A generation is about 25 years, and, judging from the numbers at Hogwarts, a wizarding generation would be maybe 2,500 people. Even with wizards' elongated lifespans (let's say 4 generations can be around at once), that's only about 10,000 people in all of the UK, a nation of 66.65 million.

Which begs the question: Why? The founders built Hogwarts from the ground up, why would they specifically choose to add a massive amount of unused space? The most logical conclusion is, they didn't add unnecessary space, they created a castle that would fit the needs of the students at the time (with maybe a little extra space just in case). The Wizarding population during their time was such that having a school with a few hundred classrooms was necessary. Again, doing the math, there would be roughly 100,000 wizards alive at the time.

So, we can see that over the course of about a millenia, (990 AD - 1990 AD), 90% of the wizarding population of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales disappeared. Ron Weasley even says that "If we hadn't intermarried with muggles, we would have died out" in the Chamber of Secrets. When the Wizarding World decided to go underground, it was after an intense series of witch hunts. For a change of that magnitude, there'd have to be a massive threat, that likely had killed many wizards and witches already. Then, living in secrecy likely presented many challenges, and made it harder for wizards and witches to meet and form families, or for wizards and witches to marry muggles without giving away the magical world (BIT OF A NASTY SHOCK FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND OUT!). By the time that marrying muggles was normalized and accepted, the wizarding community had likely diminished greatly. More likely died during WW2, especially during the Blitz-- wizards can put up charms against apparition, but they'd have no clue what a bombing raid is. Then, during the reign of Grindelwald and Voldemort, a large number likely died. In addition, wizarding life is dangerous. A slightly mispoken spell could end up killing or horrifically deforming you, a magical beast could tear you limb from limb, and you could be hexed, cursed, and jinxed into oblivion. We see all the students at Hogwarts end up OK, but after they graduate, without Madam Pomfrey on standby, how many of them will survive ten seconds? In addition, with an increasing number of muggleborns and halfbloods, and the improvement of muggle technology, wizards are losing their edge. Why use a broomstick to fly when you can use a plane? Most wizards and witches can end up living comfortable, normal lives, mostly disconnected from magic, only using it for minor inconveniences. Since they have so little need, they likely won't focus nearly as much on a full wizarding education like Hogwarts, leading to an overall decrease in interest in magical exceptionalism. With all the deaths from Voldemort part 2: Pureblood Boogaloo, along with the anti-muggleborn sentiment, the wizarding community is headed for annihilation in a matter of decades. They'll cease to exist as a separate entity, and merge somewhat with the muggles, using magic less and less.

TL;DR: Hogwarts was clearly designed for a much larger number of students, showing that wizards are slowly dying out.In Endgame, when present-day Cap [travels to 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qwv4lwWmP8), he whispers "Hail Hydra" to an elevator full of HYDRA agents before relieving them of the scepter. He then incapacitates 2012 Cap using the scepter.

The specifics of the scepter are never explained, but in Avengers 2012, Loki uses the scepter to mind-control Hawkeye into doing his bidding. So now we have 2012 Cap knocked out on the floor, having just been mind-scrambled by the scepter and probably highly susceptible to influence.

And who will presumably arrive on the scene after present-day Cap leaves? ...The elevator-full of HYDRA agents from earlier. They *could* potentially move 2012 Cap to an off-site location where he would be "debriefed."

This is the same timeline where Loki grabs the Tesseract and summarily escapes. If Marvel wanted Loki to do a "face-turn" in his Disney+ series, they could turn 2012 Cap into a villain - essentially adapting the [Secret Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAPWjQ3k04) arc. They wouldn't even need Chris Evans to do it; 2012 Cap could keep his helmet on the entire time, a similar-looking actor could do their best Chris Evans impression, and if his voice or his mannerisms seem slightly "off," so much the better.

Steve Rogers' knowledge of the mechanics of the scepter is likely fuzzy at best. It's entirely possible that hitting 2012 Cap with it could have resulted in dire unforeseen consequences.

EDIT: Some responses to rebuttals commented below -

* The in-universe function of the scepter is neither explicitly stated nor consistent. Its powers range anywhere from influencing arguments - causing Banner to unknowingly pick it up - to spawning Ultron. My theory isn't implausible from the standpoint of the scepter's capabilities, and it's been shown to have a will of its own.
* 2012 Cap says "I have eyes on Loki," but this is after Loki stole the Tesseract. For the elevator HYDRA agents, it'd be plausible that Cap had retrieved the scepter and had \*attempted\* to secure the Tesseract as well, only for Loki to have bested him. And if present-day cap brought back the scepter, that still leaves HYDRA with "Loki got away with the Tesseract, scepter laying next to KO'd probably-Hydra Cap, what do?" I'm not saying it's slam-dunk 100% confirmed, I'm just saying it's totally possible that it turns out badly.
* Steve Rogers returning the stones does not negate the changes in this timeline. What would the Loki Disney+ series be about, otherwise? There will be original, new stories told in this timeline that do not match the others.(WARNING: Endgame spoilers ahead)

When the first trailer was released, people were kinda underwhelmed that the "Far From Home" subtitle simply referred to a trip to Europe, given that Spidey had already been to another planet in Infinity War. However, the new trailer gave us some info that puts that title in a new light. Firstly, it showed that the filmmakers are aware of how much Peter's trip to space recontextualized his character ("Bitch, please..."). It seems unlikely that they'd give Nick Fury that line while still hyping up his Europe vacation as a big deal. Secondly, the new trailer introduced the multiverse. I know some people believe that the multiverse explanation is just a lie concocted by Mysterio, but I think it's reasonable to believe that SHIELD has tech to verify that claim that's too advanced to be fooled by a simple illusionist. What if, instead, Mysterio really is from another dimension, but he's lying about his intentions in an attempt to scam the residents of MCU Earth? And in that case, what if Peter found out about Mysterio's deception? How could Mysterio prevent that information from being spread? Simple: He traps Peter in the dimension he originally came from. 

&#x200B;

I believe that, at some point during the third act of the film, Mysterio will prevent his secret from being revealed by sending Spider-Man back to Mysterio's home dimension. This could create some good drama, possibly with Peter's friends being put into danger and Peter powerless to help. It could be a good showcase of Peter's character, with him having to use his intelligence to figure out how to escape (similar to Tony Stark in the first Iron Man movie, furthering the idea that Spider-Man has to fill Iron Man's shoes following his death). Finally, it would leave Peter farther from home than he's ever been, and leave the film with a far more fitting title.In the toy story universe, toys aren't the only living things. There are Christmas decorations, lawn ornaments, and I'd presume many other things. Does anyone think this would include sex dolls?The rainbow road is a celestial phenomenon and when one appears, a tournament can be begun with the goal of holding the final race on the Rainbow Road. Mario Kart 8 was the first instance of an artificial rainbow road being created for the purposes of holding a tournament. Just a cool idea, maybe more of a headcanon, but it explains why all the other rainbow roads look normal and 8 is the only one that's so deliberately manmade looking and space-themed.What got me thinking about this is Season 5, Episode 12, the one where Barney tries to bang the hot bartender. He "de-suits" because the bartender says she hates guys with suits, but we then see Barney hiding his suits and putting them on to get satisfaction. A funny metaphor, right? No. He goes through the phases of going cold turkey in an addiction, hearing voices telling him to "Suit up" and well, hiding suits in a bathroom just to put them on might be a bit more than a metaphor. So let's think about this not just in the context of this episode, but overall.

Barney started wearing suits after breaking up with his first girlfriend because he wasn't "adult" enough for her. A lot of people turn to drugs right after a really bad breakup.

Barney's suits directly correlate numerous times to him banging everyone in site. 

We know that Future Ted uses innocent metaphors to avoid telling his children about drugs, which is seen when he calls Marijuana "sandwiches". 
This makes sense because he wouldn't tell his children that their uncle had a drug addiction.

A lot of Barney's schemes and plots overall revolve around psychedelic themes and illogical happenings. 

S5 Episode 12 ends with Barney singing a long scale musical about how much he loves suits and how he'll never let them go. Theoretically, lets say that Barney's suits were proven to be drugs. A lot more things would make sense. The hot bartender in the episode doesn't want to date people that does drugs. The temptation in his head is simply his drug addiction that he can't fight. He puts on a suit in the bathroom because he can't stand being without his drugs without going through withdrawal. His inability to get close to a woman for the majority of the show could also be synonymous with him not wanting woman to find out about his drug addiction. 

Any thoughts?The Autobots came to earth in the 1980's but already had knowledge of the planet so I think they had previously sent a scout for reconnaissance. This scout was Herbie. However, he later decided to be a conscientious objector in the war between Autobots and Decepticons and spent his life as a racecar driver. There was a scene in the Lindsay Lohan movie where the bad guy turned away and Herbie made fun of him by making a funny face, but doing this required him to sort of expand/disassemble his parts much like Autobots are capable of.   


It always bugged the shit out of me that there was no explanation for some random car being sentient so I'm gonna just go with this. You have a world where there are lots of species with identical-looking individuals. Some of these species are even humanoid. Some of them appear to be wearing clothes. Some of them can even speak perfectly.

Why is Joy not possibly a pokemon species? Because no one treats them like one? If Ash walked into a business staffed with squirtles he wouldn't even bat an eye. 

**Edit:** Same with Officer Jenny. 

I've never played a game all the way through, and I mostly know of the cartoon through cultural osmosis.

But is an army of infinite clones any less outrageous? Or the theory that they're all somehow made that way, or they're all identical cousins, or that it's some kind of illusion, or some other cartoon/anime logic bullshit? What other theory makes more sense than a specialized species of humanoid pokemon? Aren't all pokemon hyper specialized? 

AFAIK, all Joys do is heal pokemon. And all Jennies do is arrest people. 

Q: Has anyone ever tried to capture a Joy or a Jenny in a poke ball? (In the anime, I mean.)

**Second edit:** To all the folks saying they're clones as if that makes things simpler or somehow less disturbing:

Cloning on that scale requires the existence of one or more cloning facilities churning out Joys and Jennies. That requires a lot more infrastructure (and cover up!) than just a species reproducing.Think about it, your character always respawns at hospital no matter how impossible it seems. This should surely apply to the NPCs. This may explain why the population remains the same and you are unable to wipe out the whole city.In Endgame, we see Scott basing his understanding of time travel on Back To The Future, and Tony Stark has to correct his misconceptions. 

But we also have an explanation of how Pym Particles work that doesn't make any scientific sense in the real world, but happens to be the same explanation that is used for how the shrink ray works in Honey I Shrunk The Kids. 

So, my thought is that Hank Pym knows that Scott is a big dork for 80s movies, and Pym Particles work in a way that is way beyond what Scott would actually understand, so he gives him the Rick Moranis version so he won't ask a lot of annoying questions that he's not able to understand the answers to.When we see Danny watching TV it's always Looney Tunes, specifically the "Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show." His nickname is "Doc," and Halloran does a Bugs Bunny impression when they first meet. Danny constantly cruises the hotel halls like the Road Runner, thereby also showing he's in good shape for a kid. 

When Jack finally snaps Danny puts all his exercise and cartoon knowledge into action. His evasion of his father is pure Looney Tunes-style, like the Road Runner vs. the Coyote. He outsmarts his dad in a very cartoon way by covering his tracks, leaving him to die in a very slapstick way. We even get an aftermath shot of Jack frozen to death like an idiot, just like how the Coyote is often smashed flat or folded like an accordion in defeat.At the end of Deadpool 2, Deadpool gets his hands on a time machine, and goes back to fix mistakes made in the movie, as well as other, more 'meta' events.

Deadpool 3 could pick up after this, and could show Deadpool, as well as any characters they want to bring over into the MCU, going to various points and 'pushing' well known heroes into their origin stories.

He could be in the car that causes Dr Strange's accident, make war look appealing to Steve Rogers, and even convince Tony Stark to show off his weapon on location in Afghanistan. They then return to the present, finding a new world. Perhaps he could arrive during the shootout in episode 3 of *The Falcon and the Winter Soldier*, where the device is destroyed, stranding the gang, including a distressed Cable, in the present.

Obviously, this will conflict with the time travel rules established in Endgame, but that could be fixed with either a comment from Cable about how the device works, or with Deadpool excitedly shouting "plothole" to the camera.Elon Musk has taken a pretty firm anti-AI stand, which some people find strange because AI is currently rather narrow and specialized.

However, this gets less strange when you realize that Musk is a character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuG2AVFB-g0) where Elon is shown speaking with Tony Stark.

This means that Elon lives in a world where Ultron exists, and therefore he knows exactly what wanton destruction an AI can havoc.

TLDR: Elon Musk lives in our world AND the MCU, and wants to prevent Ultron from happening hereThe Matrix establishes that Humanity and the Machines went to war. Towards the end of the conflict, humanity scorched the sky to rob the Machines of their power source. We are led to believe that despite this feat, the Machines still won the war and enslaved humanity as an energy source. It’s been discussed to death that humans would be a terrible energy source for the Machines. So, why do they keep us alive? 

For all the Architect’s smugness, it seems to me that, considering the alterative, the humans have a pretty cushy existence inside the Matrix. Earth is destroyed, but we live on with all the perceived amenities of the modern world while the Machines endlessly toil away to keep us in perceived material comfort. If the Resistance achieved their goal of freeing us, they would have billions of unplugged humans, all in need rapid medical assistance to adjust to the real world. Zion could barely feed their own people, now they’re supposed to sustain billions of disorganized humans on a dead planet? 

I propose that Humanity won the war against the Machines when they scorched the sky. But, victory came at the terrible cost of destroying the planetary ecosystem. Having rendered the world conventionally uninhabitable, the survivors programed the remaining Machines to keep humans alive in a virtual reality, in perpetuity. The Machines are programed to think they won the war and that they need humans as a fuel source. The Machines slave away to keep up alive while we live on blissfully unaware in a digital utopia mirroring the supposed pinnacle of human civilization. The Machines continue on because they are the ones under the delusion of that they are in control."Is she always this intense?" asks Felix.  
The soldier replies, "She was programmed with the most tragic backstory ever. The one day she didn't do a perimeter check, her wedding day....."  
  
Calhoun and her groom are shown to be at the altar about to recite their vows. Suddenly a giant cy-bug breaks into the chapel and eats the groom. Calhoun whips a giant mini-gun out from under her gown and starts blasting it while screaming. Zoom in on her horrified face.  
  
Tragic enough already, right? Now think about the first thing you learn about cy-bugs. They become what they eat, and they do it *immediately*.  
The first time you see this, one eats Ralph's laser gun and instantly grows two guns and starts firing. The second time you see this, a small Cy-bug eats some candy and instantly becomes candy-striped. Both times, it only takes a second or two.  
The third time you see this, King Candy / Turbo gets eaten and the camera cuts away before you can see the transformation begin. If the movie follows the same logic for people as it does for objects, the cy-bug *immediately* became the Turbo/King Candy boss bug.  
  
So following that logic, during the zoom-in on Calhoun's face, the cy-bug that ate the groom was beginning its transformation into a grotesque, evil mutated version of him. Even though she shot it immediately, it stands to reason that it took several shots (and at least a full second or two) to drop this giant beast.  
So while we watched her face as she was shooting at the cy-bug, we weren't watching her avenge his death. We were watching her kill her lover as he merged forms with a monster.This only applies to the 1971 film, but as the title said when Willy Wonka sent out the golden tickets into the world he only sent four out at first and waited until someone made a counterfeit to send out the last.

It’s safe to assume that he knew where exactly he was sending the tickets as Mr Wilkinson showed up almost right after they were found. This is at least the case for Charlie because he showed up minuets after he found it. 

Since we found out this was all a test at the end of the movie for Willy Wonka to find a successor he probably wanted to put more care into making sure where the ticket ended up. He said he didn’t want it to go to an adult since they would do everything their own way. It’s kinda only sheer luck on his part that kids ended up find the first four tickets.

Once the announcement went out that there were 5 tickets out there the whole world went crazy looking for them. Charlie being the exception because he couldn’t afford to look for it. Everything then calmed down after it was announced the gambler found the fifth ticket. The candy shop owner even said that once it was found he didn’t have to hide his Wonka bars anymore. (Let us also not rule out the possibility that he was in on it too) So I think that when the announcement came that ticket was fake Willy Wonka sent out the final one, with the whole world wrapped up in this contest it was probably inevitable that someone eventually tried to make a counterfeit. Once it was and everyone thought the contest was over the candy bar went out to his local neighborhood so that it could be found by someone who wasn’t specifically looking for it, someone who just wanted to buy some chocolate. Also with the devastating news of the ticket begin found it was likely no one who actively participated wanted to spend anymore money on Wonka bars. 

Going back to the shop owner, he gave the bar with the ticket to Charlie when he said he was going to get it for his grandpa Joe, with something like sharing and generosity being in lack of from the other kids, maybe this could have been a signal that the candy shop owner needed to look out for to give the ticket to. Let us not forget that he gave Charlie a bar that was on display, the floor model if you will.

With Willy Wonka being the genius and potential manipulative sociopath we know him to be, this would make sense for him to try and control the contest as best he can to find the right person to trust his life’s work to.Ok so imagine a world where Pokemon are real, but humans are not.  Pokemon run free, likely in small herds or colonies of similar types.  Pokemon would likely still evolve by level up, as they gain experience growing older, or hunting, or whatever else they would just naturally do.  This makes evolved Pokemon fairly common, but excludes certain Pokemon from the list.  Those that evolve by means other than level up.

Pokemon that evolve by stones could probably exist.  Evolutionary stones are probably found in the world (and I'm pretty sure moon stones canonically fall from the sky in the Johto games at that one Clefairy event in Mt. Moon that nobody has ever seen).  Pokemon that evolve by friendship could probably form friendships among other Pokemon and evolve that way.  This leaves trade evolutions, which are not likely to happen naturally.

Enter Kadabra, who would likely exist despite Abra not learning any offensive moves, but who could not evolve due to lack of trainers to trade it.  Now, here I'm going to make a few assumptions.  First, the Pokedex entry for Alakazam.  I know Pokedex entries are far from reliable, but one sticks out to me here.  That Alakazam has an IQ of 5000.  This is quite obviously an exaggeration, but by how far?  I'd argue that, even if this is a tremendous exaggeration, there's a fair case to be made for Alakazam being above human intelligence.  Thus, I think it's pretty fair to put Kadabra at roughly human intelligence.

As creatures of human intelligence, it isn't too much of a stretch to say that they would develop a Kadabra/Abra society, including language, economy, domestication of less intelligent creatures, etc.  Included in this list, however, is slavery.  In a world where powerful creatures like Machoke appear regularly, and over whom Kadabra had a serious intelligence/type advantage, Kadabra would probably enslave Machoke to do physical labor.  And, if they ever gave that Machoke to another Kadabra or traded it for another Pokemon slave, Machoke would evolve into Machamp.

Kadabra, being human-like in this scenario, would realize that this is a pattern and would seek to reproduce it in other Pokemon, including Graveler and other Kadabra.  This leads to Alakazam and Golem becoming prevalent in the wild.  Therefore I believe that Kadabra/Alakazam would likely perfect the process over years of trial and error, and would thus create an extensive slave trade to develop Alakazam society, and introduce Golem, and Machamp into the world.

Then, one day, Alakazam Lincoln would come along and free the Machamp slaves, inspiring John Weavile Booth to assassinate him at the Pokemon Contest.

EDIT: u/Skitterleaper brings up an interesting point about the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon canon.  I've been giving it some thought through the day and I've decided to reject that canon for a few reasons.

The first reason is the obvious presence of humans.  I'm most familiar with the first two games so I'll discuss those primarily.  So, in these two games, the player character is a human that turned into a Pokemon.  The first game mentions another human as well, who is actually the Gengar in that game.  In both games, there are plotlines that mention involvement with the humans of the world, manifesting in the Ninetales and Grovyle plots.  In addition, there's one Pokemon in the main game canon that is explicitly stated to be human-made, that being Castform.  Castform appears throughout both games and is fairly common, which seems to indicate pretty substantial human involvement.  Considering these, it seems that the Mystery Dungeon canon should have fairly little bearing on this hypothetical scenario.

The second reason is that, in the PMD canon, all Pokemon seem to have the same intelligence.  They're all capable of speech, and besides there are gummis just lying around that can raise IQ.  Alakazam is still explicitly stated to be the smartest, but that's more of a testament to that single Alakazam.  Some Pokemon should likely not be able to speak (Porygon has no mouth nor telepathy, Voltorb has no mouth, etc.) And yet they can in PMD canon.  It kind of trivializes the relative intelligence canon of Pokemon.

All being said, you could consider that the PMD canon dismisses this theory, but I happen to disagree.  We'll just have to wait for the inevitable gritty Nat Geo series to prove one side rightShort version:  Odin sacrificed Hela's mother to gain the Soul Stone, and the act caused him to change from "Warlord Odin" to "Protector of the Nine Realms Odin".  

MAJOR INFINITY WAR AND RAGNAROK SPOILERS

We know that Odin used to be a ruthless conqueror.  He and his daughter Hela rampaged across the universe, subjugating realm after realm.  Except one day, for reasons unknown he stopped, imprisoned his daughter, and became a benevolent ruler who only warred as a last result.  My theory is that during his conquest Odin sought out the Infinity Stones himself; he sacrificed his wife for the Soul Stone, and the remorse over the act and the connection to the souls of the universe granted to him by the stone caused him to change to a protector rather than a conqueror.  

I'll break the theory down into discrete parts with their justification as follows:

**Odin was collecting Infinity Stones for his conquest of the universe**

* There is a clear motivation for Warlord Odin to want to stones.  In the past he wanted to conquer the realms.  Becoming the most powerful being in the universe by possessing the Infinity Stones and the Odinforce would make that task trivial for him.
* There is a fake/replica of the infinity gauntlet in the vault of Asgard, and the dwarves of Nidavellir have the plans to make such a gauntlet.  Odin clearly knows what the gauntlet is, and what it does, and had the capability to make one for himself.
* Hela identifies the gauntlet in the Vault of Asgard as a fake, implying she knows what a real gauntlet looks like.  This is likely because she remembers Odin wielding one
* The Space Stone (as the tesseract) was hidden in a nordic village on earth long ago.  The nords worship Odin because the Asgardian pantheon visited earth in the past, so it is strongly implied that the Asgardians themselves hid the stone on earth.  Therefore we have direct evidence that Odin possessed the Space Stone at one point.
* Bor, Odin's father, captured and hid the Reality Stone.  The Reality Stone is effectively in possession of Odin already because of this.

**The Soul Stone not only grants control of souls and the soul realm, but also bridges an empathetic connection to those souls.  This is evidenced by Thanos' change in behavior in Infinity War**

* There is a distinct change in Thanos' emotional state after he gains the Soul Stone, and I don't think it is entirely due to grief over killing Gamora.  After he acquires the Soul Stone he travels to Titan and fights with the GotG, Iron Man and Iron Lad (Spider-Man), and Dr. Strange.  Given that he has the Power Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone, and Soul Stone at this point there is no reason why he couldn't have completely shut down that fight immediately and brutally (like he did in Knowhere) and forced Dr. Strange to give up the stone by threatening the rest with death and/or torture.  It's the threat of killing Tony that forces Dr. Strange to give up the Time Stone, after all.  
* Additionally, when he arrives on earth, he almost goes out of his way to just disable the Avengers there instead of killing or majorly wounding them.  Thanos can punch the Hulk into submission, there is no way he wouldn't have turned Captain America into a pasty spot unless he was pulling his punches. He basically just gently hand waves everyone away.
* I believe that the kinder, gentler Thanos we see at the end of Infinity War is due to him feeling a connection to the souls of the people around him, that is granted to him by the Soul Stone.  He doesn't significantly hurt or kill anyone after he gains the stone because he feels the pain of their deaths.  Granted, he still is a fanatic devoted to killing half the universe, but he defers all the deaths for the snap so he can let the randomness decide rather than being directly responsible.

**Odin sacrifices Hela's mother to gain the Soul Stone**

* Thor states Hela is his half-sister in Infinity War.  Odin is their shared parent, therefore Hela has a different mother than Frigga.
* Odin would need to sacrifice someone he loves to gain the Soul Stone.  It's not a stretch to assume he loved the women whom he birthed his first child with.
* It is never stated who Hela's mother is in the MCU, indicating that she is no longer relevant or alive.

Put all of the above together, and there is significant evidence to assume that remorse over killing Hela's mother combined with the empathy granted by the Soul Stone causes Warlord Odin to fully realize the pain and suffering his universal conquest is causing.  He renounces his war and become the Protector of the Realms in repsonse.  He hides the Infinity Stones that were in his possession, and destroys his Infinity Gauntlet leaving a fake in his vault (either as a reminder to himself, or as a red herring to others wanting to steal their own gauntlet).

*Edit:  Apparently this theory has been presented already.  My apologies to whomever I unintentionally copied.  I thought this one up on my own and didn't bother searching for similar posts before posting myself.* 

How do SpongeBob and Squidward lead middle class lives while being paid so little by Mr Krabs? How does Patrick make a living? Why does the show barely show the workplaces of the fish who regularly eat at the Krusty Krab?

I as many other viewers have wondered. Then I put the pieces together with some other facts.
1. Bikini Bottom is located in the middle of nowhere (Krusty Towers), founded as a 19th century colonial hamlet (Pest of the West) with no explanation given for its existance.
2. Bikini Bottom is a town of significant size, and seems to be larger and have more facilities in later episodes (indicating growth), so it must have something attractive
3. Bikini Bottom has many mines and caves below its surface (Mustard O’Mine, The Wreck of the Mauna Loa, Chum Caverns)

My theory is that there’s a large mining network in Bikini Bottom, most clearly shown in Mustard O’Mine where there’s an actual train taking people from mine to mine. The miners who found the mines then set up Bikini Gulch, with the hamlet then serving as a base for the miners providing a bank, saloon etc. This explains the remoteness of Bikini Bottom.

After growing into a full town, there was no growth of overall facilities anymore (some early episodes even mention the Krusty Krabs and Chum Bucket as the only restaurants around). It might have even led to high unemployment rates and population decline as more descendants of the miners either couldn’t find jobs anymore in the mines or didn’t want to be miners. They left town or became unemployed like Patrick. Shortly before the start of SpongeBob SquarePants, the Bikini Bottom govt. decided to stimulate consumption and thereby attract new residents and business by using the excess tax money they received from the mining industry to give every resident a significant amount of cash free for use.

This led to the growth of consumers at businesses like the Krusty Krabs, enabled Mr. Krabs to keep Squidward and hire SpongeBob for lower wages, and gave Patrick and many other Bikini Bottomites the ability to not work and spend their days in fromt of the tv, on Goo Lagoon or consuming Krabby Patties. It also attracted many new businesses and residents, causing the growth of the city between early and later seasons.

TL:DR Bikini Bottom has a mining-based economy and everyone in SpongeBob SquarePants is able to live off no to low wages due to the mining revenues being used to provide Universal Basic Income

Edit: great question why Squid doesn’t quit the KK. Here’s my explanation for those who don’t read comments;
1. Squidward wants to live like he’s Frasier. UBI allows a lower middle class life like Patrick. He needs the extra buck.
2. Squidward could quit and find another job, but remember that he has been working at the KK for long, and before SpongeBob he was happy, enjoying his coworker and believing it was just a stop on the way to fame as a clarinet player. Quitting for anything else than a career as clarinet player or artist or whatever is admitting he failed. He doesn’t have the guts to quit the KK because to him feels he’s giving up his dreams as well.I think kylo ren's pants in TLJ are higher waisted than normal because he's still healing from the bowcaster shot he took in TFA. 

A simple and short theory but I haven't seen it posted before.
I'm not sure if it's original but me and few friends were talking about this, due to the massive interest in avatar again we being much older have started to pick out more themes. But we've noticed that the next avatars personality seems to cover the faults or failings of the one before. Yangchen sacrificed her spiritual needs for the world and because of this she was unsatisfied with herself, the world was at peace but she wasn't, avatar Koruk was carefree and was intensely spiritual and vain caring more about himself and his loved ones than his duty, Kiyoshi was devoted to her nation and duty to the point she isolated her people and herself she was loved my many but kept people distant to protect them, Roku valued his friends and trusted them to the point they over stepped and he faltered, he blamed this on his avatar status but accepted it, Aang wanted to remain loyal to his nation even at the cost of the world and he valued his heritage, he was distant from other nations after the war valuing his air nomad heritage more than the others, Korra had strong connections the other elements from a young age and immediately dove into her duty and has a strong will but a deep distinction from air even to water, she tended to try to do everything herself. I am almost certain that this is canon even if unintentionally.

Edit: Grammar(*Edited for clarity.)
   As almost anyone knows, pro-wrestling is staged. It's not UFC. The guys aren't trying to win, rather they are working together to put on a good show for the audience. The wrestlers certainly endure a beating, but they are essentially entertainers. There are expected roles for the wrestlers, such as the [face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_\(professional_wrestling\)) (the fan favorite) or the [heel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_\(professional_wrestling\)) who is meant to be disliked by the audience. We see Bonesaw, who the fans love, beating up on basically nameless opponents who he is clearly meant to beat.

   The wrestling community is close knit and hard-working, even at the amateur level. There are countless guys who do it for free or get paid very little, simply for the love of the sport. So when a local venue has an opportunity for amateurs to share the ring with a big name wrestler like Bonesaw, it is like a small-time musician having the opportunity to come onstage and play the guitar alongside an established act. They recognize that is not an opportunity to try to upstage them. It is the amateur's role to lose.

"But what about the $3,000 for three minutes?", you might ask. Despite the action being staged, it still requires an large amount of athleticism, acting, and a high pain tolerance. The average amateur wrestler likely would not be able to put on a good three minute match with a professional like Bonesaw. And if a wrestler is good enough to match his abilities and put on a show for three minutes, $3,000 might not be a huge price to pay one-time for finding another talent like Bonesaw. Signing another wrestler like that could be very lucrative.

Peter Parker clearly doesn't know much about wrestling, especially when comparing his costume to the other wrestlers who show up. So when he comes and sees that he has to sign a waiver, probably required by an insurane company to cover accidents, he assumes Bonesaw will actually be trying to hurt him. Peter's expression is shocked when he watches Bonesaw simply bodyslam a wrestler, who lays there and allows it to happen. Later, he sees Bonesaw's last opponent, who clearly has more experience than Peter based on his actual wrestling attire, screaming theatrically that he can't feel his legs. Anyone who has ever watched wrestling would recognize this as part of the show. In the movie's script, Bonesaw even beats up an "audience member" who calls him fake. These are both clearly stunts, as anyone except apparently Peter Parker would realize.

During his match, in a suspiciously rubbery looking "steel-cage", we can see Bonesaw's actual confusion when Spiderman jumps above him. He literally asks "What are you doing up there?", as if to say "Stick to the program and wrestle me." Rather than wrestling him and giving him something to work with, Spiderman is running away. No one pays to watch that, so Bonesaw tries to give the audience some action. Bonesaw slamming Spiderman into the cage and hitting him with the [chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vEt28Zivp0) are nothing that any fan hasn't seen before, and would not hurt any wrestler who knows how to absorb a hit. So imagine poor Bonesaw's surprise when his "opponent", who is supposed to be his supporting act, refuses to give him any material for what is essentially physical improv. Instead, the guy starts kicking him repeatedly in the chest with his train-stopping super-strength.

So imagine if you are the event manager, when the jabroni who just seriously injured your top performer, the fan's favorite wrestler, comes up to you after his match expecting $3,000. On top of that, it's not like Spiderman can replace Bonesaw. He has no stage presence, no charisma, weighs less than 150 pounds, and has a terrible outfit. Instead of giving the folks a show by wrestling, Spiderman just kicked the shit out of a guy who is essentially an actor.

TL;DR Spider-Man is the ultimate heel.I'll admit I got this theory from this [cracked](http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-tragic-parks-rec-storyline-nobody-talks-about/) article. Generally it talks about how Ron Swanson was sexually groomed by Tammy 1. She was there since birth, raising him, educating him, and teaching him "everything he knows". She claims she will be there the day he dies. It's clearly sexual. 

Ron has demonstrated two things about Tammy. 1- she is Satan. And 2- he is powerless around her. It would make sense that Ron Swanson has developed a set of behaviors to subconsciously reject and deter Tammy.

Tammy tends to bring out a childlike immature nature in Ron- as the article mentions he shaves his mustache, dresses younger, and uses language denoting a younger age. Likely this is due to being groomed by Tammy, but its clear that Tammy likes younger looking and acting "men".

So when Ron got a job at age 9,carved his own boat, and attempts to become the epitome of manhood, he's doing so to ward off the attention of Tammy 1. It was his own subconscious way to stop the abuse and grooming that made him so uncomfortable.This is just a thought I had during a reread.

Slughorn is an incredibly skilled potions maker, but throughout the series, he's never shown or mentioned having any talent at dueling, in addition to being rather cowardly and self serving. When McGonagall threatens to duel him to the death should he betray her, he flinches, and is extremely frightened. However, just hours later, he then helps McGonagall and Kingsley duel Voldemort himself. 

So, how did he manage to take on one of the deadliest wizards of all time, even with help?

**Slughorn had prepared an emergency stash of Felix Felicis, which he used before the battle**.

In *The Half Blood Prince,* Slughorn gives out eight hours worth of Felix Felicis, the "Liquid luck" potion. Notably, he gives it out as a prize in class, the same way another teacher might offer a lollipop to students. If he's willing to be that generous with it, he has to have a decent supply for himself, or at least the capacity to make more. We even see that the cauldron he makes is far larger than what he gives Harry. Hypothetically, the Ministry regulates the brewing of it, but Slughorn has shown to be willing to break laws in the past (Acromantula fangs for the black market), and it seems fair to say that Voldemort's focus after taking over wasn't on bureaucratic administration. 

Liquid Luck doesn't just make the user lucky, it fills them with self confidence. Slughorn was obviously terrified by Voldemort, and fled at first, but the potion gave him the courage to come back, and even face Voldemort head on.There's a scene showing bulletts bouncing off of car windows without breaking them. At first I thought it was just a blooper but thinking about it, perhaps he is using a toy/airsoft type gun which would be fitting for his character and a subtle nod to his comic book weapons.Right?...the whole movie does indeed take place inside Arthur's imagination.

I'm just as tired as you all of hearing the theory that "it's all in his head" with no further explanation of **why,** so hear me out.

I think it's pretty clear from the get-go that the whole movie is from **Arthur's perspective**. He's in nearly every scene, and the movie skips over what would otherwise be crucial scenes because Arthrur is not present in them, (like for example, we never see the detectives find Randall and Arthur's mother's bodies, we have to assume they do because they start chasing him down the street and into the subway near the end of the movie.) and when there is a scene that Arthur shouldn't have been in, he's there in one way or another (like when he imagines himself on Murray's show at the beginning or when we see a flashback of his mother when she was in Arkham, Arthur was present in both of these scenes although realistically, he couldn't have). There is only one scene he isn't in, and I'll get into that later.

Now the movie has some errors in it, and many have pointed it out. I'm here to say that the producers were well aware of these mistakes, and left them in regardless because it fuels what I think is the conclusion to the movie. There's two notorious ones people have been talking about: **the revolver during Arthur's first kills**, and when **Arthur suffocates his mother**.

People have pointed out that during the scene in the subway where Arthur kills three men, the revolver shoots 8 rounds. Now, I know some revolvers can shoot 8 just as some can only shoot 6, but under the assumption it's a 6 round one, it would make complete sense. When Randall first gives him the gun, Arthur claims he "can't be near them". You could say it's implied that he has never been allowed around one becuase of his mental condition. So of course, Arthur wouldn't know any better. He doesn't seem like the kind of person to know a thing or to about guns, so he wouldn't have known only certain revolvers can shoot 8 rounds. My point? This scene, along with the rest of the movie, were indeed in his head,  and the reason the revolver shot more rounds than it should've was a mistake from Arthur's part, he didn't know any better.

Same thing goes for the time Arthur suffocates his mother in the hospital with a pillow. She had nasal cannulas up her nose! Surely those might've helped at least a little bit, right? He probably doesn't know much about medical equipment either.

Which leads me to my final point, which is **the moment Thomas and Martha Wayne are killed**. This is (I believe) the ONLY scene in the movie where Arthur is not present. The whole movie has been from his perspective, he's been even in flashbacks he couldn't have been in, so for them to include such a notorious scene is weird right? Well I believe he is indeed part of the scene, because he's **imagining** it. It is indeed in his head, and that's why we're able to see it so clearly, that and because it's the punchline to the joke (the joke being the whole movie, with the punchline being the end, now that Thomas and Martha are dead, Bruce is as much as an orphan as Arthur.).

And Arthur does have that shitty sense of humor. When he's in Murray's show he makes a knock knock joke about a guy who gets run over and laughs his ass off over it.

So **in conclusion**, the movie is just one big joke building up in his head, with the conclusion being the punchline, and there are hints throughout the movie that support this theory, as they show how disconnected Arthur really is with how things work.

Anyways that's my two cents on this theory, I may be wrong but that's the fun part about these right? And sorry if it's a bit convoluted, I'm bad at explaining myself.Out of all of the tricks, mistakes, twists, turns, and mind games Death Note, I think that Light Yagami's biggest mistake was forgetting how much Ryuk craved apples. In the earlier half of Death Note, Ryuk's love for apples is introduced - as he compares it to that of an addiction. Apples are Shinigamis much like how drugs are to human beings, and if he doesn't get his fix, he exhibits symptoms of withdrawal. In earlier episodes of Death Note, Light uses this to his advantage when the detectives and FBI place undercover surveillance cameras in his house. Light - aware that he's being watched - constructs a plan to try to find blind spots, and so he asks Ryuk to check for the cameras (because Shinigamis aren't visible to the naked eye unless you have the Death Note/Death Note pages). Ryuk is obviously derived of apples and seems hesitant on doing it, so Light bribes him into finding them by telling him that Ryuk could eat apples at the blind spots. Then, Ryuk accepts. It is clear that Light takes advantage of Ryuk's love for apples in order to make him do his bidding.  


So, why is this important? Because Light could have manipulated Ryuk into telling him L's real name for a larger supply of apples post-episode 9 (or, right after Light's father confirms that Ryuzaki/Ryuga is actually L). It's established that in order to kill someone using the Death Note, you need a name and a face to attach to the person you intend to kill. This means no false faces nor names, otherwise you have the chance in killing the wrong person (as introduced in episode 1, where Light kills a convict thinking he was L). Shinigami's also know people's names and their life spans - and in order to give a human being access to those features, they need to make a "Shinigami Eyes Deal" - a human gets the ability to read people's names and life span, but as a consequence, their lifespan is cut short. Light declined this offer, but I'm mentioning this to reinforce the fact that Ryuk knew L's name all along. So, why didn't it cross Light's mind to manipulate Ryuk into revealing L's name for a large supply of apples?  


Although Ryuk - by default - says early on in the show that he only dropped the Death Note because he was bored - and by extension, remains neutral and doesn't *"support"* Light nor L - it's proven that when he is going through apple withdrawal he'll go to extreme lengths. Especially given the camera incident earlier, where he was **DIRECTLY** supporting Light by telling him where all of L's cameras were placed.  


I believe Light overlooked this massive advantage is because, as shown throughout the series, the Death Note gradually fuelled his god complex and arrogance that followed. He became so indulged in himself to the point where he lost sight of his goal. At first, Light's modus operandi was to eradicate the world of criminals, and be somewhat of a god for his new world order. However, when the FBI and L began to take note of the fact that several criminals were dying worldwide from heart-attacks, they suspected that it wasn't a coincidence - but rather, a recurring pattern. From hereon out, Light's goals shift, and he doesn't *just* target criminals - instead, he tries to target those who oppose or threaten his goals.It's easy to see why they would do this. In fact, it's hard to imagine how they would get away with not doing it. "If you want to see how the sausage is made, you'll need a strong stomach." If they let anyone too compassionate too close to Homelander and his antics, he's be outed pretty quickly. I would even infer that the entire purpose of the Seven to begin with was to help contain Homelander.  Vought is sure to lose control of him if they don't keep him socialized, so they surround with a buffer of the kind of people who can tolerate him.

Even Maeve put up with Homelander and the rest this long, and is the kind of person who flips a table in a domestic dispute. Deep may oddly enough be the exception: he's a bad person because of empathy exhaustion from constantly hearing the cries of nearby fish, so he has trouble caring enough about humans. I don't think he has particularly low empathy.

What's interesting, though, is how Starlight fits into this. Sure, she seems nice. She fights for the good guys. But consider:

1. **Starlight shows almost no remorse or trauma after killing a man for the first time.** She just feels angry at the victim for "making" her do it by (justifiably) pulling a gun. I put "making" in quotes, because she could easily have walked up and disarmed him instead of blasting him. If she were the one walking toward him, he would have shot at her, not the others, and it took a vastly more powerful gun to so much as knock her down.

And it's not as if "this isn't that kind of show". We saw Hughie's flashbacks and triggers after he killed Translucent. Frenchie talked about how he never forgot the first person he killed. Starlight's lack of remorse is a sharp contrast with the way killing had been portrayed previous to that scene.

2. **Starlight has fewer known social relationss outside of the main characters than any other main character besides Black Noir, Homelander, and Maeve.** I'm using the term "social relation" pretty broadly. MM's intro showing him working at the the prison counts. The Deep getting gill-raped count. Off-camera things like Kimiko's terrorist activities count.

With Starlight, the exceptions are her mother and Capes for Christ. And it seems like the latter hate her, or we would have seen more of them. No one is trying to ride her coattails, or even keep in touch, like Popclaw with A-Train.

The one non-familial acquaintance of Starlight's we have been introduced to was Gecko, and that was when Starlight blackmailed him. Which Hughie could have done. But would he? Gecko did absolutely nothing to deserve to be used like that, and no one really put Starlight up to it. It was her idea. And is it just me, or was Gecko's reaction to her blackmailing him less one of shock that his friend would betray him, and more of a look of "...and the other shoe drops".

It's not as if Starlight was homeschooled or anything, either. We know this because when a video of Starlight stopping a rapist went viral, one of her old schoolmates was nice enough to out her as bulimic on social media. In the season finale, she questions Hughie about why he's remained loyal to her for so long as if that's something she isn't used to. When Hughie explains how his mommy issues cause him to stubbornly remain in bad situations, Starlight seems relieved and reassures him that this is perfectly healthy.

Starlight is a person who has a large amount of superficial charisma, but kills with almost no remorse and seems to have very few friends, leave few good impressions, and be a skilled manipulator. I'm sure she convinces herself that she helps the Boys for idealistic reasons. But it seems likely to me that she wouldn't do it except that she feels personally wronged by Vought because of the Compound V, and she's attached to Hughie because he's the only person outside her immediate family who's ever willingly tolerated her for this long. Her work with the Boys also satisfies her sense of adventure and bloodlust in a way that she was hoping the Seven would, but it turned out being in the Seven was more like being a pop singer.I was a little annoyed by how underwhelming Hulk was in this movie. I thought that the Hulk would’ve had a sweet little redemption fight with Thanos... after how quickly he was dismantled in the last movie.  At least one round even... but nothing. 

I think I just realized why.  

The reason Professor Hulk isn’t really seen fighting, is because Banner (who is now driving the Hulk car) never learned how to fight.  


His strength is hardly showcased at all. He held up some rocks... he threw a bench across the state... And he picked up a motorcycle and tossed it aside and that was the extent of Hulk showing his power.

The reason why I think this is, is because Banner never really learned how to fight and he’s always just been a spectator in the Hulk’s beserker show.  Sure, when he was wearing the hulk buster armor, he was piloting something super strong, but that was a suit of armor programmed to react and fight and super enhance wearer ability (even if they are limited).

Savage Hulk was never a skilled fighter himself. He was a berserker who just destroyed everything trying to hurt him or his friends.  His rage fueled all of his punches. During that five years, he became soft and complacent... banner only used his strength only to wow kids, but never knowing how to really use his strength for combat. 

Some of this is evident when they travel back to New York and Banner is off to get the time stone. Cap tells him to wreck some stuff and Banner isn’t really sure what to do... he punches a car... he tosses a motorcycle to the side and just stands there dopey...

Banner doesn’t have rage and isn’t a beserker.  

He should really be working with Clint, Bucky and all of the other hand to hand combatants on how to use his power.Reposted because it was removed for not having the show title.

This is a bit long TL;DR is at the end. Although I would recommend skimming for facts at least.

It's no secret that the other branches have a much higher volume than Scranton branch. In the episode 'The Convention' S3E2 Jim nonchalantly mentions that he's already made 40,000 sales and Dwight, someone who's renowned for their proficiency in sales is taken aback.

Then we skip ahead to 'The Negotiation' and Micheal discusses standards and expectations in pay raises with Darryl. Then we hear that Darryl would like a %10 raise where Michael replies saying "I don't even make this much". How is that? We find out Micheal has worked there for 14 years in which he has not once asked for a raise. When they meet with Jan she dismisses HR(the moral compass) and says she can offer him %12 but he has to ask for %15. Indicating a sense of corruption and favoritism.

We find out in 'Christmas Party' S2E10 that Micheal got a bonus of $3,000 just for "trimming some fat". As well as 'The Surplus' S5E10 there is a $4,300 surplus which could either be spent on a new copier or chairs for the whole office and without much supervision from corporate or HR.

My theory is that while Dunder Mifflin IS a failing business I believe it's being bled like a ~~stuffed~~ stuck pig from the many greedy opportunists. You have people like Josh who leveraged his current position to get a better offer from a competitor, knowing full well not only an entire branch was riding on his back but as was corporate depending on his staying. We have the corporate big wigs who show up in limos, sit around in lounges and indulge, can't even take 'The Convention' seriously. And people like Jan doing God knows what for how long until she got fired. She always seemed a little shady, like you caught her in between something personal.(such as possibly sleeping with her underage assistant).

I believe that while all the other branches were being given raises, utilizing bonus', whether from terminating workers or slashing office budgets, Scranton was being stunted. As some workers were barely getting their cost of living adjustments, I believe the other more business savvy branches would "know their worth" and ask for appropriate wage increases. Especially since the branch manager has not once asked for a raise for 14 years.

Just F.Y.I. $35,000 at an increase of just %10 results in a raise to $38,500. That's just ONE YEAR they were probably saving so much money compared to the other branches.

TL;DR: Scranton was viewed as the most profitable branch because they had SUCHHHH a low overhead. Add the fact that Micheals branch doubled maybe tripled in traffic rolled in with Michael's natural ability to be an amazing manager. Or so we're told. Is Dragon secretly a princess? She has lipstick, eyelashes and just gives off the vibe she was once a princess. She could have been sent away into that tower as Princess Fiona is and was waiting for her true love to save her and become the princess she is meant to be, she could have a curse that left her being transformed into a Dragon and she believes that Donkey is her saviour. She may have the love towards Donkey straight away because he speaks like a human so it may have confused her into thinking Donkey was once also a Prince and that he is the one there to save her, they kiss, she stays a Dragon like Princess Fiona stays a Ogre.Spoilers Obviously.

I've just finished the season today and something that caught me was after El was attacked by the Mindflayers tentacle(?) and latched on to her leg. 


Once it's off and the kids get away and to somewhat safety there's a focus put on El's blood and later on Billy comes around to it not to mention the piece of the Mindflayer that embeds itself in her leg only to be ripped out, reabsorbed into the Mindflayer and thenfor us to see el has lost her powers. 

We've seen that the Mindflayer can manipulate the biomass of people it has infected, we've also seen that it can activate and deactivate people like sleeper agents and manipulate them.

My theory has two parts:

1. The piece of the Mindflayer that was embedded in El's leg and reabsorbed also took some of her blood/flesh/dna/whatever with it and the Mindflayer will try to replicate El's ability which will then allow it to manipulate the gate the same way El has been shown to do in seasons 1 and 2.

2. There's still some of the Mindflayer's infection inside of El actively blocking her from using her ability and awaiting for the influence of the Mindflayer to come back so it can spread through her and join El with itself.When Fury is talking to the council, they leapt to the conclusion that the best way to close the portal and end the invasion was to nuke New York, without any evidence that it would work or seeking information from the people on the ground. They had deployed only a few ground troops and zero air support, and really the only forces that engaged the invaders were the Avengers. So why did the council opt to nuke Manhattan rather than try anything else? Because there being run by Hydra.

Nuking Manhattan would kill Stark, Black Widow, and Hawkeye for sure. Hulk would certainly make it, Thor probably, and Cap maybe, but losing Tony's funding and inventions would be devastating, not to mention his leadership. Thor would get pissed and probably sever ties. Eliminating Clint and Natasha would pave the way for Crossbones to take over as the top SHIELD agent. Plus, the nuke would eliminate several of the threats identified by Zola's algorithm in Winter Soldier, like Stephen Strange. I also believe the media push to blame the cause of the invasion on the Avengers was engineered by Hydra, and likely would have been successful if the nuke had gone off where it was intended. It's even possible Hydra believed the Avengers were going to pull it off (the battle *had* started to turn in their favor), and they needed an out.

Finally, the council somehow had a back channel to get 2 jets carrying nukes in the air while on SHIELD's helicarrier. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that they'd have a plan in place to go around Fury that way (using someone in Hill's position to take over is far more likely). With Fury ignoring the order, they just reached out through the Hydra network to make it happen for the sake of expedience. 

TL;DR - "The Council" in the first Avengers movie is run by Hydra, and the decision to nuke NY was made to kill some of the Avengers, end the team, and kill off other key threats like Dr. Strange.


*Edit for science:*
Appreciate all the responses. There seems to be some resistance to the idea that Cap has a better chance of surviving than Tony Stark does, so let me explain.

First, the temperature of a nuclear blast reaches 100 million degrees Celsius, and the initial fireball would basically encompass the island of Manhattan. If he somehow survived that, the radiation pulse would knock out his suit's electronics, permanently blind him, and oh yeah, all the oxygen is sucked out of the air from the blast, so he'd suffocate. Not that he'd still be alive at that point, because the heat of the fireball would either vaporize him, or if he was able to get inside a strong structure, it would likely just melt his suit around him and cook him inside it.

I do see a set of circumstances where Cap could make it, but they're pretty slim odds. He's not like Wolverine or Deadpool when it comes to healing powers, but he can make it back after being killed. If he had cover, it's possible he could escape being completely destroyed and his body could heal itself, if he got immediate medical attention.When Marty returns to 1985 in the first movie, he finds that his father has grown a spine and become successful, his brother has an office job instead of working in fast food, and his sister is *very* popular with men instead of fruitlessly pining away. I imagine that these outward changes reflect some inward changes each character experienced due to the now “improved” timeline. I think it’s quite plausible that somehow Marty was also affected by the change and this explains his aversion to being seen as cowardly. 

I never noticed before, mostly because Marty doesn’t have much characterization in the first movie, but he starts off the series as somewhat of a coward. After Jennifer suggests he send his demo in to a record company, he expresses how afraid of rejection he is. Even he notices how much like his father he sounds like. I guess my point here is that he doesn’t seem overly concerned that anyone thinks he’s a coward at this point. 

The first instance of him being goaded into a stupid fight by being called a chicken happens immediately in the second film, mere minutes (to him) after fixing his past. Then his entire cycle of character development for the remainder of the trilogy is about him trying to overcome the flaw where he fights people just for calling him chicken. Arguably, most of the suspense of the third movie could’ve been avoided if it weren’t for this flaw. So the point here is that he’s suddenly, apparently, incredibly concerned that no one thinks he’s a coward. 

Now, it isn’t unheard of that someone who is cowardly doesn’t want anyone to think they’re cowardly. But maybe, due to Marty’s antics in 1955 causing George to be a man who stands up for himself, Marty would’ve grown up with a stronger role model (even if he doesn’t remember the new George).  Now, post time travel Marty doesn’t seem to have a memory of growing up in the new household, and it seems to be canon that time-travelers’ memories aren’t changed even if the timeline is changed around them. But maybe Marty could still be affected by the fact that he *would’ve* grown up with a strong George even if he only remembers the weak George. 

I just think a week (to him) is a bit quick to go from “I just don’t think I could handle that rejection” to “Nobody calls me chicken.”

TL;DR
Due to the events of the first movie, Marty *would’ve* grown up with his dad being a strong male role-model (who’s not afraid to fight for what’s right), and maybe this is why he fights everyone who calls him chicken.First we have to go back a bit and look at the timeline of the last 100 or so years in Star Wars. 

We learn in the books that before the events of Episode One there was a huge battle between the Jedi and the Mandolorians, which the Jedi won decisively. One of the few survivors was Jango Fett, who now has a reputation of not only hating the Jedi, but being able to kill them with his hands. This reputation is what draws Palpatine to using him as not only the DNA base for the clones, but in charge of the training as well. Jango brings in multiple other trainers as well, most of them being Mandolorian. This leads to a huge culture bleed from the Mandolorians to the clone troopers. 

Skip forward to Episode 3 and the events of Order 66. During the chaos, many clone troopers desert the army, fed up of being slave soldiers with no more value placed on their lives than droids. Many of these deserters flee to the only culture they know and can easily fit into, Manalorian. One notable group of clones is able to desert with not only an obscene amount of money, but the ability to keep track of the Empire's movements.

Again, drawing from the novels, we see Palpatine begining to stockpile Beskar steel. Beskar is notable for being strong, light, durable, and most importantly Force resistant. Palpatine's greatest threat is other force users, which is why he sends Vader to hunt them down. His other threat is people adept at fighting force users i.e. the Mandolorians. Part of my theory here, is once Palpatine gets the Beskar he needs, he begins to purge the only people with both the knowledge to work the metal and the ability to fight him. More specifically those Mandolorians that are smiths. This is why after the purge, regular Mandolorians are able to operate as bounty hunters. This is also why the Mandolorian enclave is hidden, they're not hiding their numbers or presence, they're hiding the forge. 

Now going back a bit, which group of Mandolorians would be best suited to survive this purge? The highly trained ex-special forces with a large cash reserve and imitate knowledge of the Empire's plans. Now in order to stay safe, these former clone troopers can never take their helmets off, since they have an easily identifiable face. It becomes part of their survival instinct. It becomes such a mantra to them, to always keep their helmet on, that they pass it down to the next generation, which passes it on  to the one after that. In time it loses it's original purpose of a simple survival technique, but gains an almost mystical aspect of their culture. This explains why during the Clone Wars, we see Mandolorians having no issue taking their helmets off, but it's now a deeply ingrained part of their culture.In the movie Ratatouille, there is a German sous-chef named Horst. Apparently he did time in prison but nobody knows why because he changes the story every time. Another chef in the restaurant, Larousse, is said to have been a gun runner for the "resistance" before he lost. Based on the background clue from the movie, it can be assumed that it takes place in France in the late 1940's to 1950's. Horst was a German commander in WWII who was arrested in the Nuremberg trialsIf thanos cut all living populations in half, humanity would repopulate in under 200 years, assuming of course our planet didn't suffer a massive ecological collapse due to the extinction of eusocial organisms like bees that depend on their numbers.  Yet thanos adamantly thinks culling a population like a herd of deer will solve all their problems.  

Interestingly, our own species outlived stronger and more intimidating relatives like neanderthals with their bruce lee esque strength, denisovans with their big robust skeletons and barrel chests, and god knows what else that didn't make it into the fossil record.  (We even have fossils of some genetic mutant race split from our own species, called boskop men, who apparently had bigger, smarter brains, and a short run of survival in south-central africa)

As far as we know, we survived by adopting some kind of weird almost-r-strategist survival tactic.  

Our bodies are disproportinately weak and cheap to grow for a species our size, we can subsist on nearly anything, we quickly metabolize fat, and our incredibly slow growing young force us to band together en masse, unlike the neanderthals who reached maturity at 15.

Ancient pre neolithic structures like gobekli tepe even suggest that we had absolutely obscene and competent populations long before the time we believe the agricultural revolution to have occurred in.

I suggest thanos's species evolved for the **exact opposite** niche.  Extreme k strategy, impossible feats of individual strength and survivability, and as a result, a titan population needs an unimaginable amount of calories to survive.

While humans define the progression of hamlet to village to town to city by the logistic concerns that naturally arise from growing population, the titans were able to flourish with small numbers alone, and erect structures with far less need for factory machinery and tools.  Their strength cut countless steps of production in nearly every area. They never adapted to see the social threats to survival that could be provided by fellow sapient creatures because they didn't survive their first major population boom.The film gives little details about how Westley developed his immunity, only saying he built it up over the course of a few years. But how? Well it's pretty easy, as The Dread Pirate Roberts took Westley under his wing, he began testing Wesley by poisoning his food with Iocane Powder gradually enhancing the amount he puts in, hence why every night before going to bed he would tell Westley "Good Job Westley, I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Repeating it everyday for three years because it seemed likely that the next dose of Iocane might be too much and kill Westley. After three years Westley's immunity grew and persisted, Roberts decided that his friend was ready to take over the role of the Dread Pirate Roberts, seeing his devotion to true love and his strength from withstanding the effects of Iocane Powder, making him a suitable candidate to replace him as Roberts.

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT #2: 3 yearsFor context,All Speak is a Marvel thing that lets you understand every language because you speak with your heart instead of your tongue.

In the MCU we only heard the Hulk say one thing before Ragnarok and that was “Puny God” which he said to Loki. Later on when Hulk is on Sakaar,a world full of other giant gladiator guys just like him,he makes friends with one little lady,who just happens to be an Asgaurdian. In Infinity War when the Gaurdians ask Thor why he can understand Groot and he said it was an elective in his education. I don’t think the Asgaurdians would teach an entire curriculum around the language of one race,so that class was most likely all speak. It explains why Hulk opened up to Thor in his room about how he felt,because he was speaking with his heart

Edit: Okay so let’s just say that Asgaurdians understand him the best and he can at most grunt a couple words.I haven't seen Next Level, so I'm not sure if this applies to that movie. In both the original movie and Welcome to the Jungle, though, I've noticed some elements that seem to align with stories of worshiping and making pacts with ancient gods.

The only way to finish the game and exit its spell is to complete a quest *and call its name*. In both movies, this is presented as the critical step -- and by implication the whole point of the exercise. The game wants its named to be called out by one who has proven himself worthy.

The process of proving oneself worthy involves personal sacrifice, beyond simply following a set of instructions. In Alan's case, this was indirect in the form of losing his youth and his parents, while the second gang saw a more direct sacrifice as Bethany willingly gave up one of her lives for helicopter guy. The game wants to be sacrificed to in some manner.

Beyond this, the game appears to entice each player to willingly embark on a quest in its name, and offers boons of various sorts in return for game play (worship) -- Alan Parrish repairs his relationship with his father and marries Sarah, Judy and Peter get their parents back, helicopter guy appears to have a good life, and the 2017 gang seem better off.

Drawing on this and a bit of the mythology of American Gods, my conjecture is that an ancient trickster god like Anansi has found a way to survive through worship into the present day by appearing as a game to unwitting players.So in Infinity War, we see Titan not destroyed, but a lifeless husk of a planet, and Thanos has his whole spiel about he 'ignored his destiny once before', and how he's tasted defeat and 'destiny still arrives'...what if he was talking about Galactus?

What if our favourite thicc purple daddy has seen Galactus devour the *life* from worlds? And, Thanos, instead of doubling the resources, removes life by 50% across the universe to starve Big G? As vengeance for Titan, and really does back up his claim albiet, in his own head that he's committing a mercy?

I would watch the fuck out of a Thanos movie/Disney+ show where he is the hero facing a Herald and trying to defeat Galactus at all costs and goes on a full Anakin Skywalker level trajectory from hero to tragic villain, plus it would be a kick ass way to introduce Galactus to the MCU.

What's your guys thoughts?I saw the front page TIL about Stephan Fry knowing the truth behind 42 in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I am 95% sure it is this, I am not bullshitting you.

ASCII 42

In programming, an asterisk is commonly used as a sort of "whatever you want it to be" symbol, I've heard it called a wildcard. 

ASCII language, the original way that computers run, the most basic computer software, in it, 42 is the designation for asterisk. The GIANT COMPUTER was asked what the true meaning was. It answered as a computer would.

Anything you want it to be.

EDIT- FUCK. Someone not only had the same idea, but posted it on this sub. I have so much egg on my face right now that you could smack me in the face with a frying pan and call me an omelet. http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/19botr/the_meaning_of_life_the_universe_and_everything/ I am now apparently a bundle of sticks. God. Dammit. I felt so proud of myself...In the Marvel Cinematic Universe we see several alien species that are pretty much just humans we different skin colors, we see blue people, green, yellow and pink. My theory is that those aliens are just humans that have being abducted by other aliens since ancient times.

But why are they colorful? Well do you know why there are black people and white people in our planet? Because of the sun, hundreds of thousands of years ago every Homo Sapiens had a dark skin because we all lived in Africa and it was essential to protect us against the sun, when humans migrated North to Europe and Asia where the sun is not as strong, natural selection selected lighter skins because it facilitates absorption of vitamin D. So I think the same process happened to the humans that were brought to other solar systems, so they developed new skin colors to filter different types of radiation from different stars.

My evidence for it is that John C. Riley character in Guardians of The Galaxy, in the end of the movie it shows that he have a wife (that is yellow I think) and they have a perfect normal daughter, if they can reproduce they are from the same species.

Although I do not think aliens like Thanos or the Asgardians are humans. Maybe the Asgardians made humans? That is another theory though.People are backwards about this: This isn't about different stories adapted to the same heroic character. This is a story about a particular, specific event, that powerful communities insert themselves into, in order to further their own agenda. And the basic story is Max and a crazy Road battle- that resulted in a winning side. Everything else is a fairy tale. It's an amalgamation of a tale of basic survival- a chase in which "Max," an outsider, saves the day, but isn't there to celebrate the victory. (In reality, if there ever was a Max, he probably died).


*    Mad Max is the most scaled down story. It involves a crumbling world, a man who experiences sacrifice and tragedy, and seeks revenge. Big car chases and "the road" are basic themes- along with Max, and his revenge. Ends in him wondering into the wasteland. The origin story. Probably akin to Mathew. It gives an apologetic beginning. Rightly placed at the beginning.

*    Road Warrior is the most basic Max story. And if Max were a real person (in the minds of post-apocalyptic apologists) this is the quintessential story. Max and another flexible archetype, "the pilot," come across a group of survivors. He's a desert wanderer, and he saves the day. He was used, but people still tell stories about him. Mark, the earliest story.

*    Beyond Thunderdome. Pure Bartertown propaganda. The chase is important, but the real story is about how Auntie solidified her reign with the reluctant help of Max. She even showed him mercy, along the way. This Gospel of Max also incorporates "the pilot," though he takes on a different role. John. It even throws in tie-it-together mythos about "the children." (presumably another favorite myth of the era, "what ever happened to the children?")

*   Furry Road has a Luke vibe. Gives a brief, and vague origin story. But then goes straight into the action. It ties the story up with a familiar trope, that being, "Max helped to build this tribe, then vanished."


Same event is Max, a Road Warrior helping the tribe. And then vanishes. 
Same story, different points of view.

The only thing that actually *probably* happened was an epic and dramatic road chase- where a Road Warrior was a key part- a social and moral icon about struggle, and outside helpers. And that character survived and evolved.I just finished rewatching IW and then I realized Tony would have to tell aunt May that Peter's gone and he's failed to protect him, and during the first few minutes of Endgame, when he returned to earth the first thing he says is that "he lost the kid", he's probably imagined during his time in space on how he's gonna break the news to aunt May and it weighed so heavily in his mind that its the first thing he says to his wifeThis is a question that has become the source of many jokes and a large amount of fan speculation. Why is it that Doc Brown has befriended a teenager when the two seemingly have no connection?

Doc Brown first came up with the idea of how to achieve time travel in the year 1955 when he postulated the idea of the flux capacitor. It took him 30 years from this time to actually build his working time machine and begin his tests. Over the three decade span, he prepared in numerous ways such as gathering money from various eras, gathering the materials needed for his time machine, and seemingly studying time travel itself and its implications.

He would have realized that the flux capacitor would send itself through time but not through space so the only form of travel would be limited to whatever held the device itself. To begin his experiments, it would then be logical to stay within the area of Hill Valley. This would allow him to easily return to his "safe harbor" of 1985 and measure if anything he did in the past had altered the future. No matter how much he would try to avoid disrupting the timeline, the butterfly effect would still be in place though there is no way to know for sure exactly how much of an effect that this could have on the timeline. Now that he had one constant -his homebase/1985- he needed someone with a wider perspective. Someone whose family had been in Hill Valley from the beginning.

Studying the history of the town, he would have found a few families as options. The Tannens had been in the area since the beginning, for example. However, Mad Dog Tannen was infamous in the 1800s. Throughout history, his family also had a pattern of being bullies with an entourage. This means that they have always been too well known; if a small change happened in the Tannen timeline, it could have large, rippling effects on history. Looking at the Tannen family in the 1980's, there was only one Tannen that was an option - a middle-aged, alcoholic bully. This threw out that option.

Another option was the Stricklands. In the 1800's the Stricklands were Sheriffs and throughout their timeline were always in positions of authority. This would also cause the issue of affecting the timeline in large ways even with minor changes. In the 1980's, the only Strickland we see is a middle-aged Principal and thus has an affect on the lives of most of the town. This would toss out that family. 

Then we have the McFlys. Around since the beginning of Hill Valley, this family seemingly has no large contribution to its history - mediocre from beginning to the present. Small variances to this family's history would cause no large, sweeping changes to the timeline. Looking at the family in the 1980's, you have an average American family not making any ripples. The older brother works at a fast food restaurant, the sister seems vain, one parent a pushover and the other an alcoholic, then there is the youngest son - a boy with ambition who dreams big and is only held back by the family in which he was raised. He dreams big, has an open mind, and is more intelligent than he lets on. This is the perfect person for Doc to keep as his "constant" in 1985. 

Any small changes that occur throughout Hill Valley history, Doc can simply check the changes to Marty. The McFlys were always around and would be influenced by the town but never did any influencing of their own. If there is a change in Marty, Doc can trace back the McFly timeline and see what he accidentally did to affect the timeline.

Doc Brown, however, did not anticipate being gunned down prior to his first attempt at time travel which caused Marty to be the one to take the trip instead - unwittingly giving Doc the exact information he sought about time travel but by different means than he expected and, of course, saving his life.Why would the Hogwarts staff protect the Sorcerer’s Stone behind a door openable by a spell taught to first-year students? The answer: Duh, they wouldn’t.

Some Harry Potter cynics are quick to deride “Alohomora” unlocking the door on the third floor as evidence of the ineptitude of Hogwarts’ staff, or the inferiority of JK Rowling’s writing. But there’s a more elegant alternative: We don’t actually *know* that Alohomora is a common spell, we just \**think*\* it’s a common spell.

Why do we \*think\* that? A) Because of the [primacy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Primacy_effect), a cognitive bias where people tend to more easily recall information presented first in a series. And B) because in the first book, “Alohomora” is used casually by a 10-year old.

It may feel like Alohomora was cast a bunch in Book 1 — it’s one of the very first spells seen in the series — but in fact, there’s only two mentions of the word “Alohomora” in *HP&tSS*.

First, when the gang accidentally unlocks the off-limits door on the third floor:

>Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves' shouts. "Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, '**Alohomora**!’" The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

Second, when the gang tries to use the spell to exit the trial room with the flying keys: ^((1))

>\[Harry\] expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when **Hermione tried her Alohomora** charm. "Now what?" said Ron. "These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? "They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're keys!

Hermione is not just any 10-year old: She’s a brilliant wizard who just spent the prior summer reading any spellbook she (as an unguided muggle) could get her hands on, and she exhausts her spare time in the off-limits section of the Hogwarts library poring for info about Nicolas Flamel. ^((2)) She’s the only student who successfully casts the charm — “her” charm, in fact, per the second quote. ^((3)) Alohomora is *never* seen being taught or used in a classroom setting. ^((4))

And considering the [HP Wiki’s list](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Unlocking_Charm#cite_ref-WU_6-0) of the known uses of the unlocking charm: Why would the Hogwarts staff hide the Sorcerer’s Stone, why would Flitwick imprison Sirius Black (in Year 3), and why would Lily and James Potter hide from Voldemort, all behind doors that could be unlocked by pretty much any kid with a wand? Why would a school teach its youngest, most impressionable students how to pick locks?

Well, it’s because they *wouldn’t*. Our cognitive biases led us readers to believe that Alohomora is commonplace; there’s nothing in the text to prove it.

In reality, the Sorcerer’s Stone was pretty well-guarded. One uniquely talented wizard just happened to learn an advanced & probably illegal spell, and she got away with casting it twice.

&#x200B;

/// Footnotes ///

    (1) Note that Alohomora wasn't used the second time the gang approaches the forbidden door on the third floor — they arrived to find the door already opened
    (Also, if you doubt that there’s only two instances of "Alohomora" in Year 1: Find a .pdf of the book and CTL+F for it)
    
    (2) We know the tomes in the Hogwarts library are occasionally filled with obscure, banned, and dangerous spells, as was the case when Harry learned “Sectumsempra” from a used textbook in his 6th year
    
    (3) A Death Eater successfully casts Alohomora once in Year 5 to unlock the Time Room, but Death Eaters are advanced wizards who liberally employ a host of other dangerous and illegal spells
    
    Harry attempts the charm once in Year 6 but fails, presumably because of an overriding Dumbledore spell, but also possibly because Hermione’s a superior witch
    
    (4) The Harry Potter fan wiki (http://bit.ly/34rwUiB) suggests that Alohomora is in the Standard Book of Spells, Year 1… but that comes from the video game, which is probably (http://bit.ly/2rdKIiF) not canon (http://bit.ly/2NfkSDb) since a) it’s a licensed work and JK Rowling was minimally involved, b) many of the game’s plot details conflict with that of the book, and c) this (http://bit.ly/34nEoDg) is probably not what wizarding textbooks look likeIn the episode "Insane in the Mainframe", Fry is mistaken for a robot and sent to the HAL Institute for Criminal Insane Robots. When the rest of the Planet Express visits, Fry says he would have starved if it weren't for the Sick Vending Machine Robot, which then burps up a Bachelor Chow bar for him to eat.

Why is the Vending Machine Robot there? What's wrong with it? Well the most visible problem is that it is giving out  items for free, which is contrary to the purpose of a vending machine. If this were simply a mechanical problem, it seems like it'd be an easy fix. But this is a psychiatric hospital, so the problem must go deeper. The Vending Machine is too nice. It deliberately gives out its food for free, not waiting for money. Note the convenient  timing of it burping out the snack, immediately after Fry mentioned it. As if on cue. My theory is that the machine was considered insane because it gave out food for free, and this intention is also what saved Fry.(Someone in the comments of another post gave me the inspiration for this).

As we know, Dr Strange will appear in No Way Home, and Spider-Man will appear in Dr Strange 2. Sony has also said that NWH will further lay out their own universe.

I think that at the end of NWH, Peter will be stranded in another universe, and Strange will lose the connection, closing the gateway. Dr Strange 2 pick up shortly after this, and  will be about him and Scarlet Witch doing a multiversal road trip to save Peter. When they do, a year or two may have passed for him.

During this time, Sony can use Holland's Spider-Man in their own films, concluding with Clone Saga: Peter is cloned just before he goes back home, and can therefore exist in both universes at once. This is also a chance for Peter to have developed his own suit without Stark tech, pleasing the fans with a comic accurate suit. He comes back to the MCU, having become more independent, and can resume his life ready for college and with new skills and development.In the trailer for Joker, we see that Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker is not only influenced by his day to day struggles, but also has something to do with Thomas Wayne. Since we know that Thomas is running for mayor of Gotham and that he's not as "sympathetic" as other incarnations, I think we'll see Joker specifically target the Wayne family for attempting to mislead the public and convince them of their humanitarian characteristics. 

First, Joker will create unrest as he consistently exposes Wayne's dark and selfish side to the public, gathering followers of disenfranchised Gothamites as he does so. 

Second, he will harass the Wayne family by targeting their son, Bruce (as we see in the trailer, Arthur reaches through the gates of what is possibly Wayne Manor to interact with a child) and this will prompt retaliation from Thomas who disregards his public persona and uses his wealth and influence to begin targeting the Joker. 

Third, the final confrontation between the Joker and Thomas Wayne will end with the Joker baiting him into a pursuit and assassinating both him and his wife, leaving Bruce an orphan. 

I don't believe we'll see Batman, but the seeds planted for his creation mirroring the murder of Bruce's parents at the hands of the Joker in the 1989 Burton film. There's been a longstanding question in the Mario fandom: why do we allow a tyrant who attempts to overthrow our kingdom to join in with our kart-racing tournaments?  

I think there's a few valid answers here.  
For starters, I don't think anyone takes Bowser very seriously. Bowser doesn't kill and is generally seen as harmless by most. Occasionally he busts out a big scheme like Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Galaxy or Super Mario Odyssey, but for the most part Bowser plays it fairly cool.  

I believe Mario and Bowser aren't Batman and Joker, but more along the lines of Flash and Captain Cold. Friendly rivals who occasionally get serious.  
However, I don't think Bowser sees it this way. Bowser's got an ego. He thinks he's a danger to the world, but he's more of a giant teddybear.  

So if Bowser believes he is a grade-A final boss level villain (something he has reminded us of in Super Mario RPG, where he is clearly jealous of the game's main villain), why does he join these fun games?  
To beat Mario.  
He wants to beat Mario, even if he has to play kart against him. He just wants to be the best.

This is the reason why the RPG games tend to introduce new villains for Mario to fight.  
If Super Mario Bros. is The Flash Vs. Captain Cold, then Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is when Reverse Flash shows up. The stakes are now very real and there's more at stake than just a fiery rivalry.

This has been me rambling about Bowser. Thanks for reading.

TL;D I believe Bowser is not so much an A-list villain, but rather a rival of Mario's. The RPG games show what happens when a dangerous villain does come to the Mushroom KingdomIn Back to the Future, there were [pictures on Doc's mantle of Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein](https://i.imgur.com/FFjxWaQ.png). 

Doc had been thinking about time travel for years prior to 1955. He knew that if he were to ever invent a time machine, he would be tempted to go back and meet these 4 people. He also realized that doing so would carry a risk of doing something which changed those people. These changes would be reflected in the pictures. Remember, as soon as Doc saw the picture of Marty's siblings changing, he knew why. This is because Doc had already been thinking about how time travel would work. The phenomenon of "perceptible picture-changing" was already in his mind.

So Doc keeps those 4 pictures on the mantle as a track to see if his future self had invented time travel, gone back to meet them and done something to change them. They need to be placed in a very visible spot so he can easily keep an eye on them.... and Betty DEFINITELY had sex in Prague. After the events with the Fire Elemental, when we seen them back in the hotel, Ned is in a  bathrobe and Betty signals for him to come to her room.

It makes sense considering they had just gone through a life-threatening event (as is cliche in many movies) so they decide to have sex afterward. 

However, it’s likely that they didn’t have any sexual chemistry, or more likely it was just plain bad (which, if it’s their first times, no duh) and they break up shortly afterward because of it. 

I guess Ned really did become a man on the trip.We know that Ben has a fetish for women in skates (Season 6, Episode 6, "Filibuster"). In that episode, it seems as though Ben's fetish is just for roller skates. 

However, my theory is that it used to be for all kinds of skates, which is why he was so devoted to Ice Town, but after his fetish caused the the city to go bankrupt and his impeachment, ice skates don't do it for him anymore. I'd love to know if I'm alone on this one, but here I wasn't sure what everyone else's opinions are on this point.  

Fan Theories, in my opinion, should be speculation about a completed work.  Examples would be:

* Jar Jar Binks is a Sith
* Andy's Mom from Toy Story is Emily, Jessie's original owner
* Some subset of Disney Princess movies take place in a shared universe

This allows people to discuss details of the media that they've already seen, and dissect what they've seen and ask really thoughtful, interesting, and entertaining questions.  

Every day, it seems, the bulk of the top posts on this sub are:  

* My theory for how Game of Thrones will End 
* My theory for how Avengers will end
* My theory for how Star Wars will end

Many of these are very insightful, thoughtful, well-written, but I don't feel like that's what this sub is for.  "Guess the ending" is different from theorizing about minor details in a movie (or other media), or a theory about something that was intended by the author/creator but not explicitly stated on-screen/page.Swanson mentions quite a few times that he has buried treasure somewhere in Pawnee. You find out later that its buried under a tree in a park (at least some of it).

The only reason he's working a government job is to make sure nobody digs in that park with his hidden treasure! Anyone wanting to plant a tree or dig at all has to ask permission from the Parks Department, which Ron runs.

Sorry if this has been posted before but i just realized how smart Ron is, he protects his investments even though he hates his government job!For those that don't know, Donald Duck is considered to be the most powerful magic user and character in the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy metaverse because he is the only one known to be able to cast a spell called "Zettaflare", which is currently the highest known tier of the Flare spell. To put that into context, weaker versions of the Flare spell like Gigaflare are usually reserved for end game bosses and certain summons, while Teraflare is exclusive to the most powerful versions of Bahamut (an actual god) and [is the spell Bahamut used in the amazing "End of an Era" trailer](<https://youtu.be/39j5v8jlndM>).  Despite how crazy that spell is, Zettaflare is still a *billion* times more powerful.

Now with that bit of background info dealt with, onto my fan theory.

In the KH/FF metaverse there exists a status effect that completely negates most magic users' abilities. That status effect is known as Silence and as the name suggests it makes those magic users afflicted with it mute and thus unable to cast any magic until the appropriate antidote is applied. We can very easily assume that speech is vitally important to a magic user's ability to cast spells and in fact [Final Fantasy 12 even confirms this in its description of Silence](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Silence_\(status\)#Final_Fantasy_XII):

>The character's voice is lost, preventing the casting of magicks. 

Alrighty, so a user's ability to speak is vital to their ability to cast magic, what does this have to do with Donald Duck? Easy, [have you ever *heard* Donald Duck speak](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/340871252505919499/797400047800942602/donald_what.ogg>)? His speech impediment makes him very hard to understand at times and at other times is so close to nonsense that it boarders on being the same as the silence status effect, yet despite that he is still the single most powerful magic user in the KH/FF metaverse.

If he could speak normally and clearly Donald Duck could probably rewrite the fabric of existence if he wanted to.Many people have noted the (seemingly) absolute insanity of sending your child to Hogwarts. One wrong syllable, wand flick, or ingredient and they might explode. Indeed nearly everything they do could very easily kill them. Or so it seems. 

Why would wizards send their kids to a deathtrap? And why aren't there more deaths? Granted there are some, but I'll get to that. 

My theory is that Hogwarts, and probably all wizarding schools and possibly some other establishments, have "nerf" charms that ensure no one can die or be seriously (i.e., irreparably) injured while on the grounds. 

This explains so many things. I'll just do one. Quidditch is a deadly game that no one would ever play, and yet school kids are out doing it. They mention that "no one's died in years" which is either just a joke or a reference to a pre-nerf school, perhaps before Dumbledore. There are many, MANY, more that I'm sure everyone can think of on their own. But it is clear that in general all the students face many situations in which you would die, even if you were a wizard. And yet (almost) no one ever does. 

BUT you might ask, why does everyone act like there is danger? Including the adults? I think the teachers, students, and general public do not know about the charm specifically. Dumbledore acts the least afraid in most situations, and this is possibly because he cast the original spell or because he is most aware of it as headmaster. Indeed, any real death before the final book happened before Dumbledore. However, there are occasional times when something is more powerful than the spell and even Dumbledore gets concerned.

Explanations for real deaths or real fear of deaths

- The Chamber of Secrets exists "outside" of Hogwarts in the sense that Dumbledore is not aware of the location and it is isolated from the rest of the school.  However, when the basilisk moves into the school proper everyone it looks at is "magically" saved by a reflection. 

- A child died the last time it was opened, but again this was pre-Dumbledore (or if the spell has always been there then it is because the Chamber is outside the spell range). 

- The Room of Requirement might also be outside the spell range, which is why people could sneak in through Draco's gateweay. Also why the students who practiced there got so much better, because it was real. And possibly why people die there in the end, though that could be for another reason (see below).

- Fake Moody uses Avada Kedavra on a spider and kills it. Presumably the charm does not affect animals, and indeed other animals have died. Probably lots given that they eat meat all the time. 

- The Triwizard Tournament is so dangerous because the headmaster agrees to remove the charm from those competing. This is why it was banned, and why such a big deal is made about how people are selected and how the contract is unbreakable. 

- The Ministry of Magic building likely has a similar charm, which is why people work and do research there. This is why Voldemort and Dumbledore don't just outright kill each other. And why no one dies except Sirius and even that is only through an ancient powerful artifact which WAS NEVER CONFIRMED TO KILL HIM BY THE WAY, THAT ALWAYS BOTHERED ME. Like, wasn't that perfect foreshadowing for him coming back or going to another realm or something? Honestly that was a missed opportunity. Anyway, houses might have a similar, albeit much weaker, charm. 

- This is why most wizards are terrible at real-world magic (as noted by the Weasley twins). They've only practiced in a super safe environment, and don't know how to conduct themselves with no safety net. The deadliest and strongest wizards are the ones who've practiced most outside of "official" areas. The spell is subtle, it doesn't just put a bubble around you or something, it always creates plausible "lucky" scenarios where an event or another person saves you. So, having spent years like this, most wizards think they are pretty good until they try something without the training wheels.  

- Similarly when Harry falls in Quidditch he just happens to do so right in the middle of the pitch so that someone can save him. In almost all cases the charm helps by controlling events to save you in a plausible way, either through friends or lucky breaks. 

- The spell is not perfect. Anything in large numbers can overwhelm it, at least temporarily. This is why Dumbledore drives all the Dementors away, and probably why he allowed them in (before realizing that they would overwhelm the spell). 

- At the Battle of Hogwarts people die, but again this is because tons of people are attacking at once. In a sense this is visualized by the Death Eaters shooting down the force field around the school, breaking or effectively disabling the charm. And the charm was likely weak at this point, though not gone, after the death of Dumbledore (again, either he cast the charm or it follows the will of the headmaster). 

- Most importantly, Voldemort tries to use the killing curse on Harry AFTER the battle is over. With only 1 person causing harm, the spell is effective again and was able to prevent Harry from dying. Voldemort dies but he was basically already dead, and because the charm saw him as a threat and eliminated him. I don't think anyone would die from expelliarmus alone. (And we actually saw the same thing happen before, with Dobby "magically" saving Harry from the killing curse; Lucius didn't actually finish casting it, so the countermeasure wasn't as strong, but the threat was eliminated). 

Did Voldemort know about the charm? I think so. This is why he worked the way he did, in the shadows recruiting followers. He can't just go kill everyone because the nerf charm is just too powerful. Why not just have every Death Eater try to kill Harry at school? You know where he sleeps. But the charm is too powerful. At the very least he found out after the first book. 

But he probably knew or had some idea before that. He kept horcruxes at Hogwarts because he knew it was safe and they wouldn't draw attention by killing people. He knew enough about "institutional" magic that he cursed the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Where do you think he got that idea? But, in his arrogance he assumed he had destroyed the charm and could kill Harry. 

I doubt anyone else knew, except for the general awareness that Hogwarts was safe.[SPOILERS]

*The Big Lebowski* sure is a strange film, right? It's got all the elements of a great absurdist comedy: a narrator who talks to the protagonist and breaks the fourth wall, [a film within a film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHAGbD3dlhE), an intricate plot that revolves around a nonexistent mystery, and more quirky characters than you can shake a stick at.

The characters in the film are all the more memorable for the fact that they all seem to have blundered onto the set from different movies. In no particular order, we have:

* An aging hippy who gets roped into a ransom negotiation.
* A hot-tempered, gun-toting Vietnam veteran.
* An egotistical billionaire philanthropist with a dark secret.
* A sexy artist who behaves like a classic *noir* femme fatale.
* A cowboy.
* A seductive part-time pornstar.
* A sociopathic pederast bowling champion.
* A trio of lovably psychotic pop musicians who believe in nothing.
* A painfully ordinary man who just wants to go bowling with his friends.

Notice anything off about that last one?

First off, let's get one thing out of the way: the Coen Brothers clearly get a kick out of blurring the line between reality and fiction in this movie. Like I said, we have the very meta use of a Narrator who addresses the audience *and* the other characters, we have the protagonist imagining himself as the protagonist of a completely separate movie (complete with another set of opening credits), a fictional writer (Arthur Digby Sellers) of a real TV series (*Branded*), and a fictional porn film (*Logjammin'*) that plays in-universe.

For another thing, they're also clearly amused by the idea of setting up a complex plot that ultimately turns out to be a string of random coincidences and wacky misunderstandings. In true absurdist fashion, the ultimate twist of the movie is that **there is no twist**.

*The Big Lebowski* is what happens when a group of characters all become aware of their own roles in a story that doesn't have a coherent plot, conflict or resolution. All of them are desperate to keep the story going, but they all have very different ideas about what kind of movie they're *really* in—and they're all adamantly convinced that they should be the focus of the movie.

The Dude believes that he's the freedom-loving hero of an *Easy Rider*-type counterculture film, unaware that the audience is too busy laughing at him to cheer him on. Walter believes that he's the protagonist of a serious drama about traumatized veterans, unaware of how hilarious his rants about Vietnam really are. Jeffrey and Maude both believe that they're in a *noir* film (Jeffrey as a villain, Maude as a femme fatale love interest). Bunny believes that she's in a porn film. The Nihilists believe that they're the protagonists of a Tarantino-esque crime drama where the bad guys are the stars. The Stranger adamantly believes that he's in a Western, even while wandering through 1990s Los Angeles. And Jesus Quintana acts so loathsome because he thinks that he's the main villain, which makes it so much funnier when he just vanishes from the movie without a trace.

Donny, though? Donny always seems to be out of synch with the other characters because **he's the only one not trying to act out a role**. He always seems so perplexed about the chaos around him because he's not looking for a plot to follow...he just wants to live out his life in peace.

Even Donny's troubled relationship with Walter subtly hints at this: every time that Walter utters his famous line (*"Shut the fuck up, Donny!"*), it's because Donny says something that would be perfectly logical for a real person to say, but *illogical* for a character in a scripted film to say (e.g. pointing out something that the audience already knows, asking a question that the audience already knows the answer to, making a comment that breaks the flow of dialogue, etc.). Walter loses his temper whenever Donny says something that doesn't advance the plot...because Donny isn't aware that there *is* a plot. By constantly shushing him, Walter is trying to edit the movie while it's still happening.

At times, Walter comes as close to saying it as he possibly can without spelling it out in capital letters.

*"Forget it, Donny! You're out of your element!"*

*"You have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know..."*

There are other, subtler touches that further drive it home:

* Da Fino mistakes The Dude for a fellow detective, showing that he's also confused about the movie's genre.
* The Stranger is aware that he has a duty to introduce The Dude, but he frequently loses his train of thought...as if he's working with an incomplete script, and has to improvise some of his lines.
* The Stranger's opening question, "What's a hero?", is an acknowledgement of the fact that "Hero" is just a role in a story, and that anyone can assume that role.
* Arthur Digby Sellers' son Larry ignores Walter and The Dude when they try to interrogate him. As the son of a writer, he knows that fictional characters can't hurt him if he refuses to acknowledge them.
* Karl Hungus and his friends "believe in nothing" because they know that their world is a scripted fantasy.
* The role of pornography is an ironic joke. Characters in pornographic films have no existence or personality outside of their sex lives, just like the characters in this movie know nothing but their chosen roles.
* Walter throws Jeffrey Lebowski out of his wheelchair in an attempt to prove that he's not really a paraplegic, because he knows that he's just an actor pretending to be paraplegic.

But the event that **really** hammers it home is the death of Donny at the film's climax. Donny's death (via a random heart attack) is made all the more surreal by the fact that it violates almost every narrative rule in existence: it happens with no warning, it doesn't advance the plot, it's almost comically mundane, and it happens to the least significant character in the movie. That's because Donny's death is completely unscripted; it leads into the end of the movie because it throws the entire movie into disarray.

As bizarre as it may sound, Donny's death works very much like death does in real life. As in life, death often happens without warning, it's not always dramatic or meaningful, and it often compels us to mourn for people who we don't believe to be particularly significant to us.

Donny's funeral scene even hints at this. Walter finds himself at a loss for words when he attempts to eulogize Donny, because he knows nothing about him beyond his role in the plot. When pressed, the only fact that he can come up with is that he likes to surf. We don't see any of Donny's family at the funeral because, as a minor character, he has no existence beyond his limited role in the story. When giving his eulogy speech, Walter falls back on ranting about Vietnam because—given his role as "haunted 'Nam veteran"—that's **the only thing that he knows**.

After the cruelly random death of a buddy, Walter and The Dude are finally forced to acknowledge the directionless nature of life in a scripted film, and they resolve to stop looking for a plot and start enjoying their time together. That's why they finally abandon the cloak-and-dagger shenanigans in the final scene and go off to enjoy another round of bowling together.

With his final speech, the Stranger assures us that The Dude's life *will* continue, even without an arbitrary plot to give him something to strive for. The Dude may not have an epic quest to undertake, and he may not have a villain to vanquish, but—like all of us—he has a life, and he can do nothing but live it. Hence, even after the story's over, life goes on. 

And The Dude abides.

**TL;DR**: Donny is the only character who doesn't act like he's from another genre, and he seems clueless because he isn't trying to resolve the plot. His death throws the movie into disarray because it's unscripted, and it forces Walter and The Dude to acknowledge that the plot has no real meaning.At the end of EG,When cap is preparing to travel into past Bucky seems as if he knows what is going to happens, like he knew that Cap is going to past and live a life with peggy and my belife is further confirmed when bucky send sam to talk to old steve, i mean thats strange! Bucky acts like he already knows everything. Okay so here's my theory on how bucky learnt of 2023 cap (in 2014) - if you watch all peggy carter's scene from TWS you will understand, pay attention to peggy's lines too those are important. In the end credit scene of TWS, bucky visits a museum to learn more about steve, what if he visited Peggy carter's home after museum and found old steve there? I think its possible. He met old steve in 2014 and learned everything but made a promise that he won't reveal anything to the cap of main timeline. Of course steve wouldn't have told bucky about whole thing happens in future he just have told him that he is from future and living a life he never got. So there has been 2 steve rogers living in main timeline -1st. Prime timeline steve roger  and 2nd. 2023 steve rogers.This is my first theory so please go easy on me. Anyway in the movie Up Carl Fredricksen is bitter and mistrusting of Russel when they first meet. I think this is because Fredricksen according to Wikipedia was 9 years old in 1940 and Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941 meaning that during his childhood Japanese-Americans were hated by many Americans because of Japans involvement in WWII. 

Further, the Korean War occurred in 1950 and ended in 1953 meaning that Fredricksen would be 19 at the time of the beginning of the war and could have fought in it. This would also hurt his opinion of Asian-Americans and add to his bitterness towards Russel at the beginning of the movie. 

I think this theory adds to the overall meaning of Up and instead of it being a movie of about adventure and never growing but also a movie about trust and getting to understand someone who is different than you. 

Edit: a word

Shrek 2 is one of those films I can recite perfectly from memory, but I still find a new little detail every now and again upon rewatch, which I do often, because this shit slaps. Mind you, I was drunk while watching, but I still focused in on one particular factor;

Donkey, in the film's opening, reveals that he waited in Shrek's swamp for him and Fiona to return from their honeymoon, for the sole reason that he's lonely and Dragon is "acting all moody lately". We know later this is due to her pregnancy, but that is enough for Donkey wanting to move in with the ogres. So he's already ready to move away from his dragon wife just for being moody.

This is compounded when the carriage enters Far Far Away. What does Donkey do? He starts flirting with passers by! As the carriage passes a pair of nondescript female background characters, Donkey quite literally shouts "Hey, good-looking! We'll be back to pick you up later!" Not only that, but he goes missing for several hours after "bringing the car around", when he turns up uninvited to dinner. What was he doing that whole time? SEDUCING INNOCENT HUSSIES IN A NEW TOWN?!Everyone knows the scene, of course. Kirk and his friends are trapped below the surface of Regula I, and Khan taunts Kirk with the knowledge that he is about to hunt down and finish off the *Enterprise*, leaving Kirk stranded alive, "Marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet." This is when Kirk loses his cool and screams Khan's name. The scream is so badly exaggerated that it is commonly cited as a textbook example of Shatner over-acting.

Of course, what Khan (and the audience) doesn't know at that point is that Spock, in command of the *Enterprise*, is playing possum. He has deliberately ~~lied about~~ exaggerated the damage to the *Enterprise* because he knew Khan would be listening in on his conversation with Kirk. It's a trap. And Kirk knows it's a trap, so there's no reason for him to be pissed off at that point. But it is vitally important that he doesn't give this away to Khan. So when Khan is taunting him, he has to *really* sell his anger and desperation.

Now, Kirk is a brilliant starship commander, but he's not a trained actor. So when he tries to act enraged and frustrated, he goes completely over the top, and gives an embarrassingly bad performance. Fortunately, Khan is so blinded by anger and ego (he does have a superior intellect, after all) that it never even occurs to him that Kirk might be pulling the wool over his eyes. So he misses the obvious clues, and Spock's trap works.***The Theory:***  Dr. Strange sent The Hulk to Sakaar which was the first of his four attempts at getting rid of The Hulk.

&#x200B;

***Evidence:***

# STRANGE HAS THE MOTIVE

* ***The Hulk is too dangerous to ignore.***  Strange keeps a list of dangerous beings from other worlds per *Ragnarok*.  It's not a stretch to believe he also keeps a list of dangerous humans on earth which would include Bruce Banner who as both a giant green rage monster and co-creator of Ultron is probably right at the top of it. 
* ***Dr. Strange answers to no one.***  Even as a student at Kamar-Taj, Strange never did what he was told.  He was told not to use portals in the library, he did any way.  He complains to the Ancient One about being told to “blindly accept rules that make no sense.”  After which she introduces him to the Mirror Dimension where he can do whatever he wants because what happens there doesn't affect reality.  When he picks up the Time Stone to use it for the first time, does he take it to the Mirror Dimension?  Nope.  He'll play with time whenever and wherever he wants to dag-nabbit because the rules just don't apply to Strange.  After he becomes the Sorcerer Supreme, he's the top dog.  Right and wrong are whatever he says they are now, so any action he wants to take can be justified, including preemptive strikes.
* ***The Sorcerer Supreme has always tried to direct the course of history.***  In *Doctor Strange*, The Ancient One, as Sorcerer Supreme, admitted to actively interfering in events to “prevent countless terrible futures and there's always another one” so why would Strange be any different especially when he considers himself above the rules.

# STRANGE HAS THE MEANS

* ***Strange loves using the Time Stone.***  Strange's answer every question put to him is “Time Stone.”  He's had a grand total of maybe 3 hours in the MCU so far, and I'm not sure how much real time that translates to, but during that time he uses the Time Stone on-screen five times: in Kamar-Taj, Hong Kong, The Dark Dimension, NYC and on Titan.  (If you buy in on my other theory than Strange orchestrated the snap, then he also used the Time Stone two more times on Titan, once to set the time loop that ensures Thanos completes the gauntlet and once to make sure the Time Stone reverses the destruction of the Mind Stone.)  In any case, we know Strange has used the Time Stone five (or seven) times already.  Who knows how many times he used it off-screen between *Doctor Strange* and *Infinity War*?  It's safe to say though, Dr. Strange is always ready to use the Time Stone without hesitation.

# STRANGE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

* ***The Hulk is stupid.***  He's stupid.  That's all there is to it. 
* ***The Hulk is a loner******.***  In addition to The Hulk, several other people we know are probably near the top of his watch lists including Tony Stark who co-created Ultron, Vision the vibranium android who wields an Infinity Stone, Thanos the mastermind behind the attack on NYC, Loki the leader of the attack on NYC, Odin a rival protector of earth, and Thor who will be Odin's successor.  However, he can't strike any of them easily.  Stark, Vision and Thor are Avengers, there's no way he can strike at them without the risk of bringing the rest of Avengers down on him (plus the Asgardians as well in Thor's case).  Thanos is across the galaxy and surrounded by body guards and an army.  He wouldn't want to touch Loki because he's doing a great job weakening Asgard for him while Strange seemingly already has Odin under some kind of quasi-house arrest in Norway.  The Hulk though, well, he's a loner.  After *The Incredible Hulk*, Banner goes into hiding. After *Age of Ultron*, he goes into hiding again.  The Hulk also doesn't really get on well with the other Avengers.  Even as Banner, his only real friends are Stark and Romanoff. 

# HOW THE HULK WOUND UP ON SAKAAR

There's no explanation for how The Hulk got to Sakaar.  In *Ragnarok*, we're never told how he ended up on Sakaar.  All we know is that he had some sort of plane trouble and crash landed on Sakaar.

This is what would have happened.  After determining that The Hulk would be his first order of business as Sorcerer Supreme, Strange begins studying him looking for a weakness.  In his research, he learns that after Sovokia, the Avengers return to NYC without The Hulk because he had gone back into hiding.

“Why, The Hulk would have been completely isolated and weary from battle then.  What a convenient moment that would have been to strike,” he thinks to himself.  “If only I had been Sorcerer Supreme back when that happened.”

Wait a minute, he's a got the Time Stone he remembers.  He CAN be there now.  At that point he would have whipped out the stone as per his habit, and in his first attempt on The Hulk, time traveled back 2-3 years to Sokovia, a place where The Hulk would have been all alone in the Quinjet at a time where there would have been no witnesses to see him sling ring him to Sakaar.

# WHY STRANGE SENT THE HULK TO SAKAAR

* ***Sakaar is a prison planet paradise.***  Even as Strange sought to banish The Hulk from earth for the greater good, he did so without malicious intent.   He chose to send him to Sakaar because it was the perfect place for him.  The Hulk would be trapped on the planet, but he would spend the rest of his life smashing things and people all the live long day, revered as a beloved Champion by the planet's entire population instead of feared as a Monster on earth.
* ***The Hulk is also Strange's alarm clock for Endgame.***  Thanks to the Time Stone, Strange is not bound by the constraints of linear time, so he already knows that Thanos and the snap are a supremely terrible potential future and that if it ever starts to come to pass, Thanos will move so quickly in retrieving the Infinity Stones that no other higher powers or celestial beings will have time to react and stop him.  He foresaw that in that potential future that one day The Hulk comes crashes through the sanctum.  Therefore, Strange tries his best to prevent it and set himself up with an early warning system at the same time.  He sends The Hulk to all the way to a prison planet run by a celestial, so it would be impossible for The Hulk to either accidentally and purposely smash up the sanctum or even come into contact with Thanos at all.  He knows that if Banner ever does somehow come crashing through the sanctum one day, then that potential future is now the actual future and its time to put everything else he's been currently working on away and start moving pieces around to begin the Endgame because Thanos is on the move.  That's why he asks Banner who Thanos is when he arrives.  He wanted clarification that out of the trillions of souls in the universe that the Thanos Banner is talking about coming is Thanos the Mad Titan and not, say, Thanos the A'askvariian battle-slave on Sakaar.
* ***The Ancient One idolized Strange.***  Surely, the Ancient One would have stopped Strange you say.  She was the Sorcerer Supreme at that time after all.  Wouldn't it be her job to prevent someone from tampering with time like that?  Maybe, but she still won't have stopped Strange from doing it.  As early as the Loki's attack on NYC, The Ancient One is already convinced that Dr. Strange, who she hasn't even formally met yet at that time, is “meant to become the best of them,” so much so that in *Endgame* she hands over the Time Stone to The Hulk, falling in line with his Strange's plan without even knowing what it is, simply because he name drops Strange.
* ***Strange did it in the comics.***  Kevin Feige likes to pull story elements from the comic books for use in the movies.  Due to issues with his movie rights, The Hulk didn't get his own trilogy.  His entire arc was told through other MCU movies.  In the comics, Strange is partly responsible for blasting The Hulk into space because he's too dangerous to stay on earth and The Hulk ultimately winds up on Sakaar as a gladiator, so this would all be a call back to that story line.

&#x200B;

# HOW DID STRANGE EVEN KNOW ABOUT SAKAAR?

* ***Sakaar has magic written all over it, starting with its portals.***  In the MCU, we know of five types of teleportation: the hexagonal jump gates in space, the rainbow beam of the Bifrost, the Tesseract's smokey blue flames, the Convergence's giant doorways and the circular wizard portals.  Per Valkyrie in *Ragnarok*, no one leaves Sakaar.  It's impossible.  We learn that's not true, you can leave via portal, the same way wizards exit that other inescapable place, the Mirror Dimension.  Moreover, unlike the jump gates, the Bifrost, Convergence or Tesseract, all of which are fleeting and temporary passages, the circular portals on Sakaar appear to be permanent.  Wizard portals likewise stay open indefinitely provided there's wizard willing them to do so.
* ***Sakaar is run by a wizard.***  Who is the wizard keeping those portals open?  The same one who's using them to bring him participants like Beta Ray Bill, Bi-Beast, and Doug for his Contest of Champions.  The Grandmaster wears the flamboyant robes of the Masters of the Mystic Arts.  He even has his own relic, the Melting Stick.  How else is The Grandmaster who is complete given over to his hedonism able to keep control of a planet full of hostile gladiators, slaves, rebels and vagrants?  Certainly not through his administrative prowess, but rather by magic.  The Grandmaster's abilities are so great, that Loki, the rightful king of Jotunheim and assassin of its last ruler, a claimant to the throne of Asgard who bewitched its last king, the god of mischief who would go on to battle the goddess of death, the guy who tried to stab the earth's Sorcerer Supreme and would later also try to stab Thanos in the throat, the would-be conqueror of earth and the former wielder of both the Mind and Space Stones, tells Thor it would be better to try sneaking off Sakaar than to confront The Grandmaster directly.
* ***Time doesn't work right on Sakaar.***  The Grandmaster isn't just a wizard though.  He's powerful enough to keep the giant wizard portals open all over the planet.  He admits to being millions of years old.  His Willy Wonka intro says he is the actual creator of the planet Sakaar. His palace guard and architecture are all decked out in the Jack Kirby aesthetic.  And he's a bizarre father-figure to the slave civilization he's cultivated on his own private world.  He's a Celestial.  Just as that other Celestial, Ego, spent millions of years learning to manipulate matter, The Grandmaster spent his time learning to manipulate time.  Just like Ego, The Grandmaster's mastery is restricted to his planet.  He's powerful enough to control time locally on Sakaar, but not universally like the Time Stone can.  Sakaar is home to Celestial space wizard tampering with time.  The Grandmaster would be on Strange's watch list, so Strange knows all about Sakaar.

&#x200B;

# STRANGE MAKES THREE MORE ATTEMPTS ON THE HULK AFTER SAKAAR

* ***Attempt #2:  Death by taxi cab.***  After Thor frees The Hulk from Sakaar and Heimdall sends him crashing to into the Sanctum in *Infinity War*, Strange sees that Banner cannot turn into The Hulk to take on Cull Obsidian.  He portals Banner away to the park in order to “protect him,” but also sends half a taxi cab with him which almost crushes him when he lands. There were thousands of people in the area in danger of being killed during that battle. Strange didn't try to portal any of them to a “safer” place, just Banner. The Maw and Cull Obsidian had no reason to target Banner specifically because they had no way of knowing he was The Hulk. No, they were sent specifically for Strange. Still, Strange saw The Hulk in a moment of weakness and decided the risk of turning his attention from the two aliens who'd come to kill him for the Time Stone was worth the reward of ending The Hulk right then and there.
* ***Attempt #3:  The Smart Hulk.***  Since both exile and assassination failed, Strange moves on with a stop-gap measure.  Since his ultimate plan to defeat Thanos involves turning over the Time Stone to Thanos ensuring he snaps away half the universe, he can't leave The Hulk in his stupid incarnation where he'd be the ultimate danger to a city missing half its police force in a country missing half its military all because Banner stubs his toe or gets stung by a bee or something like that.  All his actions on Titan are done to ensure that off all the infinite possibilities, his chosen future, option #14,000,605, comes to fruition because in that one, Banner, crushed by his inability to protect Vision and stop the snap, looks inward as a coping mechanism which leads to him ultimately integrating his intellect with The Hulk's strength.  That intellect becomes the leash that finally checks the brute.
* ***Attempt #4:  Crippled by the Gauntlet part 1.***  The Smart Hulk has all the brains and the brawn in one package and that is an outcome Strange can live with until Stark invents time-travel.  However, once he does, the Smart Hulk becomes an even greater danger than the stupid Hulk ever was because Banner has proven time and time again, he makes poor choices.  For example, after destroying Harlem,  Banner goes into hiding, but does he go to somewhere peaceful and quiet where he can live stress-free? No, he goes to India where there's a billion of people with a billion smells and colors and noises assault to his senses and stress him out. Yet, somehow me makes that work.  Then Natasha shows up to recruit him for the Avengers. He knows its a bad idea for him to go, yet still he ends up on the helicarrier where despite all his yoga and self-control techniques, he hulks out and proceeds to destroy the inside of the helicarrier.  In Age of  Ultron, against his better judgment he agrees to help Stark create Ultron, in secret no less. Then after that debacle, he agrees to play Dr. Frankenstein a second time to create Vision even though he himself points out what a disaster Ultron turned out to be.  The danger of allowing Banner, with his poor decision making and in full possession of The Hulk's strength, continued access to time-travel is too great to ignore, especially in light of how Stark, Rogers and Loki will all have shortly screwed things up with their own time-traveling in *Endgame*.  Dr. Strange ain't got time to deal with some indestructible, space-faring, time-hopping, genius super gorilla monster who could potentially undo option #14,000,605 so he had to put the kaibosh on that.
* ***Attempt #4:  Crippled by the Gauntlet part 2.***  Option #14,000,605 ensured events transpired so that Natasha, instead of Clint, died for the Soul Stone and The Hulk, instead of Thor, ended up performing the Blip.  Her death had taken such an emotional toll on Banner, that he even makes a special effort to resurrect her while using the Gauntlet to perform the Blip.  He admits as much to the rest of the Avengers.  Option #14,000,605 ensured The Hulk wound up a mere shell of his former self.  He's crippled by the Blip and is so weakened by it that he couldn't even save himself from a collapsing building, instead he's rescued by Ant-Man.  With Stark and Romanoff now dead and Thor also psychologically traumatized and headed out into space, Banner also is completely alone and friendless again.  A broken Hulk.

Please also see my other Dr. Strange theory on this sub.  Somebody gave it silver, so you know it's good:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ehd8kg/dr\_strange\_engineered\_the\_snap\_in\_inifinity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ehd8kg/dr_strange_engineered_the_snap_in_inifinity/)Around the 10 second mark in the [Pokémon Detective Pikachu trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1roy4o4tqQM), you can hear the few notes of a melody. That melody is from [the intro screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QeiH70AUU4) of the 1st generation Pokémon games (I think). The first generation games begins by showing a battle between a Gengar and a Nidorino. The battle between these two Pokémon is the first scene in the anime. Thus it is my theory that the movie will begin by showing this battle. I might just be projecting but listen closely to the lyrics:

"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?"

The song is about two queers who are dreaming about a better future with a more accepting society where they can live peacefully together without getting shamed 

"You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending"

Is all talking about how their life would be like in their  alternate reality 

"I wish that every kiss was never ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?"

Because they know some ways down the road they're gonna have to split up or else they'd get in trouble. And every moment of them showing affection would mean another possibility of them getting caught so they make every interaction count

"Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
It might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do"

Here they get a bit more desperate. Almost begging for it to happen because they truly love and want to be together 

"Oh, we could be married (oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?"

This is the line that sold me and made me go 'hmmmm...' Because it was the 60s and gay marriage was pretty illegal. A straight couple wouldn't have to worry about not getting married, they'd just wait. But a gay couple would, marriage for them would be pretty much impossible 

"You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby"

Here it gets a bit sad, the song has a bad ending. No matter how much they dream it's all it is. A dream, that no matter how good it sounds is all just a coping mechanism for the unfortunate reality they live in. An escape but not a permanent one. End.



A feel like I should make a few points:

1. I didn't know where else to post this r/musictheory seems to be about music itself rather than songs and the stories they tell 
2. English is not my first language so sorry if I made any grammar mistakes 
3. I'm not accusing anybody of being a homosexual in case anyone starts saying "bUt bRiAn iS sTrAigHt"
4. This is my first time posting a theory


Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up at all, if I did I would've at least made the writing more decent. Thanks for the awards!&#x200B;

I recently read the Silmarillion and had a few thoughts about the true motives of Sauron, during the Lord of the Rings. At the end of the Silmarillion, Melkor is defeated and enslaved in the timeless void.  However, in some additional writings of Tolkien he wrote of the prophecy of Dagor Dagorath.  This prophecy stated that Melkor would return to the world, bringing with him a great war (Dagor Dagorath), that would end in the destruction of Arda (the Earth).

Fast forward to the 3rd age, and introduced are the Istari (the wizards), Maiar that were sent to middle earth to unite the peoples of Middle Earth against the power of Sauron.

My theory is that Sauron knew Morgoth was taken into the timeless void, but he didn't have the power to free him.  Over time he developed his crafting, such that he was able to create a key (the one ring) which would allow him to travel into the void, in order to free Morgoth from his imprisonment, thus forfulling the prophecy of the End Times, the destruction of the World. However, his creation came with a great price, as he put all of his power into its creation. Gandalf and the other wizards, were set up as gate keepers to the void, to prevent Melkor from breaking free, and bringing about the prophecy. My feeling is that each of the wizards acted as a gate keeper, in which they would only be able to allow passage into the void to the race they were assigned, upon the death of a member of that particular race, which is why Radagast had more of an affinity towards animals and creatures, the blue wizards spent their time in the mountains among the dwarves and mountain dwelling races, Saruman spent his time among men, and Gandalf spent his time primarily with the elves and hobbits.  Even Bombadil, may have been set up as a gate keeper long before, to govern some of the oldest creatures of middle earth, the Ents and the Eagles.

In the Lord of the Rings, Gandalf proves that he can travel between realms, in which he does so after defeating the Balrog of Morgoth.  He again mentions the void, when he commands the Witch King of Angmar in this quote.

"'You cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. 'Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!'"

Gandalf knew of the prophecy of the coming of Morgoth to destroy the world, and knew the One Ring was the key Sauron would need to return there, so he could free him. Because Gandalf was one of the gate keepers, he felt obligated to keep this prophecy from coming true, because the fate of the world (not just middle Earth) was held in the balance.  So in this theory Gandalf and the other wizards take on more of a Grim Reaper role, preventing the return of spirits from the void, but primarily Melkor who was prophesied to return and bring about the end of the world.

&#x200B;

Now I know this theory probably has holes, and there is so much lore in the Tolkien universe that It's probably a bit far fetched, but in the end it is just a theory I came up with.  I probably could have expanded on this further, which I plan to do in the future, but I have more research to do on the subject.

Let me know what you think.

&#x200B;

Edit:

First of all, I appreciate all the comments, feedback, and Award given.  So Thank you for that.  Wasn't really expecting that at all. 

 Also,  I appreciate the people who put me in my place about this theory just as much as the people that got enjoyment out of reading it. I read all the comments and appreciate being able to learn more lore about Tolkien's world.  Initially, I did write this just for fun, and It was my first time trying to come up with a fan theory that could make sense, but as the comments show I should have done a lot more research and gave more examples of what I was proposing.  However, it makes me want to delve into Tolkien's world more and come up with more theories that people haven't thought of, because I really like the idea of the hidden meaning behind things.  

If you liked it, I'm happy, if you didn't maybe you got a chuckle or was thinking that this guy is completely nuts. Either way, This might be the first of many I try to come up with.  :)

Thanks again.

I think Mary Poppins is an offspring of Pennywise the Dancing Clown in the movie It. We know It can reproduce as eggs are revealed to be laid by It. But we have no clue if they are the first eggs It laid. What if It had previously? Mary Poppins would be the result.

Mary Poppins, like It, primarily thrives around children. Like It, she can manipulate the imagination of children, but adults are typically uninterested in her shenanigans. She can take the imagination of children and harvest it to produce magnificent works of magic and manipulation. And like It, they all "float". However, at some point in time, Poppins decided to be a good force. Instead of devouring fear and eating kids, she chose to make kids happy. Perhaps fear is merely the most satisfying emotion to eat, and joy is like their species' equivalent of going vegan?

I also think that Bert was the child that made Poppins good. We see in It that Penny wise can offer longer life, or skills or success. Maybe this is what Poppins did when they made some kind of...arrangement? Also fun little thing, but when Bert appears in the alleyway [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDsBFbjCewg), it's almost very Pennywise-like isn't it? Regardless, in the squeal we see Bert indeed successful and accomplished. [He's a tropper for sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL3AijekRYw).

And of course, Poppins hasn't aged compared to Bert, **and comes some 27 years later**, just like It.

I think the creepiest moment is for sure, that [red balloon scene](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vBo2GRwfvBI/XU2MY5hVZwI/AAAAAAAAASo/iM8oDdtTw1YLeRwtiYklhMKLOwuVEDuKACLcBGAs/s1600/2018-mary-poppins-returns-09.jpg)...chills man.

And of course, as the video link up top, G E O R G I E is in both films.*[Spoilers for the ending of the fourth book ahead. You have been warned.]*

*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* may not be every fan’s favorite book in the series, but most people seem to agree that *this* was the book that first showed us the kind of epic that we were in for as the saga of Harry Potter raced towards its conclusion. After three books of mostly light-hearted hijinks in a magic boarding school, this book finally gave us a taste of the ultimate battle between Good and Evil that loomed just over the horizon. First the Death Eaters returned, then Harry had to watch Cedric Diggory die in front of him, and then ol’ Voldy himself rose from the grave. After that, we all knew that no character was safe, and that Harry and his pals were going to have to grow up a lot faster than they ever planned on.

But with the emotional gut-punch of that ending, doesn’t it seem just a little strange that the bulk of the plot was all about a magical athletic tournament between schools? Seriously, what was the deal with that?

Simple: in a book that’s all about Harry finally beginning the painful journey from boyhood to manhood, the Triwizard Tournament is a central metaphor for that journey. And each of his three rival contestants—Victor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory—represents a different aspect of adolescence that Harry has to face.

As many, many fans have pointed out, the very fact that Harry ended up competing in the Tournament can come off as a pretty big plot hole, considering A) he didn’t give his consent to be entered, and B) he wasn’t even old enough to compete. Hell, just the fact that he was allowed to compete as a *fourth* contestant might seem pretty strange, since the **Tri**wizard Tournament is explicitly supposed to be a competition of skills between **three** wizards. But if you see the tournament from Harry’s perspective, and if you think about it as a thematic device rather than a plot device, maybe all of that actually makes perfect sense.

The audience may have seen four contestants competing in a tournament designed for three, but Harry just saw three adversaries that he had to overcome. And it may have been against the rules for a 14 year-old Harry to compete against three experienced 17 year-olds on the cusp of graduation—but it perfectly conveys the fear and confusion of a young teenager getting his first whiffs of the adult world.

And what about those three adversaries? Let’s review...

* **Viktor Krum**’s primarily personality trait is that he’s a comically macho manly-man who acts—in many ways—as a distorted reflection of the sort of person that a teenage Harry dreams of growing into. He may not be particularly smart, sensitive or articulate, but he’s absurdly athletic, he’s admired by everyone at Durmstrang, girls love him, and he’s even a world-famous Quidditch player on his country’s national team. (Notice how he even plays Seeker, the same position as Harry?) To most teenage boys, that’s the epitome of the ideal man, even if the reality of adulthood usually isn’t that simple. So in a story about growing up, the ultra-masculine Viktor Krum personifies Harry’s burgeoning manhood.

* **Fleur Delacour**’s primary personality trait is that she’s a comically beautiful, charming and graceful woman who every male character in the story can’t help but swoon over. And just so we’re clear, her beauty isn’t just a throwaway trait: it’s established that she’s the granddaughter of a Veela, one of a species of magical humanoid creatures who use alluring songs and dances to cause men to fall hopelessly in love with them—essentially making her a *literal* nymph. And though her beauty is usually played for laughs, it’s quite thematically appropriate for the book where Harry, Ron and Hermione first start showing interest in romance. It’s funny to watch Ron helplessly stammer when Fleur enters a room, but didn’t most of *us* feel that way when we first stumbled into puberty and got our first crush? Hell, Fleur’s name even literally means *”Flower of the Heart”* in French. What is *”Flowering of the Heart”* if not a poetic way of describing one’s first love? Fleur may not be Harry’s love interest, but in a story about growing up, she’s the perfect symbol of his burgeoning awareness of his own sexuality.

* **Cedric Diggory** seems to be something of an “odd man out” among the three. He’s not as comically masculine as Viktor or as comically feminine as Fleur, but is primarily defined by his kindness. True to his Hufflepuff background, he fervently believes in honesty and fair play, and even gives his rival Harry a vital clue that helps him succeed in the second task. And unlike the other two, who are visitors from foreign schools, Cedric is a Hogwarts student who Harry knew before the Triwizard Tournament. It’s even a minor plot point that he and Harry competed in a Quidditch match in the third book. All of that combines to make his death at the climax of the book all the more shocking. Not only was it a tragedy to see such a sympathetic character killed off so suddenly, that was the *first* time in the series that a non-villainous supporting character died. Even if he was a relatively minor character, nothing was quite the same after Cedric’s death, and both Harry and the audience lost a little bit of their innocence. Much like we’re never really aware of our childhood innocence until we lose it, we never really knew to value a minor Hogwarts student like Cedric until he was killed. And that’s why he’s so significant: in a story about growing up, the wrongfully murdered Cedric Diggory represents Harry’s lost innocence.

**TL;DR:** Harry’s three opponents all represent different aspects of puberty and growing up. The hulking manly man Viktor Krum represents Harry’s burgeoning manhood, the alluring, nymph-like Fleur Delacour represents his burgeoning awareness of his own sexuality, and the wrongfully murdered Cedric Diggory represents his lost innocence.So, I saw a post on the DC sub where a guy solved the 'Riddle' in the trailer by deciphering the cypher in the note.

The Riddle: What does a liar do when he's dead.

Answer: He lies still

Guess what, it's not a riddle at all. IT'S A JOKE.

Guess we're getting another Joker. You heard it here first.At the beginning of Helm's deep, the orcs were organizing formation and hyping themselves up because they thought they were positioned outside the range of the archers. 

then [https://youtu.be/78IJdhvY1zg?t=135](https://youtu.be/78IJdhvY1zg?t=135) happened. A shot so good, Aragon thought some crack shot elf made the shot. So he yelled hold fire in elvish, because the orcs were clearly out of range, and they were waiting for the orcs to go within range for the volley fire. 

At this point the orc commander panics, because he thought he fucked up and positioned his troops to close to the wall. So he ordered the charge, before the orcs could set up a siege formation and go for a more organized charge 

**TL;DR: He made them himself, carefully and over time.** 

&#x200B;

This theory is structured into two parts, the first being a line of reasoning to build an assumption, and the second using that assumption to answer how the Joker really got his scars. 

**Part 1: The Joker Is The Opposite Of Batman.** 

I know, I know, many of you are thinking... no duh. But no, I mean literally the opposite of the Batman in every way - as a defined Canon rule. 

Starting with appearances, Batman has a black and stealthy look. Joker is bright colors and overstated. Batman wears a mask, jokers most recognizable feature is his face. Batman can have an alter-ego by taking off the mask, the Joker can’t (he is permanently Joker-faced). Batman wears armor, joker doesn’t. They are visually opposites. Hell, Batman dresses as a bat to illicit a sense of fear. What’s the opposite of fear? Laughter? A clown. 

On a deeper note, let’s talk about methodology since I think that’s more telling anyhow. Throughout the movie, the joker keeps telling us (the audience) how he is an actor of chaos and just does things on a whim. He tells Harvey Dent he’s like a dog chasing a car and wouldn’t know what to do if he caught it - he is just impulsive. Batman, on the other hand, is strategic and calculated. Except.... they really aren’t, are they? 

Though Batman is presented as the logical and calculated one and Joker as the impulsive chaotic one, in reality, it’s the other way around. *Every Single thing* we see the joker do demonstrates thinking multiple steps ahead and a “grand plan”. The cell phone in the stomach, the explosives in the hospital, the bank robbery in the opening scene, the fake-hostages in the tower, the grenades at the mob boss meeting, even crashing Bruce Wayne’s party. The Joker is by far more strategic, calculating, and planned than Batman. Even though Joker is presented as chaos, he is the only one that legitimately   
 always has a proactive plan. Batman really doesn’t have a plan most the time, he goes where there is likely to be crime and just throws himself in the mix and wings it. The car park scene, for instance, he runs into Scarecrow and the fake-batman's by chance. The man is not proactive, he literally follows a light in the sky as a call to action. The whole movie feels like Batman having to react to the jokers plans, and it seems like Batman in TDK is entirely plan-less. 

The joker appears chaotic but is actually calculated. Batman appears calculated but is actually chaotic. 

Then let’s talk about motive. From the other movies and general common sense, Batman’s motive is to be a source of Justice in Gotham. From his perspective, Gotham has a bunch of crime because it lacks reliable cops and the idea of “fair justice”. In fact, he makes it pretty clear that Harvey Dent is the real hero Gotham needs because he can be a symbol of actual justice and not just vigilantism. The joker, on the other hand, wants to destroy the *idea of justice*. From his perspective, the world is a messy unfair place and you get what you take for yourself. “I simply believe what doesn’t kill yo,  makes you, Stranger”. Or, “Introduce a little anarchy - upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos - it's fair.” Hell, Joker is pretty clearly a Nihilist (and even quotes German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche when talking to the Bank Manager). The opposite of Nihilism is existentialism, “being the creation of ones essence and subjective meaning”. Sounds a lot like Batman to me in that he is trying to create the idea of justice itself and justice is what you make it to be (in his mind). 

My point is that Batman believes the world should be a place of accountability and equal justice. The joker thinks the world is what you make of it and, under the right circumstances, everyone would act equally. Batman thinks justice is robbing a bank and then getting caught. The joker thinks robbing a bank is the justice in the first place because you failed to protect yourself. This is why Harvey Dent, THE symbol of justice is used like a pawn and ultimately torn between the 2 ideals, both metaphorically and literally. 

On the topic of motive, Batman thinks Joker wants to kill him, to which joker says, “I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no...no you complete me”. This implies that Joker is aware of this balance of opposites. Joker knows Batman is his perfect counter. Batman, it seems, does not see this. Batman just sees a crazy person. 

You know what else is interesting? The physical relationship between Batman and Joker. As shown in the interrogation scene, Batman tried to break the joker with physical violence. But the joker tries to break Batman mentally. When Batman punches, the Joker attacks his emotions. The way they fight is opposite. Batman never kills but he sure as hell mutilates and breaks bones to get what he needs. The Joker really... doesn’t hurt anyone - he KILLS them or he doesn’t. His attacks are usually more mental, like when he set the 2 thugs against each other with pool sticks, and he doesn’t beat people up, he just kills them or doesn’t. The way they fight others and each other seems like mirrored opposites.

&#x200B;

The joker is, in Canon, the mirrored opposite of Batman in every way. That’s why he’s the archenemy. If something is decidedly true about Batman, then it must be false of Joker and vice versa. 

**Part 2: How Joker Got His Scars** 

If we accept that Joker is the opposite of Batman, then we can start to use Batman as an anchor point and sudoku our way to a conclusion. 

We know that the joker has a physical deformation with the scars. We don’t know how he got them. 

If we follow the ‘opposites’ logic, we take Jokers physical deformation and that would translate to physical perfection for Batman (which, in movie 2, is pretty accurate). But Batman has a ‘mental deformation’ the scarring from his childhood where he watched his parents die. Batman went through some fucked up stuff as a kid, which is how he became Batman to begin with. 

The opposite of Batman’s mental scarring would be... *no childhood mental scarring*. So joker has no Mental Scars from his childhood. While Batman’s mental scars were externally inflicted, Jokers physical scars must have been internally inflicted. 

If Batman was mentally damaged by **external** events, then Joker was physically damaged by **internal** events. If a thug (external society) killed batman's parents, then the opposite would be Jokers own self (internal mind) causing him harm.  In other words, Joker made them himself. 

But then why the fake stories? Why the confusing bits? Well, because he tailors those stories to impact whoever he is taking to. It’s a marketing device. When talking to Gambol, he makes it so the enemy of the story is his power-drunk (and literal drunk) father. A cruel control freak, like Gambol himself. When talking to Rachel, he makes the villain his wife, in that she was too critical and judgmental. He even says his wife is “like you” to Rachel. Joker changes the story based on who is talking to and for great effective. He is able to say “people like you gave me these scars” with his stories. 

Side note but it’s also interesting that Batman blames himself for when he fails or is too weak to save someone. The joker blames society and everyone else when something goes wrong “want something done right you have to do it yourself”. Batman’s parents died and he didn’t start hating poor people or society, he started hating himself for his inaction. Joker gave himself his own scars and then blames society for them. It’s a mirrored opposite. One is externally damaged and blames himself, the other is internally damaged and blames society.

So Joker gave himself the scars *to visualize how he feels society damages people*. He makes it a smile because he thinks the idea of right/wrong is hilarious and that any sort of moral code is subject to proper circumstance. 

Another side note, but that’s why Joker laughs when he gets beat up. I’ve seen it posted before where the assumption is that Joker is just insane and doesn’t feel physical pain. I don’t think that’s true. I think he feels physical pain (shown when he was electrocuted when trying to take off batman's mask). The reason he laughs is because he is proving his point. Batman gets closer and closer to breaking his rule and engaging in “unethical” behavior. The more he beats up Joker, the more Joker can say, *“see! Under the right conditions you’re as much of a monster as any criminal in this city!”*. If Batman killed the joker, the joker would be thrilled because that cements him as the philosophical victor - even if he has to die to do it. 

That’s aside the point though and I don’t mean to derail. Back to Joker, I believe he gave himself the scars as a scare tactic and visualization. But let’s check if that really holds up... 

Would joker inflict serious pain on himself? 

Yes. He has little regard for his own physical well being - and encourages Batman to beat him up (and even kill him) to prove a point. He laughs when Rachel shins him at the party and says he likes the fiery attitude. He held a gun to his own head when meeting Harvey Dent. I believe the joker has no problem feeling pain to prove a point. 

Would joker do something purely for a tactic advantage? 

Yes. In fact, nearly everything Joker does throughout the movie is carefully calculated and planned. Hypothetically if he gave himself scars, I think it’s very likely it wasn’t in a fit of rage or insanity. It was as a cold and calculated move knowing that it would yield visual results. Hell, to make a Glasgow Smile that profound, the cut needs to be deep and then recut several times (if you look closely it looks like multiple cuts too). Not only did he do it once, I bet he did it multiple times to make sure he got the scar, since the scarring is more important than the act even. 

Furthermore, Batman literally got his Batman Costume in 5 minutes when meeting with Lucius (I know Lucius spent a lot of time working on it, by my point is Batman one day has no costume, and the next day, he does). It stands to the opposite rule that Jokers 'costume' would have been slowly and painfully acquired bit by bit over time.

Would Joker know how? 

Yes. We know he is familiar with weaponry and and military gadgets, as shown at the funeral scene but also just in general throughout the movie. He can handle a weapon and knows how to fight, it’s reasonable to assume he could carve up his own face. 

Okay so that answers... could he? Would he? And should he (motive)? I stand by my thinking that Joker likely gave himself the scars. 

Looking for more specific guesses as to who when where? 

Well here is where I admit I’m off the beaten path pretty far. Batman was scarred as a kid, so I’d argue Joker would have been an adult when he made the scar. Batman was scarred from a single climactic event, meaning I bet Joker was whittled away over time, slowly shaping his perspective (maybe adding to the smile scars bit by bit over time). Batman grew up rich, then joined Ra’s al Ghul. It’s possible Joker was born into Ra’s al Ghul (or similar) and then adapted to a life of Gotham poverty, opposite of Batman’s path. While this is pretty assumptive, it would explain why Gotham Police and Batman both can’t find any record of Jokers history. It also explains Jokers mindset and ability to fight. But thats just a guess using the assumption of part one.

&#x200B;

In Conclusion

I believe Joker is the mirrored opposite of Batman in every way as a canonical rule. If that is true, then Joker must have given himself the scars, as Batman did not give himself his mental scars (or costume, for that matter). Thank you for reading my TED talk.I think that Michael was popular in high school but because the connections he made weren’t very deep he didn’t really realize it. Just think about it. Everyone outside the office with the exception of his Improv class thinks he’s very funny and for the most part charming. Look at his second job where he worked at a telemarketing agency. Everyone there thought he was funny and interesting and they wanted to hang out with him. Another example is the rep for Lackawanna county schools at the chili’s. While Jan found Michael annoying for most of that event the rep found him funny and sort of became his pal for awhile. My third and final example is that Michael seemingly was a very talented hockey player in high school. Which is referenced by Jan in a interview by saying he’s a very good ice skater and is also referenced by Michael himself when he says that he went and scored the most goals in the history of the hockey team after his mathematics teacher (correct me if I’m wrong) told him we wasn’t passing the class. We also see him in his hockey gear during his birthday party in season 2 and we see he’s a very good skater. 
Therefore due to all this I think Michael was actually moderately if not very popular in high school.As a kid, I couldn't help but wonder how Professor Utonium's famous experiment might have turned out if he *hadn't* accidentally added a strong dose of Chemical X to his mixture of sugar, spice, and everything nice. After all, if he was smart enough to figure out a working Chemical formula for "the perfect little girls", why couldn't he have attempted the procedure more than once? And what exactly would "the perfect little girls" *really* look like? 

But maybe we already found out in another famous Cartoon Network show from the same era. Maybe at some point before the birth of the Powerpuff Girls, a kindly suburban couple from outside of Townsville was futilely trying to have a baby, and they went to him for help. Maybe he actually took pity on them and agreed to make them the perfect daughter in his laboratory. And maybe they named their young daughter "Dee Dee".

Yes, it sounds batty, but keep in mind: it's pretty well-established that *Dexter's Lab* and *Powerpuff Girls* take place within the same loosely defined universe. Dexter may never have teamed up with the girls against Mojo Jojo, but there *are* a few notable recurring characters who show up in both shows. Dexter was a big fan of the superheroes "The Justice Friends" (Major Glory, Valhallen, and the Infraggable Krunk), and two of the three Justice Friends showed up in the *Powerpuff Girls* episode "Members Only" as members of the Association of World Super Men. There were also the dimwitted kids' show hosts "The Puppet Pals" (Puppet Pal Mitch and Puppet Pal Clem), who both Dee Dee and the Powerpuff Girls enjoyed watching.

And consider what we know about Dee Dee: she's a comically sweet and innocent girl, her parents treat her as the perfect child (even though they don't always appreciate Dexter), and she's as different from her younger brother Dexter as it's possible to be—making you wonder sometimes if they really *are* biologically related. She also always wears one color (pink), she hangs out with two other similarly-named girls (Mee Mee and Lee Lee) with their own color-coded wardrobes, and her big blue eyes and blonde pigtails might even remind you of a certain Powerpuff Girl. Appearance-wise, she could easily be Bubbles' older sister. And if it really *were* possible to create a human girl from sugar, spice, and everything nice, it's not hard to imagine that she might look and act a bit like Dee Dee.

But above all: despite her sweet personality, Dee Dee seems to have a particular aptitude for wrecking Dexter's many beloved laboratory experiments; it's practically her whole character gimmick. But *why?* Does she just enjoy causing mischief? Is she just really, really irresponsible? Or does it reveal something deeper about her character? Maybe deep down, she actually has a simmering resentment of advanced science because she suspects that *she* was originally a lab experiment too, and that her creator gave her away. Maybe Dee Dee is really the world's cutest reimagining of Frankenstein's Monster, and Professor Utonium is Doctor Frankenstein.

If you take the theory further, maybe Dee Dee, Mee Mee, and Lee Lee were *all* made in Utonium's lab and adopted by different families, making them the predecessors of Bubbles, Blossom and Buttercup. And if Dexter and Dee Dee's parents knew Professor Utonium, maybe he was the one who encouraged Dexter's interest in science and inspired him to build his laboratory. And maybe that explains why Dexter spends so much time isolated from his family in his lab: he knows that his parents will never appreciate him as much as they appreciate Dee Dee, because she was *tailor-made* to be the perfect daughter. After all, how can you measure up to an older sibling who was literally made from sugar, spice, and everything nice?

**TL;DR:** Dee Dee is comically sweet, innocent, and charming because she was made from sugar, spice, and everything nice, and she spends so much time wrecking her brother's laboratory because she secretly resents that she was made in a lab.Before getting into the theory here is some evidence showing that Tony Stark is not a typical human being, which sparked my thoughts on this theory. I also want to add that I haven't personally seen this theory discussed before but I have read posts and theories about Tony Stark himself and why he hasn't reproduced the Super Soldier Serum ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/9l3pn4/mcu_could_tony_stark_replicate_the_super_soldier/)).

In Iron Man (2008), Tony survives getting shrapnel across his chest and undergoing an impromptu surgery. It might be redundant to state this given that everyone is aware of Iron Man's origins but consider it. Tony, for all intents and purposes, should have died from either 1) getting metal into his heart 2) blood loss 3) infections after the surgery (we don't know much about where his surgery took place but I assume it was the cave he was in and the flashback sequences do not make it seem like he was in the most sanitary of conditions)....and yet he didn't.

But sure, maybe we can ignore that for plots sake, but there is still more evidence to show that Tony is not a normal human. In Iron Man 2 , Tony manages to not only live through blood poisoning for an extended period of time (a condition that can kill a person in a matter of [hours](https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-poisoning#treatment)) but also manages to not suffer from the symptoms associated with this disease (confusion, organ failure, etc). In the film he drinks a concoction to help alleviate his symptoms however his condition only worsens. Given this, its amazing that he doesn't suffer more than the average person would in a shorter period of time.

There are definitely more instances in other films including but not limited to:

1. Avengers: Surviving going through a wormhole and going directly into space (surviving, even briefly, a whole assortment of cosmic attacks- radiation, extreme temperatures, asphyxiation...)
2. Avengers, Age of Ultron: Getting hit repeatedly by the Hulk.
3. Captain America, Civil War: Taking Captains shield to the chest and fighting against two super soldiers.
4. Avengers, Infinity War: Having a moon thrown at him.
5. Avengers, Endgame: Having the power of all the infinity stones going through his body (something we saw the Hulk barely take) without breaking a sweat\*see clarification. 

So it would seem that Tony Stark may be quite a bit stronger than the average man, but how does Howard Stark play a role in this? After the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, Howard Stark played a pivotal role in replicating the super soldier serum. In Captain America: Civil War we see tapes of the Winter Soldier stealing the super solder serum, that (we will assume) Howard Stark created, from Howard and Maria Stark and killing them in the process.

What if Howard Stark foresaw the fall of SHIELD? What if he believed that he would possibly die and would have to try and save his son from HYDRA?

It is not a stretch to believe that Howard Stark was a man with quiet a bit of foresight. He literally created a model of a new element in the hopes that his son would find it and realize what it was (see Iron Man 2). It is possible that he foresaw the fall of SHIELD or at least was suspicious about the organization and took some precautions to ensure that his son would be ready in the event that he found himself in HYDRAs clutches. Perhaps this precaution was giving Tony super soldier serum at a very young age in the hopes that it would have long term beneficial affects- and by the looks of it, it did.

&#x200B;

Edit: clarify "without breaking a sweat" comment: He does die, what I meant with that comment was that he doesn't express pain like Professor Hulk does.**(EDIT: "Watched the Prequels" is a figure of speech. As far as I know, Luke Skywalker doesn't have access to DVD box-sets. Cheers!)**

In the teaser for *The Last Jedi*, Luke states with clear conviction that “it is time for the Jedi to end.” There are a million ways to interpret this. Is Luke turning to the Dark Side? Are the Jedi no more? Where’s Jar-Jar in all this? And while there are multiple theories floating around, only one stands out as particularly compelling: **Luke Skywalker killed Rey’s father.**

Also, he **totally watched the prequels.**

At the end of *Return of the Jedi*, we see Luke resist the temptation to turn to the dark side – by rejecting fury and embracing composure, Skywalker musters the fortitude to rebuke the Emperor, redeem his father, and catalyze the collapse of the Galactic Empire. And while this attitude wins the day and cements Luke’s status as a true Jedi Knight, it is the same attitude that led to the Order’s collapse in the Prequel Trilogy. 

As we saw in *Revenge of the Sith*, a taciturn, emotionless outlook will eventually create outliers (Anakin, Dooku, and, to an extent, Qui-Gon Jinn) who resort to extreme and sometimes violent means to reprimand that outlook for personal gain. Say what you will about the Prequel Trilogy, but Lucas had a clear design in portraying the Jedi as staunch, out-of-touch monks – what many saw as poor writing was an admittedly flawed articulation of the notion that Jedi ideals were incompatible with human nature. The Jedi didn’t fail because of Palpatine; they failed because they’d grown beholden to archaic notions of good and evil.

We’ll get back to this is a minute. Right now, let’s focus on Rey.

Fast-forward to a Post-*Jedi* world. Together with the Alliance, Luke helps sweep the galaxy for remnants of the Galactic Empire. He’s a badass Jedi, doing what badass Jedi do: punishing evil and restoring order. In *Jedi*, we saw him carve through Jabba’s henchman like paper – here, he’s a young, Force-wielding knight at the peak of his power. Topple one dictator and the whole thing goes right to your head, so it’s easy to imagine Luke becoming just a mite sanctimonious.

But that self-righteous attitude blows up in his face when, at some point, he kills an Imperial. The Imperial himself doesn’t really matter. All that matters is that he has a baby, and that baby is now an orphan. Rather than leave this child to a life of poverty and sunset-staring, Luke does what any reasonable, guilt-stricken person would do: he adopts this baby as his own, names it Rey, and says, “You will be better than me.” And together with Rey, Luke Skywalker retires from war and starts a brand-new Jedi academy.

As he watches the child grow, he realizes that every Imperial he’s ever killed was a person – he hasn’t been cutting through heartless meat, he’s been slaughtering either drafted soldiers or conscripted orphans. People with homes, histories, families. People with stories. This forces him to question the binary ideals of good and evil as taught by the Jedi. For the first time, Luke Skywalker starts to wonder if he is, in fact, the asshole.

Take Finn. A bumbling, generally well-meaning kid who was conscripted into the First Order at a young age. Regarding Finn’s opinion of Luke, Boyega flat-out says that someone like Skywalker would be seen as a terrorist from Finn’s perspective: “For Finn, he’s been raised from the ashes of the Empire. He’s been taught about Luke Skywalker, he knows about his history. For him it’s like joining the army and then learning about one of the great enemies of your country.” Having blown up two Death Stars *filled with people like Finn*, Luke is admittedly upset with the notion of moral relativism. The seeds have been planted. In killing Rey’s father, Luke has opened a door inside his head: a door marked **Maybe the Jedi had it wrong.**

But this soul-searching comes too late, and the rigid code of the Jedi good-and-evil binary bites him in the ass when his nephew, Ben, hits puberty. All his life, Ben has heard nothing but “there is Good and there is Evil and never the twain shall meet.” So rather than dealing with his darker instincts like a mentally healthy person would do, he decides to go all-in and embrace them. He becomes Kylo Ren, an embodiment of rage, anger, and blind destruction – he’s a *Weird Al* parody of the Sith, mimicking the boogeymen his uncle warned him about. Here, we have another Anakin: someone so fed up with the restrictive dogma of the Jedi that he embraces their ideological opposite in the worst possible way.

So Kylo slaughters his Jedi classmates, as one does. While *Star Wars* isn’t exactly the appropriate venue for a school shooting metaphor, this is exactly how it plays out in the flashback as depicted in *The Force Awakens* - a handful of black-clad outcasts carving through their peers as *The Darth Plagueis Mixtape* blares over the intercom. Kylo Ren’s Vader-like outfit isn’t just a sign of reverence to his fallen grandfather – it’s a symbol that the cycle has repeated and the Jedi’s staunch ideology has once again produced unspeakable violence.

But then Kylo happens upon Rey – a child, a friend, his cousin in all but name. And rather than kill her, Kylo holds his nose and does the unthinkable: he compromises. He wipes her mind and drops her off on Jakku. Remember the flashback in *The Force Awakens*? Even as Rey screams “Come back!” to the fleeing starship, Kylo Ren sits onboard and facetimes Snoke about how he *totally* slaughtered his cousin and how it was “so fucking badass and evil, I swear.” This momentary indiscretion eats at him, and it’s why he’s so eager to impale his father the first chance he gets – remember, he’s embraced the idea that you must be either entirely good or entirely evil. Saving a little girl from the pale space-scrotum (Snoke) is decidedly not-evil, so Kylo has been longing for a way to balance to scales.

And so Rey, blind to her abilities, spends ten years screwing around on Jakku as her Jedi powers lie dormant, waiting to be unleashed. By chance, she happens upon a BB-8 unit carrying vital information, and the subsequent events made $2 billion at the box office.

Luke, meanwhile, realizes that adhering to the dogmatic principles of the Jedi has created catastrophe yet again. Worst of all, he was in the perfect position to stop it, and failed. So he retreats, in exile and in shame, to die alone as the last of the Jedi. And after spending ten-or-so years jerking off to erotically-shaped rocks, imagine Luke’s surprise when his long-dead-not-daughter shows up and hands him his father’s lightsaber.

Luke has a miracle on hands: one last chance to get it right. So what’s the first lesson for Rey? **“It is time for the Jedi to end”** – and, by extension, their archaic conception of good and evil. Luke is one-hundred percent done with this shit, and his design for Rey is imperative: in order to amend the mistakes of the past, he must teach her to look beyond the Jedi code and carve out a new path for future generations. To do that, he has to tell her the truth about her past – he must dash her hopes against the rocks and make her hate him.

The revelation in *The Empire Strikes Back* turned the Original Trilogy on its head – it flipped the narrative from “Darth Vader must be destroyed” to “Darth Vader must be saved.” It opened doors previously unthinkable, and *The Last Jedi* might just pull off the same trick. Here, the revelation is infinitely more complicated – we learn that Luke’s relationship with Rey is not one of love and fatherhood, but of murder and guilt. Rey will have to wrestle with the complexity of that relationship and the complexity within herself if she is to become the first in a new generation of Force-wielders: a generation that is not beholden to the rage of the Sith or the staunchness of the Jedi, but rather to a serenity that arises only from embracing the intricacy of human emotion and acknowledging the fundamental truth that we are all composed of instincts both dark and benevolent. 

It is time for the Jedi to end – and something new, led by Rey, to begin.

**TL;DR:** Luke killed Rey’s father and felt guilty about it. Also, the series is taking a step away from the black-and-white morality of the original trilogy and embracing a more complex evaluation of human emotion. The Prequels are still bad.This theory is only looking at Heath Ledger's Joker in TDK. It's long been speculated that Joker was ex-military. From his tactical and interrogation skills, to familiarity and ease with multiple weapons, it's easy to see how him being a veteran is not a far reaching theory. But what if PTSD wasn't the only mental disorder he came back with?

Yesterday I learned about  [Witzelsucht](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76910/some-rare-instances-brain-damage-can-lead-joke-addiction), which translates to Joke Addiction. After a traumatic brain injury (which is definitely more than possible from war) scientists  have noted in rare occasions patients develop a compulsion to make jokes and puns. Regardless of the social circumstances, they made jokes which were often inappropriate. More importantly, they found their own jokes the most hilarious and would cause them to laugh uncontrollably.

This is a description of a patient from a second case study. He has been previously fired from his job for an inability to stop making jokes. Scientists  described how the patient "would frequently break out in laughter, almost cackling, at his own comments, opinions, or jokes". Does that not sound uncannily familiar?

We don't have a definitive identity on this Joker. What we do have is a man who very possibly served as a soldier as evidenced by his skills. What if while at war he sustained a traumatic brain injury, causing him to develop a compulsion to make jokes which he in particular found hilarious? This sounds exactly TDK's Joker. Right down to the cackling laugh. War literally caused The Joker.In reality, the Truman show would not do very well. People would probably switch on for the first episode, to see him being born, but after a few episodes of Truman doing nothing but crying and shitting himself, they'd probably get bored and turn off again.


They might switch on to see him take his first steps and say his first word, but ultimately Truman really couldn't be counted on to be interesting for the majority of the time until he was about eight— after all, how many really popular TV shows star toddlers? (And don't say Rugrats!) 


But even then it would probably fail, because the director seems to be really bad at actually making a good TV show. 


When it comes to dealing with main characters, there are two types of show. One type has multiple main characters and regularly switches focus so that the viewers don't get bored, and also often has B stories when the main story isn't enough to hold viewer attention (think *The Simpsons* or *Star Trek*). The other has only one main character, but makes up for it by either having that character be interesting, or by putting them in lots of interesting situations, or both (think *Doctor Who* or *Sherlock*).



The Truman show does neither of these things. The whole gimmick is that Truman is the only one worth watching— nobody's going to want them to turn the camera away from Truman having a nap so that they can go to Marlon searching for Lincoln's gold— and they seem to be deliberatley trying to minimise drama.


Apart from the 'Dad drowning' episode, which seems to have just been to keep Truman on the island, the only other bit of drama we see that isn't related to Truman discovering the truth, is the scene back in high school when he falls for Sylvia. 


That should have been brilliant for the directors, and yet their reaction was to forbid Sylvia from talking to Truman and then get her out. I mean, Truman just set them up for a love triangle story and their reaction was to end it so that they could get back to the typical 'boy meets girl' one.


In fact, why did Meryl even marry Truman? In a real life version she'd have left him at the altar or cheated on him with Marlon so that the show could show Truman reacting to that.


Instead, everybody's just *really* happy, and happy people going about their daily lives shouldn't make good television. Certainly not television so good that the whole world watches, so why are people tuning in?


'Comfort', we're told, but comfort from what?



Well, my theory is that something happened to the world around the show. Probably overpopulation, since that would explain why a TV show was allowed to adopt a baby (there are so many babies in the world that there was virtually no hope of finding him a real home) and how the show can afford so many actors (the job market is so bad that people are willing to live entire fake lives for fairly cheap prices).


Apart from the existence of the show, other evidence for this is Sylvia's badge: 'How will it end?'


We're supposed to assume that this applies to the show, but really this doesn't make sense. Everybody in this universe knows how the show will end— either Truman will die of old age, or he will produce a child that will be brought up in a spin-off. 


In fact, the message refers to the already crumbling world.


The over crowding has lead to a world where people feel like they don't matter— look at the audience of the show, one guy spends what looks like days just sitting in his bath tub, doesn't he have a job or a family? 


It would also mean that small town living, where you only have a few people living in an area, would basically vanish. Every small town would get absorbed by the cities.


That's why people watch the Truman show. A show about a guy who lives in an idyllic small town ("Seahaven is how he world should be") and goes through life events that, before, would have been ordinary, but are now a novelty. People are riveted watching Truman sell insurance, because their own jobs have loads more people working for them and are incredibly stressful because of that and because the high population means that anyone can be replaced. Somebody finding their job fairly easy is a relic of a bygone era. People like to leave him on all night because they are living vicariously through him.



That is the only way I think you could get anyone to watch a real life Truman Show.


EDIT: More evidence is the fact that the whole Seahaven dome thing was even necessary. If they lived in a world where people still lived in places like Seahaven, then why not just go there and put up cameras?

As it's Marvel Monday, and given that Stan Lee was a major contributor, editor, and chairman to and of Marvel Studios for many years, it's only fitting that we, the mod team of r/fantheories, have decided to post a megathread. 

RIP, Stan Lee. You will be missed. Steve Rogers will be the key to the Avengers’ victory against Thanos in Avengers 4. 

Furthermore, I think that for the better part of the last decade– the Steve Rogers we’ve come to know and love is not the Steve Rogers that landed that plane in the ice 70 years ago. 

How do I know this?

His hairline. 

This is not a meme or joke or anything of the sort. I legitimately wish to posit that Captain America's seemingly superficial hairline inconsistencies are evident of a deeper conspiracy, and contextualize the characterization of Steve Rogers thus far as he appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Infinity War spoilers ahead. 
___
When he first appears at the beginning of Captain America: The First Avenger, prior to being injected with the super soldier serum, his hairline is a bit obscured by his bangs, [that is until this shot right before he undergoes his transformation](http://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/-5eLijB0xisazahCHlalmfv0W18=/1400x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJUBIVJIB3ACMLBNSOHTXS4JNA.jpg)


If you look closely, you’ll notice he has a “normal” hairline. For the purposes of this theory, we’ll call this the **“M” hairline.**

Despite subtle changes in cut and style, the hairline itself remains the “normal” for the duration of the movie, meaning that he otherwise doesn’t show any distinct qualities of other hairline types, as evidenced by these screencaps:

[Exhibit A](https://gndn.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ce03.jpg?w=640)

[Exhibit B](https://media.giphy.com/media/13JJt8C3FEnrBS/giphy.gif)

The currently accepted understanding is that Captain America crashed the bomber into the ice, and his body was recovered some 70 years later, with the serum preventing him from experiencing aging. 

The film of course ending in present day, where he wakes up at [a SHIELD facility in New York City.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/plgniAt36YY/maxresdefault.jpg) 

When he makes his way outside, to Times Square, you’ll notice that [he longer has the **M Hairline**](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avengers/images/b/b9/Captain-America-First-Avengers-Times-Square-Ending.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150322075646&path-prefix=de), but a rounded one (hereinafter the **O hairline.**) 

This could be for a number of reasons, all with varying levels of plausibility, and we’ll get into those later, but if these hairlines are anything to go by:

**Present day Steve Rogers isn’t WWII Steve Rogers.**

_______

**The Evidence**

Captain America next appears in 2012’s The Avengers, a film which explores his character coping with assimilating to modern society.

But I am of the belief that he is assimilating for reasons other than adjusting to a new time period. What if he’s so unfamiliar with today’s culture not because he was on ice for a century, but because he’s not even the same person to begin with? 

1940s Steve, or Steve Prime as it were, was a man who despite his stature, was steadfast in his patriotism. When the opportunity presented itself, he imparted his love for his country onto the nation, using the WW2 American propaganda machine to become a symbol of truth, justice, and identity. Unlike Steve himself, those values were certainly not lost to the cold arctic, yet his disappearance left a large void in not only America, but the world at large. A void that could be filled by malicious actors. 

Steve Rogers has appeared in a Marvel film every year for the last 7 years, for a grand total of nearly 3 and a half hours of screen time. In that time, we saw Steve evolve from a borderline jingoistic boy scout hellbent on protecting the promise of the American dream, to a man willing do defend freedom at the cost of abandoning the very ideologies that shaped him. 

What we’ve long thought to be great writing and well crafted character development is merely a front for the suspect goings on that lurk beneath the squeaky clean exterior of the so called Star Spangled Man. And no amount of such development is as emphatically evident of this truth than the hairline of Steve Prime, and by proxy his present day counterpart, Other Steve. 

____

**Who is Other Steve?**

Other Steve is a man of many names, and many shapes. The first shape we see, going back to 2012’s The Avengers, is the earliest replacement of Steve Prime. 

[We first see him alone in a boxing gym, going to town on a punching bag.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyOOE7VkhgA) So much so that he knocks it off its chain, sending it flying across the room, and spilling it’s sandy innards about the gym floor. This is until his fit of rage is interrupted by Nick Fury. 

This new incarnation of Steve is much more antagonistic and forthright, making Steve Prime seem far more timid and reserved in comparison. 

The most striking trait though? His hairline. 



[This is where things really get fascinating. While once again obscured by some light bangs, you can see he still has the M hairline.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/e/e8/Steve_Avengers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120229205729) Yet, when he later convenes with the other Avengers at the SHIELD Helicarrier, he [very clearly has a widow’s peak.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zezy5u61bGM/maxresdefault.jpg)

This now gives us **3 separate hairlines**. 

[The M Hairline](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/captain-america-the-first-avenger-movie-image-62.jpg)
[The O Hairline](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avengers/images/b/b9/Captain-America-First-Avengers-Times-Square-Ending.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150322075646&path-prefix=de)
[The Widow’s Peak](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/a/a5/Captain_America_The_Avengers-01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120324222753)

That means 3 separate versions of Steve, right?

Not necessarily. 

[If you go back and look at Captain America The First Avenger, Steve seems to have the O Hairline when he’s landing the bomber plane.](http://cdn.wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/captain-america-chris-evans-photo4.jpg)

This implies that some sort of change took place prior to this event, but we’ll come back to this later. For now, there is only Steve Prime. Any alternate versions, and however numerous they are, will be referred to as Other Steve(s). 

The Avengers, of course, ends with the massive Battle of New York, wherein Captain America’s hair is covered by this [unsightly helmet for a large portion of it.](http://insessionfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-avengers-group-shot-585x329.jpg) As the battle progresses, he sheds his headgear, revealing not his newfound Widow’s Peak, [**but the return of the M Hairline**](https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/18/1600x800/landscape-1430497999-the-avengers-climax-captain-america-the-avengers-34726299-1920-1080.jpg?resize=768:*)

This means that either:
An Other Steve has achieved replication of Steve Prime’s hairline. 
It is Steve Prime himself

But once again, we’ll come back to this later. 

Without analyzing the rest of his filmography too intensely, over the next 5 or so films, we watch Steve grow more frustrated, ultimately leading to his rejection of the Captain America namesake in his most recent appearance; Avengers Infinity War. 

Over these films, his hairlines appear as follows. 
___
**Thor The Dark World**

-[O Hairline](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5aGLX4egWTg/maxresdefault.jpg)

It’s important to note that this appearance was only a short cameo, and was not Steve Rogers himself. Loki used his shapeshifting abilities to look like Cap as he appeared in The Avengers. What’s interesting is the fact that the form he took didn’t have his signature M Hairline or Widow’s Peak, but a hairstyle which hasn’t been seen since the end of Captain America The First Avenger. 


**Captain America: The Winter Soldier**

Having reviewed every appearance of the hairline, these changes beg the question: Why is this happening? And more importantly, why are there so many variations?
_____

**INFINITY WAR SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT FORWARD**

As I said previously, the first major change we see in Steve’s hairline is just before he lands the plane in the ice. Just moments prior to doing that, he confronts Red Skull. [He is helmeted at this point in time.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tTZdYw7Z9TQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

Refer to these two clips:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkSarCXjxmc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nxfP0d5EVQ

Red Skull, of course, most recently appeared in Avengers Infinity War, as the keeper of the Soul Stone. It is assumed that he came into such a position by using [the Tesseract to transport himself](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/marvel-studios-cinematic-universe/thumb/5/5e/Tesseract_3.jpg/468px-Tesseract_3.jpg) to Vormir, the world on which the stone is kept. 

Captain America doesn’t remove his helmet until Red Skull is long gone and the Tesseract is left behind. This is the first appearance of the O hairline. This is because Red Skull quite literally bent space and time with the Tesseract, causing different realities to splinter off, creating multiple realities in which everything is seemingly the same, except for one small change: Steve Rogers’ hairline. This is how Other Steves came to be. 

____

In 2016’s Doctor Strange, it is established that the MCU exists in a multiverse. A series of infinite but parallel realities. 

This point is further expanded upon in Infinity War, where Strange looks into the future in order to determine the possible timelines in which they defeat Thanos. 

There was only one. 

**The Steve Prime Timeline**.

The only constant across Captain America’s run in the MCU is the appearance of the M hairline. The M hairline, of course being the original hairline of Steve Prime. The films may meander in following various Other Steves, but they will always find their way back to their true master. Steve Prime. 

Doctor Strange knew this. 

And so does Thanos. 
 
Thanos tells Tony that he is not the only one cursed with knowledge. The MCU wiki confirms that the Soul Stone grants the user the ability to determine life and death, and more importantly to see inside a person’s soul, therein allowing them to tell Steve Prime from Other Steve. 

In order to wield such power, Thanos was required to sacrifice something he loved, that being his favorite daughter Gamora. We can assume Red Skull had to do the same in order to become the Stonekeeper. 

Johann Schmidt is a calculating man, who values dominion, power, but most of all he loves war. Some might say that Captain America was his greatest adversary of all, and in his bloodlust grew some sort of twisted yet honest affection for Steve Rogers as a combatant. So much so that when the time came for the Soul Stone to fall into his hands, he had to sacrifice what he loved the most, Steve himself. 

And so his quest for ultimate power, The Red Skull unwittingly created perhaps infinite variants of the very man who sought to end it. 

And in true HYDRA fashion–

Cut off one Steve Prime, and two Other Steves shall take its place.


This movie has been out for a couple years now, so I don't know if this is a cold take or not, but I've only just gotten around to seeing it.

The movie Midsommar is about a group of graduate students who are invited by a friend to visit a pagan commune in Sweden, called Harga. Murder-cult shenanigans ensue.

The exact age of the Harga community is never explicitly stated, but the film and the cultists themselves seem to imply that their traditions are part of a continuous cycle that has been carried down through the generations, dating back to at least pre-christian times. As a premise that's not entirely implausible, communities like that have existed, but in the case of the Harga in this movie I think that claim is patently baloney.

My theory is that the Harga were founded as a neo-pagan revivalist commune by Swedish fascists probably sometime in the mid 1920's, but possibly as late as 1945. My reasons are as follows:

&#x200B;

**Point 1: The Runes**

When the outsiders first arrive at the commune, Pelle (the native) takes them by an old runestone held sacred by the community. One of the group, Josh, makes a point of asking whether the runes are Younger Futhark or Medieval. Pelle says that they are in fact Elder Futhark, a fact that surprises Josh. Indeed, all of the runes shown in the movie as incorporated in the Harga's iconography, in their writing, on their clothing, etc are Elder Futhark. For Example, their dining table is arranged into the shape of the  ᛟ  Odal rune, which was only found in Elder Futhark and was phased out of use in around 700 ce when the script was pared down into Younger Futhark. Why is this suspicious? Wouldn't this indicate that the Harga must be super ancient? Actually, I think it means exactly the opposite.

See, the thing about Runes is that, like all forms of writing in active use over long periods, they evolved over time. Elder Futhark  (200-700ce) was in use throughout central and northern Europe during the Migration period, and scholars think it was probably derived in part from ancient Italic alphabets like Etruscan. Elder Futhark then became simplified into Younger Futhark during the Viking Period (700-1100 ce), and then with the introduction of Christianity to Scandinavia, the Runic alphabet began to be influenced by clerical Latin, so that they evolved into Medieval Futhorc (1100-1600 ce). One small community in the Dalarna province of Sweden continued writing in a variant of Medieval Futhorc up through the 19th century.

Having a community in Sweden that has been continuously using *Elder* Futhark is like having a community in modern Iraq that has been continuously using Cuneiform. They both fell out of use so long ago that we forgot how to read them until the mid 1800's when they were both reconstructed by philologists. The Harga haven't just been using the runes as symbols remember, their sacred texts, the Rubi Radr, are constantly being added to and read, and it's not like the Harga are some uncontacted lost tribe, they all speak Swedish (and even English) and have normal day-jobs in the outside world, why wouldn't their written language have changed in over 1300 years?

Is it theoretically possible that the Harga have, for some unknown reason, secretly kept Elder Futhark in continuous and unaltered use since the Migration Period? Possibly, but that seems to conflict with their attitude toward the sacred texts themselves, which are always changing and being added to.

What is much more likely is that the "ancient traditions" of the Harga are no older than 1865, when Elder Futhark was deciphered by Sophus Bugge, and are probably in fact much more recent.

This fact is significant, because it was in large part the revival in interest for Nordic/Germanic paganism (and Futhark) in the late 19th century that led to the development of Proto-Nazi Pseudohistory and Occultism. Appropriating and "reviving" old norse/germanic paganism was important to nazism and proto-nazism because antisemites finally caught on to the fact that Christianity actually does in fact have quite a lot of Jewish influence. This is why you see (bastardizations of) old runes on Nazi uniforms.

&#x200B;

**Point 2: The Eugenics**

Wrapped up in the all the flower-wreaths and love potions is what must be a very tightly controlled breeding program. The old man tells Josh in the temple that one extremely disabled child is (in)bred into existence every generation so that they can add to the sacred texts. First of all, while I'm sure they had some understanding that inbreeding makes people unhealthy, there's no way that Migration-era Swedes understood genetics to the extent that they could create severely disabled people, like the child we see in the movie, at will. Second of all, that's not how inbreeding works. Inbreeding leads to deformity and health problems over time by slowly compounding and compounding harmful traits over numerous generations. If the disabled child has the genes that caused him to develop that way, then so does everyone else in the commune. You wouldn't just have one deformed person and then have everyone else looking completely normal and seeming to be in perfect health, most of them would to a greater or lesser extent also have something wrong with them probably, if not similar physical deformities, then probably heart problems or something of that nature, yet all the Harga seem to expect to live to age 72.

These two factors, that they wouldn't have understood inbreeding so well (down to a science) in ancient times, and that none of the rest of the Harga (except Rubin) seem at all adversely affected by inbreeding, also lead me to conclude that the Harga must be a relatively recent creation.

Speaking of those healthy 72-year olds, you can dress the cliff-jumping up as "tradition" and "part of the cycle of life", but we outside of the Harga have a word for that kind of practice, and it's called Euthanasia. The original (putative) practice of throwing old people off of a cliff was something that was done in times of hunger when old people were unable to work. In this case, it's just "cleansing the unfit" from the community just because.

And then we have the racism thing. The group of visitors we follow in the movie are 3 white people and 3 POC. I think it is significant that the only 2 who are introduced into the Harga gene pool are white (Christian and Dani), and the 2 first people the Harga murder are POC (Simon and Connie). And I'm only assuming they didn't breed with the third white person (Mark), but it's possible the woman who led him away with "come hither eyes" did in fact have sex with him before he was killed offscreen. So that's Whites \~2.5, POC 0. Now you might well argue that the reason that Simon and Connie were killed first was because they tried to leave, and Josh was killed because he was poking around where he wasn't supposed to. But I would in turn point out that throughout the first act of the movie, before the killing starts, Christian, Dani, and Mark, the three white outsiders, are being either sexually or emotionally enticed on all sides. Meanwhile, no one ever brews a love potion for Simon, no one makes googly eyes at Josh, no one tries to hold space for whatever problems Connie is going through. I think it's clear that the three POC were always only brought along with the intention of being sacrificed without contributing to the Harga gene pool.

Even if that's too small and circumstantial a sample size to generalize about, how about the fact that we know the Harga pull in new blood periodically from all over the world (the current batch from the US and UK), and yet absolutely none of them look even a little bit mixed-race? Because, I would contend, they are White Supremacists, and their eugenics program does not allow for non-white people.

&#x200B;

**Point 3: The Timing**

Assuming that the events of the film take place in 2018, and the sacrifice-ritual takes place every 90 years as the cultists say, then the preceding sacrifice must have taken place in 1928. That must have also been the very first sacrifice ritual, because there couldn't have been one 90 years before that; as I said further up, the cult must have been founded sometime after Elder Futhark was deciphered in 1865.

Interesting thing about the year 1928, it's two years after Sweden's first official Fascist Political Party, the SFKO, was founded. It's worth noting that although Sweden was neutral in World War 2, there was a sizable group of nazi sympathizers in the country, and some of the founding members of Sweden's modern far-right party were former Nazis. Maybe it's a coincidence that a murderous death cult appropriating ancient nordic religion was created around the same time that a strain of murderous fascist politics appropriating ancient nordic religion was on the rise in Europe, maybe it's not.

Maybe there wasn't even a sacrifice in 1928, maybe the one we see in the movie is the first one they've ever actually done. After all, since none of the members are allowed to live past 72, none of them could have been alive for the last sacrifice 90 years ago.  I think the limiting factor then on how young the religion could be is the old couple we see jumping off the cliff. They are both 72, and it's safe to assume they were both raised in the community to be as indoctrinated as they are. Interestingly, at 72 years old in 2018, that means they were born in 1946, and probably then concieved in late 1945, shortly after the end of WW2 and the fall of the Third Reich.

We then have two interesting possibilities:

A) The Harga were established sometime in the 1920's, when Fascism was on the rise in Europe and a murderous strain of pagan revivalism was somewhat *in vogue*. The first ritual sacrifice in 1926 may have been proposed as the inauguration of a new era, "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" and all that.

B) The Harga were established either leading up to or shortly following the fall of the Third Reich in 1945, quite possibly as a way of taking what had previously been overt nazi occultism underground.


ETA: Something else that has just occurred to me, the literal meaning of the word “Holocaust” is the burning of an entire ritual offering. This is exactly what the Harga do at the end of the movie.So in the latest Spider-Man trailer it is revealed that Mysterio is working with Nick Fury and he has a backstory of being from another dimension who somehow got snapped in to the main MCU dimension and is there to fight the elemental monsters. 

Everyone expects the twist in the movie to be that Mysterio is actually a villain (like in the comics) and that he is somehow using his mastery of special effects to stage the disasters and make him look like a hero.

But i speculate that the big twist is that he is not really Quentin Beck (as he is introduced by Fury) but is actually Victor Von Doom. 

From the trailer it can be seen that there is actual destruction happening to the city. Illusions and special effects wouldn’t cause damage of that scale. So i assume that they are fighting actual physical elemental monsters, which i theorize could be robots of some sort. 

You can also see that Mysterio seems to be flying and shooting “mystical” energies at the monsters. 

Dr. Doom is not only a master inventor (capable of making giant robots) but a mystic who can rival Dr. Strange himself. 

Also the elementals they are fighting can represent Doom’s mortal enemies the Fantastic Four. Sandman creature could stand in for the Thing. Molten Man creature for the Human Torch. And the Hydro-Man one for Mr. Fantastic.

Now i know the Russos have said this move is an epilogue to Endgame and is not meant to start the next phase but the parallels to the FF seem a little close.Something curious about the first episode of the Mandalorian is the other bounty hunters having an order to kill the child, and the Client seeming to push the Mandalorian towards the same except for that the scientist had walked in.

The Client also says that it is good to restore the natural order of things with the beskar returned to the Mandalorian, despite apparently being part of the Empire which took it from them in the first place. He's also old enough to remember the pre-Empire days.

Then, he also pushes for the child to be killed when the Mandalorian first delivers it, with only the scientist protecting him.

Finally Moff Gideon guns him down, unceremoniously, which seems odd. Unless he knew the Client was trying to stop him, using his high ranking position to sabotage the Empire from within and make sure it never rose again.The reason why Vegeta will never beat Goku is because they are different types of fighters. 

Goku has been training all his life to be a duelist. He initially received training from master Roshi (a duelist and tournament champion) with the goal to win tournaments. Even his later training (Kami, King Kai etc) is focused on dealing with a single very powerful opponent, not a sizable group of enemies. The only time he ever faced a real army was when he fought the Red Ribbon, who were just a bunch of assholes with ak47s (and lots of cheap vehicles) not powerful enemies (they were many but come on Goku IS bulletproof, they might as well be unarmed!). 

Vegeta on the other hand has been training to be a soldier. He received training from King Vegeta, Nappa (both soldiers) and Freeza (a conqueror). His early battles are against the armies of entire planets and he fought as part of a group like a soldier (or a special forces operative to be more precise). He often uses ki attacks like "Continuous Energy Bullet" which would obviously be devastating against a large group of weaker enemies and knows how to lead a group of soldiers (he often rallies the rest of the Z fighters, or knows how to "motivate" saibamen for example) EDIT1: Plus Vegeta has shown that he knows a thing or two about guerrilla warfare as he has exhibited during the first days he was on Namek (attack freeza troopers only when he has the advantage, use tactics that would force them to split their forces etc) EDIT2: Also if you think about it Vegeta's [current training regime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATjUxVNX0o) focuses on him fighting multiple enemies/being attacked by all sides.
 
My theory is that Goku vs Vegeta is like pitting a MMA champion against a navy SEAL. The MMA champion will obviously be better in 1vs1 combat, but the special forces guy has the skills and training necessary to fight and win a war.

TL:DR Vegeta is a soldier and Goku is a duelist, obviously in 1vs1 combat a duelist is far better.Let me start this off by  saying I haven't watched Fantastic Beasts, so I'm only going to include book 1-7 here.  
Basically, it seems odd that not a single outsider helped Magical Britain, not even neighboring countries who would be the most likely targets for Voldemort's conquest. However, it seems less odd when you consider the absolute shitshow that is Magical Britain that makes every single magical country just kinda roll their eyes when they read about them in the news.  


First off, the rise of two magical dictators in a relatively short amount of time, both with a vast amount of followers. Strong dark wizard's popping up isn't really the country's fault, but when both wizards are able to rally up hundreds of followers behind their flag of Muggle inferiority, it doesn't portray  the citizens in a good light, especially since Voldemort himself doesn't believe in all of the pure blood nonsense he talks about, he just see's that it's the easiest way to get followers in a country like Magical Britain. I can't remember the exact scene, but at one point Harry sees a statue inside the Ministry of Magic, which portrays wizards as dashing and gorgeous while the other races around them are all portrayed ugly. Hagrid talks about how he could find vampires and so on in other's countries pubs, and yet in Diagon Alley, its always filled with nothing but wizards ( exception being the bank )  


Secondly, the absolute corruption within Magical Britain is insane. How many ex Death Eaters are there inside the Ministry? How could a country let so many people who were once followers of Magic Hitler take up high ranking positions within the government? In book 5, Arthur Weasley talks about how Lucius pays off the minister to pass laws that he wants. Not to mention all the shady stuff that went on during Harry's hearing, intentionally trying to make Dumbledore not show up so that they could charge Harry as guilty. AND not to to mention how the only sources of news within Magical Britain is the equivalent of a magazine for flat earthers, and a newspaper that is so deep in the governments palm that they would happily run a smear campaign against a teenager in school.  


The entire country's children goes to only one school, which in theory should help foster unity among them, if not for the fact that the entire school system promotes division and inter-fighting. And lets not forget that one of the houses have a huge amount of children who believe in The Superior Pure Blood Race™. In fact, Salazar Slytherin, one of Britain's most famous historical figures, was the type of person to create an immortal giant snake that kills people who looks at it's eyes just so he could keep the mudbloods out of the school.  


Lastly, the entire country only has one prison. A prison that's literally a torture chamber. So basically, petty thieves and murderous Death Eaters all get to enjoy the Dementors presence all the same. Basically, the sheer amount of corruption and human rights violations within Magical Britain makes every single magical country in the world hate it, and they try to avoid contact with it as much as possible.  
   
We know that Maui “earns” his tattoos (he tells us this outright). Most of them are depictions of his great accomplishments, like slowing down the sun and pulling up islands. All of his tattoos are animated and move around his body, which presumably means none of them were given to him by traditional methods - which presumably means he earned ALL of them. 

&nbsp;

So how did he earn Mini Maui, the small tattoo version of himself that is constantly gloating and cheering Maui on while pushing him to help Moana? 

&nbsp;

Maui, a demi-god who was rejected by his human parents, spent much of his time before the events of Moana trying to please humans and make them love him. He lassoed the sun to stretch their days and bring them fun, harnessed the breeze to fill their sails and shake their trees, buried eel guts that sprouted a tree to give them coconuts, etc. All of these events became part of the tapestry on his skin, but I do not think he had his Mini Maui tattoo at this point. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, Maui went too far in trying to please the humans and got himself banished to an island for eternity. He had been there for quite a while by the time Moana found him, as shown by the tally marks carved into every surface of the island upon her arrival.

&nbsp;

Sometime between his banishment and Moana finding him, I think he had a spiritual moment/mental breakdown where he realized that none of the love and worship the humans had given him could replace the love he never got from his parents. Maui says, when recounting his seeking love from the humans that “it was never enough”. Eventually, Maui learned to replace the non-existent love from his human parents and “never-enough” love from the islander humans with love from the only human around - himself. Thus, Maui received a tattoo of himself that loves itself and is constantly flexing and showing all of the great things Maui has done.

&nbsp;

Like he says, Maui earns his tattoos, but him having the tattoo of being thrown overboard as a baby by his parents tells us that he can “earn” a tattoo without doing something classically heroic or legendary. In this case, he earned the tattoo of himself by learning to love himself. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

tldr; Maui says he earns all of his tattoos but has a tattoo of himself with unexplained origins that acs as Maui’s cheerleader. He earned it when, while in a long isolation, he learned to love himself despite a lifetime of rejection.Pretty simple and straightforward one. [Part of Wolverine's mutation is an extremely heightened sense of smell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/2jbhok/respect_wolverine/) 

Logan smokes cigars, known for their pungent odor, to help cut down from being overwhelmed by the thousands of smells he interacts with everyday that his mutant powers crank up to 11. 

Imagine being stuck in a new car, after stepping in dog shit, driving through a paper mill that was feshly painted... *all day*.While watching Pixar's Up I noticed young Ellie looks rather red in the cheeks during one of the scenes. That lead me down a rabbit hole remembering, incorrectly it would seem, that something like scarlet fever could cause infertility. But, it did point to a possible alternative that could cause her infertility.

Carl and Ellie seem to have spent a decent amount of time in their club house. Ellie more so as the club house appears to be well established by the time Carl meets her. They later buy and remodel the club house making it their home.

Carl is 78 when he begins his journey south according to the Disney [Fandom Wiki](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Up) and if the release date is "present day" for the journey Carl would have been born in the early 1930s.


[Prior to 1940 around 87% of homes used lead based paint](https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-sources-lead)


Lead exposure can cause [reproductive problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309352) in human reproductive systems by messing with hormones.


By playing in a home built prior to 1940 that was clearly in disrepair and then remodeling that home themselves both Ellie and Carl were likely exposed to a significant amount of lead dust and paint particles containing lead. Sadly, that acute lead exposure rendered Ellie infertile.  


It also may have been a cause of her death.  Lead is [stored in the bones](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html) and as your bones degrade with age that lead is released back into your blood stream.  One of the key symptoms is weakness.  Acute lead poisoning can lead to brain or kidney damage, and death.



Tldr: Ellie from the movie Up experienced high enough lead exposure to cause her infertility.

Edit: MathEven within the narrative of the series the Chudley Cannons are a laughably bad team. To the point where the team motto is literally "let's all just cross our fingers and hope for the best." So why is Ron such a die hard fan? He is one of the only charecters mentioned in canon to admire the team unironically despite being mocked for it. Well if the team is so bad than the merchandise and tickets to matches are likley dirt cheap. So much so that even the struggling mr weasly could likely spring for it on occasion. None of his siblings share his passion for the team but they were all talented  quidditch players in their own right when Ron was a toddler so they likley grew out of the team or never got into them in the first place. But I think as he was always desperate for attention from his family and any excuse to stand out Ron would have gravitated to the albeit subpar team that he shared with his father.Bear with me. I rewatched Elf last night for probably the 12th time and a few details made me realize that Buddy the Elf is capable of performing tasks within impossible time limits.

First, we find out that Buddy only makes about 85 etch-a-sketches a day while 1,000 are expected from the other elves (I’ll explain the elves later). This may seem like Buddy is slow, but in reality etch-a-sketches take some time to build from scratch https://gizmodo.com/how-to-make-your-own-diy-etch-a-sketch-509414911. It may take up to an hour for the average person to put together, even with all the material.

Secondly, when Buddy first meets his dad he says “I walked all day and night to find you.” The distance from New York City to the North Pole is roughly 3,000 miles depending on whether it’s by land (3,200) or water (2,800). Lets say Buddy left the North Pole in the morning and was in New York by the next afternoon. Assuming he didn’t use any other method of transportation, he would have been “walking” over 100 mph in order to make that time.

Next, the department store makeover. Buddy manages to decorate an entire store, Gimbels (Macy’s), in one night. He creates intricate paper snowflakes and other complicated paper directions, assembles full LEGO sets, perfectly places the pegs to spell out MERRY CHRISTMAS in lite brites, plus tons of other decorations like Christmas lights and spreading stuffing out to look like snow. Gimbels closed at 10:00 p.m. (Macy’s normal closing time) and he woke up in the window while his dad was going to work around 7:45 a.m. (I’m assuming this because it would have to be before the store opened and that would be right before business hours when his dad would be going to work.) This means that Buddy had to put all those decorations up within 9 hours, probably less depending on how long he was asleep. It would realistically take days for a normal man to decorate the store as good as Buddy did.

My final piece of evidence is the snowball fight. Not only does Buddy craft dozens of snowballs in seconds, but he is also able to move his arm at inhuman speeds to continually launch snow balls at their attackers. This is the only time we see his time manipulation from a human perspective.

Buddy doesn’t have control over his power. But whenever he is hyper focused (making things, going to find his dad, protecting his brother) he slows down time around him. This allows him to perform tasks at superhuman speeds. I believe Buddy somehow absorbed magical power throughout his life at the North Pole. All of the elves have this power, and to a greater degree than Buddy because they live for hundreds of years and have been there for generations. Santa possesses this power to an even greater degree which allows him to deliver presents to children all around the world in just one night.

Let me know if you have your thoughts or if you think there are other times he used his power.So I must have watched BTTF hundreds of times throughout my life. One scene in particular has always struck me as peculiar. I did some internet research on it and couldn't find any theories as to its importance so I wanted to throw it out there.   


Near the end of BTTF Doc is waiting on Marty to get done with the dance so they can send him back to 1985. Once Marty arrives Doc comments on him taking so long. Marty is excited and says he got to watch his old man knock out Biff and that he had never done that before. He then shows Doc the picture of him and his brother and sister that has been restored. Doc looks at the picture and asks "Never?". Marty says "No why?". Doc pauses for a second then says "Nothing." It always raised an eye brow for me, why would they waste time filming this small dialogue? The answer is, they didn't. 

&#x200B;

My theory is that Doc had a major epiphany in this scene. At that moment when he saw the restored picture of Marty and his brother and sister, he realized that you can completely change the past and still have a positive and congruent outcome on the future without destroying the space-time continuum. 

&#x200B;

You might be thinking "OK, so what?", except that this would've been what changed his entire outlook on time, made him rethink tearing up that letter, and gave him motivation to tape it back together. Up until then he viewed the space-time continuum as this fragile thing that could destroy the universe if not handled correctly. Everything had been doom and gloom as the picture was slowly fading. But then from a completely random act by Marty's father (an act that was never allowed to happen in the original timeline), everything was restored.  

&#x200B;

At the end Marty questions Doc about his change of heart and doc says "I figured what the hell." This scene shows the exact moment that doc figured it out. This makes more sense than having major character keep such strong convictions for 95% of a movie and then in the last 10 minutes decides to do an about face for seemingly no reason. This scene would add some more substance to that. And to be honest, Zemekis and Gale are better than that.

Thoughts? 

&#x200B;As insane as this sounds, I've done the research. It's plausible. The idea isn't original; it was first proposed by Carlyle Thompson, a professor of African American and American literature at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.

Gatsby is described by Nick, "his tanned skin" and "short hair look as though it were trimmed every day" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.

Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on "more than 40 acres of lawn and garden" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. "More than" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.

Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.

Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word "negro" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the "negro" part is the truth.

How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, "I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? "I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.

But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:

        ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white
        chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
        laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
        haughty rivalry.

        "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
        "anything at all. . . ."

        Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)

First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes "black."

According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, "Modish" means "Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable." In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.

There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is "M-a-v-r-o----," which is interesting, because "mavro" is Greek for "black."

One the same page, a "pale well-dressed negro" described the car, Gatsby's car, as "big" and "yellow." Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means "black mountain," which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as "high yellow" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a "black mountain" of a man, but he's also "high" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also "yellow."

Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:

        Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)

How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?

It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:

        I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)

        "We're all white here," murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)

Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.

The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.

It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

Tyson, Lois. Critical Theory Today: A User-friendly Guide. New York, NY: Routledge, 2008. Print.I have a theory from the world of Harry Potter. It has been stated that Lord Voldemort is possibly the most skilled Legilmens in the wizarding world. In the books, both Professor Snape and Narcissa Malfoy were able to hide their lies from Voldemort. Snape did so as part of his history as a triple agent who was really working for Dumbledore and The Order of The Phoenix, as well as when Narcissa lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead in the forest. There are some people who said that because of this Snape and Narcissa are perhaps the most accomplished Occlumens in the wizarding world since they were both able to hide their true intentions from Voldemort. I have a theory however that differs.

Firstly let us imagine that the act of mind-reading as walking through a series of corridors in a person's mind where there are doors that open to all the memories and desires within the person's mind. It has been stated many times before that both characters, Snape and Narcissa, acted out of love. Snape was motivated by his love for Lily Potter, and Narcissa was motivated by the love for her son Draco. (Let us not forget that the magic power of a mother's love was the start of the whole saga between Harry and Voldemort). It has been stated many times that because Tom Riddle was conceived out of a loveless union between Tom Riddle Sr. and Merope Gaunt and also because his mother died just as he was born he never experienced love and does not understand love at all.

Now in the first book when Harry and Hagrid are in London and about to enter The Leaky Cauldron, Harry notices that the non-wizard people walking past seem not to notice the entrance. They have no perception of magic whatsoever, just as Voldemort has no concept of knowledge of or appreciation for love himself.

So going back to the image of reading a person's mind and walking through the corridors of the mind looking at the doorways that lead to memories and intentions. Imagine a trip through Snape's mind. We might see a door with a carving of a young Severus Snape crying as he sees his father beating his mother. Voldemort would see that. We see a door with a young Snape shaking hands with a young Lucius Malfoy after being sorted into Slytherin. Voldemort would see that as well. We see a large elaborate door with golden handles and intricate carvings featuring the image of Lily Potter. Just like the Muggles on that London street, Voldemort would not even be able to perceive it. He would walk right past. Likewise for Narcissa, if Voldemort took a walk through her mind he would walk past the door with a carving of Narcissa cradling a newborn baby Draco, and not perceive it.

The point that I am making is that it is said that for Narcissa and Snape to hide their true motives from other witches and wizards, they would have had to have been great Occlumens, which could be true, at least for Snape. However, with respect to Voldemort using Legilmency to discover their intentions, because of his inability to comprehend love, the secrets in their minds were never in any real danger of being discovered.The delivery driver asks for the pen back and I think John held on to it in case she was there to kill him and he needed a weapon as he opened the door unarmed.

It's extra dialogue to write when he could've just signed for it and cut to the next scene. But he knows he hasn't ordered anything and people know he wants to be alone. He is grieving but John Wick seems to be able to control his emotions enough to not be forgetful about holding on to the pen.In this alternate timeline, due to certain events being slightly different, super soldier serum never being invented, Steve not getting in etc.

This is why Johnny Storm shares an uncanny resemblance to MCUs Steve Rogers.Vader's voice is not simply an amplified version on what he says, its more like a Stephen Hawking system whereby a computer recognizes what Vader is trying to say (His voice is probably extremely damaged and unrecognizable), then basically says it for him. This is why his voice does not sound like a normal person. 

OK, so he wakes up with the Emperor and within a few seconds is told that not only is his body completely destroyed making him almost a slave to his suit and by extension, the Emperor; The entire motivation for all that led him to this point, his wife, is dead because of his actions and her unborn child is also lost. Vader breaks free of the operating table and takes a few steps before doing the only thing anybody in his position could do, he screams an unholy, bloodcurdling scream. His vocal computer has nothing close to this sound in its database so it translates it to the infamous 'Noooooooooo'. 

If you think about the scene in these terms it actually adds to the tragedy of Vader. Even his agonized scream is now entirely reliant on machinery. 

The prequels are obviously a disaster, but I thought this scene was perfect. Put yourself in Vader's shoes, what would you say in that situation?

TL/DR: Vader wasn't saying 'Nooooo', he was screaming an untranslatable, horrible, soul destroying scream. His suit understood him to be saying 'Nooooo'.


EDIT: To the people saying I'm wrong because Lucas is just dumb and that's not what he meant, well yeah I know that's not what he meant. I don't give directors or authors any special consideration once the films/books are complete. To me whats canon is everything in the films+any other theory that makes the fictional universe more fascinating for me. If Lucas says something that adds to my enjoyment of Star Wars, Ill accept it, if he says something that detracts from my enjoyment, I'll reject it. Like I said, no special consideration.

As an example of this concept, a few years ago J.K Rowling said that Dumbledore was gay. You may think otherwise but to me, this seemed completely unnecessary to the story and also seemed like a cheap way to pander to the LGBT community. In my mind, Dumbledore was more or less asexual. He was a hero and his sexual preference adds nothing to my enjoyment of the series. I don't need to picture Dumbledore bumming dudes, I don't need to picture Dumbledore bumming girls, I don't need to picture Dumbledore bumming anybody; so in my mind, he doesn't. You feel me?Now this isn't about why Michael Myers is evil, or why he kills in general, but is specifically about why he was pushed over the edge on the specific night he killed his sister.

In the opening scene, you can see Michael spying on Judith and her boyfriend, and the boyfriend pulls out a clown mask to spook Judith. A minute later, Michael picks up that mask and wears it when he kills her.

BUT when we cut away to finally reveal the boy behind the mask, he's in a full body clown costume. It seems as though the mask was part of his outfit all along - so why did Judith's boyfriend have it instead of Michael? Obvious answer is obvious: the bratty teens stole Michael's mask as a joke.

Given the mask's prominent role in the scene, it makes sense that this was the final straw to push him over the edge. After all, it wouldn't take much for the personification of evil itself.I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/amfd93/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and_he/)):

**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!" 

The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his "first step" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross. 

**A point that just occurred to me:**

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully.Walkers, Roamers, Biters, Geeks. For those of you who didn't know the reason they don't call them zombie is because such a thing doesn't exist in the pop culture of the Walking Dead universe. But wait, zombies aren't an invention of pop culture, they were part of Haitian folklore long before Romero got behind a camera, and those tales have their routes in African folklore. As the slave trade spread people around it spread their folklore too, but the Walking Dead seems to exist in a universe where that legends never spread.

There's a running joke/criticism among a number of fans about how the show can only have one black male at a time. In a group that usually over a dozen people they only have one or two black characters at a time. This ratio would make sense if the Walking Dead took place in the Midwest but Atlanta, Georgia? Even the walkers are disproportionately white for a city that was 54% black as of 2010. It's almost their version of Atlanta is one where there isn't a large African American population.In the first Avengers movie, Bruce mentions attempting suicide by shooting himself, and how The Hulk spat the bullet out. This references a deleted scene in "The Incredible Hulk" where Banner travels far North into glaciers and attempts to kill himself, this angers The Hulk, who smashes the ice. 

Inside the ice, you can see a hidden Captain America shield that is uncovered. This, however isn't how Cap is actually found in the main MCU timeline.

[A zoomed-in view of Cap in the ice](https://i.redd.it/9gyqvh4t0op21.png)

**The Twist:**

If Steve Rogers/Captain America not only went back in time, but to a different timeline at the end of Endgame, (as he is officially said to have done), then that means that there are TWO Steve Rogers' in that alternate timeline; one from the main MCU timeline, and one still in the ice when main MCU Steve arrived (possibly kept there as backup by "main" Steve).

The deleted scene of Hulk unearthing Cap from the ice, might actually be a scene from the *other* timeline Steve travelled to, and that is the "original" Cap from *that* timeline who we see being uncovered.

 In the deleted Incredible Hulk scene, he doesn't put the gun in his mouth, but instead just his head in general, which makes it slightly different to how Banner described it in The Avengers.

[Bruce Banner describes his suicide attempt [MCU]](https://youtu.be/IYPodDJMjOY)

In fact, the entire "Incredible Hulk" movie could simply be parallel/similar events to what happened in the main MCU timeline, which would also account for the different actors playing Bruce Banner.

[Alternate Universe Bruce Banner Suicide Attempt ](https://youtu.be/1iRxzMFMgWY)

One of the changes to Cap's arrival in the 40s of *that* timeline was something as simple as Bruce being born of a different sperm cell due to being conceived at a slightly different time, and thus having different features but still living a mostly parallel life (with some minor differences).

One Bruce chose to put the gun in his mouth, which made The Hulk spit it out [MCU Bruce]; 

-and one tried to shoot himself in the head but hesitated, allowing an enraged Hulk to smash a large area of ice in a way which uncovered *a* frozen Captain America, [Alternate Timeline Bruce & Alternate Timeline Steve Rogers Popsicle].


**Conclusion:**

This is a pretty straight-forward explanation for the different actors playing the same character, as well as the differences between how we see that scene and how it is described...all while playing with the rules/ implications that have already been established in the MCU.

Seems plausible.


**Afterthought:**

Perhaps having an extra Steve Rogers around in the other timeline is what made the main MCU Steve feel comfortable finally retiring back in his own timeline; as shown in Endgame.

**Edits: typos/formatting/links**

-LDI believe that the upcoming MCU movies is setting up a group of villains that are alternate versions of the original 6 Avengers. Here are villains that could potentially fill the roles:


Black Widow:
The upcoming Black Widow movie is including a different Black Widow named Yelana Belova played by Florence Pugh. It’s unknown how moral she will be, but she is often portrayed immorally in the comics. I believe that she is an easy candidate for an evil Black Widow


Captain America:
The Black Widow movie is also introducing a Russian Captain America known as Red Guardian player by David Harbour. Having a significant portion of the Dark Avengers be Russian would provide a reason for a reverence for Red Guardian similar to Captain America’s. to I believe that the evil Cap will most likely be him, with a small chance of the evil Cap being any various evil Caps from the comics being introduced in Falcon and the Winter Soldier’s series such as U.S. Agent


Hawkeye:
Taskmaster is being introduced in the new Black Widow movie, and his powers include mimicking physical skills so he can easily learn to use the bow and arrow. The Hawkeye and Black Widow evil equivalents could even have a preexisting relationship like Hawkeye and Black Widow did in the first Avengers


Hulk:
I think the biggest two options for the Hulk is to either reintroduce Abomination to fill that role. While Abomination did help destroy Harlem, he could be portrayed to the public as a victim turned hero like the Hulk was. My preferred option is that it turns out Banner suppressed Hulk’s personality completely and something reactivates it and he is angry at Banner for suppressing him and we get an evil Hulk personality such as a Savage Hulk or Joe Fixit


Iron Man:
One obvious candidate for an evil Iron Man is Justin Hammer. He creates robot suits, and has worked with the Russians before with Whiplash. He also had the public eye already, and could have a similar celebrity status as Iron Man. Another candidate is a character being introduced in the Black Widow movie with the name of Melina. Melina was not given a last name yet, which leads me to believe her last name would be a spoiler. That spoiler would be the fact that she may be Melina Vostokoff also known as the Iron Maiden. While Iron Maiden doesn’t classically have a suit with flight and energy projection, but the MCU could easily add that to make her resemble Iron Man


Thor:
An evil Thor is the toughest to predict, but any of the upcoming movies outside of the Black Widow movie could plausible introduce an evil Thor. Eternals is introducing a pantheon of gods who could have one take the role, and fill the ethereal, mysterious, and powerful role that Thor does. Shang Chi will introduce some high level magic, and could have a magical character mimic Thor. Dr Strange 2 will deal with the multiverse and more high magic level characters. And Thor 4 could easily have an evil alternate Thor, especially if they dip into the multiverse to justify Jane Thor. Or they could even make Jane Thor evil as a twist, no idea how that would work but it’d be cool imo




EDIT:                                                                                        DON’T skip the comments they have some really great ideas that I didn’t mention, but I don’t want to edit them into my post because that would be stealing their creditDespite tales of Vader being charasmatic and charming, we see none of it in the movies. Instead we see a whiny boy, teenager, man get whatever he wants however he wants it.

The relationship between Padme and Anakin reminds me of the one between Jessica Jones and the Purple Man. Seemingly innocuous but utterly fake. 

At the start, not in control of his powers, kid Anakin subconsciously manipulates teenage Padme to like him, when he meets her again in the future, he imagines them together, broadcasting that thought into the Force, finally unknowingly using the ability constantly to manipulate Padme's mind when he is near her.

Outside of the relationship, Padme is a smart independent diplomat. But within it she's lacks capable thought and can't convince Anakin to do anything.

Finally on Muatafar a core concept is challenged, Anakin is a mass murderer and traitor, can she be forced to love him? The answer is yes, but Anakin realises, not unconditionally and therefore chokes her.A very unsettling detail I've noticed in the show is the alarmingly high amount of severed skulls that seem to be scattered about Peach Creek, especially in the Junkyard. In one episode, there was also a shoe with a bone sticking out of it at the bottom of the creek, which clearly implies that it is a severed foot. Numerous other very human-like bones appear in several episodes, though these may not be of human origin, unlike the skulls.

These skulls always appear in very isolated and hidden places, such as the vast, and cluttered junkyard, the overflowing dumpsters and buried underground. Clearly their placements in these locations was done with the intention of keeping them hidden. The severed foot in the creek downright screams foul play.

My theory is that there was or possibly still is, a serial killer active in Peach Creek. This killer's MO seems to be the dismembering of their victims (specifically through decapitation) and then disposing of their body parts in isolated locations around Peach Creek.

Just who is this Killer? Well in an Ed in the Bush, there was mention of a possible Boogeyman type figure known as the Bellybutton Eater. Given that both the Eds and the Urban Rangers (Rolf, Johnny and Jimmy) knew about this figure, implies to me that this Bellybutton Eater is a well known urban legend figure in Peach Creek, and given the Eds and Johnny and Jimmy's (Rolf's lack of fear could be explained due to not growing up in Peach Creek) extremely fearful reaction to it's supposed presence, indicates that it is a very feared figure amongst the Peach Creek youth. Could the "Bellybutton Eater" be the Cul-De-Sac kids' childlike interpretation of this very real Serial Killer?

Another, darker theory is that the serial killer could be someone the kids' know of. Possibly even a family member of our main trio...

***Eddy's Brother***

Eddy's older brother has clearly displayed sociopathic tendencies. Having viciously abused the much younger Eddy throughout his early childhood. Both Rolf and Kevin's extreme fear of him, could also strongly indicate that he may have behaved abusively towards them as well. Rolf also revealed that Eddy's Brother had done something horrific to his chickens, that has very likely traumatised Rolf. Cruelty towards animals, is a well known indicator of potential serial killers.

Eddy's Brother was implied to have behaved extremely antisocially during his time in Peach Creek, having influenced a lot of Eddy's own bad qualities. Eddy's Brother seemed to have engaged in very dangerous and outright cruel pranks, as well as scamming (which is just one of many bad influences he had on his younger brother).

It has been theorised that Eddy's Brother had been driven out of Peach Creek and is hiding from the law. Perhaps his murders had been found out? It also makes sense why Eddy's parents do not want him anywhere near his brother if this theory proves true, he is a legitimate threat to Eddy's life. It could also make sense why he chose to live in the amusement park, especially if it is abandoned (it looked pretty decrepit imo). Its isolated and he has a very easy place to dispose of his victims, the sea. Not to mention if it really is abandoned, it is likely nobody is aware of his residence there. He could also easily pack up and leave if the police get suspicious, and then return after the investigation dies down.

Another candidate for this Peach Creek Serial Killer is the unseen figure whom Eddy knocks out with that gag meat cleaver, after he throws it into the bushes. The guy was clearly stalking the Eds, I mean why else would he be watching a couple of unsupervised Preteens from behind some bushes? and right next to an abandoned factory and a forest no less?

Edit: A commentator has mentioned the creepy abandoned house in Honour Thy Ed. I completely forgot about it, it perfectly fits within my serial killer theory. The place was filled with secret passageways and booby traps. Definitely would be the perfect base of operations for a serial killer.

&#x200B;I got this idea while reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/kfdshq/the_grinch_if_the_whos_celebrate_christmas_does/).

Given that there is no Christian iconography other than Christmas-specific iconography (crosses/crucifixes, saints, prayer), and no churches, the Whos are a [Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) that heard of Christmas, but not Jesus.

From Wikipedia:

>A cargo cult is a millenarian belief system in which adherents perform rituals which they believe will cause a more technologically advanced society to deliver goods. These cults were first described in Melanesia in the wake of contact with allied military forces during the Second World War.

Santa Claus and his elves represent the technologically advanced society delivering goods.

I'd bet that one of the Whos was (a long time ago) tinkering with a radio contraption and picked up a bunch of human TV-broadcasts that occurred around Christmas-time (Christmas movies, TV shows, and advertisements involving holiday shopping and gift-giving), but they lacked the context to understand the religious basis for the holiday.

All they got was the consumerism and cheer - basically they got non-denominational American Pop-Culture Christmas where mom doesn't even make you go to church on Christmas eve.

When the naturally cheery and industrious society was presented with a belief system that encouraged their base nature, they took to it like a drug. The idea of Santa and his elves delivering goods was icing on the cake

There is no god in Whoville, there is only Christmas.

Edit: SpellingAs we can see in the film, the characters that come from another universe still retain their graphic style, for example: Penni Parker comes from an anime universe, and she retains her anime visual appearance despite being in a 3D universe, with Spider- Ham is the same. Adult Spiderman has a 3D look, therefore he comes from a universe that is also 3D. Let's remember the 2003 series, despite being very good it was canceled with only 13 episodes, the story of Peter Parker was not told, we could only see the typical, she is a teenager who likes photography, is in love with Mary Jane and her His parents died, but also he looks a lot like the adult Spiderman from Spider-Verse, the age agrees since in 2003 he was a teenager and in 2018 he would be an adult, also let's not forget that the 2003 series was made in 3d

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/BGeztyH.png](https://i.imgur.com/BGeztyH.png))Ever wonder why the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom is a "Princess"?

Why they never seem to have foreign invasions except when Bowser wrecks stuff up himself?

Why they never have an army, and princess peach doesn't seem to actually wield any political power(make royal decrees or anything)?

Here's my idea: Bowser, aka "King Koopa", is actually the king of a larger, "Koopa Kingdom," of which the Mushroom Kingdom is actually a protectorate or duchy of the Koopa Kingdom. Peach is effectively a duchess but is called "princess" as a matter of formality. Bowser is the one actually making the laws enforcing them, supplying the army to protect the kingdom from outside invasion, and hosting occasional pogroms to establish the dominance of the Koopa line..

Why is bowser always kidnapping Peach? It's established he wants to marry her at some point, but why her?

Well, the Duchy of Brittany was absorbed into France by a royal marriage between a prince of France and a duchess of Brittany. The duchess fought hard to maintain Brittany's autonomy, but as we all know, it no longer exists. Bowser is attempting this very same diplomatic trick.

But wait, there's more! In every Mario game, you presumably start in the mushroom kingdom, yet Bowser's forces are already there, patrolling. goombas, koopas, and then as you get closer to bowser's castle, that's where the stronger forces are. If peach is the ruler, why are all of the strongest military forces guarding Bowser's castle? Why are they all hostile to Mario? Nintendo's official documentation says that goombas are native inhabitants of the mushroom kingdom, so are they traitors? Or are they the loyalists, and Mario and Luigi are the ones rebelling against the king's attempts to consolidate his kingdom?It's been a while since I read the books so I'm not sure if my theory matches up with them. I've based the theory (mostly) on the films, and obviously there's a lot of **spoilers**.

I think everyone knows the eagle 'plot hole' in The Lord of the Rings. Why didn't they get the eagles to fly the ring to Mount Doom? My theory is that Gandalf had planned on doing exactly that. 

I'll explain chronologically.

Gandalf goes to Saruman looking for help after learning Frodos ring is the One Ring, they need to come up with a plan for destroying it. But Saruman reveals that he's working with Sauron and imprisons Gandalf for not joining him. Gandalf needs to escape and he also now knows he has to come up with a plan for destroying the ring by himself. When he thinks to get the eagles to help him escape it sparks the ideas that he could also have them help get the ring to Mordor. After all, he's not an idiot.

When he escapes on the eagle he doesn't go directly to Rivendell to meet the hobbits, he first goes to meet the eagles where the eagles live which we know from The Hobbit is in the northern parts of the Misty Mountains, on the eastern slopes. [Roughly here](http://i.imgur.com/oVZtc.jpg). 

Gandalf and the eagles discus the plan for the eagles to take Frodo and the ring to Mordor and the eagles agree to do it, even though it could be dangerous for them because of the nine dragons the Nazgûl ride - the only things in Saurons defences that could stand in the eagles way. But they would have the element of surprise and much greater numbers if they did end up having to fight the dragons. 

They see that their ability to fly is the only advantage Saurons enemies have against him and that this plan is the only plan that has any reasonable chance of success. Gandalf and the eagles agree that the plan should be kept very secret. If Sauron hears about it he'll realise the one weakness in his defences and quickly try to protect himself against it, and there goes the one advantage his enemies have.

Gandalf can't risk losing this advantage so he tells no one when he arrives at Rivendell. Nobody can know the plan until they reach the eagles and are flying on their way to Mordor because if they're captured they could have the plan tortured out of them - in the same way Gollum had the location of the ring tortured out of him. When they leave Rivendell they're a group of nine, not a just Frodo, Sam and himself like he'd planned for. But that's fine, he thinks, there are plenty of eagles to carry them.

Gandalf just has to get the fellowship to the other side of the Misty Mountains and go north to meet the eagles where they live, because meeting them anywhere else would mean a greater risk of being seen by the enemy. He can't take any chances of the his plan being discovered in any way and is being extremely careful because as far as he knows the survival of Middle Earth rests on the secrecy and success of his plan.

There are four main routes across the Misty Mountains, [they're marked on this map.](http://i.imgur.com/dMyLm.jpg) From north to south:

* High pass

* Redhorn pass

* Moria

* The Gap of Rohan

Being closest to the eagles the High pass would have been ideal for Gandalfs plan, but he decided against it because it was the obvious route for crossing the mountains (for whatever plan they might have) so Saruman was watching it. It was also infested with goblins and orcs who could see them travelling north after the pass, inform Sauron or Saruman who might then realise they were going north to meet the eagles thus discovering the plan.

The next most northern pass is what Gandalf settled for, even though it's a very dangerous pass and even though it would mean a long journey north to meet the eagles, it is still the safest route for his plan to remain secret and that is all that's important to him now. Keeping his plan secret was the main reason for him choosing the Redhorn pass. But Saruman was watching here too and sent storms to stop them.

The Gap of Rohan would take them far too close to Isengard, and more importantly too far south. Which was no good for the plan as they'd have to travel the whole length of the Misty Mountains up the eastern side to meet the eagles. So the Gap wasn't an option for Gandalf and the only way left was Moria. Which he didn't like at all and we see he's very reluctant. We think it's only because of the Balrog but it's also because of the risk of goblins and orcs seeing them go north on the eastern side (like the High pass) and because it was further south than he'd planned for which meant it would take longer to reach the eagles.

They almost get through Moria but Gandalf ends up fighting the Balrog and falling down the chasm. When he's about to fall he realises he has to tell them the eagle plan quickly before he falls, and in a way that any nearby orcs and golbins won't understand. He says ''Fly, you fools'' hoping at least one of the fellowship understands what he really means... but they don't. He falls and fights the Balrog. Meanwhile the fellowship escapes Moria and carries on with the only plan they've known - get the ring to Mordor.

Gandalf the Grey dies in the battle against the Balrog, but he comes back later as Gandalf the White. When he comes back he has forgotten a lot of things about his previous life. Even his own name, until he's reminded of it when Aragorn calls him Gandalf. *And he even forgot his plan to meet the eagles.*

At the end when he needs to get Frodo and Sam away from the erupting Mount Doom he knows only one way to do it - calling the eagles to fly them out of there. This is when he remembers the plan, calling the eagles reminds him of it in the same way Aragorn calling him Gandalf reminded him of his name. But by this time the ring is destroyed and the plan is redundant.

**TL;DR** (I don't blame you) Gandalf secretly planned on taking the fellowship to where the eagles live and having the eagles fly them to Mordor. The eagles lived on the other side of the Misty Mountains but all the routes for crossing them were too dangerous and difficult, and Gandalf (along with his secret plan) ends up falling down a chasm in a battle with the Balrog. Just before falling with the Balrog he tries to surreptitiously tell them the secret plan but was too surreptitious and they didn't understand. When he came back as Gandalf the White he had forgotten many things, including the plan to meet the eagles.As you might know, WandaVision (S01E07) is the first episode that contains a mid-credit scene; I believe that this happens because the show is now in the 2000-2010 era, and that is when the mid-credit scenes started being used in the MCU and pop culture.While your opinion on Scar might vary from Tyrant usurper to hero of the desenfranchised, is hard to argue that he was a good ruler, after all the pridelands fell to drought and famine after he allowed the hyenas to hunt the herds away.

Or was he? After all, there is being a bad ruler, and there is being such a terrible ruler than the rivers dry and the rains refuse to fall, that seems a bit too much for a mortal ruler doesn't it? But it does fall under the umbrella of a witch doctor.

During the movie we see him do obviously supernatural things, in particular the whole spirit quest with Mufasa, so let's look at the pridelands, it's a green Oasis of life sorrounded by desert, and as majestic as the pride rock is it's not enough to bring rain to the area, so what does? 

After Mufasa dies, Rafiki hangs his staff and stops taking part in the realm's politics, and once Simba returns he takes up his staff again and suddenly lightning strikes the pride rock and the clouds return. (Very obvious in the new version)

I think Rafiki was always the real power behind the throne, and Scar did not know of his importance since he was never prepared to rule and ended up driving him away, thus Rafiki stopped summoning the rains to undermine his rule, and once a more malleable candidate to the throne appears he uses his power to destroy his enemies.It’s heavily implied in Logan that Xavier killed the X-Men due to his old age and mind. However, we never really get a clear answer to why Xavier resents Wolverine so much, with quotes like “Logan... What did you do?” and “What a disappointment you are.”

My theory is that Xavier’s attack nearly killed the X-Men but the damage was done and couldn’t be reversed, Wolverine killed each of the X-Men to end their suffering. Xavier, being the pacifist he has been through the series, was strongly against this. Ever since then Xavier has had some resentment towards Wolverine.We all know the aerial and destructive capabilities of an Iron Man suit aka War Machine. With these advantages Tony can pretty much just carpet bomb his opponent and levitates in safe distance. So why in almost every fight (especially later on in the franchise) did Iron Man choose to fight hand to hand? The answer I believe is because of his admiration towards Captain America and the desire to imitate his and his dad’s hero. 

Howard Stark has been a die hard fan of cap since Tony was a child. In Civil War Tony even mentioned his dad talked about Cap for thousands of times. So in the beginning when Tony and Cap first met, Tony was already using quite a lot of hand to hand combat, albeit he still prefers to use energy projections. And the evolution of his fighting continues as they know one another more and more. In the first Iron Man movie almost every attack orients around military weapons and energy projections (tank missiles, energy blasts), in the Avengers Tony started fighting more on land (landing a blast reflection on Cap’s shield), he fought hulk wwe style in Age of Ultron, and the famous fist fight in Civil War against Cap and Bucky. At this point Tony and Steve has already developed from a faint acknowledgement to a respectable rivalry against one another, so as a child that has always lived in the shadow of this unshakable symbol of righteousness, his style consistently evolves to catch up to his hero, but Tony will never admit it. 

This is why in Infinity War and Endgame Tony uses hand to hand combats and piercing weapons for the most part against some of the strongest alien forces like Corvus Glaive, Ebony Maw and Thanos. He wants to fight fair and square in risk of his protections just like Cap always did, and with the most advanced Earth-made suit in the world, Tony is able to analysis his opponent’s fight patterns and hold his own against some of the strongest foes in the Universe, all to show his worthiness to his childhood hero, and now his most trusted friend.Emmet obviously symbolizes the kid throughout the story. He obviously has a crush on Lucy from the start and reacts only in the way a kid with his first crush acts, a deer in the head lights. He then finds out she has a boyfriend who turns out to be Batman. 

 Since he imagines Lucy with Batman she must have a lunch bag or sweatshirt or some item with Batman on it. As a young kid he compares himself in the shadow of Batman but learns that like Batman he can save the world too. 
Just as the title says. Kramer never talks or worries about money. Even when he gets mugged, he's more annoyed that he had to go to the bathroom at the time. 


If the Mad About You connection is to be believed, we know Kramer is renting from Paul Reiser's character. So he must be sitting on a lot of money. 


I think the only mention of the source of Kramer's wealth is from George, who says "People should pay $2000 to live like him for a week. Do nothing, **fall ass-backwards into money**, mooch off your friends, and have sex without dating." So at some point, Kramer came into a large sum of money. 

It could be from a lawsuit settlement, but we know Kramer is not good at negotiating those (from the cafe latte episode). It could come from inheritance, but Kramer's only mention of family is his mother who was a maid, if I recall. Likely she would have gotten any inheritance before Kramer did.From the first time the darksaber showed up in the Clone Wars, it was pretty clearly unique. Unlike normal lightsabers, which generally have a long blade, glowing white center, and colored edges (generally blue, green, or red with a few exceptions), the darksaber is shorter, shaped almost like a machete, and is almost completely black, with glowing white edges, and white flashes of energy across it.

The Darksaber was created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian to become a Jedi. It's completely unique, and no other lightsaber before or since has looked like it. So, why does it look that way? 

**Tarre Vizsla used Beskar rather than a kyber crystal to power the darksaber.**

Other Jedi and Sith have used material other than kyber for their lightsabers, and had it work fine. The main requirement for each seems to be that it's capable of redirecting energy efficiently, something beskar can do well. However, Beskar is unable to refract light like a crystal, causing the saber to lack the glowing pure white core of a lightsaber.

It also explains why the lightsaber is so important to Mandalorians. It was explained that Tarre Vizsla was an important figure, as he managed to be a bridge between Mandalorians and Jedi, mixing parts of the two cultures together. What better way to do that then by combining the ultimate symbol of the Jedi, and ultimate symbol of the Mandalorians?So ill keep this short and there's really not much evidence, but when donkey asks Shrek what his name is, Shrek hesitates for a few seconds before answering.  He says, "Uhhh..." like he has to think about it. So I think that either Shrek didn't have a name and came up with it on the spot or it had simply been so long since anyone asked him that he had forgotten.  What do you guys think?

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Apparently there is a Broadway play that shows Shrek at a young age with his name. Someone else in this thread pointed out that it was likely that he hasn't been asked his name in years. I actually like this more than him not knowing his name, as it has more weight behind it and also adds to the loneliness and isolation that Shrek had lived in prior to his adventure with donkey.  In The Chamber of Secrets, we are lead to believe that the Basilisk killed Myrtle, but all of it's subsequent victims had only been petrified, because  they didn't look it in the eyes directly, only seeing it's reflecting or seeing it through a ghost. 

It is later revealed that Voldemort's diary is a Horcrux, and that in order to make a Horcrux, one must commit murder. Myrtle is the supposed victim of murder to create the Horcrux in the diary, but she was killed by the Basilisk, wasn't she? 

Myrtle is known for wearing glasses. My theory is that she saw the Basilisk through her glasses and is petrified. Tom Riddle then brings her into the Chamber of Secrets, uses her to make his first Horcrux, and dumps her back in the bathroom.At first glance, Quidditch makes absolutely no sense. The Snitch is worth so many points that you start to wonder why anyone else bothers to play at all. Of all the games we see at Hogwarts, almost each one is won by whoever catches the Snitch, so the efforts of the other players are basically meaningless.

The fundamental problem with the Snitch is that it gives you 150 points and **ends the game**. So either you catch it and win instantly no matter who was leading, or you’re supposed to *not* catch it and keep playing. Seems a bit crazy. If you’re far behind, the game should just end. It makes no sense to keep going until someone catches the Snitch if you already know who will win.

Actually, it makes no sense to keep going, period. It’s absurd that a game can just keep going for days. Who is still watching that? How do you plan these things? Who goes to a game when they have no idea how long it will last? Does Hogwarts start to cancel classes if a match keeps going?

But there is a way to fix all of this. And it doesn't require changing the rules at all. We just need to ask ourselves one simple question: what is the speed of the Snitch?

Think about it. We see that brooms are getting faster and faster, so does this mean that the Snitch gets caught earlier and earlier? We’re not seeing anything like that. Old games would have to be crazy long and new games would get incredibly short. But this is not the case. We know that the last World Cup (1990) lasted five days (Ron mentions this in book 4).

When Harry gets his new broom, the games do not get incredibly short all of a sudden. Harry upgrades to a Firebolt, which is mentioned to be way faster than the Nimbus, but he does not capture the Snitch much earlier. He does during *practice*, but not during the game itself. That would make sense if the Snitch was tweaked to Harry’s broom for the game (but not for practice of course). It would also explain why Hogwarts matches (which feature less expensive, slower brooms) aren’t way longer than professional matches.

It would also explain why every game features a different Snitch. We know it does, because Harry inherits the first Snitch he ever caught, so it’s never used after that one game. And Hermione mentions that Snitches have flesh memories and aren’t touched before a game, not even by their maker. So there is a ‘maker’ that could tweak its speed. And that speed would have to be slightly different for each game based on the players involved. Hogwarts matches feature a slower Snitch.

It would also explain the length of the match. By balancing the speed of the Snitch, you could make sure that most games last a couple hours. There will be games that last days or minutes, but those are the exceptions. The Snitch can effectively control how long a regular game will last.

But why stop there? What if the Snitch, which seems to unbalance the entire game, is actually the exact thing that balances it? What if it favored whichever team was ahead? If you’re ahead a little, you’ll gain a slight advantage. If you’re ahead a lot, the advantage grows bigger.

That would explain a lot. We wouldn’t have a ton of cases where the Snitch changes the outcome of the game, since the team that is ahead would usually catch it. So there won’t be a ton of frustration that the Snitch completely invalidated the rest of the game, since this only happens if one seeker is much better. The other players would actually have something to do, since the more goals they score, the easier it becomes for their seeker to catch the Snitch.

The situation with Krum would be very unusual, since the Snitch would already favor the other team a lot before they ever reached a 160 point lead. Long games would happen if neither team had a large lead, causing the Snitch to favor neither team. We don’t get pointless games with one team 600 points ahead that just keep going.

There is actually quite a lot of evidence for this theory. If we look at the World Cup for example, we see the following passage:

>“Look at Lynch!” Harry yelled.  
>  
>For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing.  
>  
>“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it! Look at him go!”

Interesting, isn’t it? We’ve gone on for page upon page of how amazing Krum is, but despite this, Lynch is the one who actually sees the Snitch first. Coincidence? Or is his team so far ahead that the Snitch will basically present itself to him?

Lynch almost catches the Snitch the exact moment that his team is 160 points ahead. If the Snitch favored the team that was ahead based upon how far they were ahead, 160 would be a logical ‘maximum favoring’. At this point, the Snitch will ‘present itself’ to the seeker. What Krum did is very unusual because the Snitch would favor the other team so much that only the best seeker in the world could still snatch it from them.

It also explains why Krum didn’t wait for his team to score 20 more points. At first at seems like they still had a realistic shot of winning by just waiting a little longer. But not if Krum knows that the Snitch will favor Ireland so much that at this point he won’t be able to stop them from catching it for much longer. It also explains why he did the crazy feints while they were trailing.

A similar thing happens in book 2. Slytherin is leading 60-0 due to their superior brooms, and then this happens:

>"Training for the ballet, Potter?" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was **hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear** \- and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it.

Well look at that. The Snitch was right next to Malfoy’s ear. You’d almost think that it began favoring Slytherin because they were sixty points ahead.

And it doesn’t stop there. In book 5, Slytherin is leading 40-10 when the following happens:

>But Harry had seen it at last: the tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch.  
>  
>He dived… In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry’s left, a green and silver blur lying flat on his broom...  
>  
>The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goalhoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands; **its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer**

So the Snitch just happened to favor Malfoy, whose team was ahead. Interesting.

After this, Harry gets banned from Quidditch, and the next match goes like this:

>*The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to* ***snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose***\*, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.\*  
>  
>*‘Good catch,’ Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.*  
>  
>*‘I was lucky,’ she shrugged. ‘It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Summerby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment.*

Again, the Snitch seems to be favoring Hufflepuff, who was leading. Once again, the game ends when one team was exactly 160 points ahead. And Ginny even says: it wasn’t a very fast Snitch. So the snitches do have a different speed? Well that makes sense. Ginny is using a slower broom than Harry. So the Snitch for her game would be slower.

But why is all this kept a secret? Well, by doing this, the magic of Quidditch is preserved. The audience will stay excited for the whole game, even if their team is trailing by 100 points. If they don’t know that the Snitch will favor the other team, then they can keep thinking that maybe they can pull off a win after all? It makes the audience think that each game is basically 50-50 no matter who’s ahead, without actually making the game 50-50 when one team is clearly leading.

Both Krum and Ginny realised how the Snitch works which is why they catch it and lose the game. But they stay silent, because they know that the Secret of the Snitch is what makes Quidditch such a magical game.

Edit: I missed one more match. The final match of the sixth year, when Gryffindor wins the cup. We do not see this match because Harry had detention and afterwards he's too busy kissing Ginny to ask about it. But right before he kisses Ginny, Ron says that the final score was 450-140. Which means that Gryffindor was ahead 300-140 right before they caught the Snitch, or exactly 160 points. Which means we have three matches that end right when one team gains a 160 point lead.Been working on this one for a while, full theory is here:

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for the positive feedback! And especially thank you to whoever popped by gold cherry. I really didn't expect to get such a great response to this.At the end of Chamber of Secrets, Harry tricks Lucius Malfoy into giving Dobby a sock and releasing the elf from servitude. Enraged, Lucius pulls out his wand and begins casting Avada Kedavra before being stopped by Dobby who proclaims "You shall not harm Harry Potter!" Many people have noticed that it makes no sense for Lucius to attempt to kill Harry for a multitude of reasons, but especially because they are at Hogwarts just outside Dumbledore's office. 

Despite Dobby's protective quote, I don't think Lucius intended to kill Harry at all, he intended to kill Dobby. Lucius is intelligent enough to understand how killing Harry would end poorly for him. Lucius also showed his disdain for Dobby numerous times throughout the film and it is made abundantly clear that he only ever saw Dobby as the Malfoy's servant, rather than a creature deserving of respect. Once Dobby had been freed, he had no use to Lucius. Enraged at losing his servant, Lucius planned to kill Dobby to tear away Dobby's newfound freedom as well as revenge/punishment to make Harry feel guilty for being the one "responsible" for Dobby's death.

Also, I'm aware that Lucius Malfoy's actor has said that the scene called for Lucius to begin casting a curse and that Avada Kedavra was the first curse he thought of in the moment.Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, to him Heisenberg would be best known for the uncertainty principle, which states that it isn't possible to know both the speed and location of an electron. 

When he gives this as his alias i s01e06 he is basically saying "you will never know who I am or where I am from". When Tuco eventually finds out his real name, Walt seems surprised, as if he thought it should be obvious to anyone that it was a fake name.

HOWEVER
Werner Heisenberg is also known for his work on the atomic bomb. A moment in history that caused irreversible change.

Likewise, when Walt chooses the name Heisenberg, he has reached the point of no return. There was no going back.


You might think I'm reading too much into this but how does that episode end? With a big explosion. 

Opinions welcome. This is my first attempt at a fan theory.


EDIT: 
In Season 2 Walt meets Jessie, Badger and Skinny Pete in the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History (Hat tip to aftersox and systemfolder) http://breakingbad.wikia.com/wiki/File:NMNSH.png

The same episode where Walt names himself Heisenberg also features him changing his image by shaving his head.

As Shaggorama said, Walt also chooses Heisenberg as a symbol of a having a double life, being one person at home and another to the criminal underworld.What if Voldermort wasn't tom riddle, but a combination of Tom riddle and Salazar Syltherin. Salazar sought immortality. In fact, Salazar's last confirmed act alive was concealing a baskilisk inside the chamber of secrets. What if, he concealed his soul within the baskilisk to prolong his life. The only thing he had to do then, was wait for a parseltongue, and lure him into the chamber. Tom riddle was a talented young wizard, not unlike harry himself

"If a monster existed, it was buried deep within."  -Slughorn (Half-blood Prince)

Riddle was never the same after he opened the chamber. Having disdain for half-bloods, being a half blood himself. Salazar shared that ideology, because he was a pure blooded wizard. It gets deeper when you examine all possible meanings of the prophecy read "*either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survive*" Harry potter himself is proof two souls can share a body, even if just in part. The prophecy is implied to pertain to Harry potter and Tom Riddle, but what if the true meaning was for Tom Riddle and Salazar himself, only the message was read too late and Salazar had already won.

Now, google a photo of tom riddle.

Now google a photo of Salazar syltherin.

Now you tell me who Lord Voldemort really is.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Futher reserch into the matter leaves me to continue with the fact that Tom Riddle was the "Hier of Slytherin" was it just a legacy he was inheriting or something much more sinister? Salazar was a practitioner of  "**Legilimency**", a powerful skill also well honed by Voldermort himself, with no record of Tom Riddle ever performing such a feat.

\----Honerable mentions in the comment section:----

&#x200B;

Abe\_Bettik:

1. Voldemort needed to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux. In your theory Slytherin has made not just one but two Horcruxes already (the Basilisk and Lord Voldemort) so there wouldn't really be a need for him to learn it.
2. Voldemort and Slythterin wete all about ego and prestige. If he were Slytherin reborn, he absolutely would have been telling people.

Ennovative: Wow that's actually a great rebuttal. with your 1st point, I believe that can be wrote around. Concealing your soul into something requires a sacrifice. Could he sacrifice himself in some way to latch his soul into the basilisk? OR Is there some other magic that could be used to permanently transform himself into the ageless basilisk. Either way, Now, for the basilisk to transfer his soul to tom riddle, there would need to be a sacrifice -- but we already have it don't we? Moaning Myrtle was she simply at the wrong place at the wrong time? or was there very much meaning to her death indeed...

That is interesting to me, is that Salazar's visage was home to the Basilisk. Was that too mere aesthetic touch or some elaborate guise as a resting place, waiting for the perfect vessel. Someone he knew he could manipulate AND communicate with.I know, the film's been out for a while, but I just rewatched it, and came up with this little theory.

At the very end of the film, when Dormammu pulls Kaecilius and his zealots up into the Dark Dimension, Strange says that Kaecilius "should've stolen the whole book because the warnings... the warnings come after the spell." Wong laughs at this, and it's a cute moment, since Wong didn't find any of Strange's jokes funny before.

I, however, have a small theory about this. 

For some background, earlier in the film, when Strange cracks some jokes with Wong, and sees Wong is unamused, he says people used to find him funny. And Wong asks him, "Did they work for you?" Strange rolls his eyes at this and leaves.

Now here's my theory.

Wong didn't think it was funny. He laughed because he works for Strange now. Strange was elevated to the rank of Master not long ago, making him Wong's superior.

That's my whole theory. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

TL;DR: Wong didn't laugh at Strange's joke at the end of the film. He laughed because Strange is now his boss and you've gotta laugh at your boss's jokes.One of the greatest Christmas movies has a huge plot hole: How does John McClane so quickly figure out that the man on the roof who claims to be Bill Clay is really Hans Gruber? 

This has been answered Doylelistically: [the screenwriter explained that](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1631390/one-major-die-hard-plot-hole-finally-has-been-explained-by-the-screenwriter), in a deleted scene, all the terrorists are given identical watches and synchronize them. McClane notices the identical watches after killing a few of them and then, in the roof scene, he sees “Bill” is wearing the same watch, and deduces he must be a terrorist, if not Hans himself. And when he hears “Bill” speak on the radio in his normal voice, he recognizes the voice as Hans.  

However, a deleted scene is not considered canon. *Therefore, your honor, I demand the “watch answer” be stricken from the record and ignored by the jury!*

So how to Watsonianly explain McClane instantly knowing Bill wasn’t who he claimed to be, despite his American accent and his name on the directory? 

My theory: the cigarette. 

Earlier in the film, McClane takes a pack of cigarettes from a dead terrorist. It’s the same pack that he later shares with “Bill.” 

McClane tells Powell that the terrorists are likely European, based on their clothing labels and... cigarettes. 

The cigarettes are in fact a French brand, Gauloises, which were famously strong and harsh tasting, especially to an American palate. 

Yet “Bill” takes the cigarette and puffs away without even so much as a raised eyebrow. 

This tipped off McClane that this man on the roof was not the timid employee he was claiming to be, and that’s why he then hands him an unloaded gun.When Walt is describing the study of Chemistry he gives his opinion on what it is, leading up to the phrase...

"It is Growth, then Decay, then Transformation"

The Growth in this could be Walt growing, in a purely straight forward sense of him ageing as we all do, or this could Growth in the sense of a cancer growth I.e Walts lung cancer that we soon find out he has,

Then we have Decay, this one seems relatively simple, the Decay of Walts health due to the cancer, also this could be the Decay of Walts quality of life, not health related, we see in the early scenes, his flat marriage, his teaching job where no one seems interested in what he has to say, the past accomplishments long ago, only remembered by plaques on the wall, the lack of respect at the Car Wash, and even Hank teasing him on not having any excitement in his life.

Then we have Transformation, Walt to Heisenberg, but also his life Transformation, Walt feels alive as Heisenberg his mundane life is a thing of the past, he is exhilarated in this new world he becomes wrapped up in, he has the excitement that Hank teased him about in the early scenes,

Chemistry - "It is Growth, then Decay, then Transformation"

Walt is Chemistry.

TLDR - Walt describes Chemistry in episode 1 saying "It is Growth, then Decay, then Transformation" Walt is Chemistry as he grows into Walt, decays with the cancer and transforms into Heisenberg.

Edit: Wow thank you everyone for the upvotes and the awards, I didn't expect this to go so crazy! I agree with the majority comments that this feels intentional, it just felt too good not to highlight an expanded version of this, factoring in not only Walt > Heisenberg but also the health and excitement elements!Ancient One could not see pass her own death so I imagine it’s the same for Strange as well. So, when he peers into the Eye of Agamoto, imagine it’s like a giant wall with 14000605 tv screens, like [the Architect from Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHZl2naX1Xk&t=00m33s). Each screen represents a possible future. He hits play. He watches all the screens at once. A few screens go black, and then a couple hundred more, and a couple thousand more, and then suddenly almost all of them go black. Strange watches in horror as the few remaining screens slowly flicker away like a Dothraki Horde >![against the Night King’s Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBCmrZAWe2I&t=01m52s)!<. He sits there hopelessly in a deafeningly silent pitch black void. Thanos truly is inevitable. Moments pass, then suddenly a couple screens come back on. He keeps watching. One by one they go black again, until there is just one single screen left playing. He fullscreens the window and he rewinds it all the way back until, boom, [he’s back on Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGKPfZTXHsc&t=00m14s). That worried look he gave Tony wasn’t because of the slim chance of winning, but because he basically sealed Tony’s fate. That one single screen left playing was essentially the last part of “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” played in reverse. All Strange needs to do now is hit play.


So when Tony asked him if this was the one, he just didn’t want to spoil the movie.Wong is afraid to use the time stone, citing fears of a paradox. While this too may have been a legitimate fear, he also feared being trimmed by the TVA. 

He stopped caring at the end because the earth was about to be destroyed anyway. And there's some changes the TVA is chill with. 

Also possible that of the 14 million futures Strange saw, at least a few involved them winning and celebrating, but the TVA killing that branch just because.We see that Hela was Mjolnir's original user before Thor was born. My theory is that Odin had Stormbreaker's mold ready for his future son/daughter if Hela followed in Odin's footsteps in becoming a benevolent ruler.The Time stone is one of the most powerful Infinity stones, we see it used in Dr Strange when Strange decided to defeat Dormammu using it. We know that he was in a time loop with Dormammu even though he hasn't properly used the stone before he was able to figure out a way. Now in the movie we only see like 10 - 15 loops but Nobody will give up that quickly... when asked the director told that Strange spent a good amount of time in the loop that he learn a lot about the stone and its power and we see Strange has improved a lot in Infinity War (Was one of the most powerful among others). Even though he could fight Maw... He fought Thanos very well ( If Thanos fought without the Gaunlet then Strange would have easily won the fight ).

In Titan Strange sits down and actually looks at 14,000,605 alternate future and that looks like he just spent only a minute or two doing it, now we don't know much about Time Stone and how it works but we know that he would have to look through time as if he is watching a movie or he couldn't have actually experienced it with loops and stuff to save him... either way he would have spent a lot of time.

14,000,605 x 3 hours (He would definitely spent more per timeline...maybe months in some.. but like in the movie lets take the 3 hours) = 42001815 hours which is **4795 years** round off to 5000 years

In those 5000 years he would have learned a shit ton of things and this is how he could even put up a fight with Thanos with **different kind of powers** and **specially without the stone** 

what do you think? I think he would be one of the main reason to defeat Thanos but One of the OG six Avengers will execute it... Probably Stark because he saved him even though he said he wouldn't.

77 days to go. lets wait and see.

Edit - Thanks for the Gold stranger. Who ever you are thank you. You made me happy and i hope you are happy :) Also this is my first proper theory here... I don't like theories because it kinda spoils the upcoming movies... Hope i can write some after Endgame.

He does this by using the hover board to slide along Biff's car. He gets the almanac from the car but only when they are in a long tunnel. Biff tries to run him down as there is no where to escape; but Doc Brown drops a rope of fliers at the end of the tunnel which Marty grabs and is lifted away from Biff's car. Now, the question is, how did Doc Brown know to drop that rope at that exact place? If he was hovering over Marty and Biff, wouldnt he just  float to the other side of the tunnel and wait for them to exit? How did he know Marty needed help? 

It is my contention that Marty *was* in fact run down by Biff at the end of that tunnel and killed. Doc Brown went back in time and dropped the rope so Marty could escape. Brown never told Marty this because Marty has shown himself to be too emotionally fragile to hear such news. Basically, Brown saw Marty's death and used the DeLorean to change it. 

 

**TL;DR: The statues in He Who Remains citadel and the timekeepers are based on the four cosmic entities that created the infinity stones at the beginning of time. Death, Infinity, Eternity, and Entropy The reason one is smashed is that it is Entropy, the representation of chaos and unpredictability, the one thing that “He Who Remains ” could never conquer in his “Sacred timeline.”** 

**The theory:**

**The beings from the dawn of time**

The four statues and the animatronic timekeepers are based on the four cosmic Entities from the beginning of time. Death, Infinity, Eternity, and Entropy. Only seen briefly in *Guardians of the Galaxy,* and mentioned in *Endgame,* These extremely powerful beings created the Infinity stones, the essences of existence. Each Entity embodied a key power of the universe. Powers “He Who Remains” would need to control the timeline.

This all seems a little bit of a stretch until you connect a few dots. “He who Remains” can go along the timeline. Even to the dawn of time, a piece of information guarded closely at the TVA.

I believe that He who remains went to the dawn of time, defeated and imprisoned the Cosmic Entities, and obtained the stones. He then places them where he needed them to be to complete his plan. 

**The Broken statue**

He who remains has lived for eons and has been able to gain control of a massive timeline. I believe that he did this by defeating the cosmic entities and taking control of their abilities. He has lived an extremely long life and had control of Death and the lives of millions.  He created a massive timeline with control of time itself, and in that timeline was an infinity of variations and timelines, which are Eternity and Infinity. Still, he was the one he could never gain control over….. Entropy.

**Here is the prestige. Entropy means lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.**

The one thing he could never control was chaos and unpredictability. It always foils his plans. Like poetry, it’s two Lokis, the gods of mischief,  chaos, and disorder that are the ones that ultimately bring down everything he has built.

**Entropy is the reason for the TVA**

The broken statue represents chaos and unpredictability.  The one cosmic being ‘He Who Remains” could not control, the one he may have broke in frustration as chaos always ruins his Sacred timeline, hence the whole reason for the TVA. The TVA was created to eliminate chaos and unpredictability. This, of course, is ironic because “He Who Remains meets his end at the hands of a god of mischief and chaos.In Season 7, Episode 25 of The Office, Creed takes over his new, albeit short lived, role as manager. In one of the scenes, Creed asks his executive assistant Jordan to “find out what language this is”, and proceeds to recite a crazy bit of what is seemingly [gibberish](https://youtu.be/CvDPxsGdYx4). But what if there actually is some meaning behind this? After all, this wasn’t the only time in the series where a crazy, made up language was mentioned. In fact, in the finale it is revealed that Angela and her sister had their [own](https://soundcloud.com/ficus-like-us/02-juice-glitchy-back-with) made up language. To quote from the script:


**Angela: We even have our own special language.**

**Rachel: [loosely] Phoffylloxis broffoux woffine in boffoloxes**

**Angela: People love it.**

**Rachel: They do.**


It’s brought up again in the [deleted scenes for the episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/bcvizw/a_season_9_finale_deleted_scenes_video_came_out/).

We first learn that Angela has a sister in Season 3, Episode 10, “A Benihana Christmas”, however she states that her sister and her “used to be best friends” and “haven’t talked in 16 years over some disagreement [she doesn’t] even remember”. Later, during “Finale” (Season 9 Episode 23) it’s revealed that they are now very close. So sometime in between these two episodes, they have settled their differences and rebuilt their friendship. We never know what the “disagreement” between the two was, but we do know that Angela undergoes a lot of character development from her Season 1 self (which is approximately 13 years since the conflict) that might have brought the two back together. And what better a time for this to happen than near the end of Season 7! 

What if Creed, after overhearing Angela on the phone talking to her sister in their language, is intrigued by the conversation and sets out to figure out what exactly he heard. He plays it over and over in his head, possibly unintentionally scrambling some of it up before asking Jordan for help when he becomes manager.

Why does he care? Perhaps he intended to use it as an early form of [blackmail](https://youtu.be/OKRo6SAwYKA). Maybe he wanted to publish another exciting post on [www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts](https://youtu.be/1e5td7-Bpvc). Or it might just be Creed being Creed. I’m inclined to settle on the latter option.

Going further, what Creed heard could have also been Angela or her sister calling the other to apologize for their actions from 20 years (by the time of this episode) prior. 20 years with no contact is a huge milestone, and it’s possible it inclined one to finally settle things between the two. But this is just an extension on the original theory.

TL;DR: Creed was reciting to Jordan the gibberish he caught from a phone conversation between Angela and her sister, the same gibberish the two made up years ago. 

Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.Holly makes her first appearance in (S04E18),"Goodbye, Toby".

She is replacing Toby as he leaves for Costa Rica. Throughout the episode, you can see Toby leading her through the office,  introducing her to everyone and explaining the job to her. The HR job. A job where knowing the personal interactions and personalities of all the employees is required to succeed. It's not crazy to think Toby gave her a run down of the office before introducing her to them, so she can put their histories to a face as she meets them. I believe he talked to her about Michael before entering his office with her.

Toby told Holly that Michael hates him and HR in general. Since Holly and Toby are level headed people and Toby wants to give her a chance to interact with Michael better than he could, he told her the best chance she has is to make fun of him and put him down in front of him. Which she does. 

They enter his office, she's introduced to him and Michael has already decided she is as a bad as Toby and acts towards both of them accordingly. She takes a side step away and loudly insults Toby, saying she almost fell asleep when he showed her the filing system. They focus back on Toby and he's shown nodding his head, lightly smiling. He's not upset, he's happy he saw Holly, a kind woman who would never insult the person showing her the ropes of her new job, especially loudly right in front of them, made Michael smile. Toby thinks maybe she won't have such a hard time with Michael like he did.

And we now know she didn't. That moment in his office is when Michael realized Holly might be more than HR, and it was all because Toby told her to go ahead and put him down in front of Michael.Wonka said he wanted the winner to go to a child, one pure and innocent and won't just abuse the factory for selfish reasons. But, who wins the 4 tickets? A rich spoiled brat who would ruin the factory with selfish desires, a gluttonous pig who would eat everything in sight, a hyper competitive pseudo athlete that would drive for recognition and not secrecy, and a violent boy who is obsessed with pop culture. None of these fit with Wonkas narrative, or rather what is needed for the factory.

So what does he do? Well originally he releases these tickets one at a time as they are found. After number 1 is found he let's 2 out in the world and so on. He might have control over where they go, regionally, but left it up to chance generally. That explains why Slugworth had the general area down. And why someone like Veruca Salt who bought thousands of cases, only had one chance to win. 

The last ticket, however, goes to Charlie. Who apparently lives in the same town as the factory. As his tickets are found one by one, Wonka saw the other candidates and did not like them. Charlie was one that--given to the local popular candyman, could have chosen the "worthy" child. I think Wonka always intended for the tickets to be random and a true contest, but became fearful once he saw the 4 winners on television, and planted the 5th one to help stack the odds to someone he would favor

Edit-That would also explain why Wonka got so mad at Charlie at the end of the film. He didn't care at all about the other 4 kids when they messed up or got hurt, because he always banked on Charlie. And when Charlie turns out to be just as selfish and a liar as the others he initially thinks he got 5 duds.To start it off, Moff Gideon clearly presents himself like vader.

Unlike most moffs, who would wear a[officer uniform](https://images.app.goo.gl/2Fmz2TjUduwPrjZ79) he wears a distinctive armored chest piece, along with a long flowing cape, as well as wearing all black.

Along with his fashion choices, Gideon acts much like vader, with his frequent murder of his own soldiers(as we see with him executing the client and the local troopers, as well as apparently executing an officer for interrupting him which we hear happened from the operator the scout troopers were reporting to in the beginning of episode 8)

Also, he puts himself in the battlefield, something a typical moff would not do(remember, moffs are regional governors, not some sort of general) choosing to be with his men when confronting the mandalorian.

Along side his similar self-presentation, he wields the Darksaber, and apparently [fights](https://www.newsweek.com/mandalorian-season-2-darksaber-moff-gideon-giancarlo-esposito-spoilers-baby-yoda-lightsaber-1489026) with it as well.

So, we can see that he's trying to copy vader's image, but there's one thing he can't just get; Force Sensitivety

Supporting my point is 2 things.

Point number one, when the mandalorian brought the child back to the client in episode 3 , doctor Pershing(the scientist who claimed to have saved the child in ep3) began to extract something from the child.

Secondly, is that doctor Pershing is nowhere to be found in episode 8, meaning that he most likely was moved to a more secure location to insure his protection.

I believe, that moff Gideon is obsessed with becoming like vader, and is attempting to drain the child's force sensitivity.

This could possibly lead up to a proper final showdown in season 2, with a force senstive Gideon facing off against [ahsoka tano](https://www.slashfilm.com/rosario-dawson-ahsoka-mandalorian/).*Major spoilers for Indiana Jones and The Last Crusader with allusions towards the ending of Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark*

The classic ending of Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade depicts the archaeologist picking the ceramic cup, and unlike the golden and frivolous grail that Elsa chooses for Donovan (the primary antagonist of the film), it was the true grail. The consequences of choosing the false grail proves to be quite harrowing and fatal, echoing the fate of the Nazis in the first film. 

However, I argue that it did not matter what grail either Indiana or Donovan chose. When the crusader gives his remarks of 'choosing wisely' and 'choosing poorly' he is not referring to the choice of grail- but a choice of life. The 'real' grail, though saving the life of Henry Jones, dooms Elsa who is arguably the most insidious of the villains in the film, again supporting the concept that the grail does not matter.

This theory, much like the film, draws on Christian concepts of morality, faith and the intent of one's actions. Indiana, in his quest for the holy grail begins as a selfless pursuit for his lost father. Even when his goal switches to finding the grail, it is to save it from the hands of evil. In the last act, Indiana's final push towards the grail is fuelled from his desire to save his father- shot by Donovan to spur Indiana on. 

On that point, Donovan is the complete opposite. Following the grail for his own gain and glory, and falls for many of the deadly sins: Greed, is obvious as he accepts the gilded grail without hesitation. Lust is a little harder, and his interactions towards Elsa could be interpreted as lecherous. Pride, wrath and envy are equally dominating traits for the man.     

Is Indiana Jones perfect? No, he does exhibit bursts of anger. Can be quite cold and hostile and is also a bit of a womaniser. Indiana Jones has also taken life. True, mostly in self-defence but he does so sometimes quite casually- the spilling of blood being a sin in Christianity. But here we have to return to the theme of the crusades, Indiana is not a perfect being and nor are most humans. Centuries ago, many men from Christendom embarked on the crusades, putting their mortal lives so that they may have a place in heaven. Wiping their sins for enacting God's will- absolution. The Last Crusade is aptly named, for it is Indiana's last journey (until the fourth film), it is his personal journey. Indiana has always been a little rash and reckless, but in the third film he is finally becoming more humble and wise, following in his father's footsteps. This arc is finally realised when Indiana lets go of the grail and is saluted by the crusader, who I see as acknowledging Indiana as his successor: defender of holy relics and the man who released him from his earthbound duty to join his brothers in heaven.

Ultimately, I see the grails as all being the 'true' grail, collected by knights and pilgrims for centuries. In my opinion, the grail is not an object that one can find- it is an idea, it is a goal that one sets for their life. It does not matter if the grail one finds is the 'right' grail, what matters is that one puts themselves towards a goal borne of devotion, diligence and selflessness. Faith does not have to always mean faith in the divine, but faith to one's family or to one's spouse- perhaps faith to one's integrity. Donovan saw his goal as a self aggrandising triumph, giving him immortality and fame and so his grail was extravagant. Indiana saw his goal as saving his father, nothing special but to save a single life, thus his grail was spartan and humble. One was punished for his hubris, the other discovered his true self through sacrifice and perseverance.So, there is a running gag within Doctor Who, particularly in the Moffat and RTD era. When the Doctor is asked about something relating to time travel, he dismisses it by saying "wibley wobbly, timey wimey". It sounds like just some gibberish to just shut down the question, but what if it's not?

&#x200B;

This theory relies on a few bits of evidence displayed throughout the series:

1) Time-Lords see time differently to everyone else. The Doctor has repeatedly shown that he knows the difference between events that are fixed points in time, and moments in time that can be in flux. They can understand it, but no one else can.

&#x200B;

2) The TARDIS translates for those who need it. This even applies for the same language. For example, Martha does not need to speak in old English when interacting with William Shakespeare.

&#x200B;

3) Despite the previous statement, the TARDIS doesn't always translate perfectly. The TARDIS does occasionally have to substitute words when there is no other appropriate word. For example, Melody Pond is translated as River Song because the forrest people had no word for Pond. The TARDIS had to substitute the word pond with whatever it could use, which was river since the forrest people do have a word for river.

&#x200B;

4) The TARDIS does not translate Galifreyian hand writing. We see several pieces of Galifreyian writing around the console room, but they are not translated.

&#x200B;

With all the above information combined, what if the TARDIS is trying to translate what the Doctor is saying. But, since Time-Lord engineering and science is so far beyond anyone else's understanding, the TARDIS has to try and compensate with whatever it can find. Everyone hears "wibley wobbly, timey wimey" because that is the best that the TARDIS can do when trying to dumb down the kind of science so beyond comprehension that it may as well be magic.It was one of the first movies to get cancelled due to the pandemic, even though it was scheduled to release before most countries did a proper lockdown.

It was also one of the last to announce a revised release date, and it never made any attempts to do a limited run release or a streaming debut or anything else like that.

I posit that the reason they're being *extra* cautious with this one is because the villainous plot of the movie is about a supervirus or biological weapon, and that's not really a piece of fiction you want to release right now. Hits a little too close to home.

It's possible that the version we eventually get will have been re-edited or re-shot to make the virus plot a little less "in your face".We all know the Steamed Hams bit at this point, so I'll skip the context.

At the start of the scene, Chalmers makes a sarcastic remark about Skinner's directions, which probably means that he arrives later than the expected time.

We then see Skinner immediately go into the kitchen to find his roast burnt. My theory is that Skinner had timed the roast to be ready at the time of Chalmers' arrival, and absent mindedly leaves the roast in too long when Chalmers is delayed.I've had a chance to see Endgame twice.

I spent most of the second time watching thinking about how FF would be introduced.

I haven't seen this particular FF theory float around yet so apologies if someone has already posted a similar line of thinking. Would love to get people's thoughts on it!

FF introduction to MCU:
I believe the fact that there's a 5 year time gap makes the introduction to a young FF core much easier to pull off. 

Imagine a 21 year old Reed Richards who is now 26 during Endgame. This would give him just enough time in the saddle to mature intellectually and also prime him to have his first major contribution to the MCU. You could even probably squeeze in a few extra years and make him 28-29 for the first FF movie.

You can also imagine the entire FF team existing throughout MCU with no mention of them since they were  teenagers during most of the MCU story told thus far.

I'd feel good about this route because it doesn't seem forced. I also like the idea of setting up Reed Richards as the man who carries the intellectual torch after Tony Stark.

MCU at this point is also more galactic and technologically sophisticated. More specifically, Earth is now getting a taste of the space/technological advancements (think: Wakanda, Kree, Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy). If Marvel wanted to stick with the cosmic ray origin story for FF, they could roll with it no problem.

I'd also like to see Dr. Doom out of the gates. He's a complex villain who actually has a perversely altruistic way of thinking. Imagine him being deeply impacted by the snap psychologically. Maybe the snap actually benefited his life. Maybe it actually allows him to somewhat sympathize with Thanos -- that is, he understands some level of authoritarian rule is required for peace. If not Doom, I'd imagine Marvel using this line of thinking for some other villain in the future. It'd be cool to see Doom put a long winded plan in place (a la Zemo/Mandarin) for world domination.

Lastly, I like Galactus as the next main arc for MCU. It overlaps well with Asgardians of the Galaxy / Adam Warlock / FF and makes the introduction of silver surfer imminent.

Thoughts?

P.S. I originally wanted to write about FF and mutants, but I did a quick google search and stumbled on a guy from Quora who wrote a killer theory on how mutants come about (before endgame!). Loved it. https://qr.ae/TWIknKSo throughout the MCU and in comics the super soldier serum has been a bit of a mystery. Dr. Erskine never left notes about its creation and only one person was able to use it, Captain America. However, I think that Erskine was using something else in the MCU as a baseline. I think the Heart Shaped Herb of Wakanda was the basis of the serum. I have a few reasons to believe this.

1) The powers of the herb are very similar to the powers that Steve has. Increased strength, agility and durability are all shown to be something that the Black Panther has as well. 

2) The Vibranium shield. It seems really odd to me that Howard Stark would be able to get enough vibranium to make a shield. Seeing as Wakanda is pretty much the only place to get it. He very likely could have gotten a sample of the herb along with the vibranium. 

3) It would also explain why Erskine wouldn't leave notes about the serum. Leaving notes about that could lead the Germans and Hydra to Wakanda which would be catastrophic. 

4) It also explains why there is a hard time replicating the serum in modern times. It's based on a plant that few would know exist. We've seen in The Incredible Hulk, they haven't stopped trying to replicate Erskine's results. I think that with how brilliant scientists are in Marvel it would be weird that no one would come close in 60 years. After watching Napoleon Dynamite for the first time, I'm fairly certain that it uses tetherball to symbolise sex.

Throughout the movie, we see Napoleon play tetherball by himself. This would symbolise masturbation. There's the obvious ball/rod symbols, but that's not enough to base this theory on.

But look at the final scene where he plays tetherball with Deb ( https://youtu.be/DuIGFC88wFo). Look at the rhythm. It starts very slow and very awkward, gradually gets some rhythm, and then suddenly it's over after some quick moves by Napoleon during which Deb stood there awkwardly.

I can't find anything on this theory online, yet it seems so obvious.What Batman fears more than anything is turning evil. He is perfectly aware he is capable of doing so, and just about no-one would be able to stop him if he was a villain. 

But what if there was a person who knew his fighting style and weaponry inside out and back to front? What if there was another person with his skill and similar life experiences, yet far more young and optimistic than Batman?

tl;dr Robin is the one who will take Batman down if he goes rogue, as he is not just a protege, but Batman's planned countermeasure for a set of circumstances that may never arise. Because Batman.Okay so i watched this film the other day and something didn't sit with me right.   


Throughout the movie Tim and Boss Baby's arc is that they go from not liking each other to loving each other through running through the various hardships in the movie. Tim goes from hating the idea of having a baby brother, to loving the fact and forming a brotherly bond with Boss Baby, realizing that they can actually get along.   


Tim has bonded with his brother, They love each other as brothers do and even when Boss baby goes back to the Baby realm, Tim writes to Boss Baby convincing him to come back to the human realm, to which he misses Tim too and agrees to go back, so he rides the weird baby conveyor into human world and become a real kid once again.  


However, this process WIPES HIS MEMORY, so essentially the new brother may as well be an entirely new kid. Boss Baby is super stoked riding down the baby chute, when in fact he is taking a one way trip to HIS DEATH. The new child who emerges to be with Tim is not the brother Tim knows, he's nothing but an imposter, a shell of who Boss Baby was before, but it's played off like a happy ending.   
This is an existential nightmare and is deeply unsettling to me...   


**TL;DR: After being imprisoned by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), Loki is offered a deal. The TVA is willing to release Loki back to his original timeline if he completes a series of time fixes to “close out” rogue timelines created by anomalies similar to his Endgame escape. These fixes are achieved by changing historical events in alternate timelines through less than moral means.**

**Loki will accept but true to his trickster ways; he will attempt to use this arrangement for his own gains. He will go after the infinity stones in alternate timelines. He may even try to steal the mind stone and Tesseract from alternate versions of himself and other MCU characters.**

**The Plot Speculation.** 

So here’s my speculation, the TVA captures Loki and takes the tesseract from him. While in custody, a deal is offered.

>*The TVA asks Loki to perform a series of timeline fixes to ”close” or repair other broken or rogue timelines in the form of crimes, heists, or assassinations in exchange for being placed back in his original timeline.*

The TVA’s job is to monitor and “prune” timelines. They offer Loki the opportunity because Loki can complete the less than savory pruning.  They essentially want him to “close out” broken timelines created by accidents, such as Loki’s alternate timeline that was created when he escaped during Endgame. And sometimes, to close a timeline, you gotta get your hands dirty. A villain like Loki is the perfect candidate for this position. We have to remember that the Loki in this show will not be the” “redeemed Loki” post-2012 but the villainous Loki,  freshly caught after his failed Earth invasion. 


Loki accepts the deal and the series will follow our favorite trickster’s devious adventures as he jumps between different timelines and historical events, causing havoc while completing missions for the TVA.

**The Stones**

But here’s the hook, I think he will secretly collect or look for artifacts of power, such as the infinity stones in these alternate timelines. Loki once possessed both the mind stone and the Tesseract at the same time and knew the power of them. He would want to get them back.  The stones themselves would be present in the other timelines and at different times. If all the missions take place on alternate versions of earth, we could see Loki trying to steal the mind stone from alternate versions of himself or take on alternate Captain Americas or Red Skulls. It would also be fun to see Loki running into himself throughout history and timelines. We could even see a Viking age version of Thor, Odin, and Loki himself

I can see a running gag where every time he gets close to getting a stone, the TVA pulls him back to headquarters, foiling his every attempt. I think that’s what the D.B Cooper scene is. Loki is trying to get around the TVA watchful eye by literally jumping from a plane, but they see him and pull him back. 

It all leads back to Loki rejoining the main MCU timeline and back into the films. Loki rejoining the MCU opens up a fantastic, though heartbreaking, arc with his brother Thor. The last time Thor saw his brother, they buried the hatchet and became allies and brothers again. Loki was redeemed in this timeline, but the Loki of 2012 will have none of this goodwill for his brother. This angry 2012 Loki with a couple of infinity stones will be a formidable enemy. Thor will have to rip open old wounds seeing his dead brother that he loved as a villain again. A Loki that now seems unredeemable. Perhaps it is even Loki that unleashes/creates Gorr, the god butcher on the universe.

It’s all theoretical right now, but I am very excited about Loki’s series and the trailer. I like how they seem to be leaning into Loki being the Joker of the MCU, and I am ok with that.Every once in a while you'll see on /r/movies or /r/MovieDetails that J Jonah Jameson’s true colours are shown when the Green Goblin raids the Daily Bugle and asks JJ who takes the photos of Spider-Man.  

[like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/63w1r2/j_jonah_jameson_from_spiderman_2002_is_actually_a/)

[or this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/bqw40m/in_spiderman_2002_j_jonah_jameson_never_gives_up/)

He replies that he doesn’t know - the photos come in the mail.  People cite this as evidence of JJ’s journalistic and moral integrity, though I don’t think his motives are as pure.  

Its clear from the Spider Man 1 that Peter is the only one that would be able to take the [cinematic, high quality photos](https://i.imgur.com/aBz4jyA.png) he supplies to the Daily Bugle.  However, let’s look here at the many publications showcasing these sorts of photos in Spider Man 3:

[Exhibit A](https://i.imgur.com/vWVc565.png)

[Exhibit B](https://i.imgur.com/dxORuqO.png)

Where did these publications get the right to publish these photos?  As far as we know, Peter doesn’t sell his photos to anyone except The Daily Bugle - part of the reason he’s so poor all of the time, with JJ consistently low-balling him.  Therefore it makes sense that these other publications could not have got the photos from anyone except The Daily Bugle i.e J Jonah Jameson.  

We can also assume that Peter regularly brings in batches of photos, for which JJ will pay a lump sum for, as is evidenced by his first encounter with JJ in Spider-Man 1.   Now JJ could save them for another day and use them then. **Or** he could sell them to the highest bidder, all of whom would have zero access to high quality photos of Spider-Man.  And given how little money he manages to goad Peter into accepting, it would not be surprising to see Peter coming in very regularly through sheer necessity. JJ probably has a whole stash of unused Spider-Man photos after years of Peter's freelancing.

When the Green Goblin asks JJ who takes the picture and JJ responds with ignorance, it’s not from any kind of integrity - it’s because he realizes that if Peter is exposed he loses his cash cow in the form of Spider-Man photos.  He holds a monopoly in the market and I imagine he’d do a lot to keep it that way.

**TL;DR** - J Jonah Jameson was selling Peter’s photos for money evidenced by other publications having Spider Man photos.  He didn’t give up Peter because of Peter’s monetary value to him, not because he is a refined valley dude.

edit: this is based on the Raimi movie canon.

Ayo Film Theorists thanks for the shout out how about some of that sweet sweet ad revenue brotherPOTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD:
So an anonymous source predicted the events for Infinity War that included major plot points, team-ups, and the return of Red Skull. They just recently came out with the predictions for Avengers 4 which seems that it might be likely true.

This source writes, "Iron Man reassembles the Avengers and decides to build his own infinity gauntlet to undo everything Thanos did. They recruit Ant-Man to help them travel through time and space using the Quantum Realm to retrieve the infinity stones from different time periods. Thanos finds out about their plans and becomes destined to stop them. The movie resolves around the relationship between Cap and Tony.”

The leak continues, "At one point, Cap and Thor fight Thanos. Timeline alterations have restored Mjolnir and Cap wields it against Thanos to allow the others to escape, and is killed holding Thanos off." There's been rumors that there's a funeral scene for a crucial Avenger. "At one point, Hawkeye must protect the unfinished Stark Gauntlet from Thanos' minions. He plays an ‘instrumental’ role in Thanos' defeat. 
Thor's subplot centers on him assembling an army to challenge Thanos with the help of Captain Marvel. In leaked photos, we see Chris Evans as Cap with a stick which is supposed to be Mjolnir but with CGI added in post-production. 
Hulk's subplot centeres Banner and Hulk finally merging to become professor Hulk. He is the one that ultimately wields the Stark gauntlet against Thanos, losing his arm in the process.
Nebula's subplot centers on her efforts to redeem herself. At one point, she fights her murderous past self. "

"Several MCU movies are revisited such as the Avengers retrieving the power stone creating a timeline where the GOTG never came together."
"There's a pivotal scene between Doctor Strange and a fully CGI character being shot on a secret location, with a skeleton crew, and which takes up a sizable portion of the budget".
They concluded: “Only two of the original Avengers (Cap, Stark, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow) meant to survive the movie. Cap dies.
"The title was AVENGERS: INFINITY GAUNTLET at one point, but it might be changed after Zoe Saldana accidentally leaked it.”


Only time will tell if these predictions are true!

 If you need a refresher, the Joker went on a violent crime spree through Gotham, during which he blew up a hospital, blew up 2 warehouses, and killed several individuals (most of which were criminals).

In his final act of public terrorism, he threatens to blow up Gotham and claims to have set traps on the bridges leaving Gotham. In response, officials tries to evacuate the city by ferry, first sending 2 full of passengers; one full of civilians, the other convicted prisoners. Joker then reveals that he put explosives on both and gave each the detonator to the other ferry. If neither boat detonates the other, he'll blow them both up. In the end, neither boat go through with it and the Joker is stopped before he blows it up.

I started to consider, though, what if there was a twist on this? Jokers whole deal is messing with people. We saw this when he burned the mafias cash, when he disguised hostages as his clown henchmen and when he switched the addresses of Harvey and Rachel. Compared to those, a prisoners dillema sounds like his MO, but it seems a little too straight-forward.

I don't think that he gave the ferry's a detonator to the other ship. I think he actually gave them the detonator _to their own ship._ If either ferry tried to detonate the other ship, they would have killed themselves, and in the process, the other ship would have been blamed for it.

It's sadistically perfect; you get the challenge to societies morales, you punish the selfish individuals who value their lives above others, and you create a distrust of people who did nothing wrong. On top of that, it was very likely the civilian ferry would blow up, putting the blame on the already despised inmates and then distrust in the government when they're protected. And it fits with the Jokers MO for misdirection.

Admittedly, I don't have any way to prove this for sure. It's unclear if the detonators were short or long ranged (though there could be speculation for either). And I haven't heard any talk from writers or ditectors if this was on the table. But I think, narratively, it would fit.As the title says, in the 4th movie, Oak goes forward in time and battles alongside Ash and Pikachu. After Celebi returns him to his timeline, he remembers this in the future and later tells Ash, when it’s time, that the other starters (Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur) were “already taken” because he knows from continuity’s perspective that Ash has that Pikachu. At the end of the movie, it evens shows Oak with a pic of Pikachu drawn in the notebook, kinda confirming this theory. 

tl;dr Oak had to give Ash Pikachu or it would break time continuityIn Black Panther, the post credits scene shows Bucky living in Wakanda, being cited by the children as “White Wolf”

In the comics, the actual White Wolf was a child who plane crashed in Wakanda. his parents dead, king T’Chaka took him in and he became T’Challa’s Stepbrother, he is often an anti hero and is fiercely protective of Wakanda

This being said, why would the children call Bucky “white Wolf”? It seems so specific

My theory is that, the White Wolf IS in Wakanda, but was hidden by T’Chaka and is thus one of Wakanda’s greatest secrets, N’Jobu couldn’t have been T’Chaka’s only lie

The White Wolf became an local urban legend in Wakanda, and thus, being the 1 of 3 white men to enter Wakanda in the past few decades, Bucky is heralded as “White Wolf” because the Children have only one reference point for a white manIt's the biggest running joke in Greek Mythology: Zeus has hundreds, even thousands of affairs (many of which were basically just rape). That's a massive embarassment to Hera. The goddess of happy marriage and faithfulness has a horrible marriage with a husband who cheats on her. She's the laughingstock of Olympus, and becomes horribly bitter and jealous. Early in her life, she's portrayed as more kind, and loving, before going full on baby murder later on.

But, guess who on Olympus **literally controls love and desire?** That's right, Aphrodite. Notably, before Aphrodite became an Olympian, there aren't really any instances of Zeus being unfaithful to his first wife, Mentes, or during the start of his marriage to Hera. Then, along comes Aphrodite, who had the ability to control love, as well as her son Eros (aka Cupid), capable of making anyone fall in love, even gods. There are a few myths about what happened when she arrived, but they all boil down to one thing: Aphrodite was forced to marry the ugly Hephaestus by Hera and Zeus. Obviously, for the goddess of love and beauty, being trapped in a marriage with someone like Hephaestus was a massive insult, and she was known for holding grudges.

**Aphrodite used her powers of love to make Zeus constantly cheat on Hera, humiliating her just like Hera had once humiliated Aphrodite.**I don’t know why this just came to me and maybe it’s reaching but I think Creed convinced Jim to kiss Pam for the first time in the season 2 finale “Casino Night”

In that episode, Jim confesses his love to Pam. After she rejects him, he is away from Pam long enough for her to go into the office, call her mom, and have a short conversation before Jim comes in and just walks up and kisses her without a word. 

I think moments before that kiss, Jim ran into Creed and Creed convinced Jim to walk upstairs and just kiss Pam. 

If we fast forward to S3 E13 “The Return”, we notice this exchange between Jim, Oscar, and Creed:


Oscar Martinez:	Hey, where's Dwight?
Creed Bratton: You didn’t hear? Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
Jim Halpert: I'm pretty sure none of that's real.
Creed Bratton:	YOU'RE NOT REAL, MAN

Of course we all know this did happen, it’s just that Creed is mistaken as he is talking about Ed Truck and what he is referring to did actually happen (Jim didn’t know because he was in Stamford at the time and knows, as we all do, Creed isn’t all there so he dismisses it). Therefore, Creed has remembered something that really happened yet the details are a little off, more specifically the names of the people involved. 

Fast forward again to S5 E16, “Lecture Circuit: Part 1.” The side story in this episode is Andy having the hots for one of Stanley’s clients. He bursts into the room and says to Oscar and Creed that he is about to ask her out and he needs help. Creed then tells Andy to “just go right in and kiss her.” Andy says it’s risky to which Creed responds, “Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?”

AND THERE WE HAVE IT; rough evidence that Creed convinced Jim to kiss Pam for the first time because of the way he also advises Andy to do so. Creed’s crazy lil mind just warped the details/names of people involved in an event while also forgetting that it already happened and that he’s talking to Andy. It’s not so far fetched considering we know Creed to say some weird things during conversations (another example of this is when he said he wanted to hook Jim up with his daughter but then said he thought Jim was gay)

So there it is, I’m convinced. Tell me what you think even if it’s that I’m nuts like Creed. Thanks guys!The United States in the Disney Channel Universe has developed similarly to the real World's United States. One would assume the rest of the World has as well, but the shows leave subtle hints that the rest of the World may be in a strange pseudo-Victorian state, due to the lack of one of, if not the most influential thing that's happened in history: WW1. In this theory, I state some things I noticed about the character building in several Disney Channel shows that, in my mind, proves the theory. I should also mention that these are the shows I grew up with, if any of you guys have any evidence from other shows that I forgot that help or contradict my arguments, please share in the comments, I would love to hear them. Without further ado, let's begin.

Evidence #1: Ravi. Ravi is a strange character, and could be chalked up to poor screenwriting, but I like to live on the edge, so here goes: Ravi is the way he is because the British never stopped colonizing India. Ravi can speak almost perfect English, the only problem is that it’s too formal for a kid his age. He is knowledgeable enough to know about Rudyard Kipling, and he admires the author enough to name his lizard after him - this is important. - On the other hand, he is extremely socially awkward, and knows little to nothing about contemporary American culture. In our post WW1 world, even the poorest person in India would at least know about things like Coca-Cola. But, Ravi is completely clueless. This makes sense in a colonizing viewpoint. If Ravi did grow up at an orphanage, it is very possible that it would have doubled as a Colonist Propaganda School as well. The British often used people like orphans and widows to further indoctrinate the population. Ravi would have been trained in British culture at the orphanage, but would have likely have limited knowledge of the outside world, due to either lack of funds, lack of care, or religious elements. But wait, you’re asking, doesn’t Ravi know a lot about stereotypical Indian culture? Yes, but that does not disprove the theory. The British enjoyed the superficial aspects of Indian culture. That doesn’t mean they respected it at all, but they had a certain fascination with it. In order to make Ravi more appealing, they taught him some aspects of his culture to make him “exotic”, and to distance him from the British kids, so that he would constantly know he was “less than.” The propaganda would also explain why he likes Kipling so much. Considering Kipling’s blatant racism, he would not be a popular author amongst non-colonized Indians. But, due to Ravi’s British propaganda, he has internalized those lies and believes himself less than. He constantly has issues with low self esteem in the show, further proving my point. In short, Ravi is a British Colonizer’s dream: smart enough to “conform” and not rebel, but exotic enough to be considered silly. The British molded the poor boy into their standards, leaving the poor boy stunted and confused. 

Evil Agatha: Evil Agatha is a recurring villain character on the Jessie series. She is very British. Almost too British. She talks about the Queen way too much than the average Brit would today, and often talks about working for several Downton-Abbey like families. All of her behavior is noticeably pre WW1 talk. The ending of WW1 was one of driving forces for Britain, and the world, to somewhat overhaul their complex caste systems and many other similar aspects of society. If Agatha is still talking about pre-WW1 life, does that mean the U.K has not progressed past the Edwardian times in many aspects of society? Does it mean that they never really had an incentive to change?

Tinka and Gunther: These characters are in the show Shake it Up. They are implied to either be recent immigrants or foreign exchange students from a fictional Central/Eastern European country. In one episode, the last episode they’re on, they mention having to travel back to “the old country” and “help their aunt fight for her freedom from the King.” The king? In our post ww1 Europe, there is no total monarchy that would control things like farming. But, in pre WW1 Europe, all of Central Europe was ruled by either Prussia or Russia, essentially. Both rules were unpopular by many of their constituents. This is proof that the monarchies in Central/Eastern Europe had never gone away, further proving our WW1 theory, but it also proves that there is a movement to stop these monarchies. This is huge. Gunther and Tinka may be participants in a part of history that is long overdue in their world. Watchers of Disney since 2014/15 ish: has there been any proof of a Central/Eastern European rebellion?

Mei Wei: Mei Wei is a character on Austin and Ally. She is an exchange student from China. She acts very stereotypically  Chinese, but not in a modern stereotypical Chinese way. She is very shy, meek, and docile. Most importantly, her smarts are never mentioned in the show, an odd choice for a writing team that used to/likes to use plenty of stereotypes. While China still has many, many problems with sexism today, they have at least moved on from their old, even more sexist ways. Of course, most of that is thanks to ww1. China was never colonized by the British, though they did meddle with them plenty. Without WW1, and the subsequent Russian revolution, Communism wouldn’t have spread to China. Thus, China is still under the rule it was pre-WW1, and the societal values of pre-WW1 China. In pre-WW1 China, women were treated as subhuman citizens. They were taught to be shy and meek, just like Mei Wei, and any academic talent would have been ignored at best, discouraged at worst. Well then why is Mei Wei in high school, you ask? Well, just because China is still under pre-WW1 rules, does not mean that they haven’t progressed economy wise. China has been a major trading country since the times of Ancient Rome. With the advent of the industrial revolution, China could still have the factories they have today. Hell, they could be even more capitalist with the lack of Communism. This leads to more schooling, even for girls. It’s very reasonable that Mei Wei could be at a high school level of learning.I've seen a lot on the internet about how Hulk won't come out because he's afraid of Thanos. But I don't think that's the reason why. 

Hulk thinks that everyone on earth hates him. For one he straight up says just that in Thor: Ragnarok. And that is the whole reason he leaves leaves earth in Age of Ultron

Also think about it, Thanos isn't actually ever on earth all the times that Banner tries to Hulk out.

TL;DR Hulk isn't coming out not because he's afraid of Thanos, but because earth if afraid of him. So in Star Wars it seems like 10 minutes after Luke finds out Vader is his father he’s convinced he can save him somehow. 

Now we all love the OT because it’s a touching story of a family’s love and all that jazz but in all reality having so much faith in Vader is illogical. Dude killed a lot of people. Helped blow up Alderaan. He probably did more evil shit in the comics that Luke would be aware of. He ain’t a good dude. 

Now back to RotJ. One plot hole that was haphazardly explained away is Leia says she remembers her mom being beautiful but sad or something like that even though she’s only seen Padme for like a few seconds. The explanation is force memory absorption or some BS. 

So what if Luke force memory absorbed something too? Padme’s last words were telling Obi Wan there is still good in him. Just as Leia was able to absorb that this woman she’s seen for the first 2 minutes of her life is very sad Luke was able to a absorb the belief that the man Anakin Skywalker is a good dude. It probably existed in his subconscious his whole life and soon as he found the truth of his father he couldn’t let go of it because it was literally inplanted in him soon as he was born. 


TLDR: Luke believes in Vader because the first thing he ever heard was Padme saying there’s still good in him and per Leia’s recollection of Padme, force sensitive newborns can remember shit like that.In the animated "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," the Whos play a wide variety of loud instruments and participate in raucous games.  The noise from these activities is so loud that The Grinch can hear it in his cave at the top of the mountain.

As a result, the Whos all have hearing loss, which allows the Grinch to invade all their houses and steal everything without waking anyone other than Cindy Lou, who was so young that the damage hadn't fully set in yet.Mr. Krabs lives in a small town and owns a restaurant. He does very well for himself. Yes, he's a penny pinching miser, but that's probably his only vice. He has enough money to take very good care of his daughter Pearl and even send her to cheerleading. It takes a lot of money to feed a whale, not to mention what those cheerleading outfits and programs must cost. 

However, Plankton has vastly more wealth than Mr. Krabs could ever dream of having. Here's the evidence:

* The Chum Bucket. there's a simple question to ask about this restaurant: how the hell does it stay open? The only thing that makes sense is that Plankton uses it for money laundering. Whoever Plankton is laundering for must be paying him extremely well. It also makes sense that he would lay low in a small town well away from so many eyes and red tape that are usually found in big cities. 
* He has a supercomputer with artificial intelligence, who is also his wife, Karen. The money needed to create her, much less run her and upkeep her with maintenance must be astronomically high. My guess is that Plankton struck a deal with whatever shady character he met in college 26 years ago that he would do their money laundering if they helped him out with providing money and tech for his computer engineering. 

This brings up another issue. If he has all this money, why is he constantly trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula? Because it's the one thing in his little world that he can't have. All that wealth and money, and there's one thing in this tiny town that he can't buy. Mr. Krabs hates him and wants to live independently, so there's no buying him off. The next thing is to constantly come up with schemes in order to steal the secret formula. He doesn't actually need it. He just wants to achieve it and put Mr. Krabs out of business for spite. Plus, let's face it, he's bored.The basic premise of Ragnarok is that Fenrir the wolf will kill most of the norse gods and the world will be engulfed in flames and swallowed by floods, after which it will be reborn. When did this happen? Well, about the time of christianization of scandinavia. 

Let's go back to Roman times first. We could say that if there was no Roman empire christianity wouldn't spead as far as it did in Europe. We could also say that without the shewolf that took care Romulus and Remus there would be no Rome. So Rome/Christianity represents the wolf, the gods "die" because they are forgotten, and the people of the world are reborn by being burned at the stake or getting baptized by the water.The one thing that sets everything in to motion was Walt's cancer right? Well, what I'm theorizing goes deeper. Everything that happened in the show was caused by Skyler, or to be more specific, her smoking habit. When Walt was diagnozed, there was an off hand comment that Skyler said that it might have been the chemicals that Walt has been exposed to in his long career as a chemist. For me, that just doesnt sound right. Walt is a professional and a stickler for the rules, I'm willing to bet that he is never fully exposed to the harmful materials in lab. Walt's lung cancer was caused by secondhand smoke from Skyler and Walt's not the only victim. Walt Junior's cerebral palsy might have been caused by Skyler while smoking while she was pregnant with him and we see further evidence of this in an episode where she smoked while she was pregnant with Holly. So in conclusion, as much as it is a cliche already to hate on Skyler, She is the cause of all of Walt's problems.

TL;DR Skyler gave Walt lung cancer with secondhand smoke.Civil War is a bit of a mess when it comes to location.

Throughout the story, very few cities are visited more than once. Here is a list of locations featured (not counting important backstory like Sokovia, Wakanda etc.):

* Siberian base
* Cambridge
* Lagos
* Vienna
* Berlin
* Bucharest
* London
* Cleveland
* Queens
* The Raft
* Upstate New York

And I think there's a reason for this:  The studio wanted to create the sense of a large-scale globetrotting adventure.

But if you track the movement of specific characters in the plot of the film, their paths often don't make much sense. Stark, for example, crosses the Atlantic *twice* just to bring Spider-Man to the fight at the airport. Some kid he didn't know, who might have said no.  And instead of using this time to steal a plane, Cap sits around and waits for Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man to arrive (again crossing the Atlantic - a journey far longer than just going to the base to Siberia.)

It also raises peculiar questions about some characters between films. For example, the last time we saw Bucky he was in Washington DC. How was he able to escape to Bucharest...and why would he do that? Also, why would Sharon Carter take a position working for the CIA in Berlin?

Look what happens if you squeeze these locations back to the East Coast.

* Bucky would be hiding out in Brooklyn (his birthplace/hometown) instead of Bucharest
* Sharon would still be working and living in Washington DC
* Peggy's funeral would take place in DC, where she lived for decades before her death, and where she received ongoing medical care for years
* The headquarters of the UN are in NYC, so the signing of the Sokovia Accords - and the following bombing by "Bucky" - would take place in NYC
* The airport battle would happen at Avengers new HQ in upstate New York, instead of some random airport somewhere
* While on his way back to Avengers HQ, Stark swings by Queens quick - this is a far more casual and believable action considering he is now already in New York
* The Raft, being a United States military prison, would now logically be located off the East Coast - rather than somewhere between Germany and Siberia

So I can't prove it.  But doing this tightens up the plot so much that I think it must be true.

Thanks for reading

**EDIT -**  Credit to u/Yoshi1528 for finding the final piece of the puzzle:

> [Bucharest...was probably done at request by Sebastian Stan or as some sort of favor to him, as he was born in Romania and that was probably an excuse to have him come back to visit family, speak Romanian, etc while filming.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/j68s53/captain_america_civil_war_was_supposed_to_be_on/g7xgd5e/)

So here's what happened.  The writers originally had the story taking place across the East Coast, but then they did re-writes to move Bucky to Bucharest.  At that point, in order to make the story work they also had to move Peggy and Sharon Carter to Europe, as well as the entire second act of the film.  The weirder stuff (like Stark going back to Queens) was just leftover plot details they couldn't find a fix for.

So it looks like I got the changes right, but I was probably wrong about the motive.  It seems re-writes may not have been to make the story global, but moreso to appease one of the actors.

And there is precedence for that in the MCU - [Ragnarok was filmed in Australia because Chris Hemsworth wanted to stay home.](https://mcuexchange.com/ragnarok-australia-chris-hemsworth/#:~:text='Thor%3A%20Ragnarok'%20Filmed%20in%20Australia%20Because%20Of%20Chris%20Hemsworth's%20Request,-October%201%2C%202017&text=Everything%20that%20we%20have%20seen,as%2Dusual%20at%20Marvel%20Studios.)I was watching some Grievous clips of the original CW videos on Youtube, and I read a comment joking about how TCW is a Republic propaganda and CW shows the true events of the Clone Wars.

I thought about this seriously. Maybe that might be true. 'The Clone Wars' is the Republic's falsified interpretation of the war to propagate their civilians, while 'Clone Wars' is what actually happened. I'm not saying this was Lucasfilms' intention. (because it's obviously not) It's just my thought experiment.

- Intros

In TCW, we hear the very heroic voice over for every episode, telling the story in very much in line of Republic's point of view. Generally, it can summarized as "heroic Jedi and clone army fighting against the evil separatists." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MNSODRxME

However, in the original Clone Wars, this is the intro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQv6TNZs2pQ

There's no narrator's voice, explanation, nor recap. We see a few seconds of ambiguous sounds of battles without any music, enhancing the feeling that we're watching the records of war instead of dramatization.

- The depiction of clones

Clones in TCW are like humans. They can be joyful, talkative, friendly, patriotic, and generally lively akin to the depiction of US soldiers in Hollywood WW2 films right after the war (50s) with a few exceptions. There were even episodes dedicated to them like Captain Rex, Cody who were relatable for the viewer.

Well, you might say it's because they are obviously human clones, but in the original Clone Wars, they are more like machines of war instead of actual humans. They are almost emotionless. They don't interact with other clones, and only talk when they are replying to the orders. This was explained in because they were genetically modified to act like machines and follow the orders in the Legend EU. Why would the Republic not modify them? They viewed them as just expendables. Nothing more.

- The depiction of Anakin Skywalker

The biggest difference between TCW and CW is Anakin. In the early part of the original CW, Anakin's chracter is much faithful to the one in Episode 2. He complains, acts like a jackass, and does not follow orders from his master. For example: he fell into Asajj Ventress' trap because of his ego even though Obi-Wan tells him not to. Basically, an annoying brat. Later, we see him slowly grow as more mature and calm character in Episode 3. Hell, even his voice matches up. https://youtu.be/9WBY-C-VKTg?t=4m1s

In the earliest episode of TCW, he's nothing like Anakin from Episode 2 even though it only set after a few weeks from the AOTC. Anakin here sounds nothing like Hayden Christensen. He suddenly fights like a fine warrior, and thinks like a wise sage. A perfect image of war hero the Republic needed for the mass.

- The depiction of Grievous

In TCW, General Grievous is portrayed as a Saturday morning cartoon style villain with the backstabbing cowardly attitude. He's alright at fighting, but there's no majestic nor horrifying quality to him. He even gets captured by Gungans. https://youtu.be/ZT0wSyC1ugQ

In Clone Wars, he's basically the Star Wars version of Terminator. He's a literal Jedi hunter. No one, not even a Jedi Masters can beat him until Mace Windu breaks his organ at the end of the show. He's also a great strategist, planning the attack and commanding the droids in Battle of Coruscant.

- The Battle of Coruscant

There's simply no Battle of Coruscant in TCW. Separatist attack on the heart of the Republic was the biggest event in Clone Wars, and while Separatist was defeated, the battle caused the massive damage and devastating result for the Republic. 

The original Clone Wars showed this such as the droid army roaming and destroying the massively populated cities, kidnapping of Chancellor Palpatine, and Jedi Masters ruthlessly killed by Grievous. It would make sense for the propaganda conveniently leaving out these failures of the Republic.

- Revenge of the Sith novelization

The intro of the Episode 3 novelization by Matthew Stover sheds some light to how civilians reacted by the Coruscant invasion during the battle. They were devastated when the Chancellor was captured by Grievous, but the younglings were sure that the heroic pair of two Jedi, Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker would come and save the Republic.

These are excerpts from the book:

> Anakin and Obi-Wan will be there any minute. 
>
>They say this as though these names can conjure miracles. 
>
>Anakin and Obi-Wan. Kenobi and Skywalker. From the beginning of the Clone Wars, the phrase Kenobi and Skywalker has become a single word. They are everywhere. HoloNet features of their operations against the Separatist enemy have made them the most famous Jedi in the galaxy. 
>
>Younglings across the galaxy know their names, know everything about them, follow their exploits as though they are sports heroes instead of warriors in a desperate battle to save civilization.

> The adults know better, of course. That's part of what being a grown-up is: understanding that heroes are created by the HoloNet, and that the real-life Kenobi and Skywalker are only human beings, after all. 

This part tells that HoloNet, the Republic network is controlled by the Chancellor's office, implying that the Republic most likely has done a major propaganda campaign for all ages.

> Because the stories are out there. Not on the HoloNet, of course -- the HoloNet news is under the control of the Office of the Supreme Chancellor, and not even Palpatine's renowned candor would allow tales like these to be told--but people hear whispers. Whispers of names that the Jedi would like to pretend never existed. 

What if TCW is the HoloNet propaganda show described by the ROTS novelization?

Any thought?

EDIT: I added more points in the post. Thank to oldbenkenobi99 for providing the Holonet bit.Think about it..... we’ve only seen the soul stone used a couple of times;
1) Thanos wiping out half the universe... and as soon as he does that, he has a moment in the soul world with the one he loves (Gamora: “did you do it?” etc)
2) when the hulk used it to bring everyone back 
3) when iron man used it to get rid of thanos and his army
We then see in a ‘deleted scene’ that tony has a conversation in the soul world with his loved one (his daughter, all grown up)

SO..... going back to number two, doesn’t it make sense that hulk got to meet his loved one in the soul world after he used the stones?
Especially when we consider that he told cap (at least I think it was cap) that he tried to bring her back. 
How does he know he didn’t!? Everyone appeared exactly where they were when they were dusted, maybe she came back to life there! But no, hulk KNOWS she didn’t... 
how could he KNOW??
Did dr strange go to vormir and see if she was bopping around?? It’s possible, but did he chat to hulk about it? It’s a stretch...
Also, consider that thanos meets Gamora in the soul world; because her soul maybe lives there now due to the sacrifice. The same could be said for nat?
Maybe even Tony’s daughter actually; but that’s probably a whole other fan theory about what she might get up to later in her life! 

What do you guys think? 
I’m new to reddit tho so maybe this has been posted already a million times idkWe all know and love Flo the Progressive Insurance Salesperson from the Progressive Extended Cinematic Universe (PECU). But she has a dark, tragic past. 

A new fan favorite we've met is Dr. Rick, the Parenta Life Coach. He's the man who helps new home owners cope with turning into their parents. We've seen countless episodes of Dr. Rick helping Progressive Customers from becoming their parents. He often tells them to stop approaching strangers in hardware stores, or to stop buying so many throw pillows. His character has truly taken the narrative to new levels by introducing the PECU to an active protagonist, rather than the more passive writing we see in Flo's story arcs. 

But I digress...

There's one story that's missing from the PECU: **The Flo and Dr. Rick crossover episode**. Why don't we see that?? The writers make it clear that when customers buy a new home, they become their parents. Flo is THE Progressive girl. Surely she has Progressive Insurance in every possible form, be that home, auto, boat, motorcycle, etc. Flo would almost certainly have home insurance, which means she has a home. She would have the MOST insurance on her home out of anyone-- taking out every policy she possibly could. She would be the most likely possible candidate in the world to turn into her parents. So why didn't she ever take one of Dr. Rick's classes to stop her from turning into her parents?

Simple. **She never had any.** This is why Flo often fails to pick up on social cues. She never had anyone to properly teach her how to act. Why does she get so enthusiastic about home insurance? Obviously it's because home insurance is her way of assuring herself that she has a home, and that she belongs somewhere. The writers of the PECU have expertly laid out a brilliant dramatic metaphor, showing that insurance is more than just a financial safety net; it's a mental one too. 

But it doesn't stop there. What happened to Flo's parents, you ask? Well, we know that Dr. Rick is a strong advocate of Progressive Insurance. But he knows better than anyone that whoever buys home owners insurance becomes their parents. That's not a good look for the brand. Dr. Rick knew that Progressive needed a spokesperson who could buy as much insurance as possible, and never risk turning into her parents. There was only one way to ensure this... **Dr. Rick had to kill Flo's parents** when she was just a newborn, without her ever knowing.

**Flo has never attended Dr. Rick's class because he made sure she would never have to.**


EDIT: I see a lot of true fans are addressing the famous episodes where we meet Flo’s family. I address this in detail in a comment below, but these are mental projections within Flo’s mind. This is evidenced by the fact that actress Stephanie Courtney plays every character in her family. The director is letting us know that Flo literally imagines herself as her familial roles.Okay so let’s look at two seemingly disparate characters; Other Mother from Coraline and Pennywise from IT. How in the world could a witch that impersonates parents and a demonic clown be at all similar enough to suggest that they come from the same place? The similarities are there folks. Pennywise the Clown, also known as It or Itself, is an interdimensional emotional vampire who feeds on the fear of children, luring children in the form of a clown and shapeshifting to take whatever form scares them the most. 
Within Stephen King’s writings, evidence shows there to be more than one emotional vampire of Pennywise’s ilk. In the Dark Tower series, Roland encounters a being known as Dandelo, who appears as a pleasant older man and feeds on laughter, sucking the lifeforce from his victims by making them laugh. When he is killed, he morphs into his true form, a sort of giant insect. Pennywise’s true form on Earth at least is a gigantic spider, holding within it The Deadlights, which is where It comes from, a place of total insanity and chaos. Now, let’s look at Other Mother. She, like Pennywise and Dandelo, is able to lure her victims through shape shifting and reality manipulation, recreating her lair to resemble a more happy, wish fulfilling version of her victim’s home and changing herself to resemble a kinder, more pleasant version of their mother. She then convinces them to sew buttons over their eyes and become her playthings for her to love, as she slowly consumes their lifeforce and leaves them nothing but ghosts. Like Pennywise and Dandelo, she lures her victims and uses them as an emotional food source. Hers is not fear or laughter, but love. She consumes the love of these children she’s lured, leaving nothing left. Like Pennywise and Dandelo, her true form is not human, more like a giant humanoid spider. And finally, like Pennywise and Dandelo, she is defeated by resistance of her charms. Pennywise is defeated by resisting fear and the Ritual of Chud, Dandelo is defeated by resisting his humor, and Other Mother is defeated when Coraline breaks free from the illusion, rescues the souls of her previous victims, and locks Other Mother away in her dimension. So to sum up, I posit that Other Mother from Coraline is of the same species as IT (Pennywise) and Dandelo from the Dark Tower. *Spoiler Alert*

I believe that Edna Mode has super intelligence and may have other powers as well. In the incredible world physical appearance often alludes to the person’s powers. Edna’s short stature and large head are a physical manifestation of her powers.

Edna Mode is seen as short in stature, so much so that she is almost the same size as JackJack. It is possible that she could be a little person but I don’t think it’s as simple as that. 

The first and most obvious sign of her powers is her ability to design incredible super suits that defy what normal fabric can do. It could be argued that it’s just a cartoon and that the fabric in the cartoon is different but no other fabrics on the show can do what her super suits can. Ex: Violets regular clothes do not turn invisible.

Her work area/home seems to have little to no physical security guards but instead has relatively high tech security. Voice and retina scans, high tech isolation chambers, camera at her gate etc etc. She consistently speaks of being the exclusive designer for the Incredibles and Frozone which means that other people know who designed their super suits. As far as we can see, she is not fearful of anyone attacking her nor is she afraid of the supers she helps but rather they seem somewhat fearful of her. I believe this speaks for her other unidentified powers, she does not need extensive security for her home because she can defend herself. 

Then there’s her ability to babysit Jack Jack AND design his super suit when his Incredible father couldnt keep up with him and put him to bed. Not only was she able to handle the super power baby, observe him AND design his super suit but she explicitly stated that she would gladly do it again. I would even wager that this is not the first time she has dealt with super children based on her saying something along the lines of ‘It often happens that baby Supers manifest 2-3 powers’.

Finally, towards the end of The Incredibles 2, Frozone was going to send the children to Edna for safety, if she was just human, this wouldn’t make sense. (Says it on her wiki idk if this is definite)

What do you guys think?Robert California makes his appearance once Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finally moves on, and the rest of the office needs to find a new manager. He is strangely sexual in his word choice and smooth way of speaking, and is so persuasive he manages to go down to Florida and convince the owner of the company to make him the new CEO. He never actually reveals his real name - giving several fake names throughout his stint on the show, and is actually musically talented as seen on the episode where he invites a bunch of musicians to jam in the warehouse. The music even resembles the kind of music The Doors were making before they disbanded upon Morrison's "death." It appears he enjoys Pagan holidays, as he comes in to the office several times hungover from the nights previous "saturnalia." Morrison was notoriously interested in paganism. When the whole office was invited to his mansion, California goes on and on about how the house was built in order to host orgies. California also, at the end of the party, strips down naked before jumping in his pool - Morrison famously stripped at a performance in Miami, which led to his arrest. Finally, and the most damning piece of evidence, California admits \*several times\* to being "The Lizard King" throughout the show. The Lizard King was one of Morrison's most famous nicknames, and not one that has been copied by many other artists or performers. If he says he's the lizard king, then maybe we should believe him, and he truly is Jim Morrison!As we know, Hogwarts is an enormous building with lots of dark and cozy places, and a lot horny wizard students probably desperate to discharge their wands on something. Add to this that vigilance in the castle is almost nonexistent, so there is probably a lot of sex happening whenever nobody is looking. The strange thing about this is that students don't receive any sex education or information about forms of contraception (not even celibacy), so the logical assumption would be that teenage pregnancy in Hogwarts would be extremely high, as it is in most societies with sexually uneducated youth. But this isn't the case. Not in the books nor the movies can you see any pregnant girls or babies. This makes me think that the entire Hogwarts castle is imbued with an enchantment which keeps students from impregnating each other.Is so that she doesn't use her powers by just speaking normally or making normal requests.

It's a magical focus word so to speak, a method she uses to only utilize her powers when shes intending to make someone do something. For example:

If she were to say "Please get out of my room" without having proper control of activating her powers, the person shes speaking to would be compelled to do it even though she wasnt trying to influence them to.

But if she has trained herself to ONLY use her powers when she utters the relatively uncommon words "I heard a rumor", then she is less likely to accidently cause people to bend to her will in normal situations.


In some fantasy stories, verbal spells exist for this purpose. The words themselves are not magic, but they are used to help the witch or wizard focus on the desired result with intention. 

Allison can use her powers whenever she wishes, without saying any words or saying whatever words she wants, but she has trained herself (or been trained) to only activate her powers when she says the phrase, making her less likely to accidentaly force people to do what she tells them in common situations.Edit: New title announced! "No Way Home"!

Recently Tom, Jacob and Zendaya released their own version of the movie titles. Each one was different from the others. 

Was this them doing a gag? Perhaps...

But they didn't make the graphics. They simply released the info as told... this means MCU is hinting at something.

Well... my theory of what they're telling us? All three characters are in different multiverses and are releasing their version of the Spider-Man title. This also hints at 3 possible Spider-Men existing in one plane. And also why Dr. Strange is needed to fix things so that all of them are on the same page (same movie title)After Doc confesses his love for Clara to Marty and that he wants to stay in 1885, Marty urges Doc to decide with his mind and not his heart, implying that staying behind would not be good for the time continuom.  

But...Clara was supposed to have died in the canyon, so Doc already altered the course of history.  Who knows the impact a person like her would have had in the world?

So Doc had to take her out...of the time continuom.  By taking her to the future he saves her life AND removes her from the timeline, so in perfect Doc style it was the most logical choice!When Helen calls Edna, Edna is desperate to show off the suits she made. When Helen accuses Edna of “helping Bob sneak superhero work behind her back”, Edna responds,

“Why, darling, I thought you *knew*. Why would Bob keep secrets from *you*?”

She also included tracking devices in the suits. I don’t think that was an accident. Why include tracking devices at all? There seems to be a marginal benefit at best, and something easily exploited by the enemy at worst. Her face during their conversation, her nudging Helen to admit what she already expects, Edna knew and was helping Helen keep her family together.

Or, at least, encouraging the drama for her own entertainment.

Edit: A lot of people say Helen calling Edna was enough of a reason for Edna to think Helen knew, but Bob picked up his suit before Helen talked to Edna. Bob’s suit had a tracking device in it. Edna has to have been planning on making suits for the whole family. She’s too proud of her work to not say something to Bob. Helen calling just gives Edna the ability to feign innocence.

Edit 2: Someone pointed out I wrote “Edna called Helen”, when in fact it was the other way around. Whoops!I've often wondered why C3PO, when he and R2D2 are in the escape pod after Vader has boarded Leia's "diplomatic" ship, makes a point of saying "that's funny, the damage doesn't look so bad from here."  Seems like kind of a weird line for the filmmakers to emphasize.

My theory: though the special effects were groundbreaking and still look good over 40 years later, Lucas wasn't completely satisfied with them.  He thought Leia's ship should have looked like it had taken more damage.  So he included that line in case anyone in the audience felt the same way.In Ancient Rome, when a general was paraded through the streets after accomplishing a grand victory, he would be accompanied by a slave who would continuously whisper [*"remember, you too are mortal"*](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/01/23/in-ancient-rome-a-slave-would-continuously-whisper-remember-you-are-mortal-in-the-ears-of-victorious-generals-as-they-were-paraded-through-the-streets-after-coming-home-triumphant-from-battle/) to prevent the general's ego from getting out of control.

And for most superheroes, a secret identity serves a similar purpose. These people are essentially gods, who receive adulation and love beyond what even the most beloved celebrities in the real world get. But when Superman is Clark Kent, he's just another schmuck trying to get to work on time. When Spider-Man is Peter Parker, he's just another faceless New Yorker, who deserves no more special treatment than anyone else. Even Bruce Wayne has a company to run when he's not wearing the cowl. 

But the superheroes in The Boys never experience that. Almost all of them are heroes full time. Homelander never takes off his costume. When The Deep goes grocery shopping, he just puts a coat on over his super suit. A-Train wears regular clothes, but they're in the same color scheme as his costume. None of them have a moment where they live like regular people. They're never "off". What would that do to your brain? 

There are maybe two members of The Seven who aren't awful: Starlight and Maeve. What do they have in common? Secret identities and relationships outside of Vought. Maeve has a normal girlfriend who tethers her to reality, before she gets sucked into the machine. Starlight also takes off the wig and goes out in public as herself one in a while. Black Noir might too, but the jury's out on his private life. 

The only decent members of The Seven are ones who regularly interact with ordinary people *as* ordinary people. 

TL;DR: Secret identities are a *memento mori* for superheroes, and The Seven not using them is why they're so detached from humanity.First theory but this is a pretty small one. I've seen a lot of people suggest that Scott Lang has traveled back in time to the Avengers facility. Some have even noted that it says "1985" in the top left corner of the 'archived' footage. I won't even be getting into that because my suggestion is quite a bit simpler: 

There is absolutely no way that Scott Lang could have traveled back in time ***WITH***  the van. If he is in the quantum vortex that is in the back of the van, there would be no way for him to exit, get the van, and take the van back inside the van. Antman (and things he takes into the Quantum Realm) are the only things that can travel in time; since the van can't go inside the portal in the back of the van, there is no way for it to be in 1985. Therefore, Scott appearing at the Avengers facility *must* be in present day. In the final episode of Squid Game, Il-Nam challenges Gi-Hun to a final game. If no one helps the homeless man before midnight, he wins, if someone does, Gi-Hun wins. Supposedly, it's about their two ideologies. Gi-Hun believes in the goodness of people and thinks they will help, Il-Nam doesn't. Gi-Hun wins in the end because... he's right? Apparently? 

But here's the thing: Gi-Hun could have won instantly. All he had to do was go down there and help the homeless man himself. It is completely within the boundaries of the game and it would fit his ideology extremely well. Gi-Hun believes in helping other people, not sitting around waiting for others to help. At least, in theory, because he was so wrapped up in the game that it never occured to him to help out. He was watching someone die just to prove he's right about humanity. 

I think that Il-Nam was looking for an heir and that's why he participated in the games. When Gi-Hun never spend money on anything, the old man realised Gi-Hun could be a suitable heir. So he created the homeless man game to prove to Gi-Hun that he is no different from him and he will watch a homeless man die for the sake of a game. And that way, he would try to convince Gi-Hun to become his heir and help organise the games. But when someone came to help anyway, Il-Nam panicked and pulled off his sensor, faking his own death for the second time. Gi-Hun doesn't properly check the body, so we don't know for sure the old man's really dead. All we have is a flatline, but that's super easy to fake. And the timing is just way too suspicious. No, I think the old man is still alive, still looking for an heir.**The CIA knows everything.** They know that a UFO landed in the jungles of central/south America. They have heard of *'the demon who makes trophies of man*' as Anna refers to the Predator. They sent Dillon to the area when a situation arises that works as a perfect cover. They tell Dillon what's going on with the Soviets/Guerillas doing some shady stuff and tell him to go handle it.

&#x200B;

 **Why send Dillon?** Well Dillon is ex-military and has connections to elite Army unit commanders (Dutch and that Major General). They tell Dillon to make up some bullshit cover story to enlist the help of Dutch and his team. Dutch later finds out about the bullshit cover story and confronts Dillon. Dillon tells Dutch that he used him as the expendable asset that he is. Soldiers are expendable and since Dillon is no longer a soldier (but was at one point) Dutch is overreacting and should know how the game works. Dutch asks Dillon '*What happened to you Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust..'*

&#x200B;

**Why send Dillon now? Hasn't the Predator been killing people in the jungle for years?**  As the viewers of the film we have NO IDEA if the CIA had sent people there before. I'd be willing to bet that Dillon was not the first CIA agent that they sent to investigate. If you're a CIA agent on a special mission you don't go around telling everyone where you're going or when you should be expected to return. The only people who know what you are going to do....are the CIA. They are going to confirm nothing, deny everything, and make counter accusations to any person or entity that questions them on this matter. 

&#x200B;

**The CIA really did have Dillon pushing too many pencils.** When MAC officially loses his mind and chases after the fleeing Predator, Dillon stops Dutch from going after Mac. Dillon tells Dutch to take his remaining men and get out of dodge. Dutch tells Dillon that going to rescue somebody is not Dillon's style to which Dillon replies that he picked up some bad habits from Dutch. This is the first step of redemption for Dillon. Up until this point he has used his connections to manipulate an old friend for his own professional gain. When Dillon volunteers to rescue Mac his old friend Dutch realizes that Dillon has nothing to gain for this, but everything to lose. Dillon transforms back into the soldier/comrade that Dutch has known for so long. Dillon's mentality is not of a CIA agent, but of a soldier again. Soldiers are expendable. Unfortunately when Dillon finally has a clear cut opportunity to kill the Predator he was not prepared and not as sharp as he once was. He finds Mac's corpse and then hears the Predator whisper 'Any Time'. He wheels around and starts scanning for the source of the noise and then comes face to face with his enemy. Dillon's weapon was down by his waist when he knew it should have been held up and ready to fire. In the end Dillon did lose his life, but he died on his feet facing his enemy.It would explain why there's A) so much batman lore (dad's a fan), including the fact that Robin's new costume looks like the costume worn by Carrie Kelly Robin (from The Dark Knight Returns, a comic that Finn would be unlikely to be familiar with) and the references to much older Batman canon like 60s Batman and B) why there's such an emphasis on not being a dick father, it's the man upstairs' way of apologizing for his attitude in the Lego Movie. 

Edit: And Phyllis is the motherDisclaimer: I haven't actually seen 28 weeks later, so if any information about these events are covered in it, I am oblivious

In '28 days later', Main characters Jim, Hannah and Selena enter Manchester and find that the only remaining people are a small unit of British Soldiers.

The first thing that catches our attention about their questionable military background is when they are defending against an approaching Zombie Horde. They all seem excited to take part in the action and have no discipline or even coordination. One soldier even Shouts "I fucking got one!" after shooting one, as if this is abnormal or exceptional for him. This would be strange for an actual soldier, who would likely be trained well enough with a standard gun to expect a handful of kills. He is also breaking discipline by showing excitement about killing him, real soldiers would be reserved about this and keep quiet, many not even keeping count in an active war zone.

Another piece of evidence is that the soldier, 'private Jones', who is in charge of cooking for the unit, seems to be awful at cooking actual food. In the British army, One person in each squad is allocated a specialisation (e.g. mechanic or in this case Cook) and is not unsurprising that one of them would be allocated such a position. However private Jones seems to be completely incompetent at cooking, even serving rotten eggs to the unit, implying he never actually learned how to cook from the army.

Another Soldier, sergeant Farrell, also points to this theory. Farrell is described as the unit's 'Spiritual Guru' and comes of as an intelligent, albeit not *manly*, person. He says how humans becoming extinct will just be a 'return to normality' for the planet. Perhaps Farrell is a Philosopher or Scholar of some kind and just travelled with the rest of the unit until they found the weapons and uniforms. It also explains why he took such a firm moral stance against Major West, he knows he is lying to Jim and Co. and wants them to stop posing as soldiers and to stop their whole scheme to find women, resulting in him being shot, even though this isn't enough to get court marshalled in a real army.

Lastly, I would like to cover the last scene, in which most of the unit are killed by Jim or the infected. One soldier, Private Bell, hides behinds a bed and says he is out of bullets and, by extent, defenceless. A soldier should logically have some basic knowledge of hand to hand combat and should have at least a knife on him. The fact that a soldier would have no defence other than his gun shows that he likely received no actual training and is just posing as a soldier.So in the 2nd act of Avengers: Endgame, the surviving Avengers share every bit of info that they have on the Infinity Stones. At one point, Nebula was discussing the Soul Stone on Vormir. Anyone recall her exact words? I may be wrong, but I don't remember her mentioning the bit about the requisite sacrifice. You know, a soul for a soul.

So even as we saw Clint and Natasha making light banter on the trip to Vormir (even dropping another reference to Budapest), we knew what was coming. But did they? Apparently not. When Red Skull explains the sacrifice, Clint calls BS, thinking that the Skull "is making it up." Nat, on the other hand, looks visibly shaken. As if she is only grasping at that moment what needs to be done.

Conclusion: Nebula told the Avengers that the Soul Stone is on Vormir, BUT she didn't tell them about the sacrifice needed to get it.

Consider as well: Nebula doesn't know the Avengers well enough to determine if they would *really* risk their lives for their mission. She might even have assumed that none of them would volunteer to go to Vormir if they knew what was in it for them. So yeah, it looks like Nebula left out the fine print on getting the Soul Stone.Gimli walked in and Frodo shouted his name, but when Legolas walked in Frodo smiled and nodded, mouth hanging open, before Aragorn walked in and bailed him out (he shouted Aragorn’s name too). This is because Frodo’s mind was distracted with the gravity of his mission when he met Legolas so he completely spaced during their introduction. Frodo didn’t want to ask during the Fellowship reuniting as it would seem impolite.Someone else has probably said something similar to this, but I just realized it.  So, Brewing stands can only be crafted with Blaze Rods and there isn’t any possible way to find Blaze rods without going to the Nether.  How does this relate to villagers?  Well it just so happens that Cleric Villagers utilize Brewing Stands.  Not only that, but Blacksmith villagers sometimes have Obsidian in their chests, alluding to the usage of a Nether portal since Obsidian can only be used to craft Enchanting Tables, Beacons, and Ender Chests, none of which appear in natural villages.
Thanks you for your timei originally posted this on /r/movies and it blew up before mods inexplicably deleted it. a few people told me you guys would enjoy this. 


alright, so think about it like this. 


Javier Bardem is god.


Jennifer Lawrence is mother earth. 


The movie starts, she wakes up. She’s like yo where’s this motherfucker at?


She goes outside and there ain’t shit as far as you can see. No people, no houses, nothing, just grass and shit. This is the earth pre-human civilization. 


he pops up behind her and she’s like what are you up to and he’s like nothing, just working on some shit, it’s nothing. But you know he’s up to some shit. (By the way, he’s a poet in the movie.) She’s like ok, i’m just gonna keep working on the house (which represents physical earth and is an extension of mother earth herself). 


All of a sudden, boom. Some dude arrives. This is adam. 


Mother earth is like yo what the fuck is this, god? This is our shit, we built this, you can’t just bring someone else in on our shit.


God is like, nah it’s cool, trust me. She’s like ok i guess.


All of a sudden, god & adam are super close. God is like yo adam, i made you and adam is like bro lol that’s dope, yo what’s that crystal thing? God is like you can’t touch it, it’s mine, i made that from the last time i destroyed everything. This is the forbidden fruit. 


Then a little while later, mother earth walks in on adam puking in the toilet after a night of drinks with god and she sees he’s got a nasty ass wound right on his ribs. This is adam’s rib that god used to create eve. 


Sure enough, next day, boom, eve is here. Mother earth is like yo wtf, there’s another one!? And god is like yeah, it’s cool, just chill. 


And eve is a conniving bitch too. She’s like oh man, this is a nice place, show me around, sike,  i’m gonna go up here to this office and mother earth is like you can never go in there! This is the garden of eden.


Mother earth is like yo god, i told you i don’t like these people, i want them out of here, this is my shit. And god is still like no i’m telling you, it’s cool, they got nowhere else to go. 


Then one day, smash you hear some glass break and what do you know, it’s that crystal. And who broke it? Fucking adam and eve of course. God runs in and is like wtf i told yall not to touch it, everybody get the fuck out. Then he boards the room up thus banishing adam and eve from the garden of eden. 


Right when they’re about to leave, all of a sudden their two sons come busting in the house. That’s cain and abel. 


Mother earth is like wtf, they have kids too!? And god is like it’s cool, i’ll take care of this. 


Cain is like yo dad what the fuck you’re leaving everything in your will to abel, what about me? And abel is like you suck bro, i’m dad’s favorite. Cain is like shut the fuck up abel, i’m gonna kill you and abel is like nah. God comes in and he’s like cain, you need to chill bro. Cain is like ok… sike, i’m gonna kill this motherfucker and proceeds to bash his head in with a doorknob. 


Cain takes off into the wilderness to become a restless wanderer. God and adam and eve take abel to the hospital. 


Then god and adam and eve come back and tell mother earth that abel’s dead then all these other people show up out of nowhere to mourn his death. 


They start tearing shit up. They’re breaking shit left and right and there’s this one sink in the kitchen they keep sitting on. Mother earth is like y’all better get off that shit i swear to god and they’re like nah and the sink breaks. Water starts spraying everywhere and mother earth is like yo everyone get the FUCK out of my house. This is the great flood. Everybody is gone. 


Then god and mother earth start arguing. She’s like why do you keep allowing people in our house and he’s like this is my house too and these are my fans and they love my poetry. She’s like oh yeah, you wanna create some shit? How about you fuck me for once (DAMN) and we’ll create some beautiful shit. He’s like i got you. 


They start making out on the stairs and then we cut to the next scene and they’re in bed and she’s like i’m pregnant. He’s like lol wat, we just fucked last night. And she’s like yeah but i know. He’s like dope, we’re gonna have a baby. This is the immaculate conception of jesus.


He’s all happy and she’s like cool, well i’m gonna start cleaning up the apocalypse in the kitchen. That’s called foreshadowing, kids.  


So now we fast forward and mother earth is pregnant and she’s nesting for the baby and shit. While she’s doing that, god is like man i’m feeling inspired and he starts writing again. She’s like whatever, i’m not gonna bother you then. Then he’s like i’m done and she reads it and she’s like it’s beautiful. Then his publisher shows up (and it’s kristen wiig wtf) and mother earth is like what the fuck is she doing here and god is like she read it and she loved it. And mother earth is like how the fuck did she read it already, we don’t even have internet but god is like nah, chill. 


Time to buckle up because this is where shit starts getting crazy. 


Now all these people are showing up at the house and they’re like god, we love your work. We idolize you, we just want you to touch us. This is the start of christianity (or really most religions). 


Mother earth is like wtf, no god, don’t let them in here but god is like nah, they’re my fans, i gotta share my shit with them. But these fans are nuts and they’re eating all of mother earth’s food and ripping up the house and taking anything that may have been touched by god. But god is still like ahh, i love these people and they love me and it feels awesome. Mother earth is like wtf god, i’m pregnant with your kid, that’s not enough for you?


But now these people are getting downright fucking nuts. They’re fighting over shit and killing each other. KRISTEN WIIG IS SHOOTING MOTHERFUCKERS EXECUTION STYLE IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. 


She’s like is it hot in here or is it just me? lol global warming. 


Riot police show up, people start blowing shit up, all of a sudden people are locked in cages and shit is just going absolutely bananas. 


While all of this is going on, mother earth is going into labor. She’s crawling through the house trying to find god but she keeps running into crazier and crazier shit. 


Finally god comes and he’s like oh shit, let’s get you somewhere safe and he drags her through the crowd and breaks open the doors to the garden of eden, takes her in there and barricades them inside. 


Shit is still going nuts outside while she’s giving birth. She’s screaming loud as fuck and then boom, baby pops out. God is like it’s a boy (cuz it’s jesus) and all of a sudden everything outside gets silent. 


Mother earth is like why the fuck is it so quiet out there? God is like they’re just waiting to see the baby. They brought us gifts and it’s a bunch of fruit and blankets and shit. 


Then god is like let me hold him. Mother earth is like no, i know what you’re up to. God is like that’s my kid, let me hold him and mother earth is like FUCK NO go away. Then they just go into an epic staredown. They’re staring at each other for like three days while she holds jesus. Apparently he didn’t need to shit or pee or anything. 


Then finally mother earth loses the staring contest and dozes off for literally like a second and wakes up and jesus is gone. 


She runs outside and god is holding up jesus and the crowd is going nuts. She goes to grab jesus but it’s too late, god already passed him into the crowd.


Jesus is being passed around and is unleashing three days worth of pee on the crowd. I’m not kidding, he’s literally peeing into the crowd and they love it. 


Mother earth is running through the crowd trying to catch her baby. Baby jesus is just crowdsurfing and pissing everywhere when all of a sudden HIS NECK FUCKING SNAPS. 


THAT SHIT WAS FUCKING CRAZY. 


Mother earth is like WTF YOU KILLED MY SON. and they’re like we’re sorry but he died for us and they start FUCKING EATING BABY JESUS. 


God is like no baby, it was an accident, we have to forgive them. Mother earth is like fuck all you motherfuckers and she runs to the basement. She’s had it up to here with this shit. 


She grabs a lighter and an axe and goes up to this big ass tank of oil and hits it with the axe and spills oil everywhere. God comes running down and he’s like no don’t do it, these are my people, i love you. And mother earth is like you don’t love me, you only love that i love you. And she sets the fucking house on fire. The motherfucking apocalypse. 


The whole house pretty much bursts into flames, everyone inside dies, the house explodes and you see mother earth’s face literally burning as she sheds a tear. 


Cut to the next scene, and there’s smug ass god standing there in perfect condition (you know, because he’s god and nothing hurts him). He picks mother earth up out of the ashes and she’s barely breathing. 


She’s like i’m dead and he’s like wait i need one more thing. And she’s like motherfucker i gave you everything and now i’m dying. He’s like i need your heart and she’s like ok i guess, i don’t need it anymore. So he digs into her chest, pulls her heart out, she dies, then he squeezes her heart and it becomes that crystal thing that was the forbidden fruit. 


Next scene, mother earth wakes up and she’s like yo, where’s this motherfucker at? But it’s not jennifer lawrence. End of movie. 


tl;dr god is a self-righteous prick and accidentally destroys earth but it’s cool because he can just make another one. In Aladdin, Jafar was the good guy. The city of Agrabah was ruled by an uncaring monarch (the Sultan) who played with toys, clearly ate too much, and lived in an extravagant palace. Meanwhile, his people were starving and lived in severe poverty, barely surviving as bandits, brothels, and beggars populated the streets.  And the Sultan's naive, silver-spooned daughter thought she understood the people's lives after spending, you know, like 2 hours outside. 

So, as the Grand Vizier (that's like a Prime Minister), Jafar got fed up and did the only thing he could to save his people - orchestrate a coup d'état to seize power from the ineffective Sultan. Sadly, his plans were foiled by the selfish Aladdin. Aladdin was a self-admitted thief and con man who stole from poor people. He only cared about himself - he got three wishes and used them to become a fake prince in order to hit on the only rich girl in town, save his life from a jam he got himself into, and then freed the Genie (probably in the hopes of having an all powerful ally). What did he do for his people? Nothing. Jafar did everything he could to save Agrabah, but in the end, Aladdin prevailed, moved into the palace with the princess, and the Sultan continued ignoring his starving populace.

The entire animated movie we saw was told by the Genie to paint Aladdin and himself in the best and most sympathetic light. Revisionist history at its best. 

Jafar was the good guy.In the 11th season episode 'Bart to the Future' (broadcast in 2000) a fortune teller shows Bart a future in which Lisa is President of the United States. During the episode Lisa mentions a financial crisis brought on by her predecessor 'President Trump'.  None of the future episodes are considered canon but I think it likely that if President Trump happens in real life the show will make an exception. It would also fit with Bart becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at the end of 'Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie' because Lisa could appoint Bart.  (First off, I'm aware that I'm putting way too much thought into creating an in-universe explanation for plot armor. Don't judge me. I have a lot of time on my hands. If you don't want to read all this, just read the bolded parts)

The most important spell used in the Harry Potter books was the one Lily chose to cast over Harry. By *specifically choosing to die* out of love rather than choosing to live (that's why James's sacrifice did nothing), she created a protection for Harry capable of overpowering Avada Kedavra, the most powerful spell known to wizards. Harry then later chose to make that same deliberate sacrifice for his friends, causing all of Voldemort's spells to be harmless against them.

**The Founders of Hogwarts chose to sacrifice themselves in order in order to cast that same protection spell over the grounds of Hogwarts, to protect the students there.**

The books themselves even hint at it pretty clearly. Dumbledore mentions that "The castle is a stronghold of ancient magic" (notably, the only other time Dumbledore specifically mentions ancient magic is when he is explaining Harry's protection to him). When Ron discusses how Sirius broke into Hogwarts, Hermione says that "This castle is protected by more than walls.". Finally, Hagrid tells Harry that "Gringotts is the safest place there is-- 'cept maybe Hogwarts."

It seems strange how people regard Hogwarts as safe, given the hundreds of underage witches and wizards with zero training all trying to do magic and make potions. Yet, when there was a single death (Myrtle), people flipped out, and considered closing the school. That indicates that death was incredibly uncommon.

**The Founders' spell altered situations and probability to help students escape mortal danger or severe harm**

This is basically required to just run the school, even without any of Harry & co.'s hijinks. Students repeatedly test new spells on themselves and others in class, and brew potions that can turn toxic with even a small mistake. They deal with dangerous creatures on a near daily basis, and their one sport literally features hitting opponents with a 40 pound metal ball to try and knock them off their broom to a 50 foot drop. The protection spell makes sure all those situations end up safely (at least relatively so).

Let's just run through a list of examples:

**Pre-HP books:**

* Tom Riddle attempted to use the Basilisk while at Hogwarts, and Dippet mentions a series of attacks, yet Myrtle is the only death. We can assume there was a series of fantastic coincidences that managed to save them, just like his second attempt.

**Philosopher's Stone**

* Neville falls about 30 feet off his broom, and is completely fine
* Harry's broom is bewitched by Quirrel/Voldemort, a powerful dark wizard, yet manages to hang on.
* Harry, Ron, and Hermione get through a series of deadly traps, and take on Quirrel/Voldemort in person. Yes, Voldemort couldn't kill Harry, but the deadly plants, vicious chess pieces, and poison definitely could. Ron got crushed brutally by a stone chess piece and was fine.

**Chamber of Secrets:**

* During Riddle's second attempt, via diary, crazy coincidences kept happening: Colin is looking through a camera, Mrs. Norris is looking at a puddle, Ernie is looking through Nick, etc. How could six people/animals/ghosts (along with all the students from the first time) be that lucky?
* Ron carries around a defective wand for his second year, which constantly does spells wrong and backfires, eventually exploding with the force of a grenade. Despite that, there's never any permanent harm.
* Hermione takes a bad polyjuice potion, something that is e*xplicitly stated to be deadly*, or at minimum, horrifically painful, yet it's only a minor inconvenience. She also managed to brew Harry and Ron's perfectly, despite it being an incredibly difficult potion to make, even for skilled witches and wizards.
* Harry gets hit by a giant flying piece of metal, falls 40-50 feet to the ground, and only ends up with a broken arm.

**Prisoner of Azkaban:**

* Harry is attacked by dementors, somehow manages not to get his soul sucked out, and falls over a hundred feet, being conveniently caught by Dumbledore (who apparently didn't decide to save him the other time he fell off his broom).
* Malfoy is attacked by Buckbeak, and receives only a minor injury. He deliberately insulted a deadly, 600 pound beast with razor claws while Hagrid was halfway across the paddock, he should have been ground weasel meat.
* Lupin turns into a werewolf and rampages across the grounds, yet no one ends up being harmed, not even Sirius, who was a far smaller dog.
* Harry is surrounded by dozens of dementors, the most we've ever seen in one place, and manages to pull off the patronus charm. Yes, he had the whole confidence boost, but that's still an *insane* achievement, especially for a wizard his age.

**Goblet of Fire**

* First off, *literally every Triwizard task*. Seriously, they had to take on a dragon, dive into a dangerous lake, and go through a deadly maze. Even with all the "precautions" Dumbledore and the others took, it was still beyond dangerous.
* Snape mentions to the students that he's going to test their antidote knowledge *by poisoning one of them*. Knowing Snape, that's likely not a joke.
* Malfoy got turned into a ferret, then bounced off of the walls and ceiling. Hilarity aside, that should probably have resulted in a lot of broken bones and bruises, or even death.
* Barty Crouch used imperio to control Krum to attack Fleur and Cedric, but left them both alive. Why would he bother doing so? Krum used crucio, Avada Kedavara wouldn't have been out of the question.

**Order of the Phoenix**

* Umbridge tortures Harry by magically carving letters into his skin, which he never received medical help for (besides Hermione giving him some weird pus after a few times).
* Fred and George release flaming explosives into Hogwarts specifically designed to destroy things, as well as a full size swamp. Somehow, nobody got third degree burns or died.
* Montague was stuffed into a broken vanishing cabinet by the Weasley twins, and was trapped in a weird limbo. He then splinched his way out into a toilet (horrible brain image), but miraculously survived.
* McGonagall gets hit full on by five stunning spells. Madam Pomfrey flat out says that she should have died, especially with her age.
* Umbridge is flat out willing to use Crucio on Harry, and is only stopped by a *really* transparent distraction by Hermione

**Half Blood Prince**

* When Draco sneaks poison into Slughorn's gift for Dumbledore of mead, Slughorn instead decides to keep it, but not drink it. Thus, the poison is kept directly next to the man best suited to counteract potions, as well as who keeps a number of bezoars handy.
* It's unclear exactly where Katie is when she touches the cursed necklace, if she's on Hogwarts grounds or not, but she touches only the smallest bit of the necklace through a hole in her glove, surviving an otherwise deadly curse. Her survival also acts as a warning mechanism to save Dumbledore.
* Draco attempts to hit Harry with the Killing curse in the bathroom, but misses, at very close range
* Harry hits Draco with *sectumsempra,* a curse that slices open the body, and can't be healed by magic. At that exact moment, who's walking by but Snape, the *one person in the castle* who knows how to heal those wounds.
* During the battle at the astronomy tower, none of the Hogwarts students or Order members die. That's despite the fact that they're facing an elite Death Eater hit squad, who have all committed numerous murders. The DA members had Felix Felicis, but the Order members didn't. Bill came out the worst, with only some facial scarring.
* Dumbledore's death. Yes, he died. But note that he's not trying to save himself, and purposefully put himself in a position where the odds were stacked highly against him, even with manipulation by a protective spell. Had he attempted to survive, he likely could have.

**The Deathly Hallows**

* The general activities of the DA at Hogwarts. Seriously, you had a handful of teenagers going up against brutal torturers and killers, and emerging with only some cuts and bruises.
* The Battle of Hogwarts. Obviously, this seems like a bit of a hole in the theory: Plenty of Hogwarts students and allies died. But as we've seen throughout the series, any spell has it's limits, and it can't protect everyone. In addition, it's just a matter of chance. The spell can make it more likely that a student can dodge a hex, or a curse will miss them, but when it's happening hundreds, thousands of times, eventually their luck runs out. In all honesty, the fact that they managed to do as well as they did was incredibly impressive. The defenders only had about 20-25 trained, adult witches and wizards along with a bunch of teenagers, while the Death Eaters had a small army that was highly trained, with powerful dark magic.

**How did this happen?**

Let's get into the details now.

**The four founders were the "most skilled witches and wizards of their age". Given that they apparently built and enchanted Hogwarts alone, that seems like a fair assessment. They also all had a dedication to passing on their knowledge to future generations. However, a school full of kids learning magic is gonna have a lot of inherent dangers. Add on the persecution of witches and wizards at the time, and threat of dark wizard attacks, and there's plenty of potential reasons their school could collapse in a matter of years without them there to defend it. Unless... they could defend it forever somehow. Once the castle was done, by sacrificing themselves, they could protect students for as long as the enchantment stood. For Hufflepuff, this was done out of kindness and concern for others. For Ravenclaw, it was practicality and logic. She was already sick and dying, and her sacrifice could let numerous others seek wisdom. Gryffindor was known for his bravery and nobility, he'd likely jump at the chance to sacrifice himself. The only one who wouldn't was Slytherin, whose self interest prevented him from the sacrifice. This may very well have been the reason he left the group, an argument over whether or not to cast the enchantment. (Interestingly, Slytherin is the only founder we have specific knowledge on his death and burial site). The spell likely required some preparation, as it was extremely complex. That long time preparing may even have been the reason Ravenclaw was sick. In the end, all three founders sacrificed themselves, in order to ensure a better future for their students.**After rewatching Civil War recently i picked up on the moment Vision fell in 'love' with Wanda. Vision discusses in some depth that he is not necessarily in control of himself, and that the Mind Stone has influence over him. He hopes that by learning more about it, that he will eventually be able to control it one day and have complete autonomy.

Afterward, Hawkeye helps Wanda escape, Wanda uses her powers to push Vision through the ground in order to escape. I had always assumed that she just affected him on an atomic/physical level which gave her the ability to phase him in and out and also to move his body around, just like she would move around any other object. After rewatching i realized that as soon as Wanda attacks him, the Mind Stone glows bright red and from that point on she has control over him. Wanda is actually controlling the stone, which in turn controls Visions body.

The first scene we see Wanda and Vision together after this point is the aftermath of the Airport scene. He embraces her, then goes to shoot Falcon down but accidentally hits Rhodey. Stark asks what happened, Vision responds that he was "distracted". Tony says he didn't think that was possible, Vision agrees. I think as soon as Wanda controlled the Mind Stone and escaped, Vision grew a strong affinity to her. Not only is she the only person that could possibly understand how the mind stone affects him (given her circumstance), she also has the ability to control it which is something he desires more than anything.

I also believe this is why Vision is so confident that Wanda can destroy the Mind Stone in Infinity War, despite this never coming up in conversation prior (that we see at least). He has seen first hand that she can control the stone - something no one else has been able to do bar Thanos via the gauntlet.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: Vision wants complete autonomy of himself, the sentience of the Mind Stone doesn't allow for this. He gets himself an overly controlling girlfriend in hope she can cure his Multiple Personality Disorder.*** **First, here's a quick recap of the scenes in question (you can skip this part if you remember enough of the scene):** 

Lt. Hicox  (played by an AMAZING Michael Fassbender**^1**) accompanied by Lt. Wicki and Hooogo Shhhtiglitz, were merely supposed to rendezvous with German actress/double-agent Bridget von Hammersmark  at a small French tavern in a "fucking basement."

Hicox and co. expected it to be an empty French tavern, when in fact it is filled with German military because a German private -- Private Wilhelm -- just became a father and they're all celebrating there.

Pvt. Wilhelm gets drunk and pesters von Hammersmark, who plays it off.  Unfortunately, Lt. Hicox gets annoyed and berates Pvt. Wilhelm.  The problem is that Hicox is British-born, so he has a thick English/British accent when speaking German, and the drunk Wilhelm points it out -- despite openly questioning an officer from the status of an enlisted man.  Wilhelm's curiosity is shared by Major Hellstrom, who puts down his book and walks to the Hicox table to ask them questions.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

* **How and when they got "caught" as imposters**....*apparently*

Apparently, Major Hellstrom "realizes" that they're imposters when Hicox throws up the ["British" 3-finger signal](http://i.imgur.com/QKZCosx.jpg) instead of the ["German" 3-finger signal](http://i.imgur.com/5HkYpOY.jpg) when asking for 3 glasses.  **This is the popular interpretation, but a red herring.**

We are led to believe that this is the turning point, since Hellstrom's face changes from amicable to serious at this point, and he eventually points is Walther at Hicox.   

**However, Hellstrom *never* actually says that *this* is what gave them away.  It was only *Bridget von Hammersmark* who suggested it.  We never get confirmation from Hellstrom about the "unorthodox three-finger order."**

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Hellstrom actually figured it out long before this -- which explains all the awkwardness before the 3-finger order.**

**Once Hellstrom arrives at the table, it is at THIS POINT that he already knows that they're all frauds.  He not only "suspects," but he *knows,* immediately.  Here are the reasons demonstrating Hellstrom's knowledge that they're frauds**



* **Hellstrom knows a lot more about German cinema than Hicox expects, and can't stump him**

When Hellstrom gets to the table, we of course get the awkward line of questioning.  Hellstrom asks the reasons for their visit, their names, and the origin of Lt. Hicox, as he cannot place his accent despite his "sharp ear for accents" (he presumably correctly guessed that Stiglitz was from Frankfurt and Wicki from Munich).   It's all followed by awkward laughing by the Basterds and Bridget.

To backtrack, Lt. Hicox was a film critic before the war, and he had two books published on cinema.  His two books were BOTH studies on German cinema.  However, he hasn't watched any German films made since WWII started due to lack of German export of them.  This is important.

Back to the table.  Hellstrom asks about Hicox's origin, who responds that he's from Piz Palu, a small German village, "as seen in the Riefenstahl film."  Presumably, Hicox is trying to play off his obvious foreign accent as a common one from a small German town, a town that is represented in an obscure German film that Hicox is sure that Hellstrom has never seen.  This would lend credibility to Hicox's German origin while presumably preclude Hellstrom from further questioning.  This backfires.

Hicox's expertise in German cinema can't bail him out here because Hellstrom is presumably a huge German cinema buff (more on that below).  He not only knows of the "Riefenstahl film" Hicox name-drops, he knows of every scene that Hicox tries to throw out to Hellstrom, and Hicox can't stump him.  It gets so awkward that Bridget von Hammersmark interjects with support by saying "if my word means anything, everything he's saying is correct," sensing that the Major is onto them.

Also, he's seen reading a book before approaching the table -- a possible clue that he might have actually read -- or is currently reading -- one off Hicox's two books on German cinema.  

Essentially, Hellstrom is buying NONE of their bullshit about Hicox being from Piz Palu and his accent originating from there, since he's seen the film and Hicox isn't actually in it and the accent isn't actually in the film.

* **He knows all the German officers stationed in France**.  

This is an obvious clue, since Hellstrom outright states it.  Earlier in the film, we see him escort Shoshanna/Emannuelle to the French cafe to meet Joseph Goebbels and Hans Landa, showing his high rank and placement within the German garrison in Paris. Since he's a Major, he presumably should know all the lieutenants and sergeants stationed in Paris... and obviously, the Basterds aren't German officers, Hellstrom knows this, and Hellstrom is toying with them.

* **He recognizes Hugo Stiglitz immediately.**  

1) Earlier in the film, the first German Colonel who gets his brains beaten in by the Bear Jew states that "**Everyone in the German Army has heard of *Hugo Stiglitz*."**  Stiglitz's picture was plastered in the German newspapers along with the pictures 13 Gestapo Officers he killed.  Also, Hellstrom says he knows "every German stationed in France *worth knowing*."  Remember, Stiglitz WAS a *German soldier stationed in France*, and he was a German Officer serial killer -- **so Hellstrom absolutely knew it was Stiglitz, as he certainly is a German worth knowing.**  The final proof is that Stiglitz was supposed to be transferred to Berlin for execution, but the Basterds broke him out of the Parisian cell, putting him in Paris while Hellstrom is still there.  BTW, Stiglitz was in Paris when the Basterds broke him out, providing more proof that Hellstrom knows it's Stiglitz.  

2) Hellstrom slaps Stiglitz around to play around with him.  Hellstrom slaps Stiglitz hard twice to get him to move over when he insists on sitting at the table.  He again slaps Stiglitz twice, hard, to write a name on his card for the drinking game.  **He's toying with Stiglitz at this point, knowing that *Stiglitz can't touch Hellstrom* without blowing his cover**, as much as Stiglitz wants to kill Hellstrom (which is why Hellstrom is shocked when Stiglitz blows his cover by pointing his gun at Hellstrom's balls).   

3) Stiglitz shows genuine concern (biting his teeth) about getting recognized when Hellstrom gets up momentarily to pick up the cards.  Also, when Stiglitz lapses into a flashback of getting whipped in German prison, there's slight implication that it was Hellstrom who did the whipping.

* **They play the "Who Am I?" drinking game, and Hellstrom gives Hicox the obscure German actress, [Brigitte Horney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Horney)**.  

The drinking game requires each player to write down a fictitious or real person down on a card and pass it to his or her left, so that *that* person must stick that card on the forehead and ask questions to try to figure out the identity.  

Hellstrom sits to the immediate right of Hicox, meaning that he intentionally gave Hicox not only an obscure German actress for him to guess, but an actress who is best known for [Munchhausen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_%28film%29), a film made under the Third Reich -- and a film that Hicox couldn't have possibly seen since he's not actually German.  Earlier in the film, Hicox admitted to not having seen "any German films under the Third Reich in the last 3 years," (since Germany didn't export any of its films to the UK during WWII) and this film was released within that 3-year period.  Essentially, **Hellstrom is testing Hicox, or taunting him by making him uncomfortable, by giving him an actress that only a German living in Nazi Germany would know of.**  

Again, this shows that Hellstrom is a German film buff, especially German films under the Third Reich.  Because he's a film buff,tere's also a slight chance that Hellstrom actually knows who Hicox is (a British film critic of German cinema), since Hicox has written ***two*** books on German cinema (we know that Hellstrom can read English, too).

* **Major Hellstrom attempts to get everyone as intoxicated as possible in order to get an advantage before the shootout.**  

It was Hellstrom's idea to play the "Who Am I?" game, and if the player guesses the card correctly, everyone at the table must drink.  **He volunteers to go *first* -- meaning that if he "wins," everyone at the table must drink.**  

He wins after guessing "King Kong," and everyone applauds while trying to avoid drinking.  He reminds everyone that they need to  "finish their drinks" -- so they do.   At this point, Hicox insists that Hellstrom leave, and after Hellstrom makes them feel uncomfortable, he finally relents and says that he'll leave after they have one more drink.  **Notice how Hellstrom orders Scotch for the 3 soldiers, but nothing for himself ("I like Scotch, Scotch doesn't like me").  He's trying to get the 3 Basterds as drunk as possible before the firefight, while he only takes a sip from his beer while they toast.**  

**TL;DR** -- In the film, it's only *implied* that Major Hellstrom figures out that the Basterds are imposters because of the "3-finger order," but that was only theorized by Bridget von Hammersmark.  In actuality, Hellstrom knew IMMEDIATELY, since he's a Major who knows all the German officers stationed in France (the Basterds aren't German Officers, obviously), he knows all the German soldiers worth knowing (like Stiglitz), he taunts both Hicox and Stiglitz by flirting with their "covers," and he tries to get the 3 Basterds as drunk as possible -- while only sipping his lukewarm beer himself."

FOOTNOTE


**^1** I watched *Inglourious Basterds* in theaters in 2009, and this was my first time that I really watched Michael Fassbender, as I had ***NO IDEA*** who he was until the credits (I didn't know he was in *300*, and he literally put on a forgettable performance for me since I didn't remember him, through no fault of his own, though).  

Anyway, Fassbender's performance was so captivating that I literally stayed through the credits to see who the actor was, even though he was on screen for a total of maybe 6-8 minutes.  That was the ONLY time I have ever sat through the credits to figure out the identity of an actor.  Literally said in the middle of the film to my friend, "who the FUCK is this actor?"We all know that Hermione catches Rita Skeeter, in her animagus form as a beetle, while Rita is spying on the hospital wing after the Triwizard Tournament. And of course on your first dozen read-throughs, the reader is completely on board with this, because Rita is a toxic little beetle of a journalist.

However, if Hermione hadn't caught Rita and blackmailed her into silence, what would Rita's next big exposé have been? I think, given where Rita was captured -- on the window of the hospital wing -- tells us that she could have (and I say definitely *would* have) overheard Dumbledore's speech to Fudge, at the very least. She knew about Barty Crouch Jr., she knew about Harry's claims that Voldemort had returned, and she knew that Fudge was being a little punk and that the witness to the whole evil plot -- Crouch Jr. -- was permanently silenced by a dementor brought in by the Minister of Magic himself.

Now, I'm not saying she would have necessary got all the details right -- it is Rita Skeeter, after all -- but she had the bones of an amazing story there, and I'm sure she would have been salivating to expose all of it. *Maybe* she would have sided with Fudge, and might have continued along the lines that Harry is crazy, etc. But we've already seen that her ultimate motive is the biggest, juiciest story she can find. And what could be more juicy than a ministry cover-up about the return of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? She would have her tragic hero again, in Harry Potter (an angle that people seem to love), she would be exposing the corruption and cowardice of the Minister of Magic himself (which, come on, she would adore doing), and she would be announcing the most sensational and horrifying news of the decade -- Voldemort's return.

But instead, Hermione catches Rita, keeps her magically contained until at least after the train ride home, and then blackmails her into journalistic silence for a year. Rita cares more about her self-preservation than about the truth -- that's been made clear. So she didn't write the the story, and the wizarding world was kept in the dark for a full year longer than needed to happen.In the movie Mulan, Fa Mulan takes her father's place in the army, pretending to be his son, Ping. When Mulan arrives at the encampment, it is stated that they did not know Fa Zhou had a son. Mulan was assigned to the same unit her father was in his place. 

The unit is full of misfits, and lead by a young inexperienced Captain. Mulan joins the ranks and together they defeat the Huns. But their unit was never supposed to see battle. They only reason they saw combat was because the main army had been wiped out. They were an auxiliary unit, and no one had expected them to see real combat.  

My theory is that they were hoping Fa Zhou, Mulan's father, showed up. They were well aware he was older and unable to fight along side the young men. When Mulan first arrives, they know of Fa Zhou by name and reputation. As a wise soldier of the last great war, he was supposed to help shape the misfit unit. He had rank so he would have been put in a leadership role with the unit, helping guide them into being proper soldiers. As a veteran he would have made a great ally for the young Captain on battle tactics and on how to guide young men. Something the Captain could have used. 

Mulan showing up in Fa Zhou's place took that mentor to the young and inexperienced soldiers away making the Captain's job harder. The army planned to give him an experienced soldier who could no longer fight to help him, instead he struggles with his soldiers and himself throughout the film.

To;Dr The army planned on giving the young Captain a wise veteran to help with his misfit unit, but Mulan took her father's place, making the Captain's job much harder.It's been stated many times that Timmy is a middle-class kid in a developed country, and despite family problems, he's not nearly as miserable as other kids throughout the world who need to fight for food, or are trafficked and raped.

Idk if it's really confirmed whether or not such children can receive fairies. I know that Remy Buxaplenty originally received his godparents from effectively a similar need: His family was starving on an island. He received a macho fairy obsessed with glamor and beauty, who gave his family great wealth.

Remy then becomes the antagonist that he is now, flaunting his wealth on Timmy and others. Ironically, his bullying of poorer kids may actually produce a bit of misery in them.

However, let's consider another vertex of the spectrum: Tootie. Tootie had fairly oddparents for half of a day, thanks to Timmy, and he was only able to do that because she's confirmed to be twice as miserable as he is. She was ready to reveal the secret within hours, and only kept it until midnight because Timmy kept stalling her. If it was a true secret, she would've exposed fairies to the world and had her memories wiped, making it just as if she'd never had fairies.

We also see, in one episode, that kids in the fictional developing country of Ustinkistan get a different kind of fairies that can only grant turnip-related wishes (likely because the country's entire economy revolves around turnip, so that's what happiness in that country is measured with).

I suppose that means there are different kinds of fairies that specialize in addressing different kinds of misery. Cosmo and Wanda are of the kind that's specialized in treating the psychological misery that results from a neglectful family. He was specifically assigned a fairy couple, a godmother AND godfather, to act as healthy parental figures in addition of his inadequate real parents: A compassionate mother to teach him reason and a father to teach him fun and play the good cop. The wishes he makes, realizes the consequences of, and then unmakes all form life lessons that help him grow as a person, similar to a parents' punishments.

Notice that when Cosmo and Wanda quit in Fairy Idol it only opened one slot for a new godparent? That's because they're effectively filling one job: Providing a pair of competent parents to someone who has none.

There are probably millions of poverty fairies working in Africa, but they're restricted in magical ability just like the Ustinkistani ones, because millions of poor people suddenly wishing up wealth like Remy would throw entire countries into disarray, inflate currencies, cause wars, and likely expose fairies, putting them in danger of more Crockers. Timmy makes world-changing wishes all the time, but he undoes it after being punished by unintended consequences of the wish.


I suppose Remy's entire character arc is equivalent to one of Timmy's wishes, and we just happen to catch him in a timeline he didn't unwish.

In conclusion, fairies aren't assigned based on misery, it's based on the feasibility of Fairies resolving the misery without exposing themselves and other humans to harm.In what we see of Anakin's dream it's just Obi Wan saying "relax" while Padme is dying in childbirth. Anakin isn't in the dream from what we see. Whenever Padme brings up Obi Wan in their conversation Anakin just says something like "he can't help us" or "we don't need him". Anakin sort of knows Obi Wan sort of knows about their relationship or that theirs something going on. (At least tell senator amadala I said hello). Also Anakin has been blindingly beliving his dreams because not doing anything about them got his mother killed.

He probably thought that Kenobi was either going to sabatoge their relationship (rat him out to the Jedi council). Or that Obi Wan would take Padme for himself somehow.

Also Anakin says "you will not take her from me" as the one of the first things he tells Obi Wan on Mustafar.To Kill a Mockingbird takes place between 1933 and 1935, it would make sense that Atticus had served during WW1 and that's why he doesn't shoot or kill anything anymore.

The US was involved in ww1 from 1917-1918.

Scout describes Atticus Finch as being "nearly 50"

That would put him in his mid-late 20s during ww1.

The Selective Service Act of 1917 had a registration for the draft for all men between ages 21 and 30, which Atticus would have been.

When Atticus had to shoot to kill the rabid dog, he had amazing aim and took out the dog, showing that he had familiarity with a weapon.The setting of the 1979 original was dystopian, but doesn't feature any hint of an apocalypse. But his family meant the world to Max, and they were killed by a gang leader.

Any apocalypse in Mad Max must have happened at some point between the first movie and Road Warrior. By the time of Fury Road, the fall itself and the pre-apocalyptic world have all but faded from living memory. Characters that ostensibly remember the world before are generally old like Immortan Joe. However, crucially, Furiosa – who was born and raised in the post-apocalyptic wasteland – *appears to be about the same age as Max*.

Have you ever given a second thought to the franchise being called MAD Max? What if Max literally went mad when his family died, and his basic delusion is that the entire world came to an end when *his* world did?

&#x200B;

When he broke, he stole his police cruiser and simply drove off into nowhere. Everything after this is a manifestation of his psychosis. Note how quickly the aesthetic evolves between Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. Even though the apocalypse can't have happened very long ago, things have already rusted and fallen apart much more than you'd expect them to. The world couldn't have decayed that quickly, unless the decay is just a figment of Max' one-track imagination.

Max is trying to get to the "Plains of Silence", where he thinks he can find peace. But wherever he goes, and whoever he meets, he is always being chased and fought by a menagerie of insane gang leaders and their henchmen. Maybe they're actually cops trying to catch a dangerous and armed rogue policeman roving through the countryside in his stolen interceptor? Sure, we see brutal gangs of war boys, but that's because we see what he sees – just like a mental patient might think they're fighting a group of murderous zombies when it's actually just the nurses come to give them an antipsychotic drug. Max' particular delusion involves merciless gangs because that's how he lost his family.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Max Rockatansky is actually a latter-day Don Quixote, riding his metal steed through a wasteland of his own imagination, fighting "dangerous giants" that are actually benign windmills in a world he no longer understands, or cares to understand. Because the world is literally dead to him.**

I'm sure this has more issues than Harper's Magazine, but I had this realization the other day and needed to get it off my chest.Moana dies out at sea but is resurrected as a Demi-God. 

In Disney’s Moana, Moana’s mission is to deliver the Demi-God Maui across the great ocean so he can restore the heart of Te Fiti. After escaping the grasps of the Kakamora Maui tells Moana “You can’t restore the heart without me. And me says no.” What if this line had a deeper meaning? It infers that Moana needed Maui because only he knew the way to Te Fiti but what if he meant that only a being as powerful as a Demi-God could fight Te Ka and restore the heart? What Maui doesn’t know is that by this time, Moana had died at sea but was resurrected as a Demi-God. 

Right before Moana meets Maui for the first time, she battles inclement weather and rough seas. A lightning strike dramatically ends the scene. It was at this point that Moana dies. In the same way the Gods found Maui when was he was tossed into the ocean as an infant, the Gods found Moana and made her into a Demi-God as well. Unlike Maui though, Moana is unaware of this and still thinks she is a mortal.

Upon entering Lalotai, Maui is shocked that Moana followed him. He tells her that she, a mortal, has no business being there except as bait. Even Tamatoa asks Moana, “What are you doing down here, in the realm of the monsters?” What if they were surprised that she was there because no mortal could survive the long plunge into Lalotai thus proving that she was a Demi-God. 

In the end, Moana herself was able to defeat Te Ka and restore the heart of Te Fiti like only a Demi-God could.While it's set in the same universe as Monsters, Inc., Monsters University is actually a Steve Jobs-esque biopic film about Mike and Sully that was made in the Monsters universe after the events of Monsters, Inc.

Monsters Inc. establishes some things early on that University will contradict. Mike says to Sully early on that he's been jealous of him since the fourth grade which establishes that they've known each other for almost all their lives.  University will contradict this by having the two meet much later. 

The opening scene of Inc. shows some new scare recruits being trained who are utterly incompetent and hesitant. One even says "You can't make me." This establishes that there is a shortage of scare labor and that initial  training is done on site. Scaring is also dangerous work which is held in a certain esteem, but is not nearly as prestigious as it will be portrayed in University.

University makes scaring out to be the M.D. of its world: a highly selective highly sought out highly demanding and highly esteemed position. Training before one starts working is extensive and many are rejected due to not being the best of the best.

So why the contradictions? The company needed to create some positive P.R. after the scandal of Mr. Waternoose's child abduction plot. So it commissioned some hagiography of its new leaders Mike and Sully. It sought to portray scaring in a much more positive light and to portray it's new leaders as talented and hard working guys who came from nothing. Notice that Mike and Sully don't finish their degree. Instead they work their way up at the company from low skill positions. University seeks to explain their lack of professional training and credentials and cast it in a positive light. University also fiddles with the relationships between Mike, Sully, & Randle in the same way Pirates of Silicon Valley does with Jobs, Gates, and Wozniak.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3HrqCgn_lE

On 23 April, 2014, Maxwell, the Geico pig, says, "Who's got two hooves and just got a claim status update from Geico? This guy, that's who!"

Pigs have four hooves. What happened to Maxwell's two hind hooves? Let us investigate.

9 January 2014: Maxwell renews his Drivers License. Hind hooves are shown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slk7yCySQ3s

23 March 2014: Maxwell buys a new sports car: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qTVCdVnTuw

11 June 2014: Maxwell is shown working as a ticket-taker in a movie theater and spoils the plot-twists for every film. Hind hooves are not shown.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64cBC3IgcCw

So at some point before 23 April 2014, Maxwell lost his hind hooves. But how could this happen? Let's consider what we know about the Geico pig.

Maxwell lived a thrill-seeking life from as early as childhood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tfz2DD_UQ

As he grew up, Maxwell continued to pursue more dangerous thrills, always seeking a stronger dose of "pure adrenaline:" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj7cBYHJgis

I posit that Maxwell, giddy with the excitement of owning a sports car, and confident that he was fully insured by Geico, proceeded to drive extremely recklessly. He drove so recklessly, in fact, that he caused a major automobile collision, resulting in the amputation of both his hind legs.

I'm sure many people might have reservations about this theory, but let's begin by considering if it's even possible. Well, according to WebMD, "About 1.8 million Americans are living with amputations. Amputation of the leg -- either above or below the knee -- is the most common amputation surgery." Furthermore, among the list of causes for amputations that WebMD lists, severe injury from automobile accidents are mentioned first. WebMD also weighs in on the recovery time from amputation: "Practice with the artificial limb may begin as soon as 10 to 14 days after surgery. Ideally, the wound should fully heal in about four to eight weeks."

Why do we see Maxwell doing Yoga exactly one month after he buys a sports car (and, presumably, suffers his injury)? Perhaps Yogaforamputees.com has the answer: "Yoga for Amputees addresses the special needs of amputees such as pain relief, phantom pain, stress reduction, PTSD, grief over limb loss, body alignment, balance, building confidence. safety, healthy choices, and life with or without a prosthesis."

This leaves plenty of time for Maxwell to buy a sports car on 23 March, suffer a calamitous car accident, undergo immediate surgery to amputate both hind legs, receive specially fitted artificial limbs, and recover from his injuries through yoga well enough to return to his job at the movie theater.

But is this really the end of the story?

Have we ever actually seen Maxwell working in this movie theater before? Has he ever mentioned this job before? It seems odd that a gainfully employed spokespig of Geico would pick up a second job, doesn't it?

Why would he need the extra money? Surely not to pay his medical bills. If Maxwell's medical costs were in fact inflicted by an automobile accident, his Geico insurance plan would cover them. And remember what Maxwell says on 23 April: "Who's got two hooves and just got a claim status update from Geico? This guy, that's who!" What claim is he referencing? His sports car accident which resulted in his double amputation, of course!

But this doesn't answer my question. Why does he need a second job working in a movie theater?

The answer, I think, is a dark one.

I believe Maxwell's accident involved more than just himself. Perhaps one or more other cars or pedestrians. I don't know the details. One thing is certain, though: Maxwell is strapped for cash. He is likely being sued and/or has to pay for an attorney to defend him in court.

Why hasn't this story been reported? Who is covering it up? What happened to the victims of Maxwell's mayhem? When are we going to get answers?I love the new Spiderman movies and MCU Spider-Man, and I think Tom Holland does a wonderful job. However, one of my main concerns about the MCU spidey which many others share, is we’ve rarely really gotten to see him as a broke, working class kid struggling to get by. There was a bit of this in Homecoming, but it really didn’t come through that much. Photography and struggling for money are big parts of Peter Parker’s character, and now that he’s in the avengers and has all of Tony Stark’s tech, it seemed we would never get that aspect of Spidey’s character.

BUT now that Spiderman/peter Parker will be public enemy #1 going into Spiderman 3, I’m wondering if they could work him back to his comic roots. I think Peter will have to have a low profile, and fury/Happy is going to advise him to publicly separate himself from the avengers/Stark until things settle down. They could also work in the photography-James Jameson relationship. Maybe Parker will go to Jameson and try to convince that he’s not Spiderman, but friends with him, and he can get him pictures of someone else as Spiderman to prove it.Forrest represents the idealist version of the american dream we all have in our head, he views everything in a distorted light and is quite naive and exists in his own world. Jenny however  is a representation of true America, she is flawed and ultimately broken, we see throughtout the story Forrest chases after her but he can never reach her, he doesn't see her for who she is.

This represents how the american dream does not meet with the reality of america, and those who follow it will never reach it, the real america will just reject you, even though the eamerican dream is in love with it.The title is pretty much self-explanatory.  After being dropped off, the five kids in Saturday detention are given an assignment to write a 1000 word essay on 'who they think they are'.  Andrew, John, Claire, and Allison quickly identify Brian as the one most willing to get the essay assignment out of the way.  They hatch an unspoken plot to gain his trust, put on a pretense of friendship, and include him in all of the things that they'd normally try to get away with in detention.  In the end, the other four kids manage to hook up in pairs to celebrate their deception while Brian writes an essay on everyone's behalf.  What if Lily told Petunia all about Filch? Like "Tuney, there's this man who works at the castle doing all the cleaning but he doesn't know any magic. Isn't that funny Tuney?"

And then Petunia thinks to herself that maybe if she became a good enough cleaner she could work at Hogwarts and learn magic as well so that's why she's such a constantly anal neat freak.There was a  line which Wong says in *Doctor Strange* (2016), which was:

**"We do not tamper with natural law... We defend it!"**

So this got me thinking about Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet: What he did with it in Infinity War was *very unnatural*, ending the lives of half of sentient beings across the universe in an instant.(*So this would be a major reason behind his demise in Avengers 4*)

This also got me wondering about the Infinity Gauntlet: How did Thanos come up with it or where did he get the information on how to create it and wield the Infinity stones?

If you'll think back to the first Avengers film, the scene where Loki speaks to [The Other](http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/The_Other), he tells Loki that Thanos showed him ancient knowledge and put the scepter in his hand. After viewing the later MCU films, we can guess that Thanos got this knowledge from the *Mind Stone*, which is in the scepter, and that the scepter was probably his creation to pervert the powers of the Mind stone(*which in turn was what made Ultron the defective AI that he was*).

I'd also like to point out the scene in *Age of Ultron*, when Bruce and Tony were discussing the *behavior* of the Stone within the scepter, that it looked *"like it's thinking... and these are like neurons firing."* So if the Mind stone is thinking, it isn't too much of a stretch to assume that it could also **have memories**. But memories of what exactly...

**Memories of the Original Infinity Gauntlet.**

And so, this was the instrument that Thanos saw which he would use to make his vision a reality!

Now you're wondering: **What Original Infinity Gauntlet?!**

Well, I think the original Gauntlet was created by Thor's ancestor, the first King of the Asgardians. If you'll think back to the scene in *Thor: Ragnarok*, where Hela takes Skurge down into Odin's treasure vault, she knocks over a **Fake Gauntlet**. It's obviously a fake one, and I think it may have been a goal, one of Odin's pursuits during his conquests with Hela, looking for the other Infinity stones(*since he'd already known that two/three were on Midgard/Earth*), to make a Gauntlet like his ancestor had done millennia ago. But for what purpose, I don't know.

And then I wondered what made the Asgardians so powerful, especially Odin and his family: What was so special about them? And this thought also pointed at their ancestor creating the Gauntlet.

I think the first King designed and created the Infinity Gauntlet in order to wield the Infinity stones, and with it he created Asgard(*plus the BiFrost*) and filled it with the powers of the stones *but bound this power to his bloodline*, which is what made Odin and his family so powerful. And I believe the stones showed him that they should **not tamper with natural law, but defend it**, so he must have made it his duty, the duty of his family and of Asgard, to watch over the rest of the universe(*he may have used the Gauntlet to fight of a powerful threat as well, which Thanos' actions may have undone*). From there, he destroyed the Gauntlet and sent the Infinity stones to different parts of the universe. He might have been the one who gave Agamotto the Time stone and made him the first Sorcerer Supreme(*and Agamotto in turn, taught his followers not to tamper with natural law*).

This thought also brought to mind the visions that Thor had in *Age of Ultron*, the visions he saw of the Infinity stones. I had written this [theory that the Mind Stone had been helping the Avengers from the beginning](https://old.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/9906uw/mcu_theory_spoiler_has_been_helping_the_avengers/), and in it I mentioned that Wanda could be a vessel for the Mind stone, which means that it was the stone showing these visions to Thor. At the end of *AoU*, Thor mentions that the Mind stone is the fourth of the Infinity stones to be found and that there's someone who's made pawns of them and bringing the stones up. The prevailing theory is that this was Thanos', but it could have been the Infinity stones(*specifically the Mind stone*) pulling the strings in a way as well.

I think the visions that Thor had in Age of Ultron were partly about Ragnarok, and the Mind stone could have been trying to tell Thor about creating an Infinity Gauntlet, in order to create a "New Asgard" with it after the events of Ragnarok(*but instead it went with creating Vision in order to deal with Thanos first*). I believe when Asgard was created by the first King, it wasn't just the seat of power for their family, but it was also the power that helped keep a greater(*and ancient*) threat at bay. The Infinity stones were driving Thor towards recreating the New Asgard with an Infinity Gauntlet to restore it to power and continue holding off this ancient threat, but Thanos perverted the initial design and purpose of the Infinity Gauntlet for his own gains and vision, which is why it was fried and damaged at the end of Infinity War: He used it as an Instrument of Death, when it was originally meant to be one that defended Life! I think this was also why Thor was able to use Stormbreaker to cut through the blast Thanos threw at him with the power of all six Infinity stones: It wouldn't cause harm to an Asgardian King, since the first one designed and created the original Gauntlet!

I think this could play into Doctor Strange giving up the Time stone, because he may have seen that what Thanos was doing was **tampering with natural law**, and that the Infinity stones(*and the universe*) had a plan to deal with Thanos(*which is probably the future that Strange saw, and hopefully set Tony onto*), and this is why we have the inclusion of Captain Marvel as well(*since Marvel is supposed to be a cosmic champion and protector of the universe like in the comics*).

Thanos' misuse of the Gauntlet would have sent the universe into utter chaos, but the Avengers will prevail. But, his actions, coupled with the destruction of Asgard(*and with it, the force to hold back whatever's coming*), could spell the untimely release of a much greater threat than anyone would have anticipated. If I were to guess, I think it would have to be Galactus(*probably getting released from the Quantum Realm*), but you can put whoever you want in that spot, because, well, this is all just a theory, hahaha!

Thanks for reading!I’ve heard a lot of people say that what Steve does at the end of Emdgame is selfish and totally defeats the purpose of him returning the stones. He was supposed to erase the alternate timelines but ends up creating one (or at least not caring that he’s creating one) by staying with Peggy. Based on one scene, I’ve concluded that Cap knew exactly what he was doing.

Steve is under the impression that Peggy married someone else after he went into the ice. He also thinks it’s someome he ‘rescued’ during WW2 and therefore that she met him around the same time. 

If that’s the case, isn’t it a little weird that when Steve visits 1970 in Endgame that the only keepsake she has on her desk is a picture of Steve and not her ‘husband’? 

Now I’m fully speculating here, but I think it’s more than fair to assume that the instant Steve realized time travel was possible the very first thing he thought about was going back in time to be with Peggy. I think that in that moment Steve knew. He knew that once he finished the fight of his life (and won) that he couldn’t live without a war. He knew that he needed to get some of that life Tony was talking about. He knew that he wasn’t gonna dance with anyone but the right partner. And maybe he had no good reason to but he knew that Peggy would leave him that clue after his future self told her about his adventures. 

TL;DR once Cap saw that the only sentimental item in her private office was a picture of him rather than her supposed husband, he knew that he was always her husband and made the decision to go back. 

PS I suppose I should mention I’m subscribing to the writers’ opinions that Old Cap became part of the prime timeline as opposed to the directors’ that he created a knew one.I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5rrh2z/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and/)):

**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!" 

The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his "first step" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross. 

**A point that just occurred to me:**

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully. 
It's not a huge stretch to think that (based on what we've seen in the series so far) that the longer the incantation for a spell is, the more complex the effect it has is. 

Case in point are the healing spells we see in the series. The two healing spells in the series that seem to be the easiest to cast (outside of the video games, which aren't technically canon) are Episkey and Ferula.

We can probably assume that both are fairly easy spells to master, considering Harry was able to learn Episkey on his own, and (despite it only being used once in the books) Ferula seems to be a spell specifically created to deal with injuries that can't be healed by a non-professional. Anapneo seems to be a little more complex, but also fairly simple, with the result basically being the magical version of the Heimlich maneuver. 

While the only  instance of a healing spell capable of successfully fixing major injuries is Vulnera Sanentur (a spell that requires a comparatively long casting time and incantation),  We DO get an example of what happens when you try to create simplified versions of complicated spells when Lockhart tries to fix Harry's arm. 

I'm 99% sure that Lockhart specifically mentions (either in the movie or the book) that Brackium Emendo is a spell of his own design, and  the fact that we don't see it used ever again (despite ample opportunities) makes me think that it's quite likely that he was simplifying a more complex healing spell. 

Considering how the series also treats skelegrow as something everyone takes at least once in a lifetime, I'm going to guess that either the actual spell isn't used very often, or that it's incantation is complex and long enough that fuck ups (even with professionals) are common. 

Anyway, that example aside, we have other instances of complex magic requiring longer incantations and wand work, as most of the big spells dumbledore and voldemort use against each other require almost constant concentration and wandwork to succesfully cast, and fiendfyre seems to require a similarly extreme amount of wandwork and incantation to avoid the caster being killed by it themselves. 

In comparison, Crucio, Avada Kedavra, and Imperio are extremely simple, point and shoot spells, which require minimal wandwork or incantation to successfully use.  This is likely because (while devastating) the desired effect resulting from this spell are fairly simple.

 As a result it is much, MUCH harder to restrict the knowledge of how to cast these spells than it would be for something more complex, that could have the same desired result.  

While we don't have many examples of spells similar to Crucio and Imperio both in use and scale, there are several examples in the books of curses extremely similar to Avada Kedavra; at least in that their intended use is explicitly to kill the target rather than inconveniencing or wounding them.  I'm of course talking about the curses cast on the Opal Necklace, the Gaunt Ring, and the Blood Bourne Curse.  The thing these curses have in common (aside from the Opal and Ring curses possibly being the same spell) is that they do more than simply killing their targets, and that their effects last long after their initial casting.   

These spells are apparently rare enough that out of the three, the Blood Bourne curse is the only one that can easily be Identified, which is likely due to that it's effects can be seen in the family of the first victim generations after it was cast. The fact that the Blood Bourne Curse isn't identified by it's spell name, like most other, older spells are in the books is also interesting. This is likely due to the fact that the details of casting these curses are so tightly guarded that the incantations for the spell have been lost, and no one who is willing to inflict pain on someone like this is willing to half ass a dangerous spell and have it explode in their faces or be completely useless.

In fact, the only person who has been shown to cast one of these curses in living memory is Voldemort, who only uses said curse once, is also notable, given his desired to flaunt both his skill and superiority; and what better way to do that than use a spell so forbidden it hasn't been used in living memory (even if you never use it again because of it's difficulty) .

 While you could argue that one of the death eaters (possibly even Malfoy) also used the spell on the Opal, the fact that it makes an appearance in an earlier book in the same shop where it was purchased with a warning label featuring a death count, that is highly unlikely.

**TLDR: The unforgivable curses are easy to cast and widely known, which is the real reason they are considered to be so dangerous in comparison to other curses. 
There are other curses that are illegal, but that aren't mentioned or talked about in the books because the spellwork required to cast them is so complex, that eliminating their use is as simple as keeping instructional material on them under lock and key, and killing/silencing those who have preformed them successfully**

Edit: Holy shit thanks for the gold!I just rewatched this movie for the first time in ~5 years last night with a group of my co-workers, and we realized something that seems so obvious in retrospect but that none of us had noticed before now. 

When Kari is on the phone with Helen, she mentions that she's going to play Mozart for Jack-Jack since it is supposedly "scientifically proven" to aid in neurological development. Up to this point, Bob and Helen are completely convinced that Jack-Jack has no powers - it's likely that Violet and Dash had already developed their powers by the time they were Jack-Jack's age, and so they considered that proof that their third child was "normal."

However, Jack-Jack very clearly has powers in the final fight scene of the movie, since he uses them to brutally manslaughter the movie's antagonist. So, where did these powers come from, and why didn't Bob and Helen know about them?

The answer is very simple, and appears in the animated short "Jack-Jack Attacks." 

Shortly after Kari hangs up the phone on Helen (or rather, Helen is too busy dodging missiles to carry on the conversation), she takes Jack-Jack out of his high-chair, sets him on the floor and turns on a Mozart cassette. As soon as the music starts, **Jack-Jack's eyes dilate and unfocus, and he immediately begins floating through walls, sitting on the ceiling and bursting into flames.**

**Tl;dr -** When Kari said that Mozard stimulates development in children, she didn't know how right she really was.Thanos ended his short battle with Cap with a punch to the back of the head. Many wondered how Cap recovered in mere seconds from a punch that even took out the Hulk and the most logical explanation is that he didn’t. As Thanos used the time stone to bring Vision back, the surroundings also reverted: Natasha was no longer trapped under pillars of stone, Bruce was no longer fused to a rock, and Cap showed no signs of injuries from a blow that should’ve easily killed him.Playing through the Arkham games, all the vents are big enough to fit Batman. Being rich Bruce Wayne must have secretly taken control of Gotham's HVAC company to ensure all vent systems are big enough to fit him when he's stealthily taking down thugs as Batman.Think about it, a bullet won't hurt Clark, what are the odds that a needle will? And if a nurse or doctor starts trying to give a baby or kid shots, and every single needle bends, they're gonna have some questions.

Therefore, to keep his identity secret as a child, Supes' parents would have to pretend to be against vaccinations.In Django, one of our heros Christopher Walt'z' Dr. King Schultz at one point was a Dentist-which seems like a strange offbeat choice to have a character have that as an occupation at first. 
Dig a little deeper and start looking at the naming conventions of the film.

You have Dr. King Schultz, a third party outsider who's current job is to thwart the evils at hand and the spreading issue of racism and slavery running rampant throughout the south.

Fine- he used to be a Dentist- whatever- this is Tarantino right? He's wrought with quirky decision making. 

But then take a look at who he's first hunting; The Brittle Brothers. Aside from a few things, the only thing that comes to mind when I hear the word Brittle is sweet sugary Brittle Candy- as in Peanut Brittle and Caramel brittle, all syrup cooked to sweet perfection. He finds and eradicates them with the help of freed slave Django, only to name his next target; Calvin Candie- owner of "Candie Land"
In short- the south is an invented cavity laden cesspool. The infection of slavery is growing and Dr. King Schultz is the living remedy. 

Not to mention to one look at Calvin Candie and you see-maybe more than anyone-is in need of a Dentist. He sucks down Coconut juice- pure, cavities causing straight cane sugar. So in context you see,
He **IS** the cavity and Dr. Schultz is there to to eradicate him.

Tarantino uses the so-good but-so-bad for you analogy of  candy as the infected spreading epidemic of slavery and racism in the south to highlight it's need to be stopped.

Thanos wants the Infinity Stones and he knew that Odin and his kids are the greatest threat against his plans. He was biding his time, looking for an opportune moment to strike in order to make sure they wouldn't get in his way.

He possibly had the Mind Stone for a long while, and planned ahead on how to get the others with minimal room for error. He knew the Tesseract was on Earth after the events of Captain America: FA. But he knew that Midgard is watched over by Asgard, so he risked the wrath of Odin at His full power if he made any assault on Earth directly.

He must have been keeping tabs on how the Asgardian royal family was doing, looking for weaknesses he could capitalise on. So Thanos used the Asgardians themselves in order to make an attempt at getting the Tesseract/Space Stone. He used Loki, knowing that neither Odin nor Thor would have the heart to kill him. But it didn't go so smoothly, because the Avengers managed to subdue Loki and then take the Space Stone back to Asgard instead of letting Loki take it to Thanos.

But the sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki was enough to upset Odin though. He lost Frigga and a lot of power, requiring to go into Odinsleep. He could no longer be around to hold back Hela from whatever dimension she had been banished to. And so that wrapped things up for the Asgardians, as their family problems destroyed Asgard, leaving only Thor capable of potentially being able to face Thanos, but not in the beleaguered and demoralised state he was left in, especially after Thanos killed Loki.

Thanos didn't expect Thor to recover quite as quickly as he did, meeting the Guardians by chance, and return to Earth armed with Srormbreaker, in time to stop Thanos for good. ...if only he hadn't gone soft and had aimed for the head.This assumes that all the accents in the movie imitate the voices the Grandfather would be using in the story, hence why Inigio Montoya has such a horrible Spanish accent, the Impressive Clergyman has such an exaggerated speech impediment and Miracle Max uses a Jewish accent. For the character of the Albino he tried to use a raspy, stereotypical villainous henchmen voice but found it too difficult and switched it to the vaguely cockney accent he uses during the rest of the film. The cough that the Albino makes was not in the story, but was  a result of the Grandfather's voice hurting. It was interpreted by the boy as being part of the story, which is why we see it on screen.There were some speculations that RDJ will have a brief cameo in the Black Widow movie. So there's a little chance that it'll be a post credit scene in which he meets her after the snap, i'm saying this because there was a deleted scene in End Game where tony meets her daughter Morgan in the soul world. After watching that scene a lot people thought that Tony should have met Natasha just like Thanos met Gamora after he snapped his fingers because Natasha is the one who died for the soul stone. So maybe it happens in the movie Black widow and it could also be a kind of farewell to her.

**Nat :** *What did it cost.*

**Tony:** *You.*Jedi follow a strict code of no attachments, no possessions, no anger towards others, no marriage or romantic or familial ties. Due to Anakin blatantly reproducing in spite of the code, his offspring led to the most powerful force Bloodline I dare say we've ever seen with Luke going toe to toe with two sith lords with little training, and Kylo Ren being a badass that scared the shit out of Luke in the first place. This is the very reason the Jedi forbids familial relationships.

Also, it's entirely likely that Anakin was born of another Jedi, and knowing this code forbid his mother to tell anyone of his true origins even himself, since he is also innately powerful and I don't buy him being force Jesus.The trio of Ben, Chris, and Ron get food poisoning from eating mini calzones but Tom does not as he avoids them.

It's shown the entire town of Pawnee hates calzones. They do a lot of things backwards, and have a lot of weird traditions, one of them being the collective hatred of calzones.

It's obvious not many establishments make calzones in the town. Knowing how badly Pawnee hates them, they obviously messed up didn't make the mini ones right. Nobody orders them, so why would they know how to make them right? Well... What if nobody orders them because they don't know how to make them right?

One of the weird traditions of the town is poor hygiene. Well, really it's being an idiot, but that leads to poor hygiene and food safety practices. Mouths directly on the water fountain is a good example. Inability to know how to brush their teeth, another one. A lot of food in the town is made deep fried or baked or cooked hot breakfast, which would likely kill most food borne germs.

A calzone, however requires 30 min to bake in the oven. A pizza roughly half that or less. It's not far fetched to think the town of Pawnee thinks "it's just an inside out pizza" and tries to make it literally the same way they would a pizza and cooks it half way at a high temp, making the outside perfect but an undercooked filling. Which of course leaves the insides unsafe to consume.

Most people have an aversion to calzones because of this. Ben, not being part of the town originally, does not understand why they hate it so much. It's collective food poisoningYeah we all know that was the lamest dialogue ever, and Anakin is the worst jedi ever, and the prequels were the worst letdown ever, but I have a theory that might make things a little better.

Lets operate with the assumption that Anakin missed out on a lot more than just meditation being too old to train f9r the jedi ways. He's not only arrogant, he's inexperienced and he doesn't quite grasp the jedi training. Maybe, though, it's not all his fault. What if it's because of... Tatooine? 

The force is a mysterious power. As best said by our dear friend Ben, 

*Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.*

Created by all living things is the key here. A living energy field that can be manipulate at will. What's one thing that Tatooine is particularly devoid of? **Life**.  It's dry, it's arid, there are two suns that give so much heat and radiation. It's a wasteland. Life is hard and tough. The people make a living by farming moisture to live. Not water, not underground running liquid water, but condensation and moisture. There are no plants that grow fruitful on Tatooine. 

The reason why Luke was hidden on Tatooine is because the force is very weak on this planet. Compared to dagobah, where Yoda resigned himself to meditation, a planet teaming with life and overflowing with the force... So much so that caves exist that will overpower you with the force itself. Yoda cannot be found on dagobah because he's clouded by the force. Luke cannot be found on Tatooine because there's not much force for him to interact with. 

It also describes why Qui Gon was so intrigued by Anakin's midiclorian count, and why he had to rely on a primitive midiclorian reader instead of the force itself to get an estimate of Anakins potential. It's why Watto can't be force persuaded as easily, the force is easier to resist on those born and raised on Tatooine. It still is present, because life does exist, but it's not nearly as strong. A force user would have extreme difficulty picking up on the aura of another, especially one untrained, with little access to the force on such a barren planet.

Consequently, Anakin does not dislike sand. He dislikes the planet because it has and always has disrupted his force sensitivity. He feels the coarseness of the arid, lifeless planet and how little reach he has with the force. His famous line ends with him saying the planet he is now on is soft and smooth-thats Naboo, a extremely populated planet teaming with life under and above water. Of course he feels the reach of his power here, so much more so than on Tatooine. It might explain why he's so arrogant,  having been on a planet with so little, now being exposed to life all around and being flooded by the energy from it. 

After watching Infinity War multiple times, the point where Thanos recognizes Tony Stark is one of my favorite parts. When asked, Thanos says he does know Tony because he's also cursed with knowledge.

A lot of people have pointed to Tony foiling Thanos's plans in New York in the first Avengers as the reason why Thanos knows Stark. This is a pretty easy theory and maybe partially true. It's even brought up a few times in the movie. Banner refers to Thanos as the guy that did New York. Tony references how Thanos has been in his head for years via PTSD.

But to be honest I don't like this theory and doesn't really make sense. Thanos has been known to send other people to do his dirty work and they fail him. Loki is one of them and while Tony played the largest part, it was the Avengers that took down Loki, yet he doesn't recognize anyone else. Even if he does...say Thor (Which we don't know if he did recognize him), he doesn't show the same respect that he shows to Tony.

Likewise, the Guardians of the Galaxy foiled Thanos's plan in their first movie. Ronan went rogue and the stone ended up being put into "safe" hands. Thanos needed to destroy Zandar instead of having the stone delivered to him. Yet when he encounters Quill for the first time...the son of a celestial who held on to the power stone briefly...he is referred to as The Boyfriend. It's not until after he sees Quill was willing to keep his promise and kill Gamora that Thanos shows any type of respect. And even at that, all Thanos says is "I like you".

So being super powerful and disrupting the plans of Thanos isn't enough to get name recognition and it definitely doesn't give you his respect. So then what does this exchange mean?

I'm not sure exactly how Thanos went about knowing who Stark was and I'm sure NY put him on the map. But for some reason, he was put on the map above others like Quill who Thanos also must have heard of but dismissed him or didn't look further into him.

I think this hails back to the first Iron Man movie. There's a point where Obediah is talking to Stark Industry scientists and he's asking them to build the arc reactor the same size Tony has for his Ironman suit. The scientist says it's not possible. Obediah says something along the lines of "You don't have to invent anything...the plans and technology are here, I just need it smaller"

The scientist insists it can't be done. Obediah then responds with "Tony Stark did this in a cave with a box of scraps."

And the line that means so much "Well I'm not Tony Stark".

If you think about this scenario and the impact it has...this exchange is to show with maximum impact how unique Tony truly is. Some of the smartest scientists with the best technology and unlimited resources can't accomplish what Tony did in a cave with a box of scraps and there's a suggestion no one else could have.

In Thanos's world, there are powerful beings everywhere. He's come up against them. He's beaten them. He's traveled the galaxy murdering and defeating those who wanted to stop him. But Tony is different. It's possible that out of everyone in the Universe, Thanos recognized Tony as unique. And after New York, He saw that Tony was willing to use his power, his obsessions, and intellect to save what is most important to him at any cost. And no matter what...Tony will be able to manufacture his way of winning.

This sounds similar to Thanos. Thanos says "This day extracts a heavy toll". He knew there would be sacrifices. He says he's the only one that knows and the only one with a strong enough will to do what needs to be done. Thanos and Tony are two sides of the same coin. They have a power...and they have a drive....and they will not stop even if it means heavy personal sacrifice. They are also both self-aware of this. Tony knew from the second he stepped on that ship it would be a suicide mission. He was prepared for that. This self-awareness and acceptance of their power vs. willingness to sacrifice for a goal is the curse of knowledge the two share.

I think this is also why Strange needed Tony alive. Out of the millions of outcomes, he saw...they lost every one of them Tony wasn't in. From that quote, I mentioned from Ironman 1...Tony is uniquely powerful in the galaxy. The culmination of his intellect, drive, and morality creates a sum greater than the parts. Thanos recognizes this. It's what makes the scene one of the best scenes in the movie for me. Thanos has traveled the galaxy fighting countless powerful people....but it's this single human out of trillions that he recognizes and respects.

Finally, this is why I don't think in Endgame Tony will be rescued by Pepper or by Captain Marvel as many suggest. That monologue he has in the first Endgame trailer seems particularly un Tony like. It was reminiscent to me of him in the cave...and Tony isn't someone who just sits back and let's failure take him. He will engineer his way out. The very thing that made Thanos recognize him and respect him will get him out of that situation. Which is why in the second Endgame trailer...I think you see him working on something with Nebula. It would be such a great mirror of the first movie...to get out of deep space with no food, no oxygen, and no hope, with nothing but a box of scraps....They think he’s Anakin from AOTC. 

It used to be canon in a Star Wars novel that Anakin slaughtering the village of Tuskin Raiders turned him into a Sand People legend & they went as far as doing commemorative dance to the sounds of a lightsaber to appease him.

Obi-Wan flashing a lightsaber at them sometime before he meets Luke for the first time (with the exact same color and hilt as the one that killed their people) would be enough for them to quickly run away and not fuck with him. 

The noise he makes when he arrives is theater to fit with their legend of him being an evil spirit/horrible beast. Some people seem to think that Captain could only nudge the hammer during Age of Ultron. I propose that he started to lift it, felt it begin to buckle which gave him that shocked face and pause as he looked towards Thor, and released it.

It is established that you can't move the hammer at all until you are worthy and lets face it, Cap is morally fit even moreso than Pre-Ragnorok Thor to wield the hammer. He is also the type of guy to fake being inadequate to lift the hammer just to save face among his friends; Cap's pride isn't worth enough to embarrass a fellow avenger.

Iunno; my two cents theory. Thoughts?I've always wondered why aliens invade Earth in T.V and Movies. We've sent out information that detail our planet, surely they'd know that were very strategic and powerful right? Then I got to thinking, if they do know everything about us they'd also know that a white flag is surrender. Then it hit me, sometime ago I remember reading about how because of the solar radiation from the sun, the flag we planted on the moon has turned white. They're not invading as a form of attack, they're invading because they think we've surrendered to them.

Edit: there is the moonIn the movie Home Alone, when Kate McCallister was in Scranton, PA she told the airline attendant that she would sell her soul to the Devil Himself in order to get to her son. Not even a second later, Gus Polinski showed up to convince her to take a ride with him and his Polka crew. Gus in this case is the Devil Himself and because he brought her back to her son, she now owes the Devil her soul and will now spend all of eternity in Hell.At the beginning of the movie, Forrest talks to a black waitress about his upbringing and how he was named after the KKK founder who had made mistakes, about his hard times and the issue of segregation during his formative years. He also is able to relate to her based on her hard day and her feet hurting and how his life has been about shoes.

After her, an older woman continues to listen, who would be just a little older than Jenny is now. They talk about Forrest in Jenny's college dorm room, and when he "saves" her from the strip club. He talks to her about love and his feelings for a woman from his childhood.

Next, (we don't know when), an older man (right age for serving in Vietnam),  listens to Forrest's story about war and combat, about losing his best friend, and coming back to become a millionaire. This old man would be someone who can understand Forrest's time during the war.

Finally, he talks to a woman that would be his mom's age about his hard times when his mom dies and coming back to be with her, before the woman, who is in tears at this point, listens to the rest of his story about reflecting on his life and the decisions he had made. 

Whether intentional or not, Forrest Gump relates to his audience and tells them a story they'll really understand.There’s a joke that has been circulating for a while now about Breaking Bad being a prequel to Malcolm in the Middle, the theory being that Walt goes into witness protection and ends up as Hal. However, I think a better explanation is that Breaking Bad is actually a sequel to Malcolm in the Middle.

Before I go on, I do know that it wasn't meant to be taken as a serious theory but the comparison is helpful I think.

Firstly there is many flaws with the original theory. The timeline is backwards. There is no explanation for extended family members/childhood friends who appear in Malcolm in the Middle. Hal and Walt are nothing alike, in fact they are polar opposites personality wise.

The first two points are very obviously covered by setting Breaking Bad as a sequel, the timelines are plainly in a more logical order.

To address the other point I would argue that Walt is not Hal but an older Malcolm. This just makes far more sense; Malcolm is a genius with plenty of chemistry experience - he even uses a chemistry set to make a small explosion in one episode. 

Comparing the two characters personalities you see that they are both incredibly intelligent, stubborn and manipulative. They can both be violent and selfish but have some small supply of morality deep down. Malcolm often displays the ability to devise intricate plans that made Walt so successful. Also there is a small reference early on in Breaking Bad to Walt not caring too much for his mother which fits nicely.

Finally we know that Malcolm will probably look quite similar to his father when he’s older.

The only inconsistency is in the name, this is where some wild fantasizing has to be done. The obvious answer is that Malcolm changed his name at some point I can’t really offer anything solid beyond that.  

It is interesting to note that Hal’s father in Malcolm in the Middle is named Walter, in the episode “Family Reunion” it is shown that he is an avid history buff and he seems to be one of the few family members who openly appreciates Malcolms intelligence. It’s not too far fetched to guess that Walter is Malcolm’s middle name, this is a common custom is some families, and maybe Malcolm starts to go by this name as a tribute to his grandfather.

The surname is more complicated, Malcolm’s being Wilkerson, he would have to undergo a proper name change to become Walter White. However, if I’m permitted to wildly venture into wishful thinking territory I’d point out that the families name is never actually spoken in Malcolm in the Middle.  We only see it on a name tag.  The writer’s had intended to keep it a secret and they  make two jokes about this in the finale - there is feedback when Malcolm’s name is announced and Francis’ name tag says Francis Nolastname. So just to make things nice and neat for myself I like to think that Malcolm’s surname was always White and that name tag in the pilot was because Francis stole some other cadet’s uniform.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that Walt/Malcolm settling on teaching after things going south with Grey Matter is somewhat similar to what happened to the Krelboyne's teacher, Mr Herkabe. Maybe he was somewhat influenced by him or maybe his meth empire obsession had something to do with him realising that he was turning out like Herkabe.This theory pieces together some of the very few things that we know about Rosa: 

1) She's highly secretive, to the point that even her closest friends know very little about her.

2) She trained and competed as a ballerina and gymnast in her youth, probably traveling frequently

3) She's incredibly fit, highly advanced in hand-to-hand combat, a skilled driver and pilot, and proficient with the use of several different weapons.

4) She moves apartments regularly and always in secret.

5) She maintains several different identities, even once claiming that "Rosa Diaz" is not her real name.

6) She has a bug-out plan in place if she ever needs to escape the city/state/country.

EDIT: CIA does not deploy within the US, so I'm settling on former CIA. Thanks, u/NoAttentionAtWrk
TL;DR: A Near-perfect comparison can be made between the Gideon in the Hebrew Bible and Moff Gideon in the Mandalorian. This comparison could hint at Moff Gideon’s motivations and role as a secret Inquisitor before the empire’s fall.

The Idea:

Moff Gideon’s identity is shrouded in mystery. He blasts into the scene with no introduction, and we have a ton of questions and no answers, but I think we might be able to find answers to Moff Gideon’s secrets in the most unlikely place. The Hebrew Bible

For those who didn’t grow up with dreidel, let me explain. The Hebrew bible is the Jewish books of the  Bible containing the stories of Noah, David, Moses, and yes …. A dude named Gideon.

So how does this connect to The Mandalorian? If you didn't know George Lucas based many star wars on the bible and the stories within, it would make sense for Jon Favreau, who grew up Jewish and Catholic, to continue the tradition.

Gideon in the bible is a judge, and brilliant military leader, His claim to fame is defeating and tearing down the idols of the enemies of the Israelites.


Which fits perfectly with …..


Moff Gideon in the Mandalorian is a brilliant military general, a Moff in fact, and here’s where we get to the fun part; Gideon of the bible is a judge, Like a sword-wielding old school hero judge. Another name for a judge is an Inquisitor, so could our Darksaber wielding Moff could have been trained to hunt Jedi and force anomalies by the Sith. Next is the Gideon of the bible made his name destroying his enemies’ idols, specifically their idols or representations of their gods. Moff may be after powerful anomalies in the force to wipe out the force users that could rise up. He’s after the special ones, the off the charts ones.


To sum it up… Moff Gideon is an inquisitor trained by the Sith to eradicate or obtain the Jedi’s Powerful force users to eliminate threats to the sith and the new empire from being destroyed by a powerful force user again.



Edit: changed Torah to hebrew bible for accuracy. Though Gideon is featured in the oral torah, the hebrew bible is more accurate .The story of Cats is an elaborate and terrible metaphor for the seven deadly sins, where these cats have died and are living in a purgatory awaiting their chance to ascend. Each of the characters fill a role in this, which will be made clear during the write-up. I should note, I have not actually seen the musical, but I did see the movie while drunk, so this write-up will be coming from my memory of a drunk night one month ago with a little help of Google. The scope of this theory is for the movie only, and I am open to people providing better fitting analogies for each of the sins as I am by no means a Cats expert. I would have liked to include gifs of the physical portrayals of each sin, but videos from the movie aren’t on YouTube yet.

Each of the characters in Cats fills in for one of the seven deadly sins or as a character in the battle between heaven and hell. All the cats in purgatory wish to ascend to heaven by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy, but each portrays at least one of the seven deadly sins. To be chosen is to leave purgatory and go to heaven is to be a Jellicle cat. The guidance for being a Jellicle cat is given in the book of Deuteronomy, which I will provide below.

# Sloth

The role of sloth is filled by Jennanydots (Rebel Wilson). She is a lazy cat who sits at home all day, lazing about and in terrible shape. In her song, there are references to her working on reforming mice and cockroaches, but we see physically her slothfulness throughout her song. Additionally, the implication during the song is not her hard work, but instead it’s her forcing the mice and cockroaches to work for her, entertain her, and feed her, rather than her working hard for anyone else’s betterment.

The song is presented as a duet, with the chorus being sung about her, while she sings a refrain which defends herself. In her refrain is when there is any mention of hard work, while in the sections of song sung about her, all references are to her slothfulness.

From the song section sung about her:

>*All day she sits upon the stair or on the step or on the mat*  
>  
>*She sits and sits and sits and sits*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*All day she sits beside the hearth or on the bed or on my hat*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*She sits upon the windowsill or anything that's smooth and flat*

&#x200B;

# Pride

The role of pride is filled by Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo). It is apparently obvious from the first few moments with Rum Tum Tugger he is extremely vain. Throughout his appearance he is constantly enjoying and encouraging the fawning reactions from other cats, dressing fashionably, checking himself out in the mirror, and *milk*ing his own song. He even names his bar after himself. There are no specific lines in his song which point to pride, but a holistic view of the lyrics show someone who expects others to cater to their whims and serve them, while the behaviors of Rum Tum Tugger portray an obvious portrait of a prideful cat.

# Gluttony

The role of gluttony is filled by Bustopher Jones (James Corden). The crude fat Tuxedo cat makes an obvious candidate for gluttony, as in most of his shots on camera he seems to be eating or trying to eat something and is very obviously overweight.

From the songs:

>*Bustopher Jones is not skin and bones*  
>  
>*In fact, he's remarkably fat*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*In the season of venison I give my ben'son*  
>  
>*To the Pothunter's succulent bones*  
>  
>*And just before noon's not a moment too soon*  
>  
>*To drop in for a drink at the Drones*  
>  
>*When I'm seen in a hurry there's probably curry*  
>  
>*At the Siamese or at the Glutton*  
>  
>*If I look full of gloom then I've lunched at the Tomb*  
>  
>*On cabbage, rice pudding and mutton*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*It can be no surprise that under our eyes*  
>  
>*He has grown unmistakably round*  
>  
>*He's a twenty-five pounder, or I am a bounder*  
>  
>*And he's putting on weight everyday*

&#x200B;

# Wrath

The role of Wrath is held by a side character who has no songs in the movie: Growltiger (Ray Winstone). Growltiger is the henchman cat holding all the cats hostage on his boat before trying to kill Old Deuteronomy. The other cats end up escaping and he tries to fight them but is captured and forced to walk the plank. His only role in the film is to hold hostages for Macavity, try to kill someone, and to get into a fight. He does this without any purpose other than working with Macavity despite having no seen benefit from the exchange and seems to relish in the job.

# Greed

The role of greed is filled jointly by Mungojerrie (Danny Collins) and Rumpleteazer (Naoimh Morgan). This duo takes Victoria (Francesca Hayward) in after finding her all alone after Bustopher Jones is kidnapped. Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer try to corrupt Victoria. The pair are cat burglars who break in and steal from homes with no care for who it belongs to.

From the songs:

>*If the area window is found ajar,*  
>  
>*And the basement looks like a field of war,*  
>  
>*If a tile or two comes loose on the roof,*  
>  
>*Which presently fails to be waterproof,*  
>  
>*If the drawers are pulled out from the bedroom chests,*  
>  
>*And you can't find one of your winter vests,*  
>  
>*Or if after supper one of the girls*  
>  
>*Suddenly misses her Woolworth pearls…*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*We are highly efficient cat-burglars as well, and remarkably smart at the smash-and-grab.*  
>  
>*We make our home in Victoria Grove. We have no regular occupation.*

Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer are certainly guilty of the sin of greed and cannot be chosen as Jellicle cats.

# Lust

The role of lust is filled by Bombalurina (Taylor Swift). During the movie, she is seen with extreme interest in Rum Tum Tugger, who ultimately rejects her for only liking what he finds for himself. Unfortunately, most of her song is about Macavity and doesn’t provide as much evidence to her specific sin. In viewing the movie, like most of the cats in the movie, she acts in a weirdly seductive way. In addition, Bombalurina fuels what appears to be a drug-fueled writhing orgy with catnip during her song. This role is definitely harder to place, but from the theatrical release, the role fits best with Bombalurina.

# Envy

The role of envy is filled by Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson). Grizabella was once a popular and coveted cat who is now banished, ragged, dirty, and seen watching the group from afar wishing to belong again. She is envious of the friendly cat group and wants what they have. She is also envious of her past of being beautiful, and in the end, she is envious of the happiness she once had. During the course of the movie, with the help of Victoria, she overcomes her sin of Envy and accepts who she is and is accepted once more. Having repented for her past sin of envy, she is the one who is ultimately accepted to leave purgatory. Filling her role once she leaves comes Victoria, who sings “All that I wanted was to be wanted” and wishing to have beautiful and happy memories.

From the songs:

>*Memory, all alone in the moonlight*  
>  
>*I can smile at the old days*  
>  
>*I was beautiful then*  
>  
>*I remember the time I knew what happiness was*  
>  
>*Let the memory live again*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*Touch me, it's so easy to leave me*  
>  
>*All alone with the memory*  
>  
>*Of my days in the sun*

&#x200B;

# The Others

Every one of the other cats either portrays some sin, generally envy or pride, but two of them stand out from the others and bear mentioning: Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) and Macavity (Idris Elba).

* *Old Deuteronomy:*

Old Deuteronomy is an obvious metaphor for a St. Peter-esque figure who stands before the pearly gates to heaven and passes judgment on the collected cats on who has repented for their sins and may go to heaven. I only want to add that the name Old Deuteronomy was chosen as a reference to the book of Deuteronomy from the Old Testament, specifically in reference to the repentance needed to overcome sins and get into heaven. The following lines appear in Deuteronomy 2 – 4:

>*… and obey his voice in all that I command you today, with all your heart and with all your soul,  then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have mercy on you, and he will gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you. If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will take you.*

These instructions are what is needed to be accepted as the “Jellicle” cat, provided up front.

* *Macavity:*

Macavity is analogous to Lucifer. Throughout the film, he is lurking in the darkness, shows magical powers only seen otherwise by Mephistopheles, and is shown as through-and-through evil. His whole goal is to get to heaven for himself and does so only through wicked deeds. His goal is to get to heaven through trickery and evil and is rebuffed by Old Deuteronomy.

In the song Macavity the Mystery Cat, sung by Bombalurina, Macavity is referenced as the cause of many evil deeds, but he is never seen there. This is not in reference to how skillful he is, but rather Macavity is the source of evil in cat’s hearts and is the ultimate cause behind these acts committed by others. While he is the cause, he is never present because he is Satan, guiding the cats to evil action. The song even references the visualization of Macavity as a snake, just like the Bible.

From the song:

>*Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity*  
>  
>*He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity*  
>  
>*His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare*  
>  
>*But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake*  
>  
>*And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake*  
>  
>*…*  
>  
>*Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity*  
>  
>*For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity*  
>  
>*You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square*  
>  
>*But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there*

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

This movie was terrible. Why did I spend some of my life writing this?So Maggie has been around a lot of loud noises in her life. Most notably she had a handgun fired whilst on her lap in “Who Shot Mr Burns”. And another episode shows her shooting Fat Tony’s gang with a rifle so it’s reasonable to assume she has some form of hearing damage. Not saying she’s completely deaf just has a significant amount of ear damage.

In most episodes where it goes into the future, maggie either doesn’t show up or is there but doesn’t say anything. Either by being interrupted or just staying silent herself. 

Im mainly referring to the episode “holidays of future passed” where maggie is a globetrotting singer. Having guns go off around her at a young age and then becoming a rock star later in life has effected her. She doesn’t speak to anyone and the few times she’s about to speak there’s always a few seconds before she opens her mouth as if she’s trying to process what was just said.Big businesses are the most evil  thing on earth since minions are helping to promote their products.

Their PR teams didn't think this outNow maybe this is completely obvious, but it just dawned on me out of nowhere (seriously, why was I thinking about Mr. Belding all of a sudden?).  

Zack and his friends were constantly getting into trouble and they were seriously heading towards juvenile delinquency time and again.  They dealt with all sorts of issues in their angsty high school years; drugs, bullies, divorcing parents, eating disorders, you name it..   But who was always there to intervene and save them (even though those little shits never appreciated it)?  Mr. Belding.

I don't know how I never saw it before, but it is so obvious now.  Mr. Belding was the Bell that saved them just in time, every time. 

It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell (ding)I searched for what a rubber duck is for because I had no idea.  Pretty much they are just a toy that makes bathtime fun.

But programmers use rubber ducks as part of their process.  They explain the problem to the rubber duck, and usually the solution to the problem comes to them.

Arthur Weasley is asking Harry about the rubber duck to see how widespread that knowledge is.

Edit: After hearing other people's thoughts, I'm downgrading this to "maybe Arthur is messing with Harry because he knows that rubber ducks are one of those things that exists for no good reason."In the beginning of the movie, I always wondered why Muntz was accused of fabricating the bird's skeleton and lost his reputation. The bird was real and Muntz was shown as a famous explorer who built high tech blimp and brought back numerous specimens from his adventures (The narration said "What has Muntz brought back this time?", meaning he had gone on adventures before).

I have a theory that this is because **Muntz had lied multiple times in the past and this was the straw that broke the camel's back.** 

When Carl boarded the Spirit of Adventure, he is delighted to see all kinds of fossils Muntz had collected from his adventure. First one Muntz talks about is the Arsinoitherium. Muntz's exact words on the animal were "Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring it down." 

Arsinoitherium is a creature that went extinct about 30 million years ago. Of course, one could argue that Muntz had become famous because he discovered an animal that was thought to have gone extinct long time ago. But what he said about bringing it down with a shaving kit is what makes Mutnz's story questionable. Arisnoitherium was about as big as a modern day rhinoceros. There is no way a person could bring down a creature that big with razor blades.

Then later, Muntz talks about how he brought down a Giant Somali Leopard Tortoise while he was on Safari with Roosevelt. He's probably talking about either Theodore or Franklin because if he was mentioning a relatively "lesser known" Roosevelt like Theodore Roosevelt Jr, he probably would have mentioned their first name. The Roosevelt Muntz was referring to probably wasn't Franklin Roosevelt because Franklin had suffered from Polio and had to move in wheelchairs. Theodore Roosevelt on the other hand had gone on multiple hunting trips in Africa. So Muntz must have gone on a safari trip with Theodore Roosevelt.

But Theodore Roosevelt died in 1919. The director of Up said that Muntz was 23 in the beginning of the film and 92 years old in present day. If we assume this movie was set in 2009 (the year it was released) that would mean Muntz was born around 1917-1918. I seriously doubt that Muntz went on a hunting trip with the former president of USA when he was a toddler.

**TL;DR Muntz from Up lost his reputation because he lied multiple times about his adventures and scientist had enough and said "That's enough. No more BS from you."**Now, hear me out on this. The original Mario 1 game had a backstory to it that was printed in the [instruction book](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/smbinstruction.jpg).

Sounds familiar no? Evil King of a tribe famous for their black magic, invading a peaceful kingdom kidnapping the princess with the powers to stop him. And a courageous hero that must stop him. Sounds a lot like Ganon, Zelda, and Link no? Well, not completely, but we'll get to that shortly. So onto the main theory. 

After an uncountable number of years down the line (in the wind waker timeline) and several more close apocalypse events like the great flooding that caused wind waker to happen Hylians eventually evolved to become the Toadstools. Gorons became the Kongs. Zora became the dolphins, horses became yoshis and so on. The reason the world is in this state is because in order to prevent the world from being destroyed shattered the triforce and sacrificed the master sword to create what we now call the Power Stars. The place that this happens in is later renamed to Star Hill. A place where wishes gather and become stars. Because of this the world was filled with magic unlike what was seen previously in the world. Plants grew that could harness the power of Dins Fire. Magical Capes that allowed the user to harness the wind for protection and movement. Magical stars that give the user power to push back the waves of evil gripping the land.

Now generations down the line we come to Bowser, the latest reincarnation of Ganon ages past when his name has long since been forgotten. He uses his black magic to take over the land of the Mushroom kingdom and lock away the one person with the power to undo all his plans, Princess Peach. Who is of course the latest in the long line of Zelda reincarnations. Her power to undo the magic of the Koopas stem from her powers from when she was still the goddess Hylia. So, now we come to our hero of the story (maybe). Mario. At first glance you would think that Mario is the latest reincarnation of Link. But I dont believe that to be the case. In fact, its more likely that he is the latest reincarnation of Toon Link from Wind Waker. You see, Mario is not the one chosen by the triforce of courage. Sure he is courageous, but he is far from the most courageous in the series. No, instead he is just a normal man that took up the mantle of the hero because he could not stand by and let evil take over. Just like toon link isnt a reincarnation of the original link but instead a normal person who stepped because he could not just stand by and let evil take over. No instead our true reincarnation of Link is instead Luigi. He shows true courage, standing up to evil even in the face of utter fear. Any time Mario is in danger, Luigi steps up and saves him.

However, we have run into a problem. without the master sword, Bowser cannot be defeated for long. Not even death can stop Bowser from regaining his strength. He was sucked into a black hole and the universe restarted and Bowser was still alive. So like this, we have come to a stalemate. Bowser has no access to the triforce as it was destroyed and used to create the power stars. And Mario/Luigi does not have access to the master sword to seal him away again. And so, here we are an untold number of years later and Ganon has become Bowser, Zelda has become Princess Peach, and Link has become Luigi.The Cursed Child contains numerous inconsistencies about many Harry Potter characters, including but not limited to the secret child of Voldemort, the suspicion that Scorpius is said secret child AND that Time Turners are a thing again. For the sake of argument, let's just say that this is fiction within the Wizarding World, and it's written by Rita Skeeter; the journalist who's very existence thrives on getting things wrong about famous people.



1. It makes no sense for Scorpius to be the suspected son of Voldemort when he was born 8 years after Voldemort's death. 



2. Harry wouldn't have nearly that much of a problem with Albus becoming friends with a Malfoy after he himself is on good terms with Malfoy.



3. Voldemort having a child goes completely against his character. He was the physical embodiment of the Slytherin ideal of self-preservation, and he wasn't able to form anything resembling a relationship. Plus, he was more annoyed with Bellatrix's advances than anything else. Not to mention that he was obsessed with his own immortality to a fault.



4. The time-turners were probably more like a badly kept secret to anyone outside the Department of Mysteries, and the destruction of the Ministry's entire stock probably didn't reach the ears of the general populace. This is evidenced by Hagrid's lack of knowledge about this event in Half Blood Prince. 



5. Cedric Diggory was a good person, and the insinuation that he was a bad loss away from willingly becoming a Death Eater is something you would expect from a tabloid journalist.In the beginning of the movie Stephen cracks a joke and Wong doesn't laugh.  Stephen says "People used to laugh at my jokes." and Wong responds "Did they work for you?"

Flash to the end of the movie and Stephen makes the joke about the warning coming after the spell and Wong has a long laugh at that ending with "That's funny".

Because Wong realizes that he now works for Stephen.  Because Dr Strange is now the Sorcerer Supreme.The John Wick movies are based on a video game. The film has many elements of a video game:  

+ John Wick moves through the movie killing NPCs before encountering an end stage boss who is usually more difficult [Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0LuDSiX63M)| [Link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv70ImW-l3s) | [Link 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-TZCEyok_o) | [Link 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUqJMPAtmdY)  
+ There is minimum dialogue during the action scenes. Dialogue takes place before and after the action scenes like cut scenes in a movie  
+ John Wick is injured regularly as he goes about John Wicking, but when he is, the injury effects are short-lived. It is as if he is picking up health packs along the way. He shouldn't be walking, let alone fighting after getting stabbed, cut, sliced and shot.  
+ Coins are used in the movie in exchange for goods/services *(ok, the idea of currency did not originate in video games but gold coins remind me of Mario and Zelda)*  
+ The background characters mostly seem quite indifferent to the rampant [violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CujcdaQpYWE), like typical [nonchalant NPCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiNzN-tIz4A)    
+ The Continental is the shop / game admin area where John Wick goes to recharge his health, get supplies and save the game. In this place, the game’s action stops per the rules of the Continental but these rules are flouted as John’s awareness of the game around him unravels.  

Future John Wick films will progress the story plot of John Wick realising he is a person controlled character in a video game and him trying to fight/shoot his way out of it to take revenge on the game creator(s) who created his wife and her death.  
I’d love it if at this point, John Wick is revealed to be a conscious being in the matrix like [Neo](https://www.quora.com/In-Matrix-Reloaded-how-does-the-Merovingian-know-of-Neos-predecessors-if-the-architect-tells-Neo-that-no-one-knew-of-his-predecessors?share=1), and the JW universe is one of the many simulations alluded to by the Architect and the Merovingian. John Wick does bear a likeness to Neo and the John Wick universe already has Morpheus/ Bowery King.

_Edit: Thanks for the gold! What's the current exchange rate between reddit gold and a John Wick gold coin?_**Let's start with X-men because this is the hardest to implement within the current MCU**

Mutants existed in the distant past of MCU, Myths, Legends, Gods, you name it. Some were revered as Prophets, some Gods, some just in Legends or Stories. Fewer in number and not as fertile as humans, they eventually died out. Although the X-Gene is ever present in humans up to now, lying dormant. The Eternals movie CAN play a part in this, either show hints of it already in the upcoming movie or retroactively include it in future films.

Starting with Charles Xavier(Professor X). Nothing has changed much with his background, except for the fact that he was born in the 1980s instead. As usual, studies Genetics and many other fields, add to that ancient history and religions. Made his discovery of the X-gene during his college days, a pretty inactive and useless gene but with limitless potential. His paper about it at Age 16(1990s) was eventually used to fuel the E**x**tremis project(as seen in Iron Man 3).

Along the way he met Erik Lehnsherr and became close friends with him. Erik was born in the 1980s as well. In Bosnia and was a Srebrenica genocide survivor(Bosnian War), \[Creating a character from the holocaust isn't applicable now because it was set almost 100 years ago and he would be way too old now.\] **\[pls read the comments, lots of suggested alternative origins for Magneto there!\]**

Because of his discovery of the X-gene, Charles had this idea that the X-gene was previously active in the distant past, leading to stories, legends, myths, religions that we know of today. It somehow got deactivated ages ago and we were stuck with the boring humans that we have today.

&#x200B;

and then The Avengers happen, superhumans became a common thing. He became more engrossed with his idea(that has since become even more plausible) and his research became even more intense. Finding out that higher concentrations of the dormant X-gene correlated to people with almost superhuman abilities(intellect, memory, endurance, perception, agility, strength, even psychic abilities, etc); he started "Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters" with his close friend Erik Lehnsherr circa 2010s. A special school for special children(with high amounts of x-gene) to help them with their gifts, focusing on their respective fields of expertise.

&#x200B;

Circa 2025+ Something will happen that will activate ALOT of the dormant x-genes in humans, especially those with higher concentrations\~meaning every student in Xavier's school will become a "mutant". Unknowingly to Charles and Erik, it never occurred to test themselves as well; they were high concentration x-gene humans as well, and were surprised with their newfound abilities, Telepathy and Magnetism. This is the start of the X-Men. Tension will rise between the two founders that will lead to conflict and their eventual split and rivalry.

* This could easily be 2-3 movies story, and I won't advise to fit this all into one movie. Maybe start a Disney Plus series for all the unimportant but still helpful world building parts.

Wolverine is pretty hard to implement, as much of his story stems from being very old with many experiences(but without memory) and making him a young dude at 2020s would not do him justice. Making him just as old (still born 1880s) and one of the only remaining super rare x-gene active humans would make him too special. You could argue that he is indeed very special, but we'd had to come up for reasons as to why other special super rare mutants did not appear in the MCU films so far. OR DID THEY? (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are indeed mutants, x-gene activated and supplemented by the mind stone. I say supplemented as to not retcon Infinty War's destruction of the Mind Stone using Wanda's powers "same energy signature")

&#x200B;

**Now let's go with the DEFENDERS + Spider-Man.**

So at the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home, Peter Parker is revealed to be Spider-Man and ofcourse, Peter has to come up a way to disprove this claim in order to stay anonymous, or else becomes just this "everybody knows who I am" hero like Tony Stark, and this is not Spider-Man.

On Spider-Man 3, Talos impersonating Nick Fury ofcourse offers to help Peter Parker, and enlists the help of non other than Matt Murdock to defend him in a New York city trial. Talos impersonates Peter Parker in the trial and the real Peter wearing the Spider-Man suit goes around swinging and attends the trial. Defending Peter and saying they're just cool friends instead of being the same person. (this will nicely set peter up as spider-man's "camera guy" for the future)

Matt Murdock not knowing that Peter is in fact the real Spider-Man and that there is an actual alien impersonating Peter, the superhearing dude that he is, senses something fishy and investigates. He follows Peter around, just far and inconspicuous enough not for Peter to detect him, and there he was: Peter Parker Spider-Man fighting crime.

&#x200B;

How would Kingpin enter then? Make Vanessa, Matt Murdock, Karen and Foggy, a part of the snap. This gives Wilson Fisk five whole years to rebuild his empire without worry of Matt Murdock and co., and all of the ruthlessness back and the rage coming from Vanessa's death.

Spider-Man is actually trying to bring down Kingpin's unconstrained criminal empire at this point, and Daredevil offers to help and offers a bit of his history with Fisk (Quickly summarizing the whole of Season 1 and 3 for movie audiences).

Since Fisk is out of prison, naturally he would choose not to return, and would say to hell with Daredevil and Spider-Man. Kingpin reveals Matt Murdock's identity in which Peter and Matt easily disproves by Peter paying back the favor: by wearing the Daredevil suit. Matt Murdock then sets up Vanessa for prison and this makes Fisk even more angry. It's Fisk and his empire vs Spider-Man and Daredevil.

* After this, The rest of the DEFENDERS can come easily now. Plus Iron Fist can easily tie-in with Shang-Chi and Doctor Strange as well.

&#x200B;

**Fantastic 4 is the easiest to implement**, just with the popular theory going around. Being a team/family experimenting about the negative zone in the 1960s and getting stuck there. From there on they use negative zone resources to improve upon their 1960s inspired tech(think of cyberpunk/steampunk styles) to travel around the negative zone.

They return to the world circa 2020s and join the present MCU. Maybe they will detect the use of the infinity stones and this will prompt them to return. (they may or may not be affected by the snap due to them being in the negative zone)When he visits Wattos shop on Tatooine for the part for the ship, he is told by Watto that he has the only part available in town. Qui Gon accepts this without hesitation despite the high probability that he could be lying.

Qui Gon accepts this because he trusts his knowledge of the force to read others. But not a few scenes later Watto says Jedi mind tricks do not work on Toydarians. So, Qui Gon mistakenly assumes Watto is telling the truth because he senses no lies or dishonesty from Watto before he knows the force will not work on his mind. Qui Gon was dupedWhen Strange tells Stark in Infinity War "We're in the Endgame now," he was giving Tony a hint at what he should do.

Strange saw that Tony was going to have to go back in time, but he had to give him a hint as to when to go to. Her couldn't outright just tell him without breaking a time continuum (or just a time travel movie rule). 

By referring to the Endgame, he was pointing Tony to the moment Ultron was created. Tony points to the sky and says "That's the Endgame up there." This could end up needing a couple things....

1.) Ultron will be a key to stopping Thanos. Ultron had just come out and escaped into the world. He was meant to be the key to stopping the Endgame in Tony's mind. Tony might go back in time and fix Ultron when the party is going. When Ultron was created Tony even said to Bruce in disbelief "Were we even close to an interface?" He could have already gone back in time and was a catalyst to creating Ultron. Or someone else did and Tony will stop them.

2.) Right after Tony makes his Endgame comment, Steve says that they'll do it together. "And what is we fail?" Tony retorts. "Then we'll do that together too." This could be a hint for Tony that they can't defeat Thanos divided. Steve was right all along and they need to do it together. This will lead to the scene from the last trailer where Tony and Steve to trust him.

Either way, I think Strange is signaling Tony to that point in time. Thoughts?We were shown in Return of the Jedi that R2D2 has a storage compartment that held Luke's green Lightsaber.  

The last time we saw the green Lightsaber was in the flashback scene in Episode 8 when Luke confronted Kylo Ren at the Jedi Academy.  At the end of the flashback the Jedi Academy is on fire and Luke is standing next to R2D2.  So we know that R2D2 was with Luke the last time we saw the green Lightsaber and he has the capability to store the Lightsaber.

At no time during Episode 8 do we see the green Lightsaber while Rey is with Luke and during his Force Projection at the end he is using the blue Lightsaber.  

My theory is that sometime during Episode 9 when it looks like all hope is lost and our hero(s) are on the edge of certain defeat R2D2 will launch the green Lightsaber out of the hidden storage compartment to Rey who will use it to save the day.I love the Truman Show. It's probably my favorite movie, well, ever. One thing that's always bothered me about the film, however, is how quickly it comes apart at the seams. A perfect storm. Why would a light fall from the sky? Why would Truman's father just show up, getting past everything? Why is Truman only questioning his life, now? Simple.

The show is running out of money. 

Here's my evidence:

* Constant set failures. These obviously haven't happened before or were less numerous, but a stage light falling from the sky is just a bridge too far.

* Hiring cheaper extras with less screening. It's why the dad, a once major character, manages to sneak in. Clerical error, not an elaborate sneak-in. 

* Constant product placement. It begins off subtle, before the movie, but has clearly gotten more obvious. It's why Truman is confused by the product placement. He's not used to it.

* Advertising for the show, as in the opening. This show should already be established, a worldwide phenomenon. Why is it being advertised? Because people aren't watching.

* Travel used to be a thing for Truman (Mount Rushmore, for example). It has since completely disappeared. Perhaps this is Truman just getting older and less gullible, but another idea is that they just can't afford it anymore. 

* They only mention the milestones of Truman’s life when discussing viewership. That's why they want the first on-air conception and why they're determined to make it happen, they need milestones to get viewers. In the final scene, Christof mentions that Truman gives delight to “millions”. The milestone events are constantly mentioned in the billions, meaning that most people only watch in the milestone events or that Christof undersells himself. I doubt that Christof, the man who thinks himself nearly a god, would undersell himself.

* During the interview with Christof, they mention the show makes quite a lot of money, but the expenditures for it are equally massive. They quickly skim over this point, but I think it's what ties this movie together.

* The crew is working ungodly hours. Paul Giamatti's character, Simeon, is seen working during the dawn in the mirror astronaut scene, where he misses his wink and nudge to the camera, and during midnight, where he misses Truman’s break out. They're not that attentive, missing Truman’s escape entirely, over several hours when they had a camera right next to his escape route. They're either incompetent or, more likely, completely overworked. They just can't do it and the show isn't hiring more directors.

Sure, the show can lose money, but why?

The show is becoming monotonous. That's why they want Truman to have a kid. Just Truman and Meryl is starting to get boring, even Truman is feeling the monotony in his daily life. A man being bored for twenty-four hours a day isn't exciting television. With the baby, the show gets a whole new dynamic, a new character as real as Truman. A potential new show. A new show means new profits. It means a new dynamic as Truman begins to become more “boring”, but Truman won't budge. The show wasn't brought down by random chance. It just couldn't sustain itself under its own weight.Because he's one of the few Rick's who is happy. We all know Rick is a very self loathing character, he and many of the other versions of him hate themselves, after all his catchphrase means, "I'm in great pain, please help me." However Doffus Rick seems joyed by simple things like helping others and Jerry's Star Wars Coin Collection. He isn't just hated because he is an idiot, he's hated because he can experience what other Ricks can't, general happiness. It maybe a naive happiness, but happiness none the less.

Edit: Oh shit, did I misspell Doofus. My bad.During WW2 hydra started teleporting soldiers around the galaxy thinking they where getting disintegrated. Some got lucky and ended up on civilised worlds but with no way back home settled down.I think the Hulk has been on Sakaar for a very very long time, possibly a hundred years or more.

Hulk has been missing since Avengers Age of Ultron and Thor says to him he’s been gone for 2 years and Bruce Banner has no recollection of the 2 years Thor’s talking about. Loki was on Sakaar for 2 weeks before Thor was, but the time between them being knocked out of the Bi-Frost was a total of about 30 seconds.

So, if 30 seconds in the reference frame outside of Sakaar is equal to 2 weeks inside Sakaar then how long is 2 years outside of Sakaar equal to on Sakaar? 

My thought is Hulk has been on Sakaar for a very long time, and never as Banner, and that leads to other things such as Hulks intelligence increasing as he spends so much time not stuck Banners body.

Let me know what you guys think?

Edit: also this only works assuming the time difference doesn’t fluctuate which it could maaaaaaybe do evidenced by the fact that time on Sakaar and Asgard seem to be more or less synchronised, shown by Hellas actions because otherwise Thor would’ve shown up in Asgard a mere 5 minutes after Hella got there, however this synchronised time could be a side affect of Thor and Loki smashing through the BiFrost which cause Sakaar to synch with AsgardI tried searching around for similar theories before posting but found nothing, so here goes: In Toy Story 3 we learn Buzz has a demo-play switch when Lotso reverts him back to factory settings in his jet pack/battery insert. When the switch is flipped back to “demo”, he’s become his former self from Toy Story. He believes himself to be a ranger and that Zurg is his sworn enemy. I believe that in Toy Story, Buzz’s failed attempt at flying was so traumatic on impact that it flipped his switch from “demo” to “play”. It’s not until he watches the Lightyear commercial in Sid’s upstairs that Buzz actually feels doubt and tries to prove he’s a ranger by jumping from the railing. It’s the flipping of the switch itself that allows his toy personality to fully realize what he is and is overcome with major depression. Some evidence to help prove this further is the imposter Buzz from Toy Story 2. He’s in complete “shelf toy mode” and doesn’t for a second hesitate to believe Zurg is his father and even goes so far to say he’s got some catching up to do with dad. Even when confronted with “human thinking” sentient toys, he still believes himself on duty because his demo switch cannot allow this brain processing to happen. The memory that is created in “play” mode remains intact as we saw in Toy Story 3 and almost goes into stasis as he was Spanish Buzz. So while we’re lead to believe Buzz had the mental breakdown due to his failed flight, I actually think it went one step further and flipped his switch sort of recreating the scene from Preston’s character from Equilibrium. Ive taken into account Buzz’s earlier fall out the window because of Woody, I don’t think it was as traumatic as he likely landed in the grass or shrubs right under.Astrid really is Michael's daughter. He had his vasectomy reversed, they had sex constantly for Jan's pleasure, and whoa surprises she gets pregnant. Now Jan knowing how Michael is, refuses to allow Michael to mess up their kid, so she pretends the baby isn't his, which isn't beyond her. Michael doesn't feel an attachment to Astrid because of Jan's lies and all the negative baggage he has with her so allows himself to believe the lie. In 30 years we'll find Astrid as a regional manager of a software company creating havoc with her Scott's blood antics. Near the end of the movie, there is a chase scene thru the door warehouse. Mike makes Boo laugh and you see (at least) thousands of doors all across the factory light up. We are then shown that as long as a door has a red light (indicating it has received power), if it is opened by either side (human world or monster) then a portal is created between the two. Later on in the scene, we see on more than one occasion Mike or Sully almost fall to their death after going thru a door. (we get a good shot of how far down the fall could be, at least a couple hundred feet. 

The scene in question. [https://youtu.be/-ZndJngyZhs?t=104](https://youtu.be/-ZndJngyZhs?t=104)

It is my assertion that at least a few humans went walking into their child's closet and fell promptly to their death. After a couple minutes, the power from Boo's laughter is no longer powering the door and the portal closes. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;So a few years ago, a fan theory emerged that Phineas (of *Phineas and Ferb*) is Doofenshmirtz's biological son. The main evidence for this was that Phineas' head shape looks a lot like Doof's, Phineas has a bit of the mad inventor about him -- he's always the one who chooses some crazy build as the thing he and Ferb are going to do today -- and that Linda and Doof dated when they were young, before Linda became a one-hit wonder pop star.

This gained some traction before people pointed out the one very big hole in it: Candace. Not only does she not look anything like Doofenshmirtz, but she meets him in one episode and doesn't recognize him at all. Surely he couldn't be her father, so therefore he couldn't be Phineas's either, right?

Well... not quite. Also consider that Linda is divorced. I think you can see where this is going.

Here's my timeline. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the show is set in 2007, when the first episode aired. It's still early enough for smartphones to be a rare novelty, as indicated by Candace having a flip phone even though her family seems comfortably middle-class, but late enough for Candace to discuss an outdated marketing trend as being "so 2002" in the "Phinedroids and Ferbots" episode.

* 1970s: Linda and Doof date for a while, as we see in that one episode that has them sitting in a car at a drive-in movie. However, Phineas cannot be a child from this relationship because 1) Candace and 2) Phineas would be in his twenties at least. However, this is still significant.
* 1984: "You loved her in the '80s!" Linda somehow gets world-famous for that stupid, stupid song. She lives the pop star life for a while but then decides to settle down. Meanwhile, Doof goes to college (he may not be an actual Doctor, but he has to have some training to be able to build those inators without ordering the parts in a kit like Phineas does with the rollercoaster).
* 1990: Linda gets married to Candace's father. Doof and Charlene are married by this time too.
* 1991: Candace is born (assuming she's 16 in the monster truck episode). Vanessa is born a bit later.
* After that, Linda's relationship with her husband goes downhill. Maybe he was just a former fan who loved her for her stardom rather than her personality, we don't know. Things grow distant. Linda is no longer satisfied with their relationship. One day, while she's out on the town, she runs into Doof, who has really improved himself since their awkward teenage days. Memories come flooding back. They resume their friendship. He becomes her shoulder to cry on. One thing leads to another.
* 1995: Phineas is born.
* Linda's husband starts to notice that "his" son looks nothing like him, finds out what happened, and divorces Linda.  Doof and Charlene have no idea Doof has a secret kid.
* After surviving on her own for a while, Linda finds it pretty darn hard living as a single mom with two kids, so she starts looking for another husband. She meets Lawrence, an engineer who's also single parenting.
* 1998: Linda and Lawrence get married, introducing Ferb. Now we have the family we see in the show.

Any feedback or corrections would be more than welcome.While exiled on Dagobah, Yoda found in his meditations that the literal life force of all things controls how the Force works rather than the microscopic life forms known as midichlorians. Just as in our universe microbes surround us and live on practically every surface on Earth, midichlorians surround the entire Star Wars universe, and after early jedi discovered them they believed they were the reason the Force, for lack of a better word, works. 
Yoda, however, spent years on a planet surrounded by all kinds of living things, and by extension, midichlorians. The reason neither Obi Wan nor Yoda mention them to Luke is because Yoda discovered that they were merely all surrounding just like the Force, they don't control the way the Force works, they are just another life form with which it penetrates and binds to all other life in the universe. THEORY

We're told again and again that the goal of the invasion is the legalized occupation of Naboo by the Trade Federation.  The whole thing turns out to be a giant black eye for the bad guys though.  By the end of the invasion, the evil Sith after a millenium in hiding return only to see Darth Maul cut in half by a Jedi padawan on his first mission out while the fearsome droid army of the Trade Federation are defeated by a planet with no military using two Jedi, a handful of volunteer security guards and some Gungan cannon-fodder.

&#x200B;

When you're a Dark Lord of the Sith trying to conquer the galaxy, you can't have just one plan on how to do it.  You need contingency plans for when things go off the rails and then contingencies for those contingencies.  Captain Panaka was a deep cover asset who, though not a formal part of the plan to invade Naboo, tried his best to ensure the Trade Federation's invasion was a success by subtly working against Queen Amidala and ultimately ended up turning the entire fiasco into a victory for Palpatine.

&#x200B;

EVIDENCE

* Palpatine and Panaka are both from Naboo.  In their respective positions as senator and head of security, they would at least be well acquainted with each other professionally.  Panaka would also likely also know a great deal about Palpatine's private life and routine when he's on Naboo as part of his job.
* As Palpatine's agent, Panaka knew about the impending invasion, but downplays the possibility of attack when the Trade Federation jams their communication.  If Governor Baldie McMullet immediately understood that blocked communications were a precursor to invasion, so would a head of security.
* Panaka tries to use fear to manipulate Amidala into surrender by telling her that there is no way Naboo can defend itself against the droid army.
* When the Jedi rescue them and Qui-Gon asks her to go to Coruscant for her own safety, Panaka tries to keep her on Naboo by assuring them the Trade Federation would not harm Amidala because they needed her to sign the treaty.
* After the ship is damaged, Qui-Gon decides to land on Tatooine because there is no Trade Federation presence there.  Panaka objects.
* Once they are on Tatooine, there is no way for Palpatine or the Trade Federation to know where they are, so someone would have to send out a signal to them with their location.  There are three people on board that might suss out his intentions to send one: the two Jedi and the Queen.  Luckily, Qui-Gon has to leave the ship to get parts while Obi-Wan is preoccupied with repairing it.  So what does Panaka do?  He pawns the Queen off on Qui-Gon so he'll take her with him into town.  With her gone, he's free to signal Palpatine with their location.
* When they finally get to Coruscant and met Chancellor Valorum, he makes a half-hearted, almost dimissive bow (really more of a head nod) to him in stark contrast to the full bow he gives Palpatine later in the movie after he becomes chancellor.
* If there was one time when security should stay by their VIP's side at all times, it would be while on foreign soil.  Yet on Coruscant, Panaka ditches Amidala to hang out with Palpatine to do who knows what, but when he returns, he is very excited to announce Palpatine was nominated to succeed Valorum.
* When Amidala decides to return to Naboo, he tries to convince her to stay on Coruscant which is the exact same thing Palpatine now wants.
* Arriving back on Naboo, he tells everyone that security forces and police have started an underground resistance.  What does he do next?  He announces that he has rounded up as many of its leaders as possible and brought them back with him to the plains which would leave said resistance unorganized and effectively without leadership during their push to take the palace.  He then tries to dissuade Amidala from going through with the attack again.
* He literally takes Amidala through a window straight into a trap in the throne room where they are immediately surrounded by droidekas.  Had Amidala's decoy not shown up, the Trade Federation could have ended things right there.
* As the movie ends, he leading Gunray away and unlike the weak bow he gave Valorum, he gives his true master Palpatine a deep formal bow.

&#x200B;

TYING UP LOOSE ENDS

If Panaka was working for Palpatine, why doesn't he side with Gunray in the throne room once Amidala surrenders?  Because he's an undercover agent and undercover agents stay in character until their handler pulls them or issues them new instructions regardless of what's going on at the time.

&#x200B;

Panaka is part of Palpatine's spy network.  He had two jobs.  First, it was staging for the invasion.  He made sure the droid army had absolutely no resistance in taking the capital.  His second job was to keep tabs on the Queen.  Palpatine being a politician from Naboo, would have known she used a double, so he needed someone to keep track of the real Queen during the invasion.

&#x200B;

At the end of The Phantom Menace, once Nute Gunray has completely bungled the invasion and been apprehended, Panaka receives his new orders from Palpatine.  Gunray is in Jedi custody on a planet that is 100% hostile to him.  Yet, when Attack of the Clones picks up, he's not only free, but on the ruling council of the Separatists.  How is that possible?  Because Panaka is the one who led him away into detention and let him escape.

&#x200B;

Through his hard work, Panaka ensures that a failed one-off deal between two politicians turns into a permanent alliance with the war criminal Nute Gunray and his Trade Federation now jointed at the hip with the Sith and dependent on Palpatine for survival.  Palpatine uses the Republic to try Gunray four times in absentia to keep him in remembrance of that. For a job well done, Palpatine likely rewarded Panaka and brought him into the fold over in Coruscant which is why he doesn't return for the rest of the trilogy.

Liked my theory?  Read my other ones.**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!" 

The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is fully able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his "first step" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross.

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully. 
So been on a Bob's burgers bender recently, and I've came up with an idea as to why the restaurant doesn't do well...the prices are to low! Its counter intuitive I know, but if the price is to low people will assume it's cheap bland food; this theory is backed up by people being genuinely surprised by how good the food is (like that episode with his chef friends!). If bob raised the price up to 8.99, instead of 5.99 business would be better!I am big fan of star wars and always have wondered why the planets seem so basic, like all the planet is forest or ocean. 
But recently i finished Rebels and there i figured out. The planets generally are very small, not like the earth but more like our moon. 
That explains why there are few cities, few continets, and is so easy and quick to leave the planets. More examples

-This is very noticable in rebels, where lothal have the capital city and just a lot of plain field, also
-On the fourth season they travel from the south hemisphere to the north relatively easy.
-on the episode 3, when obi wan gets to utapau, he says that will go to the continent, like if it was the only one.
-on kamino it looks like the cloning facility is the only structure,
It would be a waste of space, wouldn't it?
-courusant is refered as a big city, it would make sense to be a small planet, even if it is all connected and act like one big city.

Of course there are biggers planets, but generally, they are smalls.

And the more i think about more sense it makes, it explains a lot. What do you think?

Edit:
Thanks to u/democrab to this:
The planets are also like colonies, where just a few developed cities scarted arround the world, that explains why dangerous to leave the cities, there is no law outside the main settlements.I’ve seen a lot of people online saying that their main gripe with Far From Home is that it doesn’t make sense for Tony Stark to spend millions on what could basically be a doomsday device, only to end up giving sole access to a hormone-fueled teenager.
While I agree that would be ridiculous, I don’t think the EDITH glasses are the only point of control for the whole system. When Peter first boots up the glasses and learns about their functionalities, he asks something along the lines of “Wow, he made all this for me?” And EDITH tells him “No, but you have access to it.”
I think that means that other people, like Pepper Potts and War Machine, probably have their own way of accessing the system, but these specific glasses, this one access point, was made just for Peter.
If I’m right and other people do have access to the system, who else do y’all think probably got a login?I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/laztjc/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and_he/)):

I think Ego lied about Quill losing his powers if Ego dies. 


What do we know about Ego? Other than the fact that he is a liar. Well Ego is not Kurt Russell but rather the planet (technically the brain as he constructed the planet around him).

Ego's whole mission is to create a second celestial to power his expansion. He even refers to Peter as "a battery". This tells us that Ego alone lacks the power necessary to expand his body across the galaxy. However, two celestials could do it. Peter being a celestial likely means he has his own power source. 

If Peter were simply drawing power from Ego then why would Ego even have to bother doing his whole quest to have a child in the first place? Ego needs new energy and if Peter's powers are dependent on Ego, wouldn't Ego just be drawing from himself?

Quill would need to be generating his own celestial energy. Ego likely lied to Peter to keep him from setting off the bomb.  If Peter thinks that killing Ego would cause him to lose his powers, he may save Ego. So the lie was a desperate last ditch effort to get Quill to save him. 


But why do Peter's hands stop glowing when Ego dies? It is because his emotions changed. Yondu tells Peter that he must control his powers with his heart (e.g. emotions). He felt love for his friends, his mom, Yondu and that fired him up to fight. You may think that it's anger but he was angry plenty of times and that didn't happen. The only other time we see him use his powers was when he created the little ball. He was trying to think of something but he wasn't feeling intense emotion. He was feeling some so he could pull out some energy. Intense feelings of passion, the desire to protect people he cares about is what helps him use his power. 

When he defeats Ego he feels a bizarre emptiness. For one, even though he was trying to stop Ego, killing the dad that you just met and having that intense of a fight is going to give you very conflicting emotions. He has had to deal with so many feelings in a short period of time that now he feels drained. For that reason, his powers went away. Remember, they didn't go away the second the brain exploded, which would make sense as that's Ego's true form. No, it lasted a few seconds until after the avatar of Ego that resembles his dad is now dead. That was when the loss became real to him and the emotions conflicted. He was no longer able to use his powers. 

He likely hasn't tried to use his powers since as he believes that they are gone and have no reason to try.Anakin's attack on her was the final straw but Padme didn't lose the will to live because of 1 Mad Man, no she loses the will to live because everything she's worked for her entire life has crumbled and she knows it's her fault or at least it seems that way.

Let's go through it, It's because of the Naboo Blockade that Senator Palpatine became Chancellor.

Because of the Replacement she chose Jar Jar the Chancellor was able to gain the emergency powers.

And maybe had she been paying attention and worked with the Senators, she could have prevented it, but instead she was focused on her Secret husband and their children.

So let's go back to the day she dies, she get's to watch as Democracy dies to like she says "Thunderous applause". So all her work as a Senator everything she's done for her people becomes meaningless. Than she goes home and she's informed that the man she loved is a madman whose killed children. She goes to Mustafar and learns he's a Sith and the final nail in the coffin he attacks her, meaning the love she lost everything for is meaningless.

So she gives up, it's too much. You could argue that the love for her children should have let her live on, but they're a reminder, a reminder of her inaction, her preoccupations that led to her part in the Republic she lived for dying.

So it's not just some fairy tale "Oh he didn't love me so I can't live" it's a woman who's lost the will to live because she's lost everything else in the span of less than a day.TL;DR: Much like the Christmas Carol, Thor will be taken through his past, present, and future by Gorr, the god butcher, . Gorr wants to destroy Thor completely, first on a psychological level then physically. He wants Thor to see why he is unworthy to be a god. In the MCU version of this story Thor would be directly or indirectly responsible for Gorr's pain and death of his family. Gorr Will show Thor his failures and mistakes and how they affected the realms around him, and the pain he caused. Thor will become unworthy because he will believe himself unworthy.

The Speculation:


In Ragnorok, Thor had to face the dark history of Asgard. In Love and thunder, Thor will have to face his own dark past and his future.

Gorr, the god butcher, hates gods with a passion; his gods failed him, so now all gods must pay for their respective failings, and Thor has many failings. Thor is close to 1500 years old and, in that time, has gone from the hard-drinking, blood-lusting warrior god of the Vikings to an Avenger.  His past is stained blood and pride, and Gorr will capitalize on this.

We reap what we sow

This version of Gorr will directly connect to Thor. Thor will either be directly or indirectly the cause of Gorr’s pain and suffering on his homeworld, and when a dying Hela comes crashing down on his homeworld, Gorr will take the all-black Sword for himself. He will hunt all gods, believing them all unworthy to rule, but he will have a special hatred for Thor.

Thor will fight Gorr, but Gorr is stronger and more of a manipulative threat than anyone he has faced before. Gorr does not want just to kill the god of thunder. He wants to destroy him. Gorr is not a foe. Thor can just beat down and move on. No, Gorr is attacking Thor on a psychological level.  

Gorr can travel to diffrent points in time . He will take Thor through time, showing him all the painful and terrible things he has done. Gorr will show him why he is unworthy to be a god and why he was right to hand over his title to valkyrie. He will convince the god of thunder theat the universe ia better off without him.

Like the Dickins classic,Christmas carol Thor will see his life laid bare, and he will lose his power, believing he is not worthy to wield it.

Mjolnir

 Gorr will transport a Mjolnir from the past to the present,  but because Thor now believes himself to be unworthy will not be able to lift it.  It is the psychological last straw to Thor’s ego. It will sit unclaimed until Jane foster detects the weird energy field and comes to investigate.

Thor will face his past and reclaim his future.

Thor will have to come to terms with the god he was and move forward. Thor has been on a redemption trail since he first was introduced, but now he will complete his arc and become a god that will eventually become King Thor in the future. He will regain his power and defeat Gorr, but he will remain unworthy for the time being; it is something he will have to work through. Thor will leave the idea of remaining worthy at all times behind. He wil instead define his life by his own code , becoming his own man/god.

This film will be about whether being worthy and following his father's idea of worthiness is important to him anymore. Since he has abdicated the throne he is free to choose his own life. 

It is not about being worthy again, its about whether that matters to Thor anymore.

Jane Foster will become the Thor and Thor Odinson, though still superpowered, will be free to search the galaxy for his own meaning, perhaps joining the Guardians of the galaxy . He will leave the nine realms in the capable hands of the new Thor, Jane Foster.

The future of Thor

Marvel is switching up the Avengers roster and seems to want to forge new avengers. It makes sense that Thor would leave the MCU at the end of Love and Thunder, much like how the rest of the Original Avengers. Of course, He could always come back later for cameos, but I think the original Avengers, Iron man, Captain America, Black widow, and the Hulk are being shelved for the new cast.

Edit. This speculation pulls heavily from Jason Aarons's thor series. if you haven't read them please do. they are the definitive take of Thor Odinson and Jane Fosters Thor.Why, would you think, a giant radioactive dinosaur keeps saving us?

 Reptiles are far less emotionally and socially advanced than primates. Unlike Kong, who shows understand of communication and concepts like home and friend, and displays human like emotion,  Godzilla is driven by primal urges only. What is mostly visible is a desire to claim his territory, but you have to look deeper than that

Godzilla is from Inside the earth. This is a highly radioactive place filled with dangerous enemies. But since he feeds on radiation, this is where he belongs 

As the earth ages, radioactive materials decay and radiation levels drop. This creates more pressure for food. Godzilla still is on top, but he has to work harder than ever before 

One day, Ghidorah falls from space in Antarctica. Godzilla takes this as a threat,  they blow a hole through the earth, and fight it out. Ghidorah looses. Godzilla isn't to sure about this new environment. Its cold and not radioactive.  He shrugs his shoulders and goes back underground 

One day thousands of years later, we blow up Japan. Like a toddler hearing a snack bag opening, he investigates and what does he find? Free food!
Not only that, but these little insects keep throwing bigger and bigger bomb morsels at him. Yum!

Now he realizes the crust isn't so bad. Not only is he unopposed, but there is a constant stream of radiation from bomb tests and reactors. So he stays,  and only awakens when another radiation eater intrudes on his space, like the mutus.

 We create the commodity he wants and needs. We are the sheep and he is the Shephard. 

What does this imply? If we decide to go green and decomission all of our nuclear plants, will he just go back under ground? Or will he start rampaging through the flock to get the last remnants of radiation he can find?1.Thor is at his most powerful in Infinity War where he overpowers even the Infinity Gauntlet and nearly kills Thanos.He doesn't have Mjolnir then. Instead he uses Stormbreaker.
2.Thor is more powerful in Thor 3 than 1&2 .The only difference being he no longer wields Mjolnir.
3.In Endgame he again wields Mjolnir and he becomes nerfed. Now his loss in power may be due to his sedentary lifestyle however it should mainly affect his agility and reflexes.His physical strength while decreased should still be somewhere near the same level as before.While that is debatable what is certain is that his lightning powers should be nearly as strong as it was during Thor 3 and Infinity War. However he hardly uses lightning and what little he uses does not seem to be as effective as before.
He is completely outmatched by Thanos without any Infinity Stones.
4.Captain America while wielding Mjolnir shows incredible strength and furthermore even lightning attacks.So where did this power come from?

This is my Theory- Mjolnir is actually a power dampener which stores Thor's power within itself.

1.Odin knew that his incredibly powerful son still hadn't acquired much wisdom and was brash and irresponsible.He couldn't trust his son to handle all that power responsibly. He already had failed to guide his daughter onto the right path.He had to take drastic measures.So he tasked the dwarfs with creating a power dampener disguised as a weapon.He always intended Stormbreaker to be the true weapon for Thor.Mjolnir was merely to be his weapon during his training wheels phase.However millenia passed and Thor remained brash and so Stormbreaker remained uncrafted.Finally Odin decided to teach him humility and used Mjolnir's power draining and storing ability to strip Thor of his powers and store it in Mjolnir.This way whoever could lift the hammer would receive the strength of Thor from the hammer.
2.When Hela destroys Mjolnir, Thor's power is returned to him.
3. In Endgame he again wields Mjolnir and it slowly drains his power and that is why he is so weak. Meanwhile Captain America on wielding it receives his power from Mjolnir.Maybe Thor finally understood it as well which is why he insisted Captain America wield Mjolnir.Jim struggles to find out why Charles clearly didn't like him. I believe he had a hate on for Jim for one simple reason. He tried to pawn his work off on to Jim. I really only have one piece of evidence for this but I think it's pretty strong. 

In the episode where Charles asks Jim for a run down, he clearly has no idea what he's talking about. And it's not just Jim. Oscar is also unsure what was requested of Jim and he is probably the smartest person at Scranton. 

Then several episodes later once order has been restored and Michael is back to his old job, David Wallace comes to the office and as he's leaving he very non chalantly asks Michael to send him a run down. Michael says sure with no hesitation which leads me to believe that run downs are the responsibility of the regional manager. 

Perhaps Charles himself didn't even know what a run down was and that's why he wanted someone else to do it. Perhaps he has Dwight doing other aspects of his job off camera and since Dwight was always shadowing Michael he knows how to do most of it. Hence why Charles prefers Dwight over JimWe see in this [clip](https://youtu.be/lloeeLEWsWg) of Tom trying to sneak into heaven 3 Kittens in a wet sack getting out and running past the White cat wearing glasses than that cat says 'what some people will do' implying that the Kittens were drowned.

how does this connect to Tom? you say well this was actually a dream that Tom had and what we see in our dreams is usually drown from real life such as people and events so in the past Maybe he was in that burlap sack with his brothers Fluff Muff and Puff and was the only one able to wriggle out and not drown.﻿

Edit: Thinks for the Gold Stranger :)If you think about the facts it all kind of pieces together. Spongebob is a super absorbent sponge like product, he lives in a place called bikini bottom, he is on the other side of town to a girl named sandy cheeks, he works in a place called the krusty krab, he works in the krusty krab with squidward an anamorphic squid that looks strangely enough like a giant penis, squidward likes to avoid run-ins with spongebob whenever possible, squidward thinks that he is good at something despite the fact that we all know that he isn't no matter how hard he practices in his home by himself.                                                                                                         EDIT:Patrick is either a puckered anus or a tattoo that gets viewed a lot, and plankton is an insecure little thing with one eye who is married to a computer and is envious of what the krusty krab has and wishes to have it to himself, or at least the ingredients on how to make one, aka: a pervert.


The Theory/ speculation 

I believe season two will focus on Mando’s quest to help find the Child’s “people” whether this means other Yoda-like creatures or force users, both can work with this theory. 

Drawn to the Child’s immense force connection, Ahsoka Tano tracks down Mando and the Child. After meeting the Child, She proposes they go to Dagobah to seek the counsel of her old teacher, master Yoda. At this point in canon, we don’t know where Ahsoka was during the Original Trilogy, but we can make an assumption that she’s not aware of Yoda’s death.

Upon arrival on Dagobah, they find Yoda’s hut has been vacant for some time, but she senses someone strong in the force. The force guides her to man by a fire outside of a cave. She senses a familiar force signature; similar but different.

The shadowy figure introduces himself as Luke Skywalker. Ahsoka explains that she was once his father’s apprentice and served with Obi-wan Kenobi. Luke asks about who his father was before he was Vader. Until this point, Luke knows very little about the man Anakin Skywalker was, so it would be nice to see him learn about his father. Luke explains that Yoda passed away years before. He has come to Dagobah to use the cave, but the answers he received were clouded. Luke, emboldened by his victory at Endor, explains that he is a Jedi and wants to build a temple to train others and revive the Order. 

Luke asks Ahsoka to join him and help guide him in the ways of the Jedi. Ahsoka refuses.

Ahsoka laments that “the Jedi fell because of their hubris, arrogance, and hypocrisy; their legacy is one of failure, you are romanticizing the old ways, and repeating the same mistakes. Sometimes it’s best to let the old ways die”. This quote is a version of what Luke will say to Rey years later. She explains that a strong, pure connection with the force is more important than a thousand years of dogma and doctrine.

Ahsoka places her hand over Luke’s; we see a vision of a burning temple; a lost son; an angry Luke brandishing his saber; the Emperor laughing. Ashoka pulls away, “abandon these plans,”  she says, ”the path you are going down only leads to pain and suffering”, She says he has much of his father in him and must be careful of his feelings.

Ashoka leaves him by the fire to join Mando and the child. Mando asks if Luke is the one they were looking for.” No,” she says, “but there is another.”

I know it’s a little wild, light on evidence and utterly pure speculation,  but that’s what makes it fun.

https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-mandalorian-season-2-ahsoka-tano-return-spoilers/?amp**Spoilers ahead for Avengers: Infinity War.**

Other than the film's score, Avengers: Infinity War has only two songs on its soundtrack, one of which is a piece from Black Panther's score.

The other is "The Rubberband Man," by The Spinners, and it's used to introduce the famously music-associated Guardians of the Galaxy--who are singing along as they fly through space.

Obviously, as the one and only song with lyrics in the entire movie, "The Rubberband Man" must have been carefully selected. There must be some meaning to it. I've seen a few analyses of the lyrics attempting to derive meaning from every single line of the song, but I really don't think it goes any further than the title and the title-line:

"Hey, ya'll, prepare yourself for The Rubberband Man."

What do rubberbands do? They snap.

**Thanos is The Rubberband Man. Prepare yourself, ya'll.**So it's nothing new to think that Humans in the pokemon world are just a type of pokemon. I've seen it alot. But I think this might also explain why some characters in the Pokemon universe seem to age in very strange ways.

We've def seen examples of people aging like Oak and Jessie/James. My theory is that Humans either can stop aging by choice like pokemon can stop evolving. Or they age like pokemon evolve. So at some point we are gonna see Ash glow white and just turn into a 25 year old version of himself once he gets enough experience.**LINKS WITH PROOF OF CLAIMS INCLUDED IN COMMENTS**

TL;DR Kevin Feige wil announce on D23 that Tom Holland will be shared by Sony and Disney. They’ll announce Spider-Man 3 and Tom Holland’s involvement in Venom 2, Kraven The Hunter, and Morbius in what would be the greatest PR stunt of all time.

Edit: This one is wishful thinking guys, just turning a bad situation into a potentially positive. Entertaining the idea and connecting the dots (since they tie there after all...)

This weekend is D23, and it’s already confirmed Kevin Feige has some things to announce that are Marvel related. Probably some Disney Plus shows, and the last movie in Phase 4.

**That’s right, there’s all but one movie yet to be announced in Phase 4.** What could it be? An Avengers movie? Maybe not this soon. Blade? No that’s Phase 5. Well, before I give you my guess, let’s switch gears for a second.

Sony is currently developing multiple Spider-Man related movies. The sequel to Spider-Verse. Venom 2. Morbius. **And Kraven the Hunter, which the screenwriter has confirmed some version of Spider-Man to be in. In his words, “And \[Spider-Man\] will come face to face with Kraven”**

Let me propose this question: If Sony got full creative control of Spider-Man, do you not think they would want to put him in EVERYTHING? **Even Amy Pascal was quoted in an interview saying “We have big plans for Tom Holland to be a part of everything,”** I’ll provide a link in the comments, as with others to provide more evidence.

**Amy Pascal also said Venom was apart of the MCU. “They may be different locations, but they are the same universe” Pascal said.**

**Lastly, yesterday, it was revealed Kevin secretly helped worked on Venom according to Deadline and wasn’t given official credit.**

Back to that unannounced movie. What’s going to happen, is Kevin is going to say something warming is up. A secret project. The last movie. Then, he’s gonna invite out Amy Pascal. Pascal is gonna come out and announced the 3rd MCU Spider-Man movie. Then, in a crazy twist in events, she’s going to announce Spider-Man’s involvement in their extended Spider-Man universe.

I know, this may be wishful thinking, I know, but the evidence is there. The dots connect a bit. The MCU has Spider-Man too connected and vise versa. Let’s break it down.

1. The MCU set up Spider-Man as the next Iron-Man and has to deal with all of the characters never addressing him or his movies again. That’s gonna be hard, and very awkward.
2. Spider-Man 3 can’t mention Thanos, Stark/Iron-Man, Stark Tower, The Stark Suit, Stark technology, Happy Hogan, his relationship to May, Nick Fury, and any other Disney/Marvel hero.

Both of those are too critical for either to lose. That’s either a reboot for Sony or a complete break of continuity for Disney. Both need Spider-Man, and Sony has the upper hand no matter what. They own the guy, but will definitely lose out on a lot of fans, and quality.

So, let’s just wait and see if this will happen. **Oh and Tom Holland will voice his Spider-Man in Spider-Verse 2. Just throwing that out there.**

**Edit**: yes I know “Venom takes place in San Fran” the thing is, if a deal is made, you can bet your bottom dollar Sony is going to want Tom in their spin-offs, and going to want to either act like their movies are *extensions* of the MCU or just retcon Venom to be a part of MCU canon. Just because Venom didn’t mention Giant Man and vice versa means that this is impossible.

I doubt these companies are really concerned about canon before trying to make the most of their buck. Plus, it’s just as easy as a producer saying “Venom took place is 2012” or “They  just didn’t mention Giant Man” and the audience just has to accept it.

Last edit: Disney also wanted control of ALL of Sony’s Spider-Man movies. Kraven. Venom 2. Why? Why would Disney want control of movies made exclusively by Sony? I think Sony planned on integrating those characters into the same universe and Disney wanted profit from them.

Also, maybe this is all breaking out because Sony KNOWS they have Spider-Man 3 slated soon so they are playing their power card. Variety reports that “Sony chairman Tom Rothman was willing to give up as much as roughly 25% of the franchise and welcome Disney in as co-financing partner in exchange for Feige’s services”. 

Honestly, I think the dispute is real now, but I think this too: Sony definitely has Spider-Man planned for all of those movies, and Feige was either going to hint that or announce it at D23, but Disney realized they could get a bigger cut. I think the articles are both sides pressuring the other into finalizing the deal before this weekend so Kevin can announce it. Why else would these arguments be happening during this week?I'm not sure if this is the correct place for this theory, but I just found this sub and didn't know of a better place to put it, so here goes. Charlie Sheen revealed on the Today Show that he had been diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago (2011). However in 2013 [he revealed to Conan O'Brien](https://youtu.be/dFu2YxMYqxQ?t=58s) that in 2011 during his time off from filming Two and a Half Men he was laughing so hard at Dave Chappelle's blind white supremacist sketch that he ruptured an abdominal hernia. He had to rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. As he relates in the clip, the producers of Two and a Half Men thought he had overdosed and fired him on the spot.  This was the beginning of his 2011 meltdown. Because it's likely they performed a barrage of tests on him prior to surgery and since the time frames at worst loosely coincide it is possible that this is when he was diagnosed with HIV. He also mentions that the firing was the beginning of his infamous 2011 meltdown, but somehow I feel that the diagnosis added a lot of fuel to that fire.In Return of the Jedi, R2 and C3PO pass by a droid torture chamber, where they see droids being burned by hot irons and screaming (RIP Gonk). C3PO screams when he gets shot by a blaster, and he shows repeated fear at the thought of any kind of physical harm or pain.

Compare that to Attack of the Clones, when he literally was decapitated, and had his head soldered onto a new body, cut off, then soldered onto a new one with only a few puns thrown in, and no sign of pain. The entire droid army advances even after being shot, and shows no real fear or reaction to pain. A magnaguard literally is half crushed, and still goes for it's staff.

**Droids after the Clone Wars had chips added to make them feel pain, to avoid them being used as soldiers again**.

The Clone Wars likely terrified the galaxy. Sure, highly trained clones could take down droids easily, but for your average civilian, even a basic B-1 droid could be a deadly threat. The Mandalorian shows us a brief clip of Separtists attacking a village that emphasizes how brutal those droids could be. Imagine an entire army that feels no pain, no fear, no exhaustion. Adding those chips was people's way of preventing any future war, or a robot revolution.It's no secret that Holt was mentoring Peralta to be a better detective in the 1st season, and later when he reveals to Amy Santiago that he's been secretly mentoring her via small acts throughout the series. This got me thinking what if he had been doing this with other detectives throughout the series we never noticed. Hitchcock and Scilly are lost causes, but Boyle has much room for improvement as well as his idolisation of Jake which could get in the way of his detective work.
In season 2 episode 9, Holt asks Boyle to teach him how to cook a meal for his anniversary with Kevin, where Holt is a terrible chef but eventually is revealed to be a culinary genius. At first I thought this was a classic b99 gag but then I remembered season 1 episode 9 "Sal's pizza" where Jake and Boyle investigate a burnt down pizza shop. In this episode it is revealed Holt not only reads Boyles food reviews but also knows his terminology ("mouth feel"). From I deduce that Holt knows all of Boyles dos and don'ts in the kitchen and was hence doing all the wrong things in the kitchen so Boyle would show some authority and stick up for himself to make him a better detective

TLDR:  Holt is purposely being annoying in the kitchen to help stop Boyle being everyone's bitchI know this horse is long dead, but i'd like to try beating it with a different stick, if youll permit me. I post this as a new thread because i havnt seen anyone else bring these points up as yet. Then again, i may just be looking in all the wrong places. If thats the case, feel free to link the theory, as i'd like to read it myself.

My "credentials": I was Army, deployed to Iraq, spent several years as both a combat engineer and EOD. 

I’d like to propose that the Joker, as portrayed here, most likely served in Iraq/Afghanistan as a combat engineer, then EOD, and was most likely an NCO (SGT and above for those non-military out there) .

I’ll try to stay on track with this, addressing the videos points in the same order, but I tend to ramble. Apologies in advance.

Truck full of soldiers comment: I’d wager that he got his scars from that (after all, we don’t have face armor) and that he ALSO got some form of TBI (traumatic brain injury) which may have been what pushed him over the edge. This also ties in to his "what doesn’t kill you only makes you stranger" comment: the blast didn’t kill him, but it altered his brain function. The scars may well have resulted from battlefield reconstructive surgery, such that it is, hence why they are so prominent.


Honor Guard: If he was a career soldier and NCO, as I suspect, it’s fairly likely that he not only participated in an Honor Guard detail, especially around the time of the Iraq war, but he very well may have trained and lead the detail. However, EOD typically doesn’t do this... but Combat Engineers do. I'd suspect he was an engineer, then went into EOD. His incident with TBI probably occurred after his EOD training, hence why he would still retain the knowledge for the honor guard. One thing I don’t see mentioned is that the Honor Guard, no matter what organization, is a very prestigious position and duty, and the uniforms, movements and overall appearance will always be very closely scrutinized. It shouldn’t be too big of a deal to think that he highjacked the honor guard, but to actually kidnap the original HG, get all their uniforms, find people the exact same dimensions of the original HG, then clean up their appearance (haircut, shave, etc etc), then train them accordingly so they could get close without anyone noticing, not to mention making sure they all wore the uniforms correctly, shows he has incredible attention to detail and probably did it before somewhere.


Weapons and explosives: Gaining proficiency with weapons isn’t difficult, being proficient and knowledgeable with SEVERAL weapons gets tricky. The fact that he can, and does, utilize them all with such confidence and success should showcase that he may have been familiar with them through some formal training. EOD typically goes through "Weapons Intel Training" where they address every single weapon one could think of, and some you can’t, and how they operate. As to the explosives, simply knowing what they are and how they work from a regular soldiers perspective wouldn’t be enough. Sure, he could dig around and find some things out on the internet, deepweb, whatever, but what he uses is far too advanced for that. He doesn’t just utilize explosives; he used BBIED's (body-borne IED's) with cell phones, straight out of the insurgent’s handbooks (so to speak) from Iraq/Afghan. To make this work, and make it work consistently, he'd have to have more than a passing familiarity with simple explosives and detonators. He also has a safe/arming switch on at least one (the ferry) detonator. That belies a little more professional knowledge of the subject. And of course, the explosives he uses, for the most part, are not "military grade", probably because they are too easy to trace... he "is a guy of simple tastes" like gasoline, gunpowder and dynamite because they are more widely available and much more difficult to link to a specific time and/or place.


Interrogation scene: I’d like to point out in the scene directly before he gets his head slammed into the table, he asks Gordon " Does it depress you, commissioner? To know just how alone you really are? Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?" , this reminds me of the feelings alot of leaders have if they get hit, lose their soldiers, and survive. Moving on, one could argue that his "head" comment means he interrogated someone before, possibly in other situations, but it may also be referring to the head trauma he may have suffered when hit by an IED, or perhaps (if my theory is to be believed) he worked with other agencies while deployed and watched these interrogations himself. He then points out that Batman got people killed, then let Dent "take his place", and that "even to a guy like [him], that’s cold", further making me think he was an NCO who took responsibility for his soldiers deaths and feels he should have been killed in their stead. Obviously, he thinks letting someone else "take the bullet" for that persons actions is reprehensible. 


Stories about scars: completely fabricated, probably on the spot, and as far from the truth as possible, HOWEVER, I don’t think he did it himself. 


His "creation": There’s a saying among veterans and soldiers: PTSD is realizing that you’ll never be anywhere near as badass as you were while deployed. If my theory holds then it stands to reason that a thought process like this could have contributed to his creation, but I don’t think that’s the ONLY reason. He is far too smart for a simple "he needs to be challenged" explanation. I think TBI pushed him over the edge, but what got him "out the door" and working towards everything was simple: he was bored. So, TBI altered his mental state drastically, Boredom got him out the door, and finally, Batman was a challenge, and we do so love to overcome challenges in the military, EOD even more so. (DISCLAIMER: I’m not saying that everyone with TBI is insane, I’m simply saying that brain injury has been shown, in some cases, to cause people's behavior to radically change, and in rare cases, they become violent sociopaths).


Ive heard people theorize that he “had no goal” or “end game”, except pure chaos. I think he had goals, and that his goals never shifted. They were the same from start to finish. This will take some explaining, so bear with me here.


In the military, and especially with leadership, we have two VERY well known processes: Backwards planning, and risk assessment. Backwards planning, simply, is planning to achieve a desired result or goal. Now, where the Joker is concerned, if I had to nail it down to one goal I’d say that the he wasn’t interested in money, power, "running the city" or anything close to that. His goal was very simple and he even stated it in the beginning, in a way: "We kill the Batman". I don’t think he meant this literally, but that his goal was to destroy the idea of Batman and anyone who might have the same ideology. Now that we have established that his desired result was killing an idea and not a specific person (which, oddly enough, is exactly what we were trying to do in Iraq/Afghanistan), we can start some backwards planning. Since the Joker is working backwards, and the police are forced to react to everything, working forwards more or less, it may seem like he "conveniently" knows everything or plans for everything. However, since his goal isn’t necessarily a specific person, it’s MUCH easier for him to be flexible in real time, whereas the police are stuck in a waiting game. This helps fill in some of the plot holes, but not all of them. How did he know to have a BBIED in the jail, for instance. Enter my second point: risk assessment. 


In the Army (where I served) risk assessment is what leaders live and breathe. A simple breakdown is this: you have your goal, then begin your backwards planning. During this planning phase, you think of every possible hazard that may occur during the course of reaching this desired goal. IE: we plan to drive tactical vehicles out to a range, could the roads be wet? will there be a lightning storm? could one of them break down? could there be an accident? could God himself smite one of the drivers? As ridiculous as it may sound, no possibility is considered too extreme (although it’s usually shortened to relevant hazards because let’s face it: we'd never get done writing them), in theory. He knew that in the course of attempting to capture Harvey he may very well be captured himself. He also knew that if he WAS captured, he'd most likely be taken to that jail. He also knew that he needed a way to get out that was simple, undetectable, and that the police would be unprepared for, hence he used a BBIED. He planned this long beforehand not because he KNEW that he'd be there, but because he recognized that it MIGHT happen, and established and applied "controls" appropriately, just like you're taught to do with risk assessments. 


At this point, I’m sure you're saying "but what about the phone call? How did he know that he'd be able to make it, much less that there would be an officer he could overpower in the interrogation room?" Good point, but he didn’t. He had no idea, and I’d be willing to bet that he had someone on the outside (remember he told Gordon that Harvey and Rachel were being moved around depending on the time?) who was told to wait and call the number on the phone at a certain time. He may have even had that person outside the building, observing, to make sure the joker wasn’t close enough to be injured or killed by the blast, and waiting for the appointed time. As far as the officer in the room, that’s what we would call a "target of opportunity". It wasn’t necessary for him to be there, but it made it much easier in the end. 


Some other points: 
Why knives? Bayonet Assault Course. Everyone went through it back then, and I think he realized how psychologically powerful even presenting a knife is in a fight, much less threatening someone with it up close. The fact that knives never need ammo, are dangerous in every direction and never jam probably didn’t hurt either.


His lack of a back-story is important in that it presents the idea that it isn’t important who he is, (or was), where he came from, etc. The important thing is the idea of him, and his opposition to the idea of Batman.  Again, in the military, it’s drilled into you that as a person, you are simply a small part of a very very very large machine, and what matters is the goal/mission and not yourself. This is also reinforced by the fact that the Joker is willing to sacrifice anything and everything, including himself, to accomplish his goal.  


His comment “they need you right now, but when they don’t, they’ll cast you out, like a leper!” was very telling as well. A lot of veterans feel this way after their service.


In the end, everything above is just my theory and not really any different from any other theory presented. I just figured id provide a look at this through “army EOD goggles”. Either way, Heath Ledger did an amazing job, and the movie was great.


Of course, I welcome any questions regarding my theory.  

EDIT 1: on fingerprints, DNA and dental records:

First off, the fingerprints. Now, if he was EOD, he would absolutely have fingerprints on record with the DoD, as is required for people with that level of clearance. However, as EOD, he would also have gone through a course we call "Sensitive Site Exploitation" or SSE for short. This is similar to what a forensic investigator would do at a crime scene, the only difference being that it would be done on deployment. This was primarily used to identify and exploit intel that might be found at weapon caches, or evidence left over from an IED strike (said evidence would have been collected by EOD in a Post Blast Analysis, cataloged, and sent to labs for further testing). Again, i wont get into specifics regarding the techniques, i will say that fingerprint collection was a large part of this process, just as it is in civilian law enforcement. It was at this point that he would learn that fingerprints are unique... but if they are damaged, by thermal/chemical burns, cuts, sandpaper, etc, then they will not match the original fingerprints taken. The damaged prints would still be unique, but the person would have to be fingerprinted again for them to be entered into any database. It would have been too easy for the Joker to burn off his prints, knowing exactly how to do it.

As for the DNA, i'd like to say that the theories youve presented are a good guess as to a clandestine involvement with CIA, Delta, whomever. But of course, the answer is nowhere near as interesting. As per Per DoD Instruction 5154.30, Section 3.c.(1), which is absurdly dry and a little confusing if you dont know which parts are simply "administrative" data that you can skip, any service member who has completed their obligation can request to have their DNA sample destroyed. It must then be destroyed within 180 days, and confirmation sent to the veteran.

So the (admittedly boring) answer is: he had the DoD destroy it after he got out.

Wish it were more interesting, but again, its just my take. :)

And about dental: The service would definitely have a copy of all dental records of any soldier. However, with the advent of DNA they tend to use those records strictly for medical purposes. Also, congress had to pass a law to allow outside agencies to use the DoD DNA database for criminal investigation/prosecution, and only after exhausting all other resources and getting an order from a judge.

Considering HIPAA and its implications, id wonder if dental records would be even more difficult to obtain than DNA... but good point. 

To add to the dental records: i double checked, and if it had been more than 2 years since someones last appointment, their records would be in the Archives, and would require a written request for the specific records. The request would need Full name and SSN and the date and location of last treatment. Keep in mind, thats to get a paper copy. There are simply too many medical records for them to scan everything into any sort of database, assuming they didnt loose it first (it is the govt, after all).

Adding for ease of reading, and the last little bit about dental that i didnt think to include on the response below. 

PS: thank you guys for the feedback :D
The title given to Roman emperors was Caesar. My thinking is when Rey calls herself a Skywalker at the end of Rise of Skywalker, she's doing something similar. 

Throughout the entire Star Wars saga, the Skywalkers have developed an incredible legacy. Anakin was a Jedi prodigy, a fallen idol, a terrifying villain, and finally a redeemed hero. Luke destroyed the Death Star, stood before the might of the Dark Side, and helped save Anakin from Darth Vader. Leia led first the Rebellion then the Resistance through their darkest hours and fought against tyranny and oppression. The three of them are instrumental in the foundation of the New Jedi Order much in the same way that Julius Caesar was in the foundation of the Roman Empire.

When Rey sees Luke and Leia smiling at her at the end of Rise of Skywalker and uses their name, she's not coopting someone else's name, she's using it to establish herself as the head of the Jedi, the Master Skywalker. And when she becomes one with the Force, her successor will become the next Master Skywalker, just as Augustus and the other Roman Emperors did with Caesar.While the first Peter Parker at the beginning of Spider-verse is a more "successful" Tobey Spider-man.

First off, some real life evidence: Tobey was considered for the role of PBP. Now why would they even consider making him PBP AFTER he was written? Maybe because it was written for him?

Now what do I mean by a "successful" Tobey Spider-man. Well in the Sam Raimi trilogy, Peter is put through the ringer. Hard.
Relationship problems, money problems, villain problems etc. But then the Spider-verse intro shows a lot of similarities between the Raimi events. 

Only happier. No relationship troubles with MJ. No problems being late for his job etc. Remember, it's an alternate universe!
Obviously he didn't wear the suit while going out on a date with MJ but I think the suit represents that he is in fact still a fully functional Spider-man at that time. When Doc Ock throws a car through the window, they're at a fancier restaurant showing a lack of money problems. 

And then there's the parody take on the infamous Spider-man dance (which sidenote: I did not think was weird at all. He's a nerd wearing a symbiote that enhanced underlying feelings so he thinks dancing & snapping at woman is "cool"). Why wasn't he wearing a blacksuit for the sake of the scene? Because he was a Spider-man still at the top of his game or  "more successful" than Tobey Spider-man 

Now let's look at Peter B. Parker: the similar scenes we see to the first Parker (upside down kiss) is now inverted back to normal which is Spider-man being upside down. Like in the Raimi trilogy. But what's another thing that's similar? 

His bad luck.

He made money problems, he got divorced, he lost Aunt May, he moved to a tiny apartment.

What about his synthetic webs? Well remember how in Spider-man 2 how he couldn't use his powers due to depression of everything going on? What if he got so depressed from the things I mentioned above that he truly could not regain his powers again despite knowing full-well it was due to his depression? Solution? Make synthetic webs.

This last thing is mostly headcanon patching: What about giant goblin Green Goblin? Norman's body was resurrected through evil science stuff.


Honestly, I don't think it's a huge jump to say that Peter B. Parker IS Tobey's Spider-man. Maybe that's how they wanted us to see it. 

What're your thoughts on this theory? Agree or disagree? Also it's my first time posting one of my theories on here so go easy on me please haha

Edit: rewatching Spider-man 2 & while talking to the dude in the elevator he tells him the suit is itchy & "rides up on the crotch" which PBP tells Miles about using baby powder on the suit to avoid itching & chafing on the crotch areaI was thinking about how everybody in the universe understands one another. Obviously they don't all speak English. The more likely thing is that there is a universal translator attached to everybody (possibly an implant) that allows for this communication.

Then we meet Groot, who only says the one phrase. "I am Groot." Except we know that's not all he's saying, as his partner in crime, Rocket, understands what he's really saying and translates for him. My theory is that, because Groot's race is rare, their language has not fully been added to the current universal translator. Most people are shocked by Groot, never describing him as a particular race, simply as a tree-like being. This tells me that most of the universe shown has never encountered anything like Groot. But Rocket has been with him for years. It would make sense for him to either find someone to install the language into his translator, or have Groot do the translating himself.This isn’t the first time I posted this, I just thought I would share it again with Sponge on the Run coming out.

This theory attempts to explain who SpongeBob was before we are first introduced to him in Season 1 Episode 1a, *Help Wanted*.

Before SpongeBob became the fry cook we know and love, he was a child protégée and as a result became a world class scholar who studied at one of the most prestigious universities under the sea. His accomplishments made him extremely wealthy and well respected in the academic community. However, all that came crashing down when he was disgraced for alleged homosexual behavior and unable to work in his field ever again. Too distraught by his downfall he left his old life behind.

While well off financially, he fell into a deep depression as he lost any sense of purpose to his life. Similar to the controversial episode *SpongeBob You're Fired* (season 9, episode 11). But with the help of his friend Patrick, he manages to bring himself out of his depression and starts filling his life with new activities such as adopting a pet snail, jellyfishing, bubble blowing, karate, superhero comic book fandom, and going back to get his driver’s license which he never had time to do before. He also decides to pursue a totally new career as a fry cook at his favorite restaurant. Even though he's managed to build a great new life for himself, he's still haunted by his past failures. We never learn what it is that he studied because he's constantly trying to move on from it.

Evidence that he was a prestigious scholar:

* He has a giant library under his house, (first seen in Season 1, episode 4b *Boating School*)
* He has a closet full of awards, (Season 2, episode 2a *Big Pink Loser*)
* He takes academic integrity very seriously (Season 1, episode 4b *Boating School*)
* He can put up with Mr. Krabs’ lack of payment

Evidence that he is still haunted by his downfall:

* SpongeBob has to chant “I’m Ready!” before going to work or boating class
* He struggles with self-doubt and requires re-motivation from Patrick when he first goes to apply for the Krusty Krab
* He breaks down crying when he’s fired, (Season 1, episode 14b *Karate Choppers*)
* He never wants to be transferred (Season 2 episode 14a *Welcome to the Chum Bucket*)
* He can’t handle a vacation, (Season 4, episode 14a *Bummer Vacation*)

With more digging and conversation, I'm sure much more evidence could be found to give us a clue as to what SpongeBob's past life was like.The reason Aladdin is homeless is because he's an addict, and Abu is a manifestation of his addiction. 

That's why, even when he does manage to steal some food he gives it to Abu and goes hungry because he "has to feed the money" i.e. his addiction. This is also why Abu keeps getting him into trouble.Ash's pikachu is not shown to have any extreme power, giving people and a spearow and light-medium shock, throughout the first episode until the end; where pikachu jumps into the air and is struck by a bolt of lightning, immediately having the power to shock an entire flock of spearows along with Ash.

The next time it's seen using it's power is to shock Team Rocket in episode two, once with a group of pikachu and once powered up by Ash in Misty's bike. Team Rocket immediately, and then repeatedly through later episodes, comment that pikachu is significantly more powerful than any they've seen before and is "way beyond it's evolutionary level".

As the show continues pikachu is shown to be equally or more powerful than pokemon that would logically defeat it, such as much larger pokemon evolutions, and pokemon trained for years by experienced trainers.

Pikachu may have been extra powerful all it's life, but we're given no inclination of it, and why would Professor Oak have given such an incredibly powerful pikachu to a young trainer that wasn't even on time to choose a pokemon? He didn't, the lightning strike overcharged pikachu, and ever since then he's been able to channel more electricity , first with a bicycle light and then later being able to generate it by itself, than any other pokemon of his level. Team Rocket, having been shocked by pikachu, know how powerful he is and that's why they want to steal him.

A plothole often pointed out is that when Scar takes over, the Pridelands dry up and all the herbivores leave. The pride tries to convince him to move on to other lands for better hunting. As soon as Scar is defeated, it miraculously rains, restoring everything. 

My theory is that the Pridelands are naturally a desert. Under Mufasa's reign, Rafiki regularly did weather magic to maintain the lands. Scar doesn't respect the circle of life and doesn't seem to have the same treaties with certain herbivores like Mufasa did (Scar imprisoned Zazu, and would've likely eaten him if Simba never interfered). So no more weather magic from Rafiki, and the lands dry out. 

Assuming Simba has a realistic lifespan, he's only gone a year. This is enough time for the lands to dry out so thoroughly. As soon as he takes out Scar, Rafiki does the weather magic and restores the land. 

There's a desert just beyond the borders of the Pridelands. So without Rafiki, this desert would extend into the Pridelands. We also see the hyenas living in deserted areas. For whatever reason, hyenas don't get the land that Rafiki makes livable. The habitable area of the Pridelands seems to be relatively small. 

This also explains the hierarchy  of the Pridelands. Everybody treats Mufasa's family as royalty, even those who would be eaten by them. This makes little sense. The forest that Timon and Pumbaa are from have no such hierarchy. But if the lions have a special arrangement with Rafiki to maintain the lands so they don't dry out, treating the lions as royalty makes a lot more sense.Many people argue that Dutch was never a good leader, but a self-centered manipulator of people less intelligent than him. But this isn’t true. The mission “Blood Feuds, Ancient and Modern”, highlight Dutch’s bravery; he walks in front of everyone of his gang members despite there being several armed guards that could kill him. He truly does care for the people in his gang, but the events of Chapter 4 mark a drastic change in his mentality. In the story mission “Urban Pleasures”, Dutch gets Arthur and Lenny to help him rob a trolley station- except it turns out to be a set up. Arthur, Lenny, and Dutch try escaping via a trolley ride, but ultimately the trolley ends up crashing very badly. We can see them all in pain, but Dutch seems to be the most affected- particularly in his head. We see a laceration on his head, coupled with a very sudden, seemingly slowed, decision making process. Throughout the shootout that ensues with the police, Arthur and Lenny ask Dutch a few times if he’s okay, to which he gives vague responses. It seems as if he’s just been temporarily affected by the trolley, but in reality, Dutch slowly delves into an increasingly violent, angry leader. He feeds Angelo Bronte to a gator with very little justification at the end of Chapter 4. He kills an old woman on Guarma in Chapter 5, saying he spoke Spanish and knew the woman would betray them. He then gives another excuse minutes later, saying he could “sense” the betrayal of the woman. Arthur calls him out on it, to which Dutch gets angry about. He would’ve killed Molly at the beginning of Chapter 6, but Ms. Grimshaw shot before Dutch could. Dutch starts to trust those he’s trusted the most less, and becomes more attached to Micah because he tells him what’s he wants to hear; it’s almost as if the brain damage he suffered amplified his need to be told he’s right. He starts caring for John and Arthur less, along with the general well-being of the gang members who aren’t him. He didn’t want to save John from being lynched, and according to John, didn’t seem to care when he was captured by the authorities. He also leaves Arthur to die in a later mission in Chapter 6. This all culminates in the last Chapter 6 mission, “Red Dead Redemption”, when Arthur asks Dutch for help against Micah, to which he abandons him one last time. I’m by no means saying Dutch wasn’t an already violent, angry person, but I believe his actions and train of thought are seriously derailed due to brain damage. 

TL;DR: After being in a trolley crash in Chapter 4, Dutch starts to lose himself by becoming more violent, thoughtless, and idiotic. 

This is my first time making one of these so lmk if there’s anything that I may have done wrong or if there is something you disagree with!

Edit: thanks for being so nice guys! I appreciate it. I got a lot of theories on this game so I’d be happy to do more of theseClue 1: In the first Avengers movie, Black Widow aka Natasha Romanov says, "It's like Budapest all over again!" Hawkeye aka Clint Barton replies: "You and I remember Budapest very differently."

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis 1:** Is it because they were on opposing sides in Budapest?

&#x200B;

**Clue 2:** In Avengers: Endgame, on Vormir, Natasha says: "I don't judge people on their worst mistakes." Clint replies: "Maybe you should." Natasha quips back: "You didn't."

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis 2:** Is it possible that Natasha, given that she originated from the Soviet bloc, did something very bad in Budapest before she was converted in her views and joined Hawkeye and his side? Is Budapest the "worst mistake" she is referring to?

&#x200B;

**Small addition:** As they head to Vormir, Hawkeye says: "We’re a long way from Budapest."

&#x200B;

What do you guys think?We often look to the influences and the tragedies that started early in Anakin Skywalker’s life as the seeds of his eventual fall, but what if it started earlier than that, what if it is Anakin Skywalker”s genetics that foreshadows his fall?. Unlike most humans,  Anakin is created to fulfill a specific purpose, to bring balance to the force. The force needed a vessel, so it placed a child into a human mother. In a perfect galaxy, Anakin grows and becomes a Jedi. He learns how to control his power and balance the force while defeating the sith, but we don’t get that story.

 Here’s the theory: 

Anakin Skywalker is created by the force and born of a human. The living force is built into his human DNA.  The force in him strives for balance, but the humanity in him yearns for free will. This makes Anakin genetically and emotionally imbalanced. He is unstable throughout his life because of this imbalance. The force controls his humanity while his humanity struggles to retain individuality in the face of preordained destiny. Neither side of him able to achieve its goal

Anakin turns to the dark side because of the side he chooses to feed. Anakin feeds his raw emotions. He rejects his destiny and does what he, as a person, wants to do. He starves the living force within him.  Love, hate, anger and fear. He gives in to the human side until that is all that is left.

 I believe this Fracture between Anakin and the force inside him happens during The Clone Wars. Anakin begins to pursue his desires, distancing himself from chosen one path.
But here is a problem, he is genetically half living force, so when he decides to separate from the force, it is like he severed a piece of himself, he is literally less him. Yes, Anakin can still use the force, but he has severed himself from the path set for him. He is embracing his humanity, but he is not fully human, he never was, he can never be. Anakin cannot simply ignore his destiny. It is built into his DNA, and He exists only to fulfill it. He goes from being imbalanced to unrestrained. He is guided by emotion rather than the force. He is not whole anymore.He wasn't designed only to be one half of the equation. 

 Turning away from his destiny and abandoning the path laid out for  sends the force inside of him and the galaxy into chaos. He is the Jesus Christ of this universe refusing to die on the cross.
The force must find a way to course-correct 

What do you think? So I just watched the new Avengers: Endgame trailer like 5 times in the past 10 minutes and there's something uniquely strange about it. If you's can remember there was a theory going around that only 2 of the original 6 Avengers will survive at the end of Endgame. If you listen to the new trailer, you'll notice 4 of the original Avengers say the line, 'Whatever it takes'. The 4 that say this are Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye/Ronin and lastly Iron Man. Could these be the 4 original members that sacrifice their lives to save everyone?

Let's break it down, Chris Evans' contract is up after this movie, same with RDJ. The Russo Brothers said Hawkeye would have a big arc in Avengers: Endgame that all Hawkeye fans would enjoy (what bigger arc than laying down your life, to bring your family and half of all life back?) And as for Black Widow, her movie is guaranteed to be a prequel now (maybe Budapest?).

The Russo Brothers also said Captain America: Civil War would prove to be a fundamental part in Endgame. The 4 Avengers that repeated that phrase in the new trailer happen to all feature in Civil War while the other 2 original Avengers (Thor and Hulk) that didn't repeat the phrase, are not in Civil War.

All in all I just found it interesting how only 4 of the original 6 Avengers repeated this phrase as if they're willing to do 'whatever it takes' to restore balance to the universe. Let me know what you's think :DGrab a coffee or something. This will take a few minutes.

Ahem. In WandaVision, we learn that Wanda Maximoff already was capable of using magic at an early age without the structure of spellcasting, unlike Agatha and Strange, who spent years studying and spellcrafting. The Mind Stone connected with Wanda and bolstered her ability, allowing her to grow and change at a faster rate. This ultimately resulted in reality-warping powers that coincidentally resemble the ability of the Reality Stone. This is all stated pretty clearly. Next.

The Mind Stone has a mind. It is sentient to some degree. We learn this in Age Of Ultron, when Tony and Bruce study its composition and find it similar to a brain. Ultron and Vision were created out of the patterns derived from the Mind Stone, each bearing a different attitude towards preservation that better reflects the attitudes of other stones-- Ultron thought to save the world through eradication of life, something we see the Power Stone is capable of, while Vision spends much of his time cooperating, learning, searching for meaning, and loving, behavior better suited to the Soul Stone. Why does the Mind Stone propagate such wildly different behaviors and powers that mimic other stones?

**Theory 1: Each Infinity Stone has a form of sentience.**

This is not a stretch. The Mind Stone represents sentience best, but the others have also been shown to be more than just colorful gems with crazy space magic powers. Let's look at the other five:

1. "The Tesseract has awakened" is the first line in Avengers (2012). A few minutes later, Dr. Selvig says that the Tesseract is "misbehaving." It turns on equipment by itself and teleports Red Skull to Vormir before its power can be used to destroy a continent.
2. The Soul Stone requires a sacrifice of love, and "holds a special place among the Infinity Stones," according to Red Skull. Presumably the Stone itself is the judge of what constitutes a worthy sacrifice, as there are no other means to judge, including Red Skull, who has taken the position of impartial guide.
3. The Aether possesses Jane Foster like a parasite or symbiote. It defends itself from harm, protecting Jane in the process, and according to Odin it draws strength from a host's life force.
4. The Power Stone can eradicate life, which requires identification of what life is. Only powerful beings can wield it, and it's not made clear how it judges what is and isn't powerful-- The Guardians were able to wield it successfully by sharing its power among them (it certainly helped that Peter Quill is half-Celestial, but that wasn't enough on its own).
5. Lastly the Time Stone doesn't seem to have any obvious indications of sentience, but it does respond to and cooperate with spellcasting, a "programming language" humans developed.

The last two are a little shaky, but 4 out of 6 showing clear signs of sentience seems to indicate it is a trait all of them share.

Okay then, let's assume all the Infinity stones have some degree of intelligence. What can that mean? Well, where there's intelligence, there's will. And where there's will, there's an agenda.

**Theory 2: The Infinity Stones exist to shape the universe in a way that protects, strengthens, and changes Life for the better.**

This isn't reeeeeaaaally a theory so much as an observation of the result of the collective will of the Infinity Stones, but it's an important note to stand by. The Infinity Stones do not seem to have a moral preference-- they allow their power to be harnessed by individuals who they deem worthy of their criteria. Every stone seems to have some measure of worthiness attached to them-- if you prove yourself, you can you can use them. But... why? Why would the stones attach asterisks to their power? Why withhold it?

Because their power is so great, they can destroy life instantly, resetting the universe to darkness, rendering their power effectively useless, and causing the end of the universe. Life, therefore, is important for a universe's survival and ability to thrive, grow, and change. The Stones need life to succeed. But again, why?

**Theory 3: The aspects The Infinity Stones represent existed in the** ***previous*** **universe, which collapsed before this one.** It comes down to one word The Collector used to describe them: *Concentrated.* The Collector calls them "concentrated ingots," as if each stone were a condensed, physical manifestation of the six aspects. Wong also says they were sent hurtling out into the virgin universe by the Big Bang, which we know as the origin point of all things. So my question to that is, how did these stones even exist at the very beginning of the universe, when even electrons didn't exist yet, much less minds and souls? Some of these aspects weren't around long enough to be concentrated, so they had to have existed before that (there's another theory here about backwards time flow condensing the stones in the reverse from our perspective of time, but I'm going to let that drop for now, it gets even more complicated with the addition of paradoxes).

The stones likely could have been created specifically to survive the collapse so that life could once again grow and prosper in the next universe. They are aspects of the previous universe's life and memory, and only those who show they are worthy of protecting and cultivating life can use them. Thanos using them to snap away half of all life shows the stones' greatest collective flaw: meeting their criteria individually is not enough to deter someone with a strong enough will from hurting life.

This is diving a little too deep into speculation, so let's come back around to Wanda.

**Theory 4: The Mind Stone recognized Wanda from a previous universe and showed her an image of herself from that universe, not of her own future.** The Mind Stone showed Wanda a silhouette of the Scarlet Witch, a being that can shape reality, something she was on track to becoming. Why would the Mind Stone intervene?

In the current timeline, all six infinity Stones have been snapped away by Thanos. They're gone. Cap returned the time-displaced versions, but that never reinstated the ones that were vaporized. The stones needed a backup plan to control aspects of the universe in case they were destroyed. That backup plan is Wanda Maximoff.

We know that Wanda can destroy an Infinity Stone, we saw her do it. But that raises an interesting counterpoint: if she can destroy stones using her reality powers, why can't she *create* them as well? She unintentionally recreated a facsimile of the Mind Stone when she recreated Vision from her own memory, and it was every bit as powerful as the original, allowing Vision all of his abilities and restoring his mind in such detail that he could resist Wanda's control. When the Hex came down, that stone disappeared, but the show made it clear that none of what Wanda did was an illusion. The new Mind Stone she created existed only briefly, but it was just as real as the previous one. What might she be able to do if she actually *tries?*

**Theory 5: Wanda's powers are red because she IS the new Reality Stone.**

Wanda is the one being in the universe who can claim power on the level of an Infinity Stone, she is the living embodiment of Reality. She can manipulate reality to the point where she can *create Infinity Stones.* She is still learning and training to harness her powers fully, but if she ever does, she will be the human equivalent of the Aether. The universe needs her to step up and fill the gap left by the vacant stones. She's practically an aspect of the universe all her own, and she's proven she can create a Mind Stone, so she's 1/3 of the way to restoring the aspects of the universe to control, if not the stones themselves.

So what does this mean for the future of the MCU?

**Bonus Strange and Spidey Speculation!**

When Thanos snapped away the stones, their control over the timeline went with them, opening up alternate universes in the process. This has been happening for five years, and now that Strange is back, he's got his hands full dealing with the fallout Thanos created. That is where Multiverse of Madness begins.

Doctor Strange will recognize Wanda as a force of nature, a universal constant, a Nexus being. He will need her help as a tether between universes, so that he can contain the branching multiverse we will likely see in Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's likely they *won't* restore the universe to just one timeline, but create a way to manage the branches so that all the disparate franchises can continue to exist as a larger part of the broader MCU. This may come down to creating new stones, or perhaps utilizing some fundamental force we aren't privy to yet (perhaps introduced in Eternals?) From there it's anyone's guess.

In any case, if you've made it this far, thank you for reading my stream of consciousness in full! I'm sorry it's so long, so congrats, you've earned five internet cookies (If you scrolled to the TL;DR first, you owe me ten, haha!)

**TL;DR: The Infinity Stones are sentient, have a will to help life thrive, came from a previous universe, and showed Wanda a previous version of herself to spur the creation of the next set of Infinity Stones, starting with her-- because Wanda IS the new Reality Stone.**

EDIT: I attributed the description of the stones as "concentrated ingots" to Wong, when it was actually the Collector. 'Tis fixed now.*I posted this to /r/harrypotter and some people had interesting insights about this theory. I wanted to post this here to see what else people thought.*

The world of Harry Potter holds that the Sorting Hat sorts a child based on what traits they possess. The brave go to Gryffindor, the intellectual to Ravenclaw, the cunning to Slytherin and the hardworking to Hufflepuff (or, if you believe the Sorting Hat in The Prisoner of Azkaban, Hufflepuff just gets the leftovers). However, as I was rereading the series, I came across a lot of holes in that line of thinking.

First of all, many of the kids sorted don’t actually have the traits espoused by their heads. 11-year-old Neville isn’t brave at all; he’s even scared of his own shadow. 11-year-old Draco isn’t anywhere near cunning (basically alienating Harry Potter, the wizarding world’s biggest celebrity). And don’t get me started on Crabbe and Goyle.

Now Neville definitely becomes brave, and you could argue that Draco develops cunning down the line. But the point is, they didn’t have those traits the moment they were sorted. So perhaps the Sorting Hat can somehow predict their future? Or read into their minds to see which traits they’ll develop if nurtured. That’s certainly possible, but how can you possibly tell which traits an 11-year-old will have? They’re basically the age of a 5th grader. And let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that in the wizarding world personalities are somehow fixed at the age of 11 (unlike in the real world). Then shouldn’t the data the Sorting Hat collects be extraordinarily valuable to help ensure your students grow up to be healthy individuals? You wouldn’t use it to assign a student their dormitory and then never touch that info again.

And that’s clearly also not true. Peter Pettigrew was sorted into Gryffindor and he never became brave. In fact his character is literately defined by its cowardice. Similarly, Marcus Flint gets held back a year. What’s cunning about that?

And that’s not even addressing the biggest issue with the above theory (and the biggest thing in favor of my alternate explanation): students’ choice matters. Probably the biggest insight into how the Sorting Hat works is what Harry tells his son Albus – “The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”

And we see this not only with Harry (who chose Gryffindor over Slytherin) but also I’d wager Hermione (who chose Gryffindor over Ravenclaw), as well as anyone who’s family traditionally gets sorted into a house. It’s hard to imagine every single Weasley being a Gryffindor or every single Malfoy a Slytherin, if your choice was determined by your personality (and not your choice).

So clearly there’s an issue with the standard idea of how the Sorting Hat sorts. But then, if it doesn’t sort based on inner traits, how does it decide who goes where? I’d argue is sorts a child based on their values. Specifically, a child who believes Bravery and Courage are the most important traits would go to Gryffindor, where as a child who values Intellectualism and Love of Learning above all else would go to Ravenclaw. The key difference is that a child need not possess that trait, but merely value it.

This explains how Draco, completely inept at becoming cunning (but growing up in a family where it is prized), can be sorted into Slytherin while Hermione (who is an intellectual, but wishes to become like her heroes in Gryffindor) can choose to become a Gryffindor. Additionally, this neatly explains how polarized the houses are towards one another. If you take all the kids that value bravery and stick them into one house (an environment where everyone else also values bravery above all else), you’ll start to see them all become brave (and, in some cases, to the exclusion of the other traits).

If this theory is true, it also shows how badly the house system needs to be revamped (to stress inter-house friendships and development of all 4 major traits). But that’s a whole ‘nother discussion.The bulk of this theory is this: Eywa is a fungus. not the kind of rotting fungus, or mushrooms you see out in a field. She is a form of mycorhizal fungus. This fungus connects tree roots, and can even send nutrients, matierals, and chemical signals from one tree to another. (the book Entangled Life does a deep dive into fungus, deeper than i ever could if you are interested, give it a read). Basically, Eywa is a super massive fungal network that spans the entire continent, possibly the globe. I have some evidence and suppositions to support this.  


1: Everything in pandora is connected. when Sigourney's character sticks her instrument in the ground you see elctrical signals passing from tree to tree, from plant to plant. these signals are the Neuron analogues firing in Eywa. it is your first peak into her brain. as mentioned in the book "Entangled Life" this scene was added in after Cameron learned of Mycorhizal fungi.

2: The "Ancestor Trees" Lack any true leaves or photosynthetic elements. there are several real-life plants like this, one of this being  Monotropa unifora. it's entire existence is supported by nutrients imported by mycorhizal fungi. similarly, the "Spirit trees" are not supported by any leaves, or really roots, just the mycorhizal fungi that are Eywa.

These are my two biggest pieces of evidence supporting my theory. The second pieces are less strong, but i feel they still fit.

3: the weird "Tentacles" are not made of flesh, or neurons, they are made of mycileum. Fungi already permeate nearly every part of your body, and the natural world. it is likely that these are an adaption, something that flows between the very cells of the Navi, and all animals, even into the brain. this fungal network is independent, but carries electrical signals as well. it may even completely replace parts of the nervous system all together. it may be physically impossible for navi to survive into adulthood without this adaptation. this connection, and one-ness with eywa is what humans cannot understand, they cannot "See" because their nervous system lacks the proper adaptations. more on this later. 

4: when the navi attempt to save sigourney's character, tendrils grow from the spirit tress to the bodies of sigourney and her avater. these tendrils are fungal mycelium. plant roots do not grow very quickly, the fastest growing plant on record still does not grow enough to have visible changes to humans. fungal mycelium grows much faster. i have personally grown oyster mushrooms and have watched them nearly triple in size in under 10 hours. it is truly fascinating. 

&#x200B;

and now that we have established what eywa is, we need to establish why she is toxic. 

 Spores. most if not all fungi reproduce by spores. it is possible that these spores are what give newborn animals on pandora their weird hair tendrils. spores land on infants as they are born and grow into them, permeating the nervous system, likely starting in the lungs and sinuses. this is likely what makes the atmosphere of pandora toxic, and here is why: Humans do not have a compatible nervoys system. as eywa attempts to invade their bodies and integrate them, she unknowingly kills them, and this is if the spores don't carry some other form of toxin that is lethal to humans. 

&#x200B;

hell, we know eywa is conscious, she may have been attempting to kill humanity all along. from the beginning, the first scouts to arrive would have worn various respirators, but its possible that, once they scanned the air and found it breathable, they removed the respirators, only to begin to suffocate as eywa's spores invaded their lungs. the combination of our different biology, and eywa's would mean that despite the spores sprouting, they may not be able to take hold or were made to intentionally kill. as such, when a mask was returned, either the spores died off in the hostile human environment, or our immune system effectively destroyed them. 

i say it must be lungs and sinuses because humans do not cover ears or other orifices. so it seems the animal borne eywa strain cannot survive outside of the body. as such, it needs the moisture and airflow of the lungs to sprout. 

This sort of leads in to the final scene, when eywa answers jakes prayer. i do not think eywa answered the prayer at all, i think eywa came to a decision on her own. i think that it took time to fully incorporate sigourney's character, but once it did, it came to understand what humans are. not that we are evil, or destroy our planet, or anything like that. i mean actually understand what we are, that we are different. see, we could not connect to eywa before. we were separate from her network. she has no eyes or ears of her own, so she may not have even been aware humanity existed. she would have only seen the effect, not the cause. once sigourney died and was incorporated, eywa was able to uderstand the problem. she learned, essentially, a parasite has landed in her ecosystem, and that it must be purged. it was probably less of an answered prayer and more of an immune response, and it probably had little to do with jake's own connection, and everything to do with the complete consumption of sigourney. in all likelihood, eywa chose to fail the transfer so that it could take sigourney's mind directly. it likely could have succeeded, but was intentionally failed to gather information. 

tldr: Eywa is a planetwide fungus that poisons the air for outsiders.Not sure if this is supposed to be obvious, but I just thought of it. 

It's basically just the Smith family that breaks the 4th wall. Rick usually kinda hints on the 4th wall in the season premieres. Beth actually referred to a season and stated that "things are going to be like season 1, but more streamlined" when she and Jerry get back together. 

They do this because they've watched Rick and Morty on interdimensional cable. Interdimensional cable shows TV shows from every universe. According to this theory, that includes the real one. So they've seen their adventures and mishaps chronicled. 

This likely caused some existential crises, but they seem to have adjusted. The whole family seems to have kinda chilled out about being in life threatening situations. Beth doesn't even seem to care that Rick takes them on dangerous adventures. Because they're a TV show, so nothing too bad can happen.In S2E15 "A Clone of My Own", Cubert was "born" and he had to learn that the main thing about science is that if you can imagine it, you can do it. It was a simple joke that was used to both to make fun of the "achtually" crowd and explain away why the gadgets and inventions Farnsworth made were all ridiculous. 

But Fry is also imaginative, despite being stupid. Already as a kid he wanted to go to mars, and that lead to Philip Jr. getting inspired by his uncle to go to Mars (S3E10 "The Luck of the Fryrish"). In S8E11 "Cold Warriors" teenage Fry enters a science fair with the idea of sending the common cold to space through his pet guinea pig, but the boy genius Gedgie stole the idea and did it in a more technical form winning the fair. When Fry first faces the Brains he uses his imagination to trap the lead brain in a stupid story (S3E7 "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid"). Even in S8E13 "Reincarnation" Fry helps the professor continue his scientific discovers just by asking "why." 

The professor uses that same imagination for all his inventions and does not fully realize that Fry's imagination is probably what lead to the Professor's own success as an inventor. I also think that's what the writers may have been trying to say within the show. Obviously, it's a comedy series but they've been known to deal with these topics fairly well. Even in a subject that deals with cold hard facts, you need imagination for everything to grow and be better, which is why Fry, despite all his flaws, is the main character. Because he has that gift of imagination.Tyler is sitting by the emergency escape  and he's reading the pamphet thing. He reads out something along the lines of, "If you are incapable to help with the emergency escape, please switch seats." He then turns to The Narrator and asks if they can switch spots.

He asks because he is imaginary, and therefore cannot open the door if needed.

**TL;DR: At the end of** ***Thor: The Dark World,*** **the audience sees Odin talking to his son Thor, but after Thor leaves, we see that it was Loki. As the audience, we immediately assume that Loki took the throne through nefarious means, but maybe that’s not the case; in fact, it makes more sense if Odin himself placed him in charge of Asgard. Odin has always seen past Loki’s many flaws to the good man underneath. A son and a prince of Asgard. He lets Loki enchant him, letting his son rule as he seeks peace and solace on Midgard.**

**An Allfather’s love**

Loki is the ultimate outsider, not really a frost giant, not really an Asgardian. Often a villain and occasionally a  hero. But he is driven by simple motivations. He wants to be valued by the people he loves, but above all, he wants the love and respect of his father.

**Why it works**

So here’s the idea: Odin found out about Loki’s fake death in *The Dark World* and used this to plan to start his son’s path to redemption. Odin asked Loki to rule in his place, to use his power of illusion to rule in the Allfather’s stead. Odin knows that his own death is imminent, so he retreats to earth to give his son a chance to be a better man. He lets Loki enchant him and goes to Midgard.  Odin could have wanted a few years of peace, a few years not being the King. A few years back on Midgard among the people he loves.

Here’s the part that really hits me in the feels. Odin truly loves and believes in his son. His dream is for his sons to work together. He sees Thor as the protector of the realm, and perhaps he wished to see Loki as the ruler of Asgard. He gives Loki this position because he does think that he’s right for the job, despite all of his flaws. Even Thor in *The Dark World* says this:

>“Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understands rule as I know I never will.”

**Loki: King of Asgard**

Loki as the King seems like a poor choice. You would expect that he would quickly turn Asgard into a dystopia and subjugate the people, but. He doesn’t. In fact,  Asgard prospers. Even though he is honoring himself with statues and plays, Loki is trying to rule well, but he is short-sighted, focusing only on Asgard while the rest of the 9 realms fall into disarray. He needs guidance. He still wants to make Odin proud. Odin wants to redeem Loki before he makes the same mistakes he did. He is trying to save his son by giving him his trust. Loki still screws up, but it sets in motion his redemption later in the film when Loki comes back to protect his people.

Odin’s involvement is further reinforced when Thor and Loki meet him in Norway. Odin doesn’t greet him like a usurper of his throne, but as a son, he loves. This is the moment that Loki is genuinely set on the path of redemption. At this moment, he has everything he has always strived for.

Sure, it will take him a bit to fully commit to his new redemption, but this is the seed planted by a father that loves his son.

Odin’s gambit pays off. Not only is Loki redeemed, but he also saves Thor and the Asgardians.

*Edited to clear up the Prospering part,*Minor spoilers for Agents of Shield, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Black Panther

In 1931, Wilfred Malick received the "secret ingredient" for the Super Soldier Serum at a party. Delivered to HYDRA, the serum became complete and in 1940, Johann Schmidt used it to turn himself into the Red Skull.

However, the serum was not at its peak. As Doctor Erskine stated in The First Avenger, "*The serum was not ready."* In the end, Erskine chalks up the defects to Schmidt's character, but I believe there's a chemical explanation as well, and that is *Erskine used the Heart-Shaped Herb to complete the serum*.

As we know, Erskine moved to America and joined Project Rebirth during the early days of SHIELD. Because of this, he had access to a multitude of resources from the American Government. As quoted from Fandom, "[Wakanda became an isolationist nation, posing as a third world country, in order to keep the existence of vibranium a secret, although it was discovered by researchers sometime during the 1940s.](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibranium)" Sometime in the 40s, researchers discovered Wakanda and managed to obtain a sample of vibranium. 

As far as I can tell, there are only three instances of vibranium falling into the hands of non-Wakandans. One is the aforementioned instance in the 40s. One is when the [Museum of Great Britain displayed a Wakandan axe, mistakenly taken from the Fula Tribe in Benin](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Benin). And finally, when [Ulysses Klaue stole vibranium with the help of an insider, N'Jobu](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Wakanda). The fact that the only modern instance of vibranium being extracted, post-Wakandan Outreach Program, was through an inside plot, and the earliest extraction was from before the Wakandans had to worry about the "outside world," and most likely simply lost a battle against the early Fula Tribe, it seems that the Wakandans do not let vibranium go easily. Therefore, I suggest that the explorers in the 40s were only let into Wakanda through befriending the Wakandans. And that would give them many opportunities inside the country, especially if they befriended the king at the time. I believe that the explorers, however, heard of the powers of the Black Panther and betrayed the trust of the Wakandans, stealing some of the Heart-Shaped Herb before they left. [As demonstrated by Nakia in Black Panther](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4t9Y5-crM), there are secret passageways to the Heart-Shaped Herb room that would allow thieves to sneak past the guards and steal even one of the herbs.

Returning back to America, the vibranium and Herb made their way back to the government, whether through trade, or if the explorers were government agents. And so, the Herb sat in a vault somewhere, until it caught the eye of Doctor Erskine, a new hire for Project Rebirth.

Erskine probably knew of SHIELD due to his close relations to Howard Stark, and most likely knew of the vibranium mission to Wakanda. After learning that the Herb returned from Wakanda, same as the mystical metal, he began experiments and figured out that the Herb gave immense power with little side effects, save a trip to the Ancestral Plane. Possibly, he substituted the corrupt part of the serum that changed Johann Schmidt into the Red Skull for a distilled version of the Herb, which removed the spiritual side effects. This compound gave Steve Rogers the powers he gained. Also, this could add a bit of poetry, as Steve would owe both his powers and shield to Wakanda.

This could also explain why no one had been able to recreate the exact serum, as there was only a small amount of Herb poached from Wakanda. HYDRA, Bruce Banner, and everyone else who tried to recreate the serum would have to substitute the Herb, which would lead to some of the side effects and pain that we see in the Winter Soldiers. Perhaps the US replacement for the Herb in the 80s is what caused disease in the comrades of Isaiah Bradley.  

TL:DR The Heart-Shaped Herb is what caused Captain America's serum to be as pure as it was, and lack of the Herb is why attempts to recreate the serum from scratch have failed.

Thanks for the read, o7 y'all!

edit: ok looks like this theory has been presented already [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/9k01sv/nobody_is_able_to_recreate_the_super_soldier/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) sorry y’all i swear i haven’t seen that post before and i checked through the sub for a similar theory before i posted this. my bad for thisHe is simply greeting the house-elves who will be popping dinner to everyone in just a few seconds.

[The barber goes a bit deep and we see that Lisa has a Caucasian scalp.](https://i.gifer.com/fetch/w300-preview/9f/9f08781a4230cbdeced1b2aeee2ae33b.gif)

In another episode, [Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are vexed by the fact they can't tell where their heads and hair begin and end.](https://i.redd.it/sxtfgh4d0vq21.jpg)

The only logical explanation is that they are Caucasian with a thin coat of yellow fur which blends in with their yellow hair, or the hair on top of their heads may just be longer yellow hairs and styled.When the witch said he’d have until his 21st year, she meant 21 years into the curse rather than him being 21 years old. When the films going on, the curse has been in swing for 21 years. The beast is in his 40s, which is much more in line with how his character acts and how he relates to Belle

Lumiers infamous 10 years line referred to the fact they hadn’t been *used* in 10 years “needing exercise, a chance to use our skills”. He’s literally saying they haven’t put on a show for 10 years. Not that they’ve been cursed for 10 years. He implies that in the early years of the curse either there was company or they put on shows for the Prince to cheer him up. But the fact the song is be our guest implies this is something they do for guests, most likely to win over captives 

But I believe other girls were held captive before Belle. Hints; he’s surprised Belle didn’t shudder at his paw, possibly he experienced that rejection before. They had a room ready for a girl. The furniture had protocol for guests and the wardrobe had clothes ready for her.

I think in the early years the beast and the servants took girls to the castle through various means and tried to get them to break the curse but none of them could, at which point they’d proabbly be left to starve in the dungeon like Maurice would have.  Hence the beasts memorable line “then starve!”

I think that in the 11th year something particularly disastrous happened and he stopped trying which is why the furniture didn’t put on a show/have a guest for 10 years. Even the narration says “as the years passed, he lost hope” meaning he did once try to get girls over to break the curse and there were attempts.It was all planned from the start. Bran has not shown an ounce of want, or pleasure or happiness until this final episode. Bran has done Jack all except set things in motion. He set everyone on their path. He knew from the start how to pull all of the pieces to him becoming the king. Bran knew to use his power to pull together his biggest threats and contenders, to eliminate all of the potential kings and queens until only he was left

It's what he was here for

Edit: backstory examining the children of the forest, and night king, and the 3 eyed raven. The raven is known to the children as the last greenseer. Per the wiki Stories describe the greenseers seeing through the faces of their weirwoods, influencing animal and plant life, and possibly seeing into the past and future.

The greenseers were the leaders of the children of the forest. They fought against the first men and were defeated by the Starks and the first men. In retaliation the children converted a stark into the Night King to form an army to stop humanity but was repelled, they failed. The 3 eyed raven knows of this return, and develops a new plan with the children.

If creating a king of Ice is not enough to bring down the fire in humanity, then they will become the king. So the 3ER develops a plan to use yet another stark man, to take over (bran says "I am not bran stark anymore"), and manipulate the houses along the way into destroying each other. Now he can focus on spreading the weirwood trees and the return of the magic that once was.Hey, so this is a theory I’ve had regarding Andy’s Dad. In Toy Story 2, Woody rejects Buzz’s offer to come back with him to Andy’s house. He then sits down and watches a clip of a Woody puppet singing “you’ve got a friend in me”: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tMoJgFNz2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tMoJgFNz2U)

A kid then comes up to the Woody puppet and grabs and hugs it. My theory is the kid in that video is actually Andy’s Dad. Andy’s dad went to some kind of Woody’s Roundup convention where he purchased Woody and played with him just like Andy did (Note Andy’s mom mentions Woody being ”an old family heirloom”). He then passed Woody onto this son Andy.

Note in the clip above, when Woody sees the kid approach the Woody puppet he instantly perks up and watches with interest, as though he recognises the kid in the video. He then wipes the brown paint of his boot revealing “Andy”. Indicating that seeing Andy’s dad again convinced Woody to go back to Andy instead of going to Japan.As any fan of Alan Moore's *Watchmen* will tell you, one of the most intriguing things about the book is its clever use of alternate history. Sure, the story's basic premise is that it takes place in an alternate version of 20th century America where superheroes are real—but that's just one of the many striking differences between the world of *Watchmen* and our own world. And once you get **really** immersed in the world of the story and start absorbing its subtle background details, you gradually begin to realize how richly detailed its timeline really is.

Among other things, this is a world where...

* The United States won the Vietnam War, and Vietnam became the 51st US state.
* The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan didn't happen until 1985.
* The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution was repealed, doing away with Presidential term limits.
* Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were assassinated before they could reveal the truth about the break-in at the Watergate Hotel.
* Richard Nixon never resigned from office, and remained President of the United States until the 1980s.

One of the many little differences in the timeline is hammered home at the very end of the story, where we learn that a certain actor from California with the initials **"R.R."** is considering running for President in the 1988 Election—but it's revealed that it's **Robert Redford** rather than **Ronald Reagan**, and one of the characters openly scoffs at the idea of *"a cowboy actor in the White House"*.

If you go by the 2019 HBO miniseries, in fact, Redford didn't just *run* for President, but actually *became* President, remaining in office for nearly three decades.

Now, this little detail was *probably* just intended as a minor historical in-joke—or possibly as a subtle jab at Ronald Reagan, considering Alan Moore's outspoken anti-conservative views. But if you consider some of the other details of the *Watchmen* universe, there could be a deeper meaning to it.

Why?

Because in the *Watchmen* universe, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were murdered before they could expose the truth about the Watergate break-in—which means that Robert Redford never would have played Woodward in the 1976 film *All the President's Men*, which was a dramatization of the Watergate scandal.

In real life, *All the President's Men* is generally viewed as one of the most prestigious and high-profile roles of Robert Redford's career, and it's safe to say that his acting career might have looked *very* different if he had never starred in it. There's no way to know for sure, but it's not hard to imagine that his acting career prematurely fizzled out in the *Watchmen* universe without *All the President's Men* on his resumé—which might explain why he chose to give up acting and go into politics.

I know there's no way to confirm this one, since we can never possibly know *all* the details of an alternate universe. But if you've ever wondered what could have led the star of *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* to run for President of the United States, that's probably as good an explanation as any.

**TL;DR:** Since the Watergate scandal never happened in the *Watchmen* universe, Robert Redford never starred as Bob Woodward in *All the President's Men*, which may have led to his acting career fizzling out early. This might explain why he chose to give up acting and go into politics.In Eric Carle’s “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” on Saturday, the titular caterpillar eats through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. The night he had a stomachache. It was always assumed the reason for this was the sheer volume he ate (and possibly sugar content) compared to previous days. However, when you think about it, on the previous days all he ate was fruit. All of the foods he ate on Saturday are processed to some degree. Even the watermelon was sliced by someone who was definitely not a caterpillar. So where does a caterpillar find one piece of chocolate cake, one ice cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon? The garbage, of course. Once we realize this, the stomachache makes even more sense.He was killed when Kylo Ren attacked the Jedi Academy a decade ago. Luke didn't know how to turn into a ghost like Yoda and Obi Wan did (never learned that trick), so he was lost in some magical force plain of existence and couldn't really materialize before people. That's why he couldn't save Han, he couldn't kill Snoke, etc. He could only  project visions into people's minds in one particular place in the galaxy that is strong with the force. 

So  we're seeing Rey on this island, having visions about Luke and Luke struggling to materialize himself as a force ghost. He's not really there, we're seeing everything from Rey's point of view, only visions of Luke. This is why we don't see Luke talking with Chewie, because Chewie can't see him. R2 was the closest sentient being to Luke when he died a decade before, so some part of Luke was in R2 which is why R2 was broken in Force Awakens. 

Luke Skywalker is not some asshole that doesn't care about his friends, he's a confused ghost that's disconnected from the universe of the living. Then once he's able to figure out how to project his ghost to the world of the living, he immediately goes and saves everyone.He meets with his fellow criminals and speaks in code:
Sorry I’m late I got caught up watching the pirates of the Caribbean marathon. Have you watched those?!

Forgive me if the format is bad. Just something I put together on my way to work.

Hope you enjoy!

https://youtu.be/GI6CfKcMhjYI'm sure this is very on the nose, but I haven't seen it mentioned too much, so I figured I'd post.

I think Morgan Stark will star in her own standalone film titled Iron Man 3000. The character will succeed Peter Parker as a high school aged super hero, and Peter Parker will mentor her with his experience in the same role while he's aging out.

There is foreshadowing of Morgan taking on the mantle by wearing the Rescue helmet and establishing a relationship with Happy.If we look at elf society in the movie Elf we see that there is a hierarchy system with good elves and bad elves and climbing the way up the ladder.  We know Buddy is not exactly the 'best' of good elves but we're lead to believe it's because hes just a big ole ninnymuggins and doesn't really 'fit' in the world.  What if two other human children ended up in the North Pole and actually did well?  I suggest that Micheal Scott and Leslie Knope are those two children. 

I feel my evidence is pretty strong with the following evidence:

Micheal and Leslie both work in higher supervisory jobs and are looking to climb higher and succeed.  They both have an enormous amount of love for their co workers and mean well when they try things.  They both consume unusually high amounts of sugary sweets much like Buddy does as well.

&#x200B;

That's all I got thanks So, spoilers obviously.

We learn right away that Mirabel didn't get her own door/powers, and as Abuela says "I don't know why you didn't get a gift!"

I think it has to do with the reason that Mirabel was born, and it involves Abuela being pushy. 

Before Mariano's proposal, when them having children ("He wants five babies.") comes up, Abuela says "Wonderful! Such a fine young man with our perfect Isabela will bring a new generation of magical blessings and make both of our families stronger." It's clear that she sees more children as potential gifts they contribute to the family, rather than new family members. She's lost sight of the family as individual people. She even admits this at the end.

My theory is that, after having two children (Luisa and Isabel) their parents were content and didn't plan to have more children. But Abuela pushed them to try for one more "gift," and they did as they were told, as she expected. She may even have chosen her name, because it's a "miracle" after they said they didn't want more! Abuela's little miracle. Her prize. 

It isn't that Mirabel's parents didn't love her and want her once they had her, only that her reason for existing is because Abuela crossed the line. Instead of "earning their Encanto," she was being manipulative of her family and caused Mirabel to exist because she wanted a new power in their ranks.

I believe that's when the cracks ACTUALLY started, and why Bruno had been repairing them for so long. 

The house (which was sentient) couldn't give Mirabel a gift because that would have rewarded Abuela for what she'd done, but without the ability to explain it to her, Abuela just doubled down. But Casita loved the family, so instead of just denying her anything it gave Mirabel the only other magic it had..... It's own, that it had shared with Abuela. That's why she is the only one who could talk to it even before coming of age.

The door disappearing was supposed to be a message to Abuela, but like Bruno's predictions it got misinterpreted.

After the candle burns out, the house says one last thing to her with the squeaky shutter (which I swear had the same cadence as someone dying whispering "It's... O.... Kay" to their loved one.) I think it could do that because the candle wasn't the source of the magic, it was just the representation of Abuela's connection to it.

Once the house is rebuilt, and the whole family finally sees Mirabel for who she is instead of what she didn't get, she gets her door..... Which is the door to the entire Casita, meaning that the space meant for her was their entire home. She not only brings the house back to life, she proves that she belongs.

As an addendum, I think the reason that Antonio gets his gift is because his parents had him without prompting from Abuela. He's also proof that Mirabel is connected to the house (and her family) on a deeper level because she knows "he's an animal guy" and gives him a box covered in the animals who show up for him, the stuffed jaguar LITERALLY being the smaller version of Antonio's new mount/friend.... Before he even got it.During the movie, Meryl (Truman's wife) seems to desperately wanted a baby with Truman. 

I really think it's because she is already pregnant with her partner outside of the show and she wants to keep her role in the tvreality show. And she will probably faking a miscarriage with Truman when she will give birth.

Because during the middle of the show she seems very stressed and anxious, probably more than she should even after the strange behavior of Truman. and even nauseous during the car ride.

In this famous scene (https://youtu.be/6U4-KZSoe6g) It’s really look like Meryl is overprotective and full of fear very quickly, with a man she knows since years. Like a mother would do.

In another scene she is in a hurry to go at work, pretexting an "elevator disaster" probably to meet her partner and maybe take care of her future baby.

After that Christoff choose to create "a new romantic interest" and kick Meryl, maybe because she thinks it was to dangerous for her or Christoff realized about the baby ? 


I searched all over the internet for a theory like mine about Meryl or something who would explain her strange behavior but I found nothing so here I am.I believe this for several reasons. 

1. Hes throws the wine out of the glass on purpose. It looks like a joke but i beleieve this joker doesnt drink BECAUSE his father was a drinker and a fiend.  And after he does this he tells a guest you remind me of my father. 

2. Joker hates people in authority because he hates powerful men who  believe they are above the law.
He helped weaken gothams mob because they are above the law. He shot gordon because gordon was the head of gotham PD. He destroyed harvey because harvey believed he was morally superior. And he took down batman because he was a vigilante.  This joker is very anti authority and i believe hes like this because of how his father abused him. 

3. People think both stories have to be lies but they dont. This joker could very well be into self mutalation. If you ever seen a real glagslow smile they arent that thick. I believe that his father did carve his face, and carving his face since then became a massive form of self mutalation. He eventully started wearing clown make up to try and hide his scars. This explaning the joker persona.Here's from when I originally made the post: https://redd.it/78qb9h (10/25/17)  
&nbsp;  
1. Rey is a clone made from Luke's hand. It was a really cool concept in legends and FFVII.  
2. It's why the lightsaber flew to her in TFA and was calling to her, because it knew her DNA  
3. It's why she knows how to do a bunch of stuff that she shouldn't be able to (before she downloaded her powers from Kylo during the standstill fight on the edge of the cliff in TFA)  
4. Supported in VIII in the cave where the two parents become one, and only show her, in a long line of clones.  
5. Apparently there is concept art for dark Rey, almost exactly like The Force Unleashed II  
5. Helps to explain why Han knew who she was, and why Maz had the lightsaber. Like Luke did it on purpose.  
6. She's a girl because in biology, the safer candidate is female, and she never morphed to male. (I'm kinda reaching with this one, but there is some truth in the rabbit hole)    
7. Could explain why she is severely conflicted with the force, her DNA comes from before Luke sorted his stuff out, and during his most conflicting time in his life.In The Hunger Games, the Capitol picks children from the community to send to their death, in a lottery process known as "The Reaping", highly reminiscent of the [lottery system](https://www.sss.gov/About/History-And-Records/lotter1) used for the Vietnam draft. A lot of young people like Katniss and Peeta were sent to fight, regardless of whether they wanted to. 

The new conscripts are given the "royal treatment", idolized by the press, and congratulated on their sacrifice by the capitol, the wealthy and powerful who will never have to offer their children up to die. They are given a small amount of training knowing full well that many of them are expected to die. Then, they are "deployed" to an unknown land, far away from home, to kill other young people who, much like them, were sent to die by the old and powerful. But once again, the people in command can sit back, and put these young people in danger without ever having to risk anything. 

Catching Fire is "Thank you for your service: the book". It's about how society treats veterans. The returning veterans are given a hero's welcome, and are given heaps of respect and adoration, but their pleas to not let it happen again are ignored. The outsiders (those who haven’t experienced the horror firsthand) keep telling them about how much honor and glory there is in bloodshed, but the people who have been through it know that there’s no honor, it’s just dirty business. They are treated more as objects of fashion than heroes, and the same society that welcomed them home sends them right back into the meat grinder.

Mockingjay is about how politicians treat veterans. Katniss spends this film being shunted from propaganda shoot to propaganda shoot, and serves as president Coin's mouthpiece. Coin proudly holds up Katniss as political currency, using her halfhearted endorsement to curry more favor. 

Ultimately, when Coin proposes a new Hunger Games, Katniss realizes that Coin doesn't give a shit about her, or other survivors. She's just going to send more children to die. Katniss feels used, betrayed, and cast aside. Just like any number of American vets. **Infinity War Spoilers Ahead**

In accordance with Marvel’s incarnation of Thor, this theory draws from a superficial understanding of Norse mythology and applies a heavy creative license.

Somebody \(can’t remember who\) mentioned in an earlier thread that Groot might be related to Yggdrasil, the tree in Norse mythology that connects the nine worlds. I think that’s right, and I think there’s a lot of evidence to support it.

First, let’s look at a couple of important items from Infinity War: ​\*\*\(1\)**​ the fact that Thor “speaks Groot,” and ​**\(2\)\*\*​ Groot’s ability to not only pick up Stormbreaker, but to bind with it**.**

While Thor shrugs off his ability to speak Groot as the result of it being “an elective,” this doesn’t explain why it was an elective in the first place. Given the God of Thunder’s apparent distaste for academia, I doubt that Asgardian royalty—and Odin in particular—would grant Thor free reign over his education. This means that the Groot language made the short list of electives available to the future king, which in turn indicates that it has some particular importance to Asgard.

This importance becomes apparent when Groot picks up the head of Stormbreaker—a weapon far more powerful than Mjolnir and \(presumably\) therefore more exclusive in terms of who can wield it. But then Groot goes even further: he chops off his own arm, and his “flesh” *immediately binds with it*​.

In the MCU, Thor travels through the branches of Yggdrasil when he uses the Bifrost \(as explained in the first Thor movie\). And what is one of the primary powers of Stormbreaker? The ability to use the Bifrost.

*So, why is Groot, a tree of unknown age and origin, capable of binding himself to a weapon that harnesses the power of the Bifrost*?​ **Because Groot is related to—possibly descended from—Yggdrasil.**

This theory finds further support in the way Yggdrasil is characterized and depicted during the Middle Ages. As an initial point, consider the fact that in both the ​*Poetic Edda*​—compiled in the 13th century from earlier sources—and the ​*Prose Edda*​ \(also written in the 13th century\), Yggdrasil is [described as an ash tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil) \(fraxinus excelsior\)​. As shown in this [​photo​](https://imgur.com/4XXwBnw), Groot’s leaves are strikingly similar to those of the European Ash. \(You can tell that it's an ash tree because of the way it is.\)

Groot's appearance when saving the Guardians in GOTG Vol. 1 also has a strong resemblance to a 1515 [​wood engraving](https://imgur.com/e6Y9kPb)​ by Hans Baldung Grien \(the earliest depiction of Yggdrasil I could find\).

All of this taken together makes a strong case for Groot's Asgardian roots. Does this hold any significance for the plot of Avengers 4? I doubt it, but hey, it's still pretty neat.

**Tl;dr:** ​Groot is related to/descended from the magic rainbow tree that helps Thor get around.

Edit: Lots of good points about there being no worthiness enchantment on Stormbreaker. As some others have noted, I drew that conclusion from the fact that Stormbreaker would have "melted the mind" of a less powerful being and took it as evidence of Groot's underlying inherent power—definitely my mistake! However, I don't think this detracts from the fact that Groot's "flesh" immediately binds with Stormbreaker in such a snazzy way.

Edit 2, Part 1: The odds that Thor knows how to speak Groot due to Allspeak seem pretty overwhelming, but I don't think the theory falls apart because of it. Props to those who pointed it out the comments; I believe [u/Omicron\_Squid](https://www.reddit.com/user/Omicron_Squid) was first to the punch. 

Edit 2, Part 2: Electric Boogaloo: I thought I did a good job checking to make sure this theory wasn't old hat, but it seems I am not as good at searching the internet as I thought. As noted by [u/mybustersword](https://www.reddit.com/user/mybustersword) in the comments, an earlier version offering similar film\-based evidence was posted by [u/hockeytalkie](https://www.reddit.com/user/hockeytalkie) 27 days ago, and mad props are in order for these right proper film detectives who thought of the premise quite awhile back: [u/waffleterritory](https://www.reddit.com/user/waffleterritory) \(1 year ago\), and [u/Walkersnotzombies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Walkersnotzombies) \(10 months ago\).

Bruce Willis was born in 1955, only a few years younger than actual Vietnam vets (he played one himself in In Country), and guys born in the 1950s, like my Dad, were more likely to be to be the sons of World War II veterans than Vietnam veterans. Butch's father was taken prisoner after being shot down over Hanoi at least 7 years ago before the Captain Koons scene. The actor who plays young Butch, Chandler Lindauer, would have been 7 at the time of filming. Fine, so maybe Butch's father got shot down when his mother was pregnant, and Butch never met his Dad. But if Butch the character is as old as Bruce Willis the actor (there's no indication Bruce Willis is playing a much younger man. Marcellus Wallace indicates his aging) and Pulp Fiction takes place in its present year (1993/1994), then the young Butch scene would take place in 1962 or 1963, and his father captured in 1955 or 1956. In the Eisenhower Administration, the US only had advisers in Vietnam. The first American POW in Vietnam,  Captain [Floyd James Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_James_Thompson), wasn't captured until 1964.

I see four options.

A. In this fictional world, the United States entered Vietnam in a more active capacity much earlier.

B. Butch is much younger than Bruce Willis

C. Pulp Fiction takes place some time after 1994

D. It's a simple factual error.

Boxing can make aging rough, but Butch's age is a major thematic and plot factor, so I don't think he is supposed to be ten years or so younger than Bruce Willis was at the time of filming. He definitely appears to be over 30. There is little to indicate that the movie takes place in the future either.

Pulp Fiction does appear to take place in the same universe as Inglourious Basterds, and I'm not just talking about Red Apple cigarettes.  Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz is the father of Lee Donowitz, the producer Alabama and Clarence tried to sell cocaine to. Alabama at one point was the partner of Mr. White. Mr. Blonde/Vic Vega is the brother of Vincent Vega. So we know that in this world there is an alternate military history already, with the United States undergoing a more brazen attempt to assassinate Hitler and Nazi higher ups in a crowded theater. It's not too far fetched, then, to suppose the following military history would be different was well. I can't say exactly how it would have played out. Maybe the United States killing Hitler would have made them appear far more dominant than the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, emboldening them in The Cold War, and they entered Vietnam in a more active role far sooner, bombing Hanoi as far back as 1955.So I've heard the references to the novel's metaphors (Raptor taxonomy being purposely incorrect, Hammond's Elephant, The Dragon Curve, and others) as well as the movie's references (The seatbelts, the flea-circus, "spared no expense!", etc) BUT, i've never heard anyone mention the Sea Bass.  


Chilean Sea Bass is a marketing term first used in the 1980's for the sale of Patagonian Toothfish; a decidedly less sexy name for a fish. Toothfish is in no way related to Sea Bass, but does have somewhat similar characteristic to Sea Bass - being a slightly oily, semi-firm fish. Because of the cost of Sea Bass, Chilean Sea Bass was a popular alternative that had quickly become a hot-buy at a steep cost; ironically for a less than ideal fish.  


So "Spare No Expense" Hammond was serving a cheaper alternative to real Sea Bass that has no actual relation to REAL Sea Bass at all. Yes, John Hammond was serving up a phony with a fancy name and everyone was LITERALLY eating it up - except for Ellie; who was visibly repulsed by the meal and interestingly enough, was the first person to openly question the integrity of the creations themselves (While Malcom questioned if the park itself would fail, Dr. Sadler was the only person to state that the eating of local fauna was questionable behavior for the "dinosaurs") Ellie was both figuratively and literally unable to stomach Hammond's lies.From the newly released trailer, we see that Mysterio will be the main antagonist of the film but seems to be acting as a hero in the film's first act. The majority of speculation suggests that Mysterio is actually the mastermind behind the "villains" he is stopping, a trick he uses in the comics as well. 

I think that the theme of the film will center around what kind of heroes Spider-Man and Mysterio are. As we see in the beginning of the film, Spider-Man is loved and adored. He swings around Manhattan, attends charity events, and has even gotten his haters to become his biggest fans (Flash). Mysterio is then introduced and shown as being better than Spidey. He'll stop the elemental creatures with ease and Peter Parker will have trouble keeping up.

When Mysterio is revealed to truly be up to villainous acts, he will address Spider-Man's positive fame. He'll try to convince Peter that being seen as a hero is better than the heroic acts themselves. "Show them what they want to see" rather than "actually save the day". Peter will struggle with how the public sees him (and the new hero, Mysterio), wanting to both do what is right and get the positive credit for it.

In the film's climax, Spider-Man and Mysterio will battle. It will be a different kind of battle than we are used to seeing, however. Mysterio, through his true power of trickery, will create an illusion that makes Spider-Man look like the villain. Peter will have to make a very "Dark Knight" choice: protect himself to continue being the heroic superstar he is seen as back in New York, or sacrifice his public image to do the right thing and become the hero that he truly is.

Ending the film with the news/media hating him seems like a fitting transition into a third movie and introduces one of the biggest problems that classic Spider-Man deals with in the comics. It sets the groundwork for J. Jonah Jameson and the Daily Bugle, Norman Osborne's anti-Spider-Man stance, and a redemption arch for the third film. [Scene](http://24.media.tumblr.com/1d4d710f29756696ae421b5be8132f96/tumblr_n6pjcknvxT1rp0vkjo1_500.gif)

In the scene above, it looks like Imhotep degenerates a bit when he kisses Evy, and I've wondered why this happens for a long time. I watched the film again the other day and something finally clicked with me.

He's not fully restored at this point, he's still got to suck the life out of one last poor fucker. So he only has a limited amount of skin he can use to cover his body. Now, we're all adults here, and we know what happens when a guy kisses a hot girl. Imhotep can control a lot of stuff, but simple human biology isn't one of them, and there's another part of his body that can use that skin for better things.&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**  The villains in *Spider-man: No way home* were pulled from their universes at the moment before they became unredeemable. After talking to Dr. Octopus, Peter realizes that all these “villains” can be saved before committing their most terrible crimes.  All except the Green Goblin, he is too far gone. This is why Peter wants to take the box from Dr. Strange. He is trying to give them a second chance.

**Speculation:**

Spider-man has fantastic villains. The reason that they are great is that they are (mostly) relatable. They are often people motivated by loss, pain, and circumstances beyond their control.

* Dr. Oct caused an accident that killed his wife; the now sentient arms controlled him. Making him a murderer
* Sandman just wanted to see his family and had an accident turning him into sand
* The lizard was trying to protect innocent people by taking the serum himself.
* Electro was in a terrible accident and is made a villain on public T.V by his

Hero.

None of these people are bad people, just people at the wrong time in their life. This is what Peter will see. These are all people that need help before they commit their greatest crimes.

So.. in the new trailer, we see that Spidey and Dr. Strange have captured Dr.Octopus. Dr. Strange tells Peter that these villains are fated to be killed by Spider-man. He also tells Peter what they will do in the future in their universes. Peter decides to save them by ensuring they do not follow through with the crimes they can't come back from. He stands up for them, and he is in his current predicament,  as a man on trial for murder,  understands them.

**Uncle Otto?**

Dr. Octopus is the primary catalyst for change, once removed from his own universe, has a moment of clarity. He realizes that the Peter Parkers of the world are just teenagers with good intentions. Dr. Strange deactivates the arms, and their control over him is lost. Otto is himself again. Peter connects with Dr. Oct when he is imprisoned. Dr. Oct again becomes a mentor, but this time to our Peter Parker. Ironically, Dr. Octopus could be our universes, Uncle Ben.

**Too far gone**

But I think that one villain can not be saved; the film still needs an Antagonist after all. The Green Goblin has been a staple in the Spider-man films as a damn near-perfect Villain to Peter. Norman Osborne is too far gone, and his literal first act as the Green Gobin is killing a lab assistant.

The transformation into the Green Goblin is not a tragedy, accident, or sacrifice but an attempt to land a military contract. He was motivated by greed and power, and he was not a victim of his experiments but a consequence.

**Why it works**

The Spider-man villains, except for the Green Goblin, are not bad guys, just people doing bad things and corrupted by forces outside of their control. This would show the compassion of our web-slinger and his ability to see other people's perspectives—a trait of a true Hero.

The movie could tie in the theme that we all need a second chance, just like our Peter Parker. Parker could send these villains back to their universes changed and change those universes. Maybe in those worlds, Maguire and Garfield’s Spider-men have their happily ever afters. Perhaps this makes Holland’s Spider-man the ultimate Spider-man?

[Spider-Man: No Way Home - New Trailer Breakdown and Marvel Easter Eggs Analysis - Den of Geek](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/spider-man-no-way-home-new-trailer-breakdown-marvel-easter-eggs-analysis/)So I've subscribed to the theory that the MCU we've witnessed is basically one of those fractured timelines where Cap always went back in time and there was basically always two versions of Cap - the one we've watched this whole time and the one that went back in time and lived his life peacefully with Peggy. We've seen regular Cap from The First Avenger through Endgame, but where has Time Traveler Cap been? Sure he's keeping a low profile, but it feels like retconning rather than fitting a larger vision over the past 22 movies. **What if he's been in every single MCU movie since the start?** 

My theory is that Stan Lee has been representing Time Traveler Cap this whole time as an old man who can't help but be near the trouble. Stan Lee obviously looks nothing like the older version of Cap that we see at the end of Endgame, but I think that's more of a symptom of how the MCU perceived this old man until we finally realized who he was. This would tie in where Time Traveler Cap has been during all of these events while also give a little extra meaning to every Stan Lee cameo. Obviously this is crazy far-fetched, but it gives the movies a beautiful little bow on top at the end of this incredible saga so I'm just gonna believe it whether or not it's true :)(TLDR at the bottom if you just want to see the evidence)

When I first saw the movie, I thought it was weird that Starlord, Drax, and Nebula were able to take such a direct blast from the power stone without dying, especially since the first guardians movie made it clear that this gem can destroy entire planets.

Now in fairness Thanos does show he can control the degree of the power and uses it to brush away 3 people on earth without any sign of using the soul stone,

However on Titan, right after he snapped out of the hypnosis, he was angrier than at any other point of the movie, and therefore seemed to lose control more than at any other time. Throwing the moon being the pinnacle of that rampage.

But many have pointed out how gentle he was in the second half of the movie, how he seemed to go out of his way to not kill people on Titan or Earth because he wanted the snap to decide.

But I think having come close to losing the gauntlet he lost control and pushed out a blast from the power gem more than what he meant to.

Which is why....

TLDR:  directly after he drops the two guardians and nebula with the blast from the power stone, it cuts to the shot where Iron Man attacks with a blade. At the very beginning of that shot, in a blink and you'll miss it moment, you can see that the soul stone is **glowing**

And not just a little bit but clearly activated.
There's no other reason for it to be activated at that moment unless it was to keep those 3 alive since they fell so limp it looked like he basically killed them.

I'll try to upload the shot and put it in the comments but it's not 100% undebatable that the soul stone is activated. Once you see the picture and check the footage yourself, you'll see its true. I've watched the movie over 100 times now but only noticed this because I was basically going through shot by shot to get good drawing references.

Edit: Oh Snap! (Phew I lived) comicbook.com did an article on this thread and even linked to it!
I showed my mom! She thinks I'm famous! 

https://comicbook.com/marvel/amp/2019/01/23/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-soul-stone-star-lord-drax-theory/Not so much a theory, just an observation. I haven’t seen anyone discuss this before.

Tony/Iron-Man: Mind - arguably the smartest Avenger, also figured out how to use the mind stone.

Thor: Space - he comes from a different/far away place, travels through the Bifrost which acts similarly to the space stone.

Hulk: Power - “Hulk like raging fire”

Cap: Time - he has lived in and experienced different eras, essentially traveling through time. He rues the time he has lost, and he experienced Peggy’s life as being fast-forwarded. 

Natasha/Black Widow: Reality - this one is the toughest argument to make, but I think her experience with the Red Room has made her consider what could have been (other realities). Also, her tendency to see both sides/switch sides (like in Civil War) demonstrates her ability to consider the complexity of reality.

Clint/Hawkeye: Soul - heart and soul of the team, often has to sacrifice loved ones (figuratively, by leaving his family) to do what he believes in.

EDIT: Of course this isn’t a perfect 1 to 1, and you could switch a lot of them around depending on different aspects of the characters. This was just for fun, and I’ve enjoyed reading other people’s interpretations. Keep in mind that these were shower thoughts, not a thesis lol.TL,DR: Tom Hagen talks Sonny down from killing Sollozzo and gives solid reasons why, Michael reintroduces the idea of the assassination and convinces everyone he can do it, then with a ton of seriousness and conviction gives Sollozzo an out if he can guarantee his father’s safety from now on. Sollozzo balks and seals his own fate.

Long version:

Tensions run high after the attempted assassination of Don Corleone, and the scene opens with Sonny telling Michael that Sollozzo wants to meet with him specifically for a "proposition" (of course Sollozzo wants to avoid hot-head Sonny). Tom is actively working to try to talk down Sonny from murdering Sollozzo, that "Some of the other Families won't sit still for all-out war" and "Your father wouldn't want to hear this, this is business, it's not personal Sonny", “Even shooting your father was business, not personal Sonny!”. Sonny finally agrees: "Alright. We’ll wait", especially after Tom says McCluskey the police captain is Sollozzo's bodyguard and that killing him is an impossibility, that "The Corleone Family would be outcasts. Even the old man's political protection would run for cover." Note that these are all valid points. Tom is the even, cool-headed thinker.

Michael then offers up not to wait, which leads him to saying he'll carry out the assassination himself. This is met with reservation but ultimately Michael convinces everyone it needs to be done. Keep in mind that up until this point, Michael has not been part of the whole mob thing, never himself intended to be a part of it, and was not intended by his family to go into (it is mentioned he will go into politics and work that angle). While Michael is considered a war hero due to being wounded, there's no indication Michael has ever killed anyone face to face, so this would be his first time.

So the following famous scene starts with Michael being picked up at Dempsey's and Sollozzo opens saying he wants to "straighten everything out..." and "It shouldn't have happened." Michael responds "We'll straighten everything out tonight, I don't want my father bothered anymore", Sollozzo swears on his children he won't be. Now, of course Michael still intends to kill Sollozzo at this point, but Sollozzo does come out of the gate strong by swearing on his children regarding Don Corleone's safety.

Now what's interesting is the [conversation once they are in the restaurant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQqv2UuvC0&t=10s). Sollozzo again opens with an "I'm sorry", insisting it was just business, that it wasn't personal, how he wants to work through things. Michael tries to fumble the convo in Italian but then says in English quite seriously: "What I want, what is most important to me, is that I have a guarantee. No more attempts on my father's life." Now Michael saying this is almost bizarre to me. You have Sollozzo pleading with Michael to try to keep the peace and move forward, more to try to calm down Sonny too (which was all Tom’s advice), and really Michael could have just been stone face about it, or said I'll see what I can do, and then gone through with the deed as intended.

So why would Michael ask for the guarantee? Perhaps because he was listening to Tom's convincing dialogue in the previous scene that the peace be kept until a better option opens itself up. Perhaps Michael is hesitating at the shitstorm that will occur if a police captain is killed along with this mobster and what that means for himself and his family. Keep in mind Tom is like a brother to them and the most well respected aside from Don Corleone. Him trying to back Sonny off from killing Sollozzo is with some solid rationale, not to mention Michael has never killed anyone (especially not in cold blood).

Now, my theory, is that if Sollozzo had repeated once again, swearing on his children, insisting it would never happen, that Michael would have made the decision to not move forward with the assassination, that he would have pursued the Tom Hagen route to short term peace. Keep in mind the whole point of the assassination was due to Don Corleone being difficult about taking mob business in a particular direction. Of course a peaceful middle ground could be reached. It's just business. Don't let it get personal, even if it is your father. What's best for business? Look at Michael's face at 1:53 to 2:05 when he asks for the guarantee of safety; Michael is not an actor and he is being dead serious in his request. But what Sollozzo says triggers Michael and seals his own fate:

"What guarantees could I give you Mike? I am the hunted one. I missed my chance. You think too much of me kid. I'm not that clever. All I want is a truce."

What a slap in the face to Michael. From apologizing, to swearing on his children to no more harm to his father, to wanting to move forward, to now suddenly saying he can't guarantee his father's safety, and to add insult to injury, insisting that he is now the victim 'cause he didn't properly assassinate his dad. Look at the fire in Michael's eyes at 2:10 - 2:13, with the subtle eye movement to the throat that seems to say "You're done."; any chance of Sollozzo salvation is now gone. And Michael's literal next line, trying his hardest to push away the anger, is: "I have to go to the bathroom."October 1992: *Homer The Heretic* airs and ends with Homer talking to God.

http://i.imgur.com/uwHdZLM.jpg

**Homer:** God, I gotta ask you something. What's the meaning of life?  
**God:** Homer, I can't tell you that.  
**Homer:** C'mon!  
**God:** You'll find out when you die.  
**Homer:** I can't wait that long!  
**God:** You can't wait six months?  
**Homer:** No, tell me now!  
**God:** Well, ok. The meaning of life is…

April 1993 (SIX MONTHS LATER): *So It’s Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show* airs and involves Bart’s April Fools prank inadvertently putting Homer into the hospital, where he is then crushed by a vending machine and put in a coma.

Now the episode ends with Homer waking up (and giving us a hilarious POV shot of him choking Bart), but it seems to be too convenient and sudden.

http://i.imgur.com/9GYMplw.jpg

I propose that Homer didn’t actually wake up from his coma. He is still in a vegetative state and every single Simpsons episode afterwards is in Homer’s imagination.

This is why the characters don’t age. Homer remembers Bart, Lisa, and Maggie as 10, 8, and 1 year old, so they will always appear that way in his dreams. He is subconsciously aware of time passing, so his mind will often “update” his memories so that the year they occurred matches up with the age he thinks he is (eg. *That 90’s Show* contradicting other flashback episodes).

While the characters’ ages don’t change, the events happening to the Simpsons definitely did. The plots of episodes following the April Fools show are far zanier than beforehand. Let’s compare, shall we?

**Plot Examples Before April 1993**  
Bart cheats on an IQ test  
Homer tries to give up drinking  
Marge considers cheating on Homer  
Lisa has a crush on her teacher  

Yes, there were some wacky plots, but overall fairly mundane stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary for most people.

**Plot Examples After April 1993**  
Homer goes into outer space  
Principal Skinner is revealed as an imposter  
Mr. Burns captures the Loch Ness Monster  
Homer works for a supervillain who takes over the eastern US  
Bart and Homer buy a racehorse and discover the secret land of jockeys  
Also, celebrity after celebrity after celebrity  

This is clearly Homer’s imagination running wild. With no real world restrictions, Homer’s mind is able to dream up scenarios of him and his family in fantasies involving him winning a Grammy, his father fighting his boss for buried WW2 treasure, his wife getting breast implants, his infant daughter saving him from drowning, etc.

The massive amounts of celebrity appearances are easily explained as well. People in comas can sometime hear what people in the same room are saying. While Homer wouldn’t physically react, his mind processes that information and includes it in his dreams.

Maybe the nurse leaves the radio on and Homer hears a Lady Gaga song. Suddenly:

http://i.imgur.com/4C0817Q.jpg

His family visits and talk with each other about the new Mel Gibson movie they’re going to be seeing after leaving the hospital. Next thing you know:

http://i.imgur.com/nzyS4my.gif

And so on.

There’s one last thing I want to leave you with. Going back to Homer’s conversation with God, what is the meaning of life? Or at least Homer’s life? Well life can have different meaning for different people and a purpose or reason for one’s existence can be as unique as their fingerprints. For Homer, his grand purpose is obvious – he is here to entertain. His dreams, his imaginative adventures, have provided billions with amusement and will continue to do so for decades.

Not bad for a dumb overweight loudmouth.

EDIT: This got really big. I'm getting messages about it making the news in Australia, Belgium, and other places. It made the front page of Yahoo, and TMZ even got a statement from Al Jean about my theory. He says it's not true, but what does he know about the Simpsons?Is Vader the Loki of star wars?

**Tl:DR: Anakin Skywalker did not balance the force in one grand act but by a lifetime of forcing others to become heroes in the force.**  Luke, Leia, Yoda, Obi-wan, Ahsoka, Ezra all share one major thing in common. Anakin Skywalker. This one person forces each of these people to become heroes and connect with the force in stronger ways and reach their true destinies. what if his true destiny fulfilled is not his final moment of heroism but his lifetime of evil.

>***Mobius to Loki :***  
>  
> ***You weren't born to be king. You were born to cause pain and suffering and death. That's how it is, that's how it was, that's how it will be. All so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves.***

Like Loki in the marvel universe, Vader's biggest contribution is to help others reach their true destiny by being a life-changing obstacle. He's essentially a hero tester, a litmus of persons ultimate resolve

**The Theory:**

I know, talking about the balancing of the force is a surefire way to get everyone all riled up but let’s look at this as more of a thought experiment. If you think about it, this does make a little sense… from a certain point of view.

**Trail by fire.**

Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one prophesied to balance the force, and he did by killing the Emporer and perishing himself. What if his true destiny fulfilled is not his final moment of heroism but his lifetime of evil.

**For there to be a great good, there must be a great evil.**

All heroes of classic literature and fantasy need a villain to defeat, an adversary to their cause. Vader is this villain to so many star wars characters that it is impossible to ignore the fact. That many characters are heroes because Vader forces them to rise above and beyond. Yoda is a perfect example. Anakin’s fall and the fall of the Jedi temple forces Yoda to retreat to Dagobah and connect with the force in a stronger way than before. This gives him the ability to lead luke to become a person attuned to the force that will bring the end of the empire.

Luke himself is a hero and a leader in the force because he had to rise above to combat Vader. Obi-wan finds his true destiny guiding luke but then becomes more powerful in death than he ever was in life.

Ahsoka is the true example of this idea. She becomes a person defined by Vader and Anakin. She is trained by Anakin but Tested by Vader. She finds the true path of the force when Anakin and the council force her to reject the Jedi order and seek the force on her own terms, but even though she finds her independence in the force. Anakin/Vader is the catalyst of her journey. Everything she has had to overcome is tied to Anakin/Vader.

**Evil Hero**

So in a weird way, Vader, at his most evil, is a spark for good; he is the pressure that forces heroes where there is none. He is the necessary evil to create the essential good.

\*originally posted to r/starwarsspeculation, but I felt like this was a better home for it
https://www.starwars.com/databank/anakin-skywalkerAnd here we go again. 

With Thor 4, Love and thunder well on its way,  We have a bit of a problem to address. If Natalie Portman is going to get the power of Thor as in the comics, then we need Thor’s mighty hammer, Mjolnir, back. As it stands, Cap returned Mjolnir to the original timeline, Hela shattered it again, leading to Thor getting Stormbreaker again. Everything is back to where it is supposed to be. The hammer has to follow the same path to keep the events leading to Ragnarok.  Both cap and thor know that the hammer has to be returned or there is no stormbreaker, no wakanda rescue . The hammer must go back .

But then how can Jane Foster get her hands on that hammer? A hammer that is integral to the story moving forward if they use the cancer storyline from the comics. Well, I think the answer is simple.

Captain America switched the hammer out with a fake.


So for Jane foster to claim the hammer and get the power of Thor, I believe the hammer has to survive. But how?  So I think I have the answer. Cap goes back to the events of Thor: Ragnarok and making a  quick switch.  Perhaps at Dr. Strange’s mansion,  He secretly gives Thor the replica, and that’s the hammer Hela shatterers. In reality, though, Cap has kept the hammer for decades, until the events of Love and thunder. Cap preserves the timeline while still keeping the hammer. I believe this movie will start with old Cap giving the hammer to Thor or Jane foster. I imagine a scene with old Captain America saying,” I think this belongs to you “as he hands the real Mjolnir back.  

There are inherently  going to be plot holes in this theory for sure. How come the hammer does not come to him when he calls? or how can Cap get his hand on a believable replica? But the fact remains that Jane Foster will need Mjolnir to start her transformation. i dont know if reforging Mjolnir will keep Odin's blessing intact.  Perhaps the hammer is reforged with Captain America going back to find the pieces. 
I like to think that Thor would want to find a way to save his most valuable possession. And perhaps with a little help from cap they can save it whether  its from time travel or collecting the pieces.

I know this has a ton of holes but Jane does have to end up with the hammer at some point so let's figure this out together.

What do you think?   In the Season one episode of Community (S01E04 "[Social Psychology](https://youtu.be/ObA_n7pjp8A)"), The experimentees are told they will have to wait for the experiment to begin. However the true experiment is to see the reaction of the participant when they give up and storm off. Annie is surprised to see [Senior Chang](https://youtu.be/ObA_n7pjp8A?t=65) in attendance. He then explains how he could use the 80 bucks. When they are told the will have to wait Chang immediately [blows up](https://youtu.be/ObA_n7pjp8A?t=76) and storms off. We are supposed to think that this is because of how unhinged Chang is. My theory is that he knew the true goal of the test the entire time. He gave them exactly what they wanted the exact moment the test began.

We assume he got paid (he did participate fully) $80 for doing 30 seconds of acting. It is said that this psych lab happens every year. We don't know if it is this exact experiment. But he refers to it as  "The Duncan Principle" and he seems to know the outcome before they start. So it is a good bet that this has happened at least once before. 

   Chang being a teacher would have seen this done before and would see a quick and easy 80 bucks. Duncan may even have a deal with him....drop out immediately to show the others that it acceptable to freak out violently.This was probably just a mistake from the developers but I tried to come up with a lore-friendly reason why there is still fresh food in ancient dungeons.

The crypts are enchanted or cursed which causes all the corpses in there to stay alive. These corpses become the draugr. So if the draugr are being artificially kept alive for longer, this could also apply to the food. It stays fresh because it is under the same enchantment as the draugr. 

Pretty simple but it does explain the flawed logic of finding food in the crypts. Hope this helps.Kenny McCormick dies every early episode of South Park. The McCormick family is shown to have one older brother Kevin and Kenny. In the end of season 5, Kenny died from a muscular disease and stayed dead for a season, to appear casually at the end of season 6. 

Later on the McCormick family has a little girl, sometimes she’s really young and sometimes older. It is later confirmed her name is Karen and Kenny is super protective of her. 

It is shown that Kenny comes back because Mrs McCormick gives birth to him and he grows overnight. Was Mrs McCormick pregnant with Karen, which caused Kenny to stay dead for 9 months? Does Kenny die less because he’s being more responsible and caring for his younger sister?

Edit: My first award ever. Thank you! This speaks to me being a big South Park nerd. I’ll show up to accept it dressed like Jennifer Lopez while high on acid.**First off, this theory is about the original X-men movie Trilogy. I know there are other movies within the Fox-verse, but all the time travel makes it way too complicated.**

The obvious question then is *why* Xavier decides to do this.

**Xavier is making his group of mutants appear as a more mild, reasonable alternative to Magneto's forces.**

It's actually a surprisingly common tactic among civil rights movements. For example, during the Women's suffrage movement in the US, Alice Paul led a group of "radical" feminists, who wanted crazy things like equal pay. Meanwhile, another group led by Carrie Chapman Catt essentially worked as a foil to them, and achieved massive amounts of success by using far more mild tactics. All of a sudden, due to Alice Paul, women getting the right to vote, which had been seen as incredibly radical just a few years previously, now seemed like the most *mild* possible reform.

Xavier's plan is simple: he stirs up fear in the public using the Brotherhood of Evil mutants, then he has his own X-men come in and save the day. Xavier is sending a simple message to humans: You. Need. Us. If the X-Men get shut down, then humanity is basically doomed. The only way to stop the scary evil mutants is to treat the nice, helpful mutants well, and offer gifts, like a nice new toupee for the follically challenged, or a new chess set... or equal rights or whatever.

**A clue to this comes in Professor X's first chess game with Magneto**

The notable part in this scene is Magneto's final move: surrender. He's tipping over his piece, and letting Charles win... which is odd, since about two seconds before that, he'd been talking about how he'd never give up his goals. The chess game is the most constant metaphor for their relationship, so why create such a discrepancy? Simple: The entire conversation is being monitored by the prison. Chess is a simple way to pass messages, as well as likely through telepathy. Magneto is signalling to Charles that he's still on board, and that he's allowing him to win. Just like in the chess game, the X-men probably could win without Magneto's help, but he makes it easier and cleaner.

Another important detail from the game: *Charles sacrificed his queen*. It's the most powerful piece on the board, and second most important. His "king" is obviously his goal of having mutants and humans live together, but what is the queen? His own life... which he "sacrificed" in the Last Stand.

**Another piece of evidence for this is Charles's inconsistent use of his powers**

It's one of his big things: He won't use his powers on others, because blah blah blah, moral integrity. *Except for all the times he does so*. Despite how often he talks about "the sanctity of the mind", he was perfectly willing to mind control Sabretooth and Toad, or read Magneto's thoughts. One might argue that those were exceptional cases... except for the time when he went into Wolverine's brain just to screw with him and prove he had powers.

Let's circle back to the part where he controlled Sabretooth and Toad: He was willing to mind control both of them in order to fight Magneto... but then when they show up to attack his students, he won't mind control them then? Or, when the Brotherhood of Evil mutants is setting up a machine that could kill hundreds of thousands, including his student? He won't mind control them *then*?

Or, at the end of X2, when he paralyzes an entire room of newspeople and political advisors, *while the President is giving a live national address*, just so that he and his team can show up, freak the guy out, then disappear? What happened to the sanctity of the human mind *then* Charles?

The reasoning for Xavier's decisions is clear: he only uses his powers when it best suits his plans. He didn't stop Magneto's forces, because he wanted them to succeed in those instances. For all we know, he might have been secretly sabotaging his students a number of times, just to allow his plans to proceed.

**Let's look at all the times they "fought" in order to show why they did so.**

* When Xavier sends his students to "rescue" Rogue and Wolverine, he does so to gain their trust, as well as to try and force them to stay. He has a decent idea of Rogue's powers, but is unaware of their scope, and if they would work for the mutant machine. By making her feel afraid of being attacked, he motivates her to stay in safety.
* When Xavier mind controls Sabretooth at the train station, he makes a large, public attempt to fight off Magneto... then lets him go, in order to protect civilians. He accomplishes two things: One, making himself seem innocent. If he let Rogue go, his other students and Wolverine would be suspicious. Two, he has a big, public affair where he and his X-men are shown to be heroic, and save the lives of a number of police.
* The X-Men sabotaging Magneto's machine creates a massive, public fight where they're shown to save countless lives, preventing a terrorist attack on New York, while *literally defending Liberty itself*. It's basically the perfect PR move, and shows how "necessary" the X-Men are. Xavier was likely faking his coma so that he could monitor events, and nudge them to go the way he wanted. After all, him just mind wiping everyone wouldn't make the world love mutants, since they'd never see it.
* During X2, Xavier is faced with a situation he hadn't directly prepared for, and wasn't able to control. However, he had a clear contingency plan set up. It's no coincidence that Mystique chose to break out Magneto at that *exact* time, or that she "accidentally" stumbled upon the plans for Cerebro 2.0. Xavier was also never mind controlled at any point: how could one little teenager control the most powerful telepath on the planet, who'd just had his powers enhanced tenfold? Charles wanted to send a message to the president: fuck with us again, and maybe my students *don't* decide to save the entire world.
* The Battle on Alcatraz is one of the last pieces of Xavier's plan, and one of the times his cunning is most evident: Of course Charles wants to have a mutant "cure" around. That way, he can remove any mutant who doesn't want to go along with his plans from the equation. Much of the negative image for mutants is caused by supercriminals, or new mutants accidentally killing people when they get their powers. The ability to neutralize them is crucial for Xavier. However, the film brings up that many want to make the "cure" mandatory, which is something Xavier can't allow. He *lets* himself "die", but as we see later on, had a specific plan to keep his brain alive. He does that for two reasons: One, to make sure she'll help Magneto. Two, to sabotage any hope of Jean returning to the X-Men, so that they'll be forced to kill her. She's far too powerful and unpredictable, Xavier can't just let her run around wildly. The entire battle was never supposed to succeed. What Xavier and Magneto *really* wanted was to make a threat: First, if this is how evil mutants respond to the existence of a cure, with a massive invasion and death, trying to pass a law forcing mutants to take it could kill millions. Second, once again, it shows how *vital* the X-Men are. Enough soldiers died to make it clear that they could never hope to stop threats like these on their own. Only Hank McCoy could take down Magneto, only Wolverine could take down Jean.

**And at the end of Last Stand, we see that it all paid off: Mutant rights have been achieved, and they live in harmony with humanity. Charles survived, and Magneto still has his powers, just in secret. Because of Charles's heroic "death" as a martyr, no one would dare question his legacy or investigate further.**

**However, Xavier and Magneto could never allow anyone to know what they were doing.**

All of the X-Men, and all of the Brotherhood (except potentially Mystique) legitimately believe in their cause. Xavier likely "helps" them along with a little psychic nudge here and there; not enough to directly control them, but to make them believe in his ideals, and not question his actions.

That's also why Magneto wears his helmet to block Charles, so that no one will question why Xavier didn't just shut him down.

In addition, when Xavier visits Magneto, he's giving the government hours and hours of footage of himself talking about lofty, noble ideas, while Magneto hates on him. He's obviously covering their asses, but there's more to it: Humans *love* a story like that. John Paul the Second got shot, then went to go find his attempted killer in prison and forgive him. Xavier is portraying himself as a noble hero.

**The final piece of evidence, as well as one of the most obvious, is how ridiculous the situation is.**

Magneto can *control all metal*. Do you really think he needs a "mutant bomb"? If he'd wanted to kill people in New York, he could have just flown over on his little metal disc, and started chucking around cars, tearing down skyscrapers and killing tens of thousands of people in a few minutes. If he'd really wanted Alcatraz gone, he could have just tossed semitrucks at it from a mile away until the island was a smoking crater. Also, he fights a guy with *metal bones*, a man whose powers are controlled by a *metal visor*, and a man in a *metal wheelchair*, but never actually takes the super obvious opportunity... because he doesn't actually want to win.

Instead, Magneto goes for big, obvious plots. Evil invasion of the Statue of Liberty; lifting the Golden Gate Bridge out of the ground and moving it (instead of just, y'know, loading his troops onto a train and flying it over, like he showed he could do, which wouldn't have allowed thousands of soldiers to then arrive super quickly behind him). He does those things because they generate publicity, and scare the public far better than an efficient plot would.

Even Charles's strategy is clear intended for publicity. His students are all wearing form fitting leather suits: completely useless for actual combat, but they look super cool on the front page of every newspaper. It's the same reason why out of all his students, he picks the supermodels for his main team. There are tons of mutants who are covered in scales, or who are living goo. Instead, Xavier chooses the ones who look most human, so as not to scare people.

**TL;DR:**

**Professor X and Magneto are working together in secret. They manipulate all their "fights", so that people will gradually begin to accept mutants, and see them as a necessary part of society. All of "Magneto's" plans are created by both of them together, and are designed for maximum publicity, as well as to send very specific messages.**

Edit: So, apparently someone has accused me of "stealing posts from years ago". Just making it as clear as possible: This is my OC. I wrote this theory over the weekend, and posted it yesterday.With Michael, there is very little dead time. He often calls every single one of his employees in for a meeting or some other nonsense that isn't necessary. At one point they're asked how anything gets done with him and Phyllis says "We find little times throughout the day". This sounds like a joke but I think it's exactly how they do so well. They're constantly on edge because nobody has any idea when Michael will interrupt them again. And they try to squeeze as much work into the day as possible. Also, his distractions probably help to break up the monotony. 

Now, I don't think Michael does this intentionally. When David Wallace asked him his strategies, Michael has zero clue what he was talking about. I think Michael does these things for the reasons he states, however idiotic they might be, or simply to try and create the bizarre workplace he has an ideal of (where everything is fun and everyone is friends with each other), and this unintentionally creates a workplace where people work hard, simply to try and get things done in spite of his methods. I've always wondered why Harry wasn't sent to his maternal grandparents'. James's parents were already dead by the time Harry was orphaned, but I don't think there was ever any definitive fate given to Mr. and Mrs. Evans. And it's not like he wouldn't have been welcome; Petunia describes her parents as being overjoyed that Lily was a witch. Harry's maternal grandparents would've probably accepted him with open arms.

So why didn't they? Only reason I can think of is that they were dead.

But that's really crazy - I mean, Lily and James were only 21 when they died. I know James' parents were older when they had him, but presuming Lily's parents were average-aged, they'd be in their early 50s at most by the time of their daughter's death. Why would they both be dead?

Furthermore, why does Petunia hate Lily so much even after her death? Usually people would become remorseful with survivor's guilt.

Well, my theory is that they Death Eaters came for Lily and Petunia's parents, and probably killed them looking for information on Lily's whereabouts. This is why Harry never went to them, and it's why Petunia remained spiteful toward Lily even after her death - she blames her sister for the loss of her parents.[Video version for those interested](https://youtu.be/l43R56gMJAk)

I posted this [in a thread three months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/3yg83a/the_struggle_of_stan_lee_jr_the_story_behind_the/) in /r/marvelstudios and thought I would share it here too. It's not meant to be serious, just a bit of fun to tie together and rationalise Stan Lee's appearances in the MCU.

* **Captain America** Stan senior is a decorated war veteran and womaniser. He attends an awards ceremony for Steve Rogers in Washington, but Captain America is a no-show.

* **Agent Carter** We see Stan senior post-World War II getting his shoes shined in New York, all whilst browsing the newspaper. He notices he's missing the sports section and politely asks the mustachioed man sat next to him for his. The man agrees. Stan senior later goes missing, leaving behind his son, Stan Jr, who is 23 years old.

* **Daredevil / Jessica Jones** Having served in the Army during WW2, Stan Jr easily acquired a job in the NYPD. He spent the entirety of his career searching for clues on his long lost father, with no success. Shortly before his retirement, at an advanced age, Stan Jr foils a robbery single-handily. The footage (caught on CCTV) of him detaining the thug and exclaiming "Excelsior!" skyrockets him into fame, turning him into an internet sensation over night. As a result, many NYPD stations hang a photo of Stan as a reminder that no cop is ever past his prime.

* **Iron Man** Stan Jr, now a B-list celebrity, is invited to attend Tony Stark's party. Tony doesn't recognise him and  thinks he's Hugh Hefner. Tony later announces himself as Iron Man.

* **Iron Man 2** Annoyed that Tony didn't get his name right, Stan goes to see Tony Stark at the Stark Expo to correct him. Stark gives him a wave, believing him to be Larry King, and walks off without speaking to him.

* **Incredible Hulk** Stan has returned to his home. He drinks some of the Brazil soda Banner manufactures. He gets sick and collapses from gamma poisoning. His family from New Mexico sympathetically buy him a new pick up truck, Stan's passion, as a get well soon gift.

* **Thor** Needing a break after recovering from the poisoning and slightly frustrated with Tony Stark, Stan goes to New Mexico to visit his family to thank them for the truck, which he drives there in. Whilst there, his family invite him to come and see a fresh crater site. No one can pull the satellite out of the epicentre so Stan uses his truck, but the satellite is too heavy and it pulls the back of Stan's new truck off. No it did not work Stan. That satellite is later revealed to be Thor's hammer. When Thor battles the destroyer Stan's pickup is destroyed in the vortex.

* **The Avengers** Quite frankly had enough of 'superheroes' like Thor and Iron Man, Stan Jr returns home to New York City to get a break. Much to his dismay, Stark has Stark tower built and eventually the battle of New York takes place. A survivor of the attack, Stan is interviewed by some of the press whilst sat out playing chess. How does he feel about New York's saviours? "Superheroes in New York? Give me a break...".

* **Iron Man 3** A B-list celebrity slowly fading into obscurity, Stan Jr is invited to take part in the televised Miss Chattanooga beauty pageant. He is a judge on panel and gives generously throughout the event, scoring 9s and 10s for every contestant. He only finds out after the show that Tony Stark had also been there and stole the broadcast signal for himself, Stan Jr's chance to regain some fame was taken away by Stark again. Stark must have been following him.

* **Thor 2** In an attempt to get really far away from Stark and any other superheroes, Stan Jr heads to London, England. Fueled by happiness that he's away from the superheroes (and alcohol) he goes out on the night and has a great time, but gets taken into police custody over night because he gets a bit too drunk. It is there in the police station he has his shoe stolen by none other than Erik Selvig, a key player in the Battle of New York. Later that same week Thor shows up and has a battle with another alien. Stan isn't happy, these guys just won't leave him alone.

* **Agents of SHIELD** If England was too close, Italy could be far enough to escape superheroes. He takes a train through Europe where he comes across a bespectacled father and daughter who seem to be arguing about the father's life choices. Stan over hears the whole thing and immediately scorns the father, and tells him that he should be ashamed.

* **Captain America 2** Now low on money, Stan has to find a small time job to help him pay the bills. He returns to the US and moves to Washington DC, where he can share an apartment with an old friend, and becomes a security guard on the night shift working at the Smithsonian. A couple of months into his shift the Captain America costume is stolen from its exhibit... "I'm so fired" he says. And he was.

* **Guardians of the Galaxy** On the planet of Xandar, whilst searching for bounties, Rocket spots an old man enjoying the company of a woman. Its none other than Stan Lee senior, still womanising 70 years on after disappearing, seemingly now upgraded with alien technology allowing for longevity of life. "Where's your wife old man?" Probably dead, Rocket...

* **Avengers: Age of Ultron** After defrosting, Steve Rogers caught up with his old friends from the war. Stan Jr was one of these friends. He receives an invite to a party hosted by Tony in the newly finished Avengers Tower which he accepts, planning to use it as an opportunity to finally speak his mind to Tony and Thor. He soon takes on the challenge of drinking a drink not meant for mortal men to show Thor who's boss. He's later seen very drunk slurring popular catch phrases whilst being escorted out of the building.

* **Ant-Man** Feeling bad for allowing him to get so drunk, Steve helps Stan find a new job as a bartender. There, at his new job, he is quizzed by a gentlemen regarding the attractiveness of the woman he is with. Stan agrees with the man that she is indeed "crazy-stupid fine".

*Edit: Thanks for the gold! And thank you for helping my video do so well! Holy crap! You guys are fantastic!:D*So I re-watched the episode where Rick & Morty removed their toxicities. Halfway through the episode Rick noted that the targeted toxins were whatever each individual *perceived* as the toxic parts of their personality. We saw that Rick's perceived toxicities were his god complex, misanthropy, and his love for Morty. We saw that Morty's perceived toxicities were his low self-esteem and doubts.

Once Morty had his toxins removed, the Non-Toxic Morty applied his hyper-intelligence to become an incredibly successful Wall Street prodigy and was able to evade Rick and even see through Rick's plan with Jessica's call (to an extent). This shows that Morty is hyper-intelligent like Rick when his self-esteem issues are fixed. He is a sort of sleeping giant.

We know that Rick puts Morty down *a lot* throughout the series. I believe this is because Rick knows that Morty's low self-esteem is the only thing keeping him from becoming capable, independent, and dangerous to Rick. Recall that Rick said at the end of Evil Morty's first episode, "a cocky Morty can lead to some real problems..." Rick puts Morty down largely to suppress his capabilities. 

Rick takes this a step further by meticulously taking all of Morty's memories of Rick being wrong i.e. the memory about Morty teasing Rick about not knowing the word "granted". This is a critical method Rick uses to keep Morty's self-esteem low. Morty believes his independent thoughts/actions from Rick are almost "always wrong" because Rick removes memories that support the contrary.

This makes the Rick-Morty relationship in every dimension far more intriguing. Rick constantly puts Morty down and removes his memories as a survival strategy. At the same time, Rick considers his love for Morty to be a toxic weakness within himself... because he knows confident, independent Morties (like Evil Morty) are the only beings in each dimension that can outmatch Ricks.  

"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."In Infinity War, Thanos has the gauntlet made in Nidavellir. When he does the Snap, the Gauntlet was damaged for some reason. He didn't struggle a lot as compared to wielding the Stark Gauntlet with all Infinity stones in Endgame. But the Stark gauntlet doesn't get damaged even though Hulk snapped using it. I think the Nidavellir-made Gauntlet which is a strong metal absorbed some of the powers of the Stones resulting in the damage of the Gauntlet when the Snap occurred. But the Stark gauntlet which is made of Earth metals cannot hold the power of stones so the power of the stones directly affects the user and Hulk damaged his arm. In this way, making a vibranium gauntlet would be more efficient and the damage done to the user would have been less.We're going to jump back and fourth in the song to piece this one together, so let's start here:

> It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

> You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older

> But the meteor men beg to differ

> Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

This set of lines explicitly establishes the song as being about global warming, directly referencing the hole in the Ozone layer. You're going to need warm clothes now, but you sure won't years from now.

> The ice we skate is getting pretty thin

The ice we skate refers to the melting ice caps and will eventually flood everything. 

Okay now, let's back up a little bit in the song:

> Didn't make sense not to live for fun

This line begins to lay out Smashmouth Guy's life philosophies that he has gained from the realization that the earth is doomed. If earth is destroyed, all that we have created, all of our legacy as a culture, is lost. This may not happen during his lifetime, but in Shmouthguy's mind, any attempt to create meaning is pointless since it will eventually be destroyed, so the only thing that makes sense is to live for fun and get as much enjoyment out of his existence as possible. Later in the song, he uses this line again, preceded by:

> Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming

> Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

Not only is Smashmouth Guy confronting earth's demise, but also his own inherent mortality. Even if global warming wasn't going to destroy everything, he still knows that his time is limited and decides to "hit the ground running" because that makes his life pleasurable.

Now, let's jump to right after "The ice we skate is getting pretty thin." We've got: 

> The waters getting warm, so you might as well swim

> My world's on fire how about yours

> That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Saying that you "might as well" swim because the water's getting warm enforces Smashmouth Guy's philosophy of living for fun. Nothing is going to matter in the grand scheme of things, so you might as well just have fun. The line "My world's on fire, how bout yours" is both literal and metaphorical, referencing the burning world, but also how his own worldview has been shattered and burned down by the realizations he has come to. In the line "That's the way I like it, and I never get bored", Smashmouth Guy acknowledges that he has come to terms with all of this. Even if universe does not remember him, he enjoys the freedom that his realization has given him. By realizing that nothing matters, Smashmouth guy can live the life he wants to without fear of repercussions in the very long run.

During the break between verses, we hear in the background: 

> Go for the moon

> Go for the moon

> Go for the moon

> Go for the moon

Although the Mouth-Man has come to terms with his own situation, he still feels sympathy for those who have not. "Go for the moon" is his plea that in order for humanity to survive, we colonize other planets and get away from the dying world we inhabit.

Now, let's hop back to the beginning: 

> Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

> I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

> She was looking kind of dumb, with her finger and her thumb

> In the shape of an 'L' on her forehead

The people who tell Smashmouth Guy that the world is gonna roll him and that he ain't the sharpest tool in the shed are actually the unenlightened ones. They look at his seemingly shallow, pleasure-seeking life and condemn him for not having higher aspirations, but really Smashman is the only enlightened one and they are the fools. Note that the person with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead is the one who is said to look "kind of dumb"

Now, let's jump near the end:

> Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas

> I need to get myself away from this place

> I said, Yep, what a concept

> I could use a little fuel myself

> And we could all use a little change

The 'Mouth needs a little fuel himself because he also needs to get himself away from this place, as none of the people around him believe what he is saying. He wants to find a place where like-minded people embrace the same lifestyle he does, which would be much more fun than living around the people he currently does. "We could all use a little change" means that society would benefit from a paradigm shift and realize it's true situation. The "little fuel" could also refer to rocket fuel, which would enable humanity to "go to the moon."

And that's it! Hopefully we've all gained a new respect for this deep, spectacular song. Smashmouth is the true all-star for trying to get us to realize that we are all doomed.I don't have much evidence for this, but I think it's possible. Bill was a cursebreaker who made good money and his parents have shown to have to much pride to take handouts, so he went to the Daily Prophet/Ministry of Magic and set up a fake contest so they could win a "free" trip to Egypt. The Ministry probably agreed because they wanted to sweep the fact that a student was involved in the Chamber attacks under the rug, and having the involved party be out of the country in the immediate aftermath of the events would help do that.Buckle up, long theory ahead (skip The Evidence to Debora's Secret for a TLDR of sorts)

After watching Baby Driver, seeing some other people's observations on Debora's strange behaviour and then re-watching Baby Driver, I realised that Debora may indeed have a secret under the hood.

Before anything else, **The Evidence**:

- During the long-take opening of Baby going out for coffee, we see Debora for the first time, walking straight past Baby in the coffee shop and heading in the same direction as Doc's warehouse.

- When Baby meets Deb for real, she happens to have several qualities that immediately scream attraction to Baby (singing a song with his (code)name, her desire to go on the open road with music and her love of older tunes) and later easily bonds with Baby over their parental issues. She also shows immediate comfort with him, grabbing his tape recorder, asking about his line of work and being very casual when Baby starts flirting. 

- Also, Debora has only just started working at this diner, shown by the fact that she's wearing a new uniform with a different name on it. The boss may just be a dick, but he may also not really want her there.

- During Baby's second encounter with Debora, Debora learns his name (Baby) and shows very little surprise over his unusual name. We also see her push into intimate topics with Baby such as his mother. Also, despite Debora being off-shift, her boss continues to be a dick and rush her. Next, at the laundromat, the meeting seems pretty normal, until someone that we don't see suddenly enters the building. Debora looks straight towards them before looking back at Baby and rotating around him to angle his vision away from the door and immediately asking if she can see him "some other place".

- Baby takes Debora to the only nice restaurant he can think of, one he heard very recently from Darling in the elevator. There, he just so happens to encounter Doc, who begins to use blackmail him with his new "waitress girlfriend". Debora is surprised but not concerned by Doc's appearance. However, later in the car afterwards, Debora shows obvious concern but simply digs in to try and get the truth out of Baby ("you can tell me anything"). This point is important, as Debora continues to dig until Baby lets her know that she is very important to him, and Debora takes this extremely well, but appears distraught as he tells her that he feels he isn't good enough for her. Debora rejects this notion and immediately jumps straight for Baby and makes sure he knows she (now) reciprocates. 

- Baby is only one job away from being "even" when he conveniently meets Debora, and as soon as he is off the hook, decides to go devote his new life to her. This results in Doc using her to pressure Baby back into working for him as now Baby has something else to care for (other than his foster father that Doc may/may not know about)

- We are led to believe that when Baby calls Debora shortly after this and offers to take her away with him that she goes with him due to the recent death of her mother, however she still shows an extreme lack of concern over this offer considering that she has only known Baby for a very short time.

- Baby is forced to enter the diner with three criminals while Debora is working there. Also, Debora appears to be working at this diner 24/7, which is bizarre. More bizarre is the fact that she reads the situation and keeps her cool pretty well over the course of this scene and is even smart enough to provide Baby with the means to subtly communicate with her (the suggestion slip). However, Batz catches this and attempts to kill Debora, which seems in character considering how psychotic he is constantly shown to be.

- Over the course of the third act, Debora shows surprising adaptability and calmness (compared to how panicked most would be) during the violence and doesn't hesitate to trust Baby and follow him through it all. Not only that, but when things happen like Buddy trying to kill Baby or being confronted by police, Debora can react with action (attacking Buddy with a crowbar and trying to play getaway driver herself to get away on the bridge).

- Baby confronts Doc and begs for help (and his mothers tape). Doc doesn't comply until Debora conveniently reveals herself, resulting in Doc "catching a feeling" and helping Baby.

**Debora's Secret**

With all this in mind, we can conclude that Debora may in fact be employed by Doc for the express purpose of blackmailing Baby. She happens to show up at the diner Baby has been going to for years, have plenty of the same interests, and shows little hesitation in trying to reel him in. Not only that, but she also acts as an informant of sorts; Baby has a tape recorder that Debora tells Doc about, and shortly after this, Batz happens to find it and a confrontation begins. 

*What's up with Batz and Debora?*

We know that for whatever reason Doc shares information with Batz about Baby, and it is very possible that in order to get Batz to trust Baby so that he doesn't go psycho on him, Doc revealed to him that he had Debora. This is also how Batz learns about the tape recorder, and why he is extra suspicious of her at the diner. He tries to shoot the diner up because as we learn earlier, he is extremely prone to this, but decides not to after Baby stops him because he realises that it may be best to keep the getaway driver happy until (at least) after the job.

*Why does Debora's presence make Doc help Baby?*

Because Debora is probably related to Doc, which is the final straw in causing the normally unfeeling monster to "catch a feeling". We know Doc is okay with using family members for (light) criminal activity as he gets his surprisingly potent nephew to go scout a location with Baby. Later, Doc picks out Debora's tape among all of the tapes found in Baby's apartment, and this short piece of auditory affection sparks the first piece of guilt in Doc regarding the affair, but not enough to get him to tell Debora to leave the diner.

*Why does Debora show actual affection towards Baby if it's just a con?*

Because over time, Debora begins to actually relate to Baby through things that aren't music and driving; their mothers, and guilt. The pivotal point is in the scene in the car, when Baby tells Debora how he feels. At first, she's ecstatic not only because she is beginning to reciprocate, but also because this is what she needs to get info out of him. But then, Baby tells her that he feels he isn't good enough for her, and Debora feels guilty and begins *full* reciprocation. 

And there you have it. Being an Edgar Wright film, it wouldn't surprise me at all if this theory was true (at least in a different form of Debora being something other than what we see), but I'm probably also missing lots of details so let me know if you see anything more conclusive!Near the climax of the film, Owen leads his trained but wild raptors on a hunt for the Indominus Rex. In the movie, the raptors had been portrayed more-or-less like real animals, specifically intelligent pack hunters, with Owen being considered the alpha and having control and authority over them. Being the first generation, they are probably not so good at communicating with him and understanding what he wants them to do, leaving them to try and guess at it. When they hunt the Indominus, it's with people who they have seen Owen, their alpha, fight with, and who he is obviously hostile towards. When they finally find the I Rex and it appears they're siding with her now, instead of turning to look at the humans in general, as they would if they were going to attack, they look at Owen specifically, probably for guidance or instruction on what to do.

When Hoskins has them start shooting, in the resulting confusion the raptor pack has to act on its own, and being still mostly wild animals, hunt the perceived threat that is the other humans. They do attempt to meet up with Owen, who, incorrectly, thinks the "raptors have a new alpha," but they fail. One of them is killed by a rocket, but shortly before that, she appears as if she might defer to Owen with regards to the kill she had just made, with him being higher in the pecking order.

I have two more proofs, and I think they make it pretty conclusive. The raptor that kills Hoskins showed up when Hoskins was getting close to and being aggressive towards Owen. The raptor doesn't surprise him or even look at Owen, instead she vocalizes,getting Hoskins' attention, and then she immediately interposes herself between Hoskins and Owen, keeping her back to Owen in what is probably a defensive posture. She certainly wouldn't have done it if she thought Owen was a potential threat. She later crashes through the glass after killing Hoskins to rejoin Owen, only stopping when the Dilophosaurus appears, engaging another threat.

My final, and possibly most important proof, goes back to the start and end of the raptors supposed "side change." When they rejoin Owen against the Indominus, he never does anything to show or reassert dominance over the Indominus and the rest of the pack. He didn't have to, because he had always been considered the alpha, because the Indominus /never/ did anything to assert dominance over him.

TL;DR: The raptors were always on Owen's side, and three of the four died trying to protecting him.

Edit: It's also possible that, since the Raptors had already accepted a non-raptor as the alpha, they thought that Owen's goal was to bring the Indominus into the pack to fight the humans, who they had, again, seen him fight with. It makes more sense that the alpha would want you to fight his enemies than to fight the guy you just meant, who can also communicate, and who the alpha's enemies are attacking too.

Edit 2: Some people have wondered why Blue went at the other trainer, and personally I think it's because she was caught up in the panic and confusion of the fight, and didn't immediately recognize him like she would have with Owen. As soon as he said her name, she backed off to look at him, instead of continuing to attack. We don't see how she would react beyond that, because Owen calls her shortly thereafter.Ever seen a blind eye due to lead poisoning? They look evil as hell. The iris is missing the pupil entirely and the eye itself looses the veins over time and is pale white. 

When the narrator sneaks to the old mans room at midnight and shines a light on the guy just illuminating "that" eye, you might be curious. Like is he trying to wake him up? Who sleeps with an eye open anyway? 

Well, the eye doesn't work and due to that sometimes he forgets to close the eyelid before hitting the bed so it would just stare out into nothingness, seeing nothing but looking quite evil indeed.

The main character seems pretty crazy, the narrator is saying again and again 'he's not crazy' he heard that heart from under the floorboards. 

But one of the main side-effects of lead poisoning is delirium, memory loss, erratic behavior and bad temper. If you've ever read Freakeconomics, they propose that the drop in violent crime after the 70s was due to the phasing out of lead in car gasoline. 

But at this time, lead was still used in a lot of things such as in pencils and most especially wall paint. Given the narrator lives with the old man, it is an old house and likely still has the toxic paint and it was not clearly understood in this period of the mid 19th century that the lead in paint can cause such averse side affects. 

Simply put, he is not crazy at all, just suffering the ill-effects of a deadly poison he is unwittingly breathing in all the time - further exasperated by his midnight cutting up and replacing of the floorboards which certainly would have been covered in lead dust by the time he was done.Before Ragnarok, Thor has had a old-timey Shakespearean way of talking, that has since gone away in favor of a more casual and fun dialect. 

This has been explained away by directors as Thor picking up on Tony’s mannerisms, but this makes little sense since Hemsworth’s brand of charisma is quite different than Downeys, and there was no real gradient between AOU Thor and Ragnarok Thor. 

I propose that Allspeak, the language Asgardians speak, sounds Shakespearean to English speakers on earth. But as we “learn” it through exposure, Asgardians sound less Shakespearean and more like us. 

Thus Thor’s personality becomes more apparent to us, which also somewhat explains his personality change.Yoda and Ben had almost certainly schemed a plan to train Luke long before A New Hope. Too much is riding on Luke killing Vader and Palpatine. Yoda was just making Luke aware he was in for a tough time.

Edit: pardon the late night typos. Everyone is correct in saying Yoda says that Luke is too old not young to begin the training.In the *Avatar: The Last Airbender* (ATLA) episode "The Blue Spirit", Aang talks to Prince Zuko about his "friend from the Fire Nation", Kuzon. Aang goes on to use Kuzon as an example of the possibility of him and Zuko being friends. ("If we had known each other back then, do you think we would be friends?")

We don't know much about Kuzon, as he never makes an appearance in the show, whereas Bumi - Aang's childhood friend from the Earth Kingdom - makes an appearance in several episodes, as "the mad, old Earth King Bumi" (i.e. King of Omashu).

The only point against this theory is that, in an interview, the creators of ATLA - Bryan and Mike - cited Azulon as being "95 years old" when he died, which would mean that Azulon wasn't born until after Aang got trapped in the iceberg. However, as *The Legend of Korra* (LOK) shows, existing canon can be bent - or even changed or broken - is Mike & Bryan decide to change their minds in terms of the story.

 Likewise, as another commenter pointed out, the storyline involving Sozin, Azulon, and the history of the Fire Nation royal family was also changed and retconned over time, with Sozin's and Azulon's resepective ages also being a "moving number", so to speak. *(moved to top of post as per commenter's suggestion)*

However, there are several pieces of evidence and foreshadowing in the original show's narrative, irregardless of subsequent changes, that have me believe that Kuzon was, in fact, \[originally\] Prince Azulon, Fire Lord Sozin's son.

1. **The very fact that Aang "just so happened" to be friends with Bumi, who later became the Earth King / King of Omashu.** We don't know much about how Bumi came to power, but as the Earth Queen / King in *The Legend of Korra* (LOK) is shown to be a hereditary monarchy position, I'm assuming that Bumi was, in fact, *Prince* Bumi of Omashu. (This is also counting the Earth King of Ba Sing Se, another city-state.)
2. Following up on the point above, **If Aang was friends with Bumi, an Earth Kingdom prince and heir to the throne of Omashu, it makes it more believable that he could have also been friends with Azulon, a Fire Nation prince, and heir to the throne**. As shown in the show, the Air Nomad masters (Order of the White Lotus members?) knew from an early age that Aang was the Avatar, ad chances are, they started introducing him to the heirs of other kingdoms in order to prepare Aang for his future role as the Avatar.
3. Following up on Point #2, this is also supported by the fact that, in LOK, the Order of the White Lotus identifies Korra, Aang's reincarnation and successor as Avatar, early in her childhood, and spends her adolescence training her to master the elements of Water, Earth, and Fire - with the exception of Air, as she goes to Tenzin, Aang's son, to learn that element, as Tenzin is the only Airbending master in the world. **We also see that the Order of the White Lotus were present and active in Aang's time as well, with Aang's old friend, King Bumi, and Iroh, son and original heir of Fire Lord Azulon, were both members of.** As members of the White Lotus, both Bumi and Iroh also provided guidance to Aang, advising him on his role as Avatar, and fulfilled Aang's wishes for them to also guide and train his successor as Avatar, Korra.
4. Given Points #1, 2, and 3, going off of the White Lotus's role as "guiders and protectors of the Avatar" in LOK, and that they were active in Aang's time, or even in Aang's childhood, if Monk Gyatso - Aang's Airbending master and "adoptive father" - was also a White Lotus member, **\[Monk Gyatso\] and the rest of the White Lotus would be preparing Aang - like Korra after him - for his future role of the Avatar from early childhood as well.** The presence of all of the Avatar's incarnations at the Northern Air Temple also supports the White Lotus connection, as well as the expanded canon naming Jinpa, "an Air Nomad member of the White Lotus", in Avatar Kyoshi's time. The White Lotus are also called "the Avatar's teachers and protectors", which Monk Gyatso certainly qualifies for with Aang.
5. The Order of the White Lotus - a "secret, ancient society that transcends the boundaries of the four nations, devoted to sharing sharing ancient knowledge across national and political divides" - is literally described as "ancient". **It is unknown when exactly the Order of the White Lotus was founded as a secret society, but they have been active since the time of Avatar Kuruk, Avatar Kyoshi's predecessor, indicating that they have been around for Kuruk, Kyoshi, Roku, Aang, and Korra.** Their role in assisting Avatar Kuruk, as well as their member Jinpa, an Air Nomad, serving as Avatar Kyoshi's secretary, trusted counsellor, and confidante. also lends credence to the White Lotus also "guiding and training" Aang.
6. **Aang is identified as the Avatar by "choosing the items that belonged to previous Avatars" when presented with hundreds to thousands of toys, as a test. The White Lotus, a "society of scholars and masters", would have been the most likely source of these items**, as they would have been the most likely group to own and possess the items / relics of previous Avatars as historical artifacts. The White Lotus also likely lent these items to the Air Nomads, probably at the suggestion of a White Lotus member, so that when the Air Nomads identified the Avatar, the White Lotus would also be informed of the identity of the new Avatar.
7. Given the high liklihood of the Order of the White Lotus being involved in identifying, and influencing, Aang's life as the Avatar, **the White Lotus also would have sought to steer Aang to serve their mission: "to transcend the boundaries of the four nations, and to share across national and political divides".** To this end, what better way to do this than to present and introduce Aang, the future Avatar, to the future heirs and leaders of the other four nations, and have him make friends from all four nations? Aang even cites his childhood experience of "making friends from all of the nations" as the reason why he isn't nearly as quick to judge the Fire Nation to Katara, Sokka, and even Zuko.
8. For Point #8, from what we see in the show, **it doesn't appear to be common for other Air Nomad children to have friends from "all four nations", and yet Aang - who is, coincidentally, also the Avatar - does.** Instead, the other Air Nomad kids appear to be primarily friends with other Air Nomad children, and they even exclude Aang from their group when they learn that he's the Avatar, "because it wouldn't be fair to play with him anymore". To me, this points to Aang having been taken on a tour, or trip, to all four Nations before he was trapped in the iceberg, probably - again - by secret White Lotus member(s) within the Air Nomad leadership and council. Aang, of course, was unaware that he was the Avatar, and thus, made friends with kids of other nationalities more freely.
9. This, of course, brings us around to the likelihood of Prince Azulon, the son of Fire Lord Sozin, and heir to the Fire Nation throne, secretly being Kuzon, Aang's "Fire Nation friend". **Kuzon being Azulon, I would argue, was forshadowed and hinted at by a few episodes**: "The Blue Spirit", mentioned further up, where Aang works with Zuko, and mentions his past friendship with Kuzon in contemplating being friends with Zuko; "The Great Divide", where Aang has to mediate two warring tribes, and ends up fabricating a story about "knowing their ancestors as children" in order to end their feud; "The Avatar andf the Fire Lord", which touches upon the friendship of Avatar Roku, Aang's predecessor, and Fire Lord Sozin, Zuko's great-grandfather; and, of course, the episodes where Zuko and Aang have to work together. In "Avatar Day", Avatar Kyoshi's past feud with Chin the Conqueror is also shown to affect Aang, as he is Kyoshi's reincarnation.
10. **Prince / Fire Lord Azulon was not always evil and ruthless, but rather, raised to be that way by his father, Fire Lord Sozin, in the expanded canon.** A lot of people assume that Prince Zuko's "good" side comes from Ursa, his mother, who is later shown to be a granddaughter of Avatar Roku, but I believe Zuko's arc also reflects that of his grandfather, Azulon. It should also be noted that Iroh, who is not a descendant of Avatar Roku - but who was Azulon's firstborn son - was also Azulon's favorite for inheriting the throne, even over the ambitious, greedy, scheming Ozai. In the show, Azulon even shows disdain and anger towards Ozai, his second son, for showing these traits, which were more in line with Sozin, Azulon's father. In this way, Azulon mirrors Zuko and Zuko's arc in many ways, including showing that, had Zuko not been guided by Iroh and Aang, he could've ended up just like how Sozin raised Azulon, his grandfather, to be.
11. **Much like his granddaughter, Azula, and Aang, Prince Azulon was a firebending prodigy "from an early age", as per the expanded canon, and was regarded as "one of the best Firebenders in the world".** If Aang was carted around to different nations by White Lotus members, and later sought out Toph - "one of the greatest Earthbenders in the world" - to be his Earthbending master, and Katara - Aang's Waterbending teacher - was "one of the greatest Watebenders in the world", it's entirely possible that the White Lotus sent Aang to befriend Prince Azulon, with the goal of Azulon later teaching Aang how to master Firebending. This also ties into Zuko's stated belief that he is "restoring his honor" by, and "it is his destiny" to, help and train Aang, the Avatar, how to Firebend. Zuko teaching Aang how to Firebend would fulfill the original "promise" of Azulon teaching Aang Firebending, should this theory prove to be true.

I believe all eleven (11) points of evidence make a compelling, complex, and nuanced case for Kuzon being Azulon. If not, then I suspect that, if Kuzon was a separate person, he was probably the older brother of Azulon, with their arc and relationship mirroing that if Iroh and Ozai, and later, Zuko and Azula. This has been theorized before on Tumblr, and I thought it worth mentioning as well.

This is because, in the expanded canon, Azulon is noted as "being favored by his father, Sozin, over another family member (Kuzon?)".

Yet another possibility, also posted on Tumblr, is that Kuzon was the son of Avatar Roku - Aang's predecessor - and the father of Ursa, the mother of Zuko and Azula, which would also make him Zuko's maternal grandfather. However, I personally do not think this would be as compelling as Kuzon secretly being Azulon, or Kuzon being Azulon's older brother.

Personally, I find the hints / possibility at Aang being friends with Prince Azulon as "Kuzon" - or Kuzon being a prince, and Azulon's older brother, like Iroh to Ozai and Zuko to Azula - to be an incredibly compelling story. It also has the potential to add even more complex, nuanced backstory and lore to the ATLA universe, characters, and the characters' development and relationships within the show.Mills throughout the entire film is sketchy, and works to distract Somerset (Morgan Freeman) from finding clues and evidence. When Somerset finds clues, Mills becomes visibly distraught and then points out false clues to distract Somerset. Mills’ clues always are irrelevant. One of the early examples is when Morgan Freeman is examining the body of gluttony and just as he’s finding small pieces of evidence, Mills distracts him by pointing out a bucket of throw up under the table. This bucket would’ve been concealed under the table and the position that Mills was at and he would not have been able to see it unless he was at the crime scene before.

As the murders continue, more false evidence is planted (the finger prints, John Doe etc.) to throw Somerset off. As the murders continue the evidence also becomes increasingly obvious, as Mills become more desperate to throw Somerset (who I believe suspects Mills) off his trail. Mills also consciously breaks down a suspects door, so that all the evidence therein becomes void. To add after he breaks down the door, they never enter the room to collect evidence.

John Doe (Kevin Spacey), an obvious fake name for the fake murderer , is most likely a cynically insane individual which Mills hired to be a red herring. Doe was likely convinced that we was the killer due to his mental instability. Note how when Doe first talks it appears as though he is reading from a script or has practiced a few lines. Doe was employed by Mills, but was hard to control due to his mental state. This isn’t because Doe killed Mills’ wife, which was likely part of Mills’ plan, as their relationship wasn’t quite right (she didn’t want to tell him about the baby, she seemed to be locked inside the house all day, whenever Mills’ is around her the music becomes so sinister). Mills’ final plan of having Doe turn himself in and kill Mills’ wife was a last ditch attempt to remove himself as a suspect. This is why it seems so odd for the murder who initially didn’t try to leave any clues, to begin leaving clues and then turn himself in. Which I don’t think Somerset bought at all.

The twist is that Mills didn’t know his wife was pregnant and is why when that information is revealed Mills, for the first time, shows genuine emotional distress (besides when Somerset was digging up his clues).

This all seems so obvious especially how Mills character is played, the music, as well as the shots they have of him. When I went online I really couldn’t find any conversation about this. Instead there were discussions about Somerset (???) being the murder as well as theories about Doe’s motives. Doe is obviously a red herring and Somerset is not the murderer, is painfully aware of who the real murderer is the whole time but needs to collect evidence.Dwight figures out fairly quickly (after Season 1) about Jim and his pranks.  How do we know this?  Pretty simply, "Christmas Wishes" Episode 10 Season 8. 

Here, Dwight is able to replicate how many of Jim's pranks look.  Now some of the pranks Dwight lays on himself are absurd, the very first "prank" is telling.

Jim, announces loudly his credit card information for Dwight to steal.  Dwight KNOWS he is even being pranked here, and turns the prank around to order flowers for Pam.  Now this isn't proof enough, but it shows that Dwight is bright enough to in the moment discern one of Jim's pranks and is able to prank him back without even being something that would be against the rules to lose his bonus.

But let's look back, maybe Dwight just learned this over 8 seasons, right?  I pose that he caught on rather quickly.  Dwight, although not a fully social butterfly at the start of the show, is shown many times to be of high intellect.  He loves to be a "detective".  And let us not forget, he is actually a very good salesperson (better than Jim).

When Dwight became aware of Jim's pranks as he is doing them is hard to discern, but on Jim's baseball card in "Work Bus" it says he has played 794 pranks on Dwight.  Are we really to believe that Dwight, a top salesman, and someone who fancies the law and being a detective really didn't catch on?  Here are some points to support my theory:

No one else plays pranks on him, so ANY time he is pranked, it is by Jim (sometimes with the help of Pam, but very rarely did she ever prank him alone)

In "The Alliance" Jim agrees to an alliance with Dwight because of his paranoia.  But let's look at that.  Dwight, someone who is paranoid just happens to fall for Jim's pranks over and over???  This is season one, and I pose the point where Dwight finally became on to Jim because...
A deleted season in Office Olympics, Jim finds Dwight's wallet and returns it to him, without doing anything.  Dwight knows that doing something with his stuff is what Jim does, and cancels his credit cards.  THIS is where I think Dwight catches on to him, because the next prank is:

Jim doesn't convince Dwight it is Friday and not Thursday, Dwight opens the door for this.  This is Dwight seeing if Jim will take the bait, and he does.  So Dwight indulges him.

I could go on and on about pranks after this, but this was the point that I believe it happened.  So the next question is, why?
Why would Dwight allow Jim to prank him?  I believe it started out as a way for Dwight to keep Jim in check.  A way that if he needed to, have a long-con available to be able to harm his "enemy" at the time.  Why do I think this?

Season 6 "The Lover". Dwight plants the mallard to record dirt on Jim.  But the mallard was a tool to allow Jim to find it to make him think he got it and feel safe.  Dwight hid a recorder in a pen.  He was even able to play off that finding the mallard was bad and he was sorry.  But Dwight is more cunning than that, this showed he could imitate emotions to make Jim think something else.

The payoff: Season 7 "Classy Christmas"  This is where Dwight psychologically defeats Jim during the snowball fight.  This was proof for Dwight that he was superior, physically and mentally, and should he need to, could defeat Jim.  This is the point where Dwight stopped seeing Jim as an adversary and developed a friendship. How do we know that?

Season 9 "Dwight Christmas" during this he whips Jim too hard and kind of breaks down because Jim is leaving.  It is at this point you can tell Dwight enjoyed Jim, he was in on the pranks, but that's because they had a friendship.  The pranks evolved from something Dwight allowed Jim to think he had on him for career gain, to being something that two friends did to pass the time.

The proof they were friends?  Dwight's speech at the very end of the series and allowing Jim and Pam to pull one over on his beloved company for extra cash.

tl;dr Dwight knew that Jim was pranking him most of the series and allowed him to do it.

edit:formatting

Edit2: Wow appreciate all the responses.  A few people have brought up a few instances where it seems unlikely Dwight was playing along.  I want to clarify that I don't believe Dwight knew about EVERY prank Jim played on him while it happened.  But I do believe that the vast majority he does.  No one could bat 1000, but I think that's part of the "game" for Dwight.  Figuring it out as it happens.  

Just remember, Jim has played almost 1000 pranks on him, just because a handful slip through the cracks doesn't mean he isn't smart, just human.  Even if Dwight "missed" 50 pranks that would still give him a 95% success rate.In 1981's Halloween 2, Michael Myers wrote the word "Samhain" in blood on a chalkboard. Samhain was the holiday that preceded Halloween, in which human sacrifices were made to the god Crom Cruach. This is how Michael never dies: each sacrifice he makes to Crom grants him another life on Earth. 

The only way to truly kill Michael Myers is to find someone who can stand on equal ground against him and has also earned Crom's favor by the sacrifices of blood made in his name. The one who found the answer to the riddle of steel. The Cimmerian, the Barbarian, the Destroyer: the one made king by his own hand. Conan.Spoilers for The Rise of Skywalker

The new movie established that if Rey kills Palpatine, Palpatine's soul will flow into Rey. You could interpret this to mean that he would then possess Rey and take control of her body. But, you could also interpret it to mean that there will be some sort of fusion between Rey and Palpatine. It might mean that she would have all of his knowledge, and there would be a merger of their personalities.

Palpatine also said that he contains all of the Sith. Its not 100% clear what this means. But, it could mean that when Palpatine killed his master, Darth Plagueis, a similar fusion took place. All of his master's knowledge flowed into him, and their personalities merged. Perhaps this process also occurred when Darth Plagueis killed his master. And so on, and so forth. As such, every Sith Lord is a fusion of all the Sith Lords that existed before them.

This sheds an interesting light on the Rule of 2. Every Sith Lord is functionally immortal. They take on an apprentice in the hopes that their apprentice will surpass them. Then, once the apprentice kills them, their soul flows into the apprentice. In this way, the Sith Lord hive mind gets a shiny new body that is better than the one they had before.

Of course, this is all just speculation. But, I think this is a cool idea.Daenerys and her dragons will help save Westeros from the Long Night. BUT, once the war has ended, her moment of triumph will turn to ash in her mouth as the camera reveals she has been stabbed, or poisoned (doesn’t matter). Varys will be discovered as the culprit, he will be captured, and he will die in Westeros, just as Melisandre foretold. He will accept his death sentence with a dignity, his last words will be to proclaim he did it “for the good of the Realm.”

In Season 7 Episode 2 “Stormborn,” Daenerys astutely noted Varys’s shifting loyalty from the Mad King Aerys to Robert Baratheon to Viserys and now to her. Varys responded that he serves in the best interest of the people and that “I choose you. The people have no better chance than you.” But warns, “As long as I have my eyes, I’ll use them.” He believes Danys is the best Westeros has, but he doesn’t yet know about Jon Snow’s true parentage.

The first half of the season will be devoted to the war against the White Walkers. During the conflict, Daenerys and her dragons will prove invaluable which will justify her role to Varys. However, she will have her moments of cruelty when dealing with dissent, echoing her treatment of Randyll and Dickon Tarly. But, Varys will stomach her temperament as the only option. 

However, when the truth about Jon Snow’s parentage spreads to Varys’s ears we will see a flicker in his eyes, his calculus will shift, and in that moment, he will conclude Jon is the best option and that Daenerys must be removed. Jon’s is a man, a man with a superior succession claim to the Iron Throne, a natural leader, a peacekeeper, the hero of the War for the Dawn, and already King in the North. Moreover, he comes free of Danys’ Targaryean fiery temper, her foreign army, and her two destructive dragons. 

The war will climax with Jon using Longclaw to kill the Night King. The death of the first White Walker will conveniently trigger the death of all the other remaining Walkers whom he originally created from humans. Their deaths will then cascade down to the death Wights they each raised, as we saw in Season 7 Episode 6 “Beyond the Wall.” With her purpose served, Varys will order her death thereby making room for Jon to reluctantly take the Iron Throne so as to bring an end to the conflict which has ravaged Westeros since the start of the series.

But, Daenerys’s life will not have been in vain. In the wake of her death, dutiful Greyworm and Missandei will lead the remains of her army back to Meereen to reinforce her rule. Some Dothraki will remain giving even more reason for Jon to take the Iron Throne in order to rally the Seven Kingdoms against this intermittent threat.

As for Daenerys, she never had the chance to disappoint and compromise, and so will be remembered across the continent as "Mhysa" and as the "Breaker of Chains." In time, her memory will inspire her people to continue her abolitionist campaign, culminates in the end of slavery across Essos. She will never sit upon the Iron Throne. But, for striking the first blow to end slavery, she will be enshrined in glory forever.I believe that neither Wolverine nor Deadpool are circumcised, since their foreskin would just grow back. Just a thought btw. I have a theory that Isabelle is an alcoholic now. After working her ass off in NL, she burnt out. So when Nook offered her a job on an island she took it. That's whats in that glass every day during the morning announcements. That's why she doesn't announce that Saharah or Redd or anyone is there aside from campsite visitors. 

It explains why she goes off on a tangent about her TV shows or magazines. It explains why she's passed out at her desk by 3 pm. She's a lush.

ETA: Because a lot of people are asking, this is referring to Isabelle from the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game for Nintendo Switch.We all know Ultron and Vision are AI counterparts. It seems they may also share a love for Wanda Maximoff.  

The film begins with Wanda and Quicksilver helping Ultron in his mission to bring extinction to the Avengers and bring "peace" to the world. When Wanda first turns against Ultron, on the train, there is a genuine loss conveyed in Ultron's voice. "Please, don't do this," he says. It is rather out of character for the villian, actually, who is usually quite cocky and confident.  

Later, he says to Vision, "My vision... they really did take everything from me." He also says "you took away my world," and Vision refers to Ultron as being (emotionally) hurt. 


So of course he views Vision as an opportunity that was stolen from him, but what the hell else does he have to be sad about? Other than a few destroyed robots, Wanda is the other big loss he experienced. Which leads me to believe that he loved Wanda in a way, much in the way that Vision ends up falling in love. It's just that Ultron's unrequited love is destructive and is a factor in his emotional state and decisions at the end of the film.

Edit: so I wrote this while watching the movie. Towards the end, there is pretty solid evidence of the odd love. Ultron is nearly defeated, and Wanda approaches him. "Wanda... if you stay here, you'll die." Ultron sincerely wants her to live. Then Wanda rips his freakin' heart out. A physical manifestation of how he already felt.I keep seeing posts about certain stones influencing people (which seems to have been discussed for literal years now). But i think its clear all the stones are sentient, and i think theres a decent chunk of you that have believed this for a long time.

There is proof for at least 4 of the 6 stones having a level of sentience, and i don't see why this sentience would extend to most but not all of the stones.  


**Space Stone** \- in Avengers, Erik Selvig explains that the Space Stone turned itself on to Nick Fury. He even hesitantly states that the 'stone is misbehaving' and goes on to say "the Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving"   


**Reality Stone** \- Manipulates Jane Fosters reality in Thor The Dark World in order for her to access it using the convergence gateways. As seen by falsifying data on her tracking device (leading her astray) and creating a gust of wind to push her through the portal. The stone then physically attacks/assimilates with Jane and somehow contacts Malekith, awakening the dark elves.  


**Mind Stone** \- clearly influences Bruce Banner in Avengers while aboard the helicarrier, to the point that it manipulates him into picking the sceptre up without him knowing. This is further reinforced by the events in Age of Ultron with the creation of ultron and the discussions Bruce and Tony have about the stones intelligence when researching it.  


**Soul Stone** \- Red Skull in Infinity War explicitly states the stone has a 'certain wisdom' and that 'to ensure that whoever possesses it, understand its power. The stone demands a sacrifice' highlighting the stone clearly has an intelligence/will  


&#x200B;I had this thought while reading the other [Stan Lee post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ofh09t/mcu_steve_rogers_and_stan_lee/) on the subreddit frontpage. What if Stan Lee, who's appeared in dozens of MCU works by now, is a TVA agent?

One possibility is that he's gone rogue and has just been doing whatever the hell he wanted across the Sacred Timeline rather than trying to bring it down like Loki and Sylvie are doing or something, but keeping it on the downlow enough to prevent a nexus event that would get the TVA involved.

Or he's actually still a TVA agent and all of his quick little cameos are very deliberate manipulations that the TVA have to do to keep the Sacred Timeline flowing naturally.

This is all bullshit, but I just thought it was fun to think about.The fact that Lockhart hadn't done any of the things he claimed should have been easy to discover. When Buckbeak slashed Malfoy, there were two committee hearings, numerous witnesses called, official statements, and mountains of paperwork. That was for a single hippogriff. How was there zero investigation into a yeti, a banshee, some ghouls, a vampire, and a werewolf, among many others? Even if only one of those took place within the Ministry's jurisdiction, all it would take is a single official asking villagers to find out that a completely different person had actually defeated the monster.

So, why was he never exposed by the Ministry? 

**Lockhart was an effective method of propaganda for the Ministry, so they helped cover up his incompetence.**

If the books hammered one thing home, it was that the Ministry of Magic was headed by a number of cowards and incompetents who'd take the easy way out, and bend the rules as they saw fit. Fudge fully ignored the laws on underage magic for Harry in his third year, then tried to have him expelled and arrested for breaking them fifth year. There's also a number of cases of them defending death eaters because of their wealth and influence.

In Harry's fifth year, they also showed that they could fully manipulate nearly every wizarding newspaper to control the news. It went further than just stopping them from running a story, they managed to get the *Prophet* and others to covertly mock Harry and Dumbledore. They could easily stop any reporter from investigating Lockhart further, and only allowing positive articles to be published.

So, it'd be fully in character for them to cover up Lockhart's secret exploits if it benefited them. Why would they choose to do that?

**Lockhart served as a form of propaganda, enhancing the reputation of England in the international community, as well as giving wizards a false sense of security.**

We don't see a lot of the international community of Wizards, but from the few glimpses we see, especially Fantastic Beasts, there's a massive amount of competition, one-upmanship, and undermining. So, of course the Ministry would try to enhance their international reputation, especially if it was at the expense of foreign wizards (Lockhart mentioned one of the wizards he mindwiped was Romanian).

Second, the Ministry wants wizards to feel safe. Realistically, if a werewolf came at the average wizard, they'd be *f u c k e d*. However, Lockhart walks around, not as a grizzled, scarred fighter like Mad Eye, but like a regular wizard. He doesn't tell people to be constantly vigilant, and study their spells, he just tells them that thinking fast and being charming can solve any problem, and that if they buy his book, they too will be able to beat a vampire! Lockhart is a pretty, glittery mask for the harsh reality that if the average wizard went up against a monster, the result would be something that looked like a strawberry smoothie in a blender with no lid.

**TL;DR: The Ministry knows that Lockhart is a liar, and helps him cover the fact up (likely without Lockhart's own knowledge), in order to enhance their international prestige, and pacify their population.**In Moana, the grandmother is always shown as full of life, and full of energy.  Even right before she got sick, she was climbing hills and moving vines to show Moana the ancient boats.  But a little after the grandmother gives Moana the heart of the te future, she immediately gets sick, can barely speak, and dies.

They say the heart of te fiti can create life, so maybe the heart was keeping her alive so she could give it to Moana.  

Lastly, we know the heart of te fiti is wanted by many beings, including te ka, who also seems to be able to sense when it’s near by.  Not know exactly where it is, but knows when it’s near since she immediately appears.  Since her black tendrils reach are trying to find the heart, it probably was drawn to Moana’s island, because the grandma had the heart.Obviously Evil Morty (ya know, with the eye patch) wasn't a one off thing since he was elected President of the Citadel a season later.  


The show starts with Rick reappearing after some kind of crazy extended absence. My idea is that Rick lost his original Morty and was racked with guilt because after Morty's "death" he realized how much he loved him. So he found a dimension (C-137) in which a Rick had run away (and we know it's possible to kinda usurp your position in another dimension like happened in Rick Potion No. 9). Rick slid himself in there and tried to make nice to repair his mistakes.  


This brings us to how he lost his original Morty and why he feels so guilty about it. In the credits, we're given a shot of Rick and Morty running from some kind of monster, Morty falling, and Rick jumping into a portal without him while Morty looks on terrified. Most of the other scenes from the credits, we've seen played out in the show. That's one of the ones we haven't, though. Because it happened before the events of the show as we know it.  


Somehow, Morty survived being chased down by those monsters. Since Morty is Rick's grandson, at least \*some\* of the infinite number of Mortys must have inherited his intelligence. Rick's original Morty (the one from the credits) is one of them. He was so pissed at Rick for abandoning him, he became Evil Morty, hatched an elaborate plan to get even with HIS Rick, and put it into motion in the episode Evil Morty was introduced in.  


This would also explain why, in that episode, they showed Rick pictures of he and Morty as a baby even though Rick was supposed to have been gone while Morty was a baby. It also explains why Rick was crying when he saw the pictures. He believes that his original Morty is dead because of him and that, only after, did he figure out that he really loved him.  


Evil Morty's original plan was thwarted. So he regrouped, picked up the pieces, and formed a new plan; one in which he becomes President of the Citadel. We'll see what happens next.....This is a simple theory, but I wanted to try to look at Skyrim's myths and culture according to both the ideas in the game and its influences, namely norse mythology.

Basically, it goes like this: The greybeards are old and have greybeards, We know that much. But a lot of old farts live in the game and have the notable grey hair. Why would you name your dragon enthusiast cult after the fact that your hair pigment has faded? It would only be significant if aging was itself considered significant. Now, in Skyrim, the nords hold the belief that dying an honorable death in battle will get you into Sovangaurde. If we look at norse mythology, we see a clear parallel to Valhalla. However, in the Norse stories, there is an inverse to Valhalla: if you die of old age or sickness (including famine), you will go to Hel. Their version of Hel is more mopey than anything else, nowhere near as torturous as Christian Hell, but it is still an awful way to spend eternity (or at least until Ragnarok, depending on who you ask). While there is not a Hel parallel explicitly stated in Skyrim, we can assume that you aren't getting anywhere good if you are a Nord who gets old and dies, maybe a Daedra realm or the Kajit afterlife just for kicks. This is important. 

Even the Nords we see who are old in the game still act battle ready (when they don't they are usually quite sad and broken, like the former ship captain in Windhelm). It makes sense that every Nord is willing to keep fighting even into old age, because even if they get struck down immediately, they still get to go to Sovanguarde. So all Nords who are faithful to their tradition and aren't mentally broken actively make the choice to die in combat rather than of old age, even the old ones.

So now the Greybeards are really important, because they are completely faithful to Nordic tradition, even holding one of the highest and most important roles in their society, to the extent that even the high king and the Jarls respect them, yet they choose to grow old and study the dragon language. They devote their lives to academic pursuits, all but ensuring that they will never die in battle. The point is that they willingly choose age, and likely death by age, so no Sovanguarde for them.

To put it another way, this would be like if the Pope decided not to go to heaven in order to learn more about angels... or dragons... same thing. Another more tenuous comparison would be to Bodhisattvas, Buddhists who willingly refuse to fully achieve Nirvanna in order to continue to help people. This would be considered an incredible, almost unthinkable sacrifice. Which is why the Greybeards are considered so important. They literally sacrifice a good afterlife in order to preserve their people's tradition. Hence, their aging is more important than a regular Nord's. The average nord, when he gets old, would simply need to pick a fight with an elf for safety's sake, thereby mitigating his/her age. When a greybeard gets old, that's it. They may be able to preserve themselves longer using the thuum, but they will still die of old age as they don't use their abilities for combat.

So while there are old nords, the greybeards age actually carries a lot more meaning. Hence, they name their cult after their sacrifice. "Greybeard" as a general term is just slang for an old man, but in this society, where age carries a much higher level of importance, to be a greybeard would be profound. This also explains (part) of why the general nords revere and fear the greybeards so much rather than just thinking of them as a weird dragon fan club.

TL:DR; Greybeards get their name from the fact that their chosen lifestyle, while integral to preserving nordic culture, prevents them from reaching sovanguard.In Prisoner of Azkaban (film) we see the inside of Lupin's office when Harry was learning the patronus. During the first battle against the bogart/dementor we get a close up on one of the candles. The top vertebra is marked with 'VIII' and the numbers continue down the candle. This is a very specific detail to incorporate into a film and required more investigation. I counted the remaining vertebrae, beginning with 8 and determined that in the full candle there were 21 vertebrae. I checked the other candles in the shots and they were also 21 vertebrae candles. 

After the bogart is returned to the trunk, we see Lupin immediately re-ignite the candles even though it is perfectly lit in the office without need of further light. This gives two possibilities:

First, Lupin really likes those candles. They are kinda creepy and cool looking but that isn't really worth the screen time to show him relighting them. 

Second, they are burning constantly and marking time passage. This, I believe is more likely. Lupin is marking the passage of time through the cycle of the moon.

After the full moon is complete, Lupin lights a new candle which burns through days 1-21 of the cycle. On day 22, he begins taking his Wolfsbane potion to allow it to be in effect when the full moon begins. Assuming that there is a period of time that the moon has an effect (supported by tonks in one of the later movies "The first night is always the worst") days 23-28 he sleeps from the effects of the potion and after the full moon is complete, begins a new set of candles. 

Tl;dr: Lupin's candles were basically pill boxes for forgetful werewolvesOk, so Howard Stark was a founder of Shield and a genius. In Endgame, Howard meets Tony and they have a conversation (the deleted scene also helps this case when Howard asks Tony to come work for him and Tony says he is working in "futures") about his upcoming fatherhood.  But Tony looks enough like his younger self in the BARF simulation, that there is a good chance that Howard (at some point) recognizes that Tony will one day become the man that he met; even if he can't explain how.This would have large implications for what we know about the history of the MCU. It means that, as Tony grew up and Howard sees his brilliant son be the young Tony Stark we know, he begins to figure out that Tony is that guy he met all those years ago and will become a hero.  All of a sudden, this changes how Shield may have formed with Howard knowing that something bad is coming and that he will have to advance science as much as he can to ready the world for his son.  It changes how we can view Howard's invention of the new element and his statement that "you are my greatest creation" speech. He may have even recognized Cap once he is able to sit and reflect on what he saw.  Now things like the way Howard used to talk about Cap to Tony makes complete sense, he is trying to tell his son "this is the best man I have ever known, trust him because you two are going to do something amazing together."  The more I think of it, the more I find little hints that just maybe, Howard was preparing Tony from a very early age and that inadvertently molded Tony into the exact opposite of what he saw Cap as... which exactly what he needed.  


Edit: I wonder if this is connected to Howard's womanizing later in life. That he may have thought that his wife had an affair with this guy and that is why the kid looks so much like him, until he comes to the realization a little bit later.

Edit 2: I just rewatched the Iron Man 2 Howard Stark tape scene and I am more convinced that this has legs.  The first words of Howard's message to Tony are "with technology, all things are possible" and then later says, "you will change the world" not, I believe you will. His entire demeanor changes as if to say, "ok, now that you are about to be who I know you will be, let me tell you what I wish I could have said when I met you".  It gives the scene an entirely different perspective.

Edit 3: ok, I think I understand that with time travel you can't change the past, you create an alternate reality. That said, shouldn't the fact that these things showed up way before the time travel mean that in this reality, the time travel itself always happened and the stones were always going to be destroyed which means any results of time travel that stick (like cap or the stones being destroyed) exist in the main continuity?  As in nothing was changed because we only care about the results of the time travel in our timeline and some results seemed to stick and others didn't.  I feel like the end of the movie leaves this intentionally ambiguous.

Edit 4: Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely (the movie's screenwriter) on May 2nd to Fandango seems to agree with me, at least somewhat in my interpretation of time travel in the movie. Not only that, but he seems to imply that others at Marvel Studios do as well using the royal we.

Edit 5: last one I promise.  First: Front page, that makes me feel pretty good today.  I have never done that before, thank you to the people who were nice in telling me that I am wrong and having fun.  Not sure why so many people got bent out of shape about it, but that's the internet.
Second: So it doesn't hold up, which is a shame.  The weird quote about Cap's shield not withstanding, I thought it was a pretty fun idea.About halfway through Megamind, there's a scene where Roxanne and Megamind (currently disguised as Bernard) are lying on the grass telling each other secrets that they'd "never told anyone".

Roxanne's secret? That she and Metro Man were, despite what *everyone* thought, never actually and couple.

This fits pretty well with Megamind's general theme of subverting common superhero tropes. The Super Villain is actively rooting for himself to lose; the Super Hero is secretly bored with his job; the Plucky Young Reporter who keeps getting kidnapped isn't actually romantically involved with the Hero.

However it begs the question, how *was* she involved with him exactly?

When Megamind says that Roxanne knew Metro Man best, she does not contradict him. She also reveals that Metro Man trusted her with the location of his Old ~~Shool~~ School House hideout. Considering that he was then able to hang out there for weeks after his 'death' without anyone finding him out, we can assume that he didn't trust many people with that secret.

Also, how did people get the impression they were dating? Yeah, the media will typically jump to that conclusion whenever a famous figure starts spending a lot of time with somebody of the opposite sex, but they apparently never denied it.

In fact, even after Metro Man's death, Roxanne considers this to be the kind of secret she would only share privately with the man she was falling in love with.

But Roxanne doesn't seem like the type who would be happy pretending to be Metro Man's girlfriend just to further her career. And Metro Man doesn't seem like the type of Tighten-style loser who would lie about being in a relationship just to seem cool/pressure Roxanne into making it official.

Yet, they seem to have if anything encouraged people to believe this lie. They even fooled Megamind, who has probably witnessed their interactions together more than anyone else has, and is basically obsessed with Metro Man.

And you'd think that he at least would be somebody they'd want to make it very clear to that they weren't really a couple, considering that his belief that they are is causing him to *repeatedly kidnap* Roxanne.

But then, maybe that's the point.

Imagine you're Metro Man, let's say a few years to a decade before the main film starts. You've been fighting Megamind since you were a little kid, and probably started the actual Super Hero vs Supervillain thing when you were both teenagers.

You are well aware that you could actually solve this problem at any time— by killing Megamind, or at least injuring him enough that he couldn't attack the city anymore— but you feel bad for the guy (and are maybe a bit worried about what happens to you when the city no longer needs a hero) so you've been holding back.

So long as nobody gets hurt, it doesn't matter, right?

But there's a problem. Your battles are quickly becoming more elaborate, and Megamind has chosen to start involving civilians. Civilians who don't *know* that he's not actually dangerous, and are getting traumatised every time this happens.

Plus, for all his super intelligence, Megamind can be incredibly stupid at times. He wouldn't intentionally harm a hostage, but his definition of 'safe' is not necessarily to be trusted. (Minion's is better, but he frequently gets over-ruled.) All it takes is one panicked civilian to get loose, run through the lab and end up triggering a booby trap or stumbling through the 'exciting' door, and suddenly your little game has an actual body count.

So, in order for this to continue, Metro Man needs somebody who is fully aware that Megamind isn't actually dangerous, and can be trusted to sit tight and wait to be rescued, rather than panicking and trying to get free themselves. And he needs to ensure that all future Megamind attacks will be focused on this one specific person.

Enter Roxanne Ritchie.

Maybe it's because she was the reporter most often assigned to interview him, and they'd struck up a rapport. Maybe Megamind had already kidnapped her once before and he was just impressed with how she handled it.

Either way, Metro Man confides his problem to Roxanne, and they come up with a solution.

They will allow people to think that they are a couple. They will let the tabloids take pictures of them together, refuse to correct anyone who assumes, and let the rumour mill do its work. Once their 'relationship' becomes common knowledge, news will inevitably reach Megamind, who surely won't be able to resist such an obvious way to get at Metro Man.

*This* is why Roxanne is so calm about being kidnapped. Not only has she done this a hundred times before, but Metro Man probably emphasised the unlikelihood of Megamind intentionally harming her in order to get her to agree to the plan.

This is also why she sees not dating Metro Man as such a dark secret. Even though it's probably safe to reveal now that he's 'dead', she can still remember a time when letting it get out would have potentially caused Megamind to start targeting ordinary people again.

Not to mention why the woman who broke into Megamind's lair (and refused to let Bernard carry that heavy gun for her) and responded to Metro Man's reveal by pelting him with objects was so okay with passively waiting to be rescued all the time. Playing the ideal kidnapping victim is itself an act of resistance— by encouraging Megamind to kidnap her, she ensured that he wouldn't be going after other targets.In Endgame, we can see the Infinity Gauntlet's power painfully burn through Hulk's arm just from him putting it on, to the point that he has to put his arm in a sling for the rest of the movie. He said it emitted the same gamma radiation that made him, so why would Tony Stark, an unenhanced and severely injured human being with no superpowers whatsoever, not sustain a similar if not greater amount of damage than the man the Gauntlet was "made for?" By all rights just being in the same room as it should have killed him.



My theory is that the Hulk didn't just bring everyone back, he also restored the stones. Earlier in the film, the Ancient One tells Bruce that the stones cause the flow of time, and removing even a single one will have disastrous effects on the timeline. This news definitely set off alarm bells in his mind, since he comes from a timeline where *all six* have been destroyed. This is most likely the reason why he was so insistent about being the one to snap. He's the only one she told this extra info to, so he knew nobody else would know to bring them back. He immediately says that it should be him, even over Ant-Man's suggestion to discuss it first. He denies Thor's demand to do it(even though he survived being blasted with energy from a sun, the vacuum of space, etc.) despite being arguably worse suited for the task. Heck, the gamma radiation comment could have just been a lie to scare anyone else from doing it. 



In addition, Thanos seems to have taken much more damage from destroying the stones than he did from the original snap. He only scorches the Gauntlet for the first snap, and seems mostly fine. Hulk would have probably experienced something similar if undoing the snap was the only thing he did. 
After the second use however, Thanos is left with a shriveled, scorched arm and burns on the side of his neck, which happen to be much more consistent with the injuries Hulk sustained. It can be assumed then that destroying the stones requires the same amount of energy as bringing them back.Besides the fact that both are played by Johnny Depp, the events of both films take place in the Mojave Desert and the two characters also dress extremely similarly (initially). Bearing this theory in mind, as most dreams contain the events of the previous days, the fact that Rango is a lizard could be a recollection to the cannibal lizards Raoul saw in the bar.

Also, when Raoul wakes up, his hotel room is flooded and he is wearing a lizard tail. The lizard tail is due to his character in the hallucination, whereas at the end of Rango, the town is flooded briefly, which suggests that when he wrecked his hotel room, it was under the belief that he was Rango.Some of the benefits of Ancient Ruins in Civ 5 are ridiculous if you follow the in game explanation that they are of ancient failed civilisations. For example you can discover technology like Electricity or Nuclear Fission which an ancient civ would never have. Literally nanobots can be found in ruins. Likewise your crossbowmen can discover Gatlin Guns or your Longswordsmen rifles. Amazing weaponary for an abonded ruin in 1347ad. Even maps of the deep ocean that current civ cannot explore or locations of Barbarian Camps a continent away could be the result of modern day maps discovered centuries later by the player.

I believe that once you win a science victory and leave the planet it falls into a dark age. After your civ exhaust the planet of resources for your rocket programme and have probably nuked your enemies Civilisation collapses. Until you start the next game with small remnants of the previous Victors remaining in the form of ruins.Spiderman: Far From Home spoilers below.

One of the characters that seem to be speculated about a lot is Flash. It does seem like he is being set up to have a bigger role in the next movie. Personally, I think he could be helping Peter when he becomes an outcast after the events of the credits scene.

Flash admitted that Spiderman was his idol and someone he looked up to. He also seems to be quite insecure and wanting to prove himself. He is also very rich but left mostly to himself, his parents don't seem interested in him.

I think that after the events of the after credits scene, Spiderman is going to become somewhat of an outcast (kind of to contrast this movie's theme of "it's hard to be a hero" with a bit of "it's even harder when everyone thinks you're a villain"). Maybe he will have to go into hiding. Maybe he will be cut off from all the cool technology and support that SHIELD offered him. That's where someone like Flash could be very useful - he has the means to help out Peter and since he knows him and knows he's definitely not a cold-blooded murderer, plus the fact that he idolizes Spiderman, I think he would be instrumental in helping Spiderman redeem himself.

I know it's nothing groundbreaking, but I thought I'd share.Everyone goes by the explanation in Deathly Hallows given by Dumbledore as to why Harry didn't die at the end of the book. He says: because Voldemort took Harry's blood to recreate his body, Lily's protection kept Harry from dying. This statement does not work with the evidence of the event.

1. When Harry was hit by the killing curse as a baby, it rebounded and killed Voldemort, necessitating that he create a new body. This did not happen the second time.

2. When Harry was hit by the killing curse as a baby, it left a visible mark. This did not happen the second time.

3. To destroy a Horcrux, the container must be destroyed.

Three is the important one here. Harry needed to be destroyed for the part of Voldemort's soul to be killed. Had Lily's protection been responsible for the survival, he would not have died. Hence that portion of soul would also not have died. So, Harry must have been killed.

When Harry was in Kings Cross in his head, he could have chosen to move on. Which means he was dead. There was some other force at work which gave him the choice to return to life, without needing the methods Voldemort had to use to create a new body. And Harry had something of that level of power with him - master of the united Hallows: he had the stone and the cloak, and the curse was cast from the Elder Wand, which he was currently master of. 

Because Harry chose to not defend himself, the Wand was not defeating Harry, so its allegiance did not change. Dumbledore even comments on it, "And that, I think, will have made all the difference." Had he tried to duel, he would've lost allegiance to the wand when he lost, and simply died.

Dumbledore lied to Harry. Probably to protect him - knowing you're the master of the Hallows could make anyone power hungry.

**EDIT: Additional proof:**

Because Harry sacrificed himself to protect others, the people in Hogwarts had the same protection that Harry had when Lily sacrificed herself to protect Harry. From the book:

"I've done what my mother did. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them."

For that to have actually affected everyone, Harry would've needed to truly dieEmperor Palpatine is generally accepted to be one of, if not the, smartest characters in the Star Wars universe. He's definitely politically savvy, having brought down the Republic and the Jedi single-handed. But there's another guy who has a different sort of intelligence that surpasses anyone, and who is almost always completely overlooked - Han Solo. I'm talking genius level intelligence here, the guy is a math wizard who can do calculations in his head better than any astromech droid. We're shown, time and time again, just how good Han is with math so let's start at the beginning:

In A New Hope, while performing the jump to lightspeed Han explains to Luke, "Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova, and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?" But here's the thing about that scene, Han is the one who appears to be programming the hyperspace route which means he's the one doing the calculations. He doesn't own an astromech droid, and as we'll discuss next, Han only uses the computer on board the Millennium Falcon as a last resort. I should mention here as well that Han is performing those calculations while under fire and evading an Imperial Star Destroyer, demonstrating an impressive ability as both pilot and math genius.

In The Empire Strikes Back, Han has C-3P0 talk to the Falcon's computer to find out what's wrong with it only after they're stuck inside an asteroid hiding from Imperial pursuit. While on Hoth only Han and Chewie worked on the Falcon and seemingly without help from any droids. Han also seems reluctant to even have C-3P0 hook up to the computer, and we know it's the first time he's ever done so because he says to Han, "I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect." I think C-3P0's choice of words here is important. As a protocol droid C-3P0 knows over six million forms of communication, why would this random computer's dialect be notable in the first place? Because he's trying to be polite. Saying the computer has a peculiar dialect is a diplomatic way of saying, "Bro, your computer is a dumb shit." I think Han's attachment to the Falcon is based on something deeper here, and the computer being dumb as shit touches on that. If Han is a math genius than the Falcon is a ship that Han can pilot freely, using his full ability and without being held back by a droid or computer that's slower than him. He is proud of the Falcon because he is proud of the things he's been able to accomplish with it, and I'll touch on that more.

We don't see other pilots or characters jump to hyperspace without help from an astromech droid (assuming also that larger ships have navigational computers). R2 is the one that gets the ship to lightspeed at the end of Empire Strikes Back, and we don't see Rey pilot the Falcon to lightspeed until the end of TFA while accompanied by R2. Lando did pilot the Falcon in ROTJ, but we don't see whether or not they have an astromech hooked up in the back.

And speaking of TFA, Han jumps to lightspeed from inside a hangar and is also able to bypass Starkiller's shield by passing through it at lightspeed before crashing into the planet. No one helps him accomplish either task in a ship that has been abused and neglected for years. Both tasks would also require extremely fast and efficient calculations in order to pull off successfully, yet Han does both without missing a beat.  If the computer was shitty in Empire, it must be even shittier now. The Falcon has been left on Jakku for years because fixing the on board computer is probably too costly, and is also why Unkar Plutt is so interested in getting that astromech droid from Rey. I'm sure if he doesn't want to pay to fix the computer he won't want to pay for an astromech droid, but is quick to attempt to swindle this one of a kind droid from Rey for almost nothing.  

If Han is able to do all these impressive calculations in his head without help from an astromech droid, it also explains his skill and accomplishments as a pilot. He is able to do it all himself, automatically and on instinct. There is no delay or error involved. He can accomplish the Kessell Run in 12 parsecs not because his ship is this wonderful piece of machinery, or because he had help from the most advanced droids, but because he is a damn math genius who is better and faster than anyone or anything. He can accomplish these things in the Falcon because there is nothing holding him back. The Falcon is a perfect ship for a guy like Han. Where other pilots would be handicapped by the ship he excels, he can take pride in that hunk of junk because everything that ship has accomplished has been 100% his doing. I'd also like to point out that when Han talks about the things he's accomplished he always credits the Falcon and never boasts about himself. It's a bit of misdirection to keep others from seeing him for what he really is.

Lastly, I think Han being a super genius also explains a lot about his character. When we first meet Han he presents himself as this cocky scoundrel with a checkered past. But we know that this isn't the real Han. This persona he puts on is to keep people at arm's length. Part of the reason may be that he has difficulty relating to people. This explains his son's disappointment with him as a father, why Han runs when it all goes to shit, and why he keeps a Wookie as a co-pilot. He may also be using this persona to avoid being detected by the Empire. If they found out about his intelligence the Empire would want to recruit him. Avoiding Imperial detection may also explain Jabba's bounty. He dumped his cargo to avoid being caught smuggling by the Empire because he didn't want to be seen as too good of a smuggler. We've seen him be a better a pilot than that, avoiding the Empire should be easy for him. He doesn't need C-3P0 to tell him the odds because he already knows them. He doesn't ask if something is possible before he does it because he already knows it can be done.

I don't think you can explain Han's accomplishments or abilities through luck or force sensitivity. Those things would be too convenient to explain away his strengths. As a character, Han is unique in the Star Wars universe and I think him being a super math genius is a convincing explanation.Alright, this movie is already old, but I’m new to reddit, and I finally can get it out my system (and I’m amazed I cannot find other posts like it, but I might just have used bad keywords).

So: Thanos IS a villain. He’s never been a good guy. Even when you have the best intentions in the world, if you plan involve a genocide and trumping every one that disagree with you: that’s textbook tyrant. There’s no debate here.

BUT, in endgame, the Avengers are ALSO the villains.

See, the movie (super)hero trope is pretty straight forward: just put your own interests aside to help others. The more you’re willing to risk just to make the world a better place, the more heroic you are.

That’s why the Thanos/Avegers pair works so well: Thanos plan on sacrificing the life of others for his own goal, while the Avengers would sacrifice themselves for others not to die. Simple, efficient: great premise for a story.

In every other movie, the plot is kicked-off by some sort of external threat, and the heroes have to overcome their weakness to defeat the threat. In Endgame however, there is no threat. The whole movie is set in motion by the own selfishness of the Avengers.

They can’t cope with their losses, they cannot stand their failure, so they decide to revert the snap. They do not ask around what the rest of the humanity thinks. They do not reflect on the impact of bringing back dead people after 5 years of mourning would have. They do not think about the countless catastrophes that would be caused by instantly snapping back 3 billion humans. They do not think about the 5 years gap, people that were in planes, husband and wifes that have found someone else, and God know how many other trauma such an event can cause…

Nope, they just think about themselves, their wounded ego, and their sadness.

How do you call a character that is willing to put everyone else’s life (and sanity) in jeopardy to achieve his own goal ? A Villain.

&#x200B;

And this is what bugged me so much about this movie: it’s a superhero movie without hero. Infinity War works so great, Thanos is a real bad guy, and you want the heroes to succeed. Whereas in Endgame the more you think about it, the more you realize how awful the goal of the Avengers are…That could’ve been a very interesting and plausible story: even the Avenger would lose their mind in such a situation. But that’s not how it is shown in the movie. In the movie the Avengers are framed as heroes and the ending is supposed to be the happiest ending. And this is just not the case.The short version:

Pierce's "bequeathal" to Abed was **choosing him to make a documentary about his final moments on Earth**.

For the benefit of any non-*Community* fans out there who haven't seen that episode:

"Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking" is a fan-favorite episode from the second season of the famously offbeat cult sitcom *Community*. In the episode, the old and curmudgeonly **Pierce Hawthorne** tricks his friends into believing that he's *dying* after he's hospitalized due to an overdose on prescription painkillers following an injury that leaves him temporarily confined to a wheelchair. While in the hospital, he concocts an elaborate scheme to emotionally and psychologically torment his friends by giving each of them a final parting gift (or "bequeathal") before his "death", with each bequeathal being specifically calculated to exploit each character's defining insecurity or character flaw. The ensuing story is essentially a drawn-out character study that uses the premise to explore the flaws that each member of the group struggles with. To briefly recap:

* **Shirley Bennett** (who's kind and loyal, but often insecure and judgmental) constantly worries about what her friends really think of her, so Pierce gives her a recording of the group talking about her behind her back.
* **Britta Perry** (who's passionate and idealistic, but often clueless and hypocritical) wants to contribute to a humanitarian cause that she passionately believes in, so Pierce gives her $10,000 to donate to the charity of her choice.
* **Jeff Winger** (who's handsome and charismatic, but often compulsively seeks other people's love and approval) is still haunted by his father abandoning him as a child, so Pierce arranges for Jeff to meet his father so that he can finally have the closure that he seeks.
* **Troy Barnes** (who's friendly and talented, but aimless and seeking a purpose in life) worries about not living up to his full potential, so Pierce tries to inspire him by arranging for him to meet his idol LeVar Burton.
* **Annie Edison** (who's intelligent and hard-working, but often pushes herself too hard) struggles with her compulsive need to be the best at everything she does, so Pierce gives her a valuable diamond tiara in recognition of her being his "favorite".

As we gradually learn, however, each gift has a cruelly ironic dark side that's specifically calculated to make each character miserable, forcing them to confront and/or question what they *really* want out of life—because Pierce staged his fake death to get back at his friends for not taking him seriously and excluding him from their fun.

* Shirley's gift forces her to confront her natural tendency to assume the worst about others, and she's forced to decide whether she *really* wants to know what her friends actually think about her—which makes it all the more ironic when she listens to the recording and learns that they actually *do* like her.
* Britta's gift forces her to confront the fact that she doesn't always practice the political ideals that she preaches, as she's tempted to keep the money instead of donating it.
* Jeff's gift forces him to confront the fact that he never really came to terms with his father's abandonment, making it all the more ironic when it turns out that Pierce actually lied about finding his father.
* Troy ends up having a complete emotional breakdown when he meets LeVar Burton, and finds himself too nervous to even speak to him—forcing him to confront the prospect of being a disappointment in the eyes of his hero.
* Annie is forced to confront her natural tendency toward overachievement as she faces the idea that she wants to be "better" than the people she loves most.

Notably, though, the one character who apparently *doesn't* get a bequeathal is **Abed Nadir**. In fact, "Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking" is one of a handful of *Community* episodes where Abed spends most of his time offscreen—because Pierce asks him to document his final moments before his "death", and the entire episode is presented as a documentary *filmed* by Abed (hence the title). Since he spends most of the episode behind the camera, we rarely see Abed, and he doesn't get a bequeathal.

My theory, though, is that filming that documentary *was* Abed's bequeathal.

As weird as that might sound, it fits exactly the same pattern as the five other bequeathals: it's calculated to fit his personality profile, it results in him getting exactly what he *thinks* he wants, but it ultimately turns out to have a cruelly ironic twist that feels appropriately matched to his defining flaws.

As any *Community* fan will tell you: Abed's defining trait is that he's an aspiring filmmaker with an encyclopedic knowledge of popular culture, giving him a heightened awareness of commonly used plot devices and storytelling techniques in fiction. He's also a socially awkward geek who understands movies and television much better than he understands people, and he doesn't always know how to handle it when real life doesn't adhere to the same rules as fiction.

By giving Abed the opportunity to personally document the powerful story of five people confronting the death of a friend, Pierce gives him *exactly* what he's always wanted most: **the chance to be a great filmmaker**. But that "gift" also ends up having a cruelly ironic dark side, since it means that he's stuck behind the camera and forced to watch helplessly as his best friends all confront their innermost flaws and failings. And in the end, he's forced to confront the fact that his documentary is based on a lie—since Pierce wasn't really dying. While maybe not *as* painful as Jeff's realization that Pierce lied about finding his father, that kind of discovery would also presumably sting for someone like Abed, who's spent years dreaming of making a great film that can actually move people emotionally.

Not to mention: when his "documentary" ultimately falls apart with a messy and unresolved argument between Pierce and the rest of the study group, it serves as yet another painful reminder to Abed that real life doesn't always get cozy resolutions like the movies that he loves. Abed even comes pretty close to saying that in his closing narration, where he admits that his documentary didn't turn out like he'd hoped it would.

*"I thought the documentary format would be like fish in a barrel. But as is the case with a real barrel of fish: after a while, it can become cramped, chaotic, and stinky. Fortunately, if your documentary is turning out just as messy as real life, wrap it up with random shots which, when cut together under a generic voice-over, suggest a profound thematic connection."*

In other words: real life isn't always as moving or poignant as the movies—and while it might sometimes *seem* to have a deeper meaning, that's usually just a clever editing trick. For somebody like Abed, who likes to believe that life really *does* play by the same rules as the movies, that's a painful realization to have. And by forcing him to arrive at that realization, Pierce forces him to undergo the same painful self-examination as his friends.

**TL;DR:** Pierce's bequeathal to Abed was giving him the opportunity to become a great filmmaker by making a powerful documentary about his "death". In the end, though, he torments him by making him watch from behind the camera as his documentary is revealed to be a sham, forcing him to confront the fact that life doesn't work like in the movies.In Lilo and Stitch, even though she doesn't get as much screen time as her younger sister Lilo, the character of Lilo's older sister Nani shows a real effort to create a strong young adult  female character whose life doesn't revolve around a romance plot, maybe at the time a first for Disney.

Nani has it pretty rough.  She's trying to raise Lilo as a parent, work a steady job, and keep CPS off her case - all while dealing with the loss of both her and Lilo's parents, and the ways it's affecting her younger sister's behavior.  The way the CPS agent behaves towards Nani is pretty horrible when you think about it - this girl obviously was drowning in stress, pain and doing her utmost to hold it all together, and needed help, not threats.  On top of that, her sister brings home a bizarre "dog" that turns out to be a dangerous and destructive alien fugitive. 

Nani is the driving force behind the movie's central emotional theme - "Ohana/Family", and not abandoning or forgetting family (even if they've passed away).  This is the lesson that sticks with Stitch and helps him bond in a real way with Lilo and Nani both.

Probably the biggest show of Nani's character's happiness being based around keeping her family safe and happy, not romance, and a big show of respect to her as a woman, is in the existence of the male character who *is* interested in Nani, her coworker, but to the very end of the movie remains only her friend, being turned down for dates by the overtaxed Nani, whose priorities in life are definitely nothing to do with dating at that time.  There is a possibility of a future romance there but at least in the original movie, there's no real suggestion that it will or won't happen.  Nani isn't ready for all that with everything on her plate, and both the film, and the male character in question, *respect* Nani and her decisions.  The guy doesn't insist on dating her.  He doesn't vanish from their lives either after being turned down for dates.  He shows he really does care for Nani, and by extension, Lilo, by being content to remain her friend and to help relieve some of her stress, taking the family surfing and assisting Nani in other ways.

Why is the idea of him being interested romantically in Nani even introduced, when it goes nowhere?  Because the movie doesn't see Nani as a person who is not worthy of being desired as a romantic partner, in spite of her life circumstances.  She is a fully rounded individual.  She's crush-worthy, but chooses to focus on her family-centered and work-centered goals despite knowing she has a potential suitor waiting to sweep her off her feet.  She is able to put that aside, almost exasperated with the idea of being expected to find time to date on top of everything else going on, and she keeps focus  for the goals she knows are essential for her and Lilo's happiness as a family....  and her suitor doesn't have so little interest in her as a human being as to go skulking out of her life when she won't agree to a date.  He still wants a friendship with her regardless.   Nani is one of the most progressive young women depicted by Disney in an animated movie ever.Here is my evidence:

1) Michael’s parents are divorced. He remains close with his mom but doesn’t speak with his dad. The reasonable inference is that the divorce arose out of some problematic behavior by his dad.  

2) Michael rarely ingests any alcohol or drugs himself. The only occasions I recall are (1) the business meeting at Chili’s; (2) the time he smoked a “clove” with the hot girl with a lip ring at an Alicia Keys concert; and (3) at the dinner party with Jan.  All of these are situations where he was drinking to comply with a social norm. If his father was an alcoholic, he may prefer to avoid alcohol generally. 

3) In the Meredith intervention episode, Michael tries to physically force her into rehab. It seems very important to him that she goes, despite his character generally being pretty self-centered.  Additionally, in that episode, he asks the cashier if 5+ bottles of vodka is enough to get the office drunk.  Watching his father drink excessively, he may not understand how much an average person drinks. 

It’s a stretch, but I think there’s something to it. During the Book 1 Episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender - "The King of Omashu" Aang has to go through Several challenges placed by Omashu's Earthbending King, Later revealed to be Aangs old friend Bumi. Bumi kept teaching Aang during these tasks to think outside the box and to not use just what his initial plan would be.

According to the "Avatar Extras," a series of Directors Commentaries added to each Episode.

" Many Avatar fans consider this a "filler episode", that is, it doesn't advance the over arcing story line of the series. They're as crazy as the king. " 

And at first glance to this Episode, it is kind of filler...It didn't really advance the plot at that specific time. However the moral it taught Aang lingered on till the very last battle with Fire lord Ozai.

I believe that Bumi's challenge was part of the reason Aang found another way to beat Ozai. Aang was already opposed to killing, And everyone, even his past lives (Including a former Air Nomad Avatar) told him "You'll probably have to kill the Fire Lord" But his refusal to just give in and stoop to the Fire Nations level of violence gave him the chance to learn outside the box: Spirit bending. Which Aang used to take away Ozai's bending.Okay so the Netflix movie Bird Box frightened me when I first watched it. I'm not gonna lie - something about mass involuntary suicide just really gets under my skin, and so of course - being a Supernatural fan - I'm gonna try and figure out a way to take the fight to the monsters. 

First up, we need to establish that we can actually interact with these creatures in a way that goes beyond being made to kill ourselves. We see their shadows pass by windows on several occasions, and towards the end of the film, Girl reaches out and believes that she is touching Mallory. She is actually touching one of the monsters, showing that although they are invisible they are (at least sometimes) physical entities. Further backing up their tangible nature is their apparent inability to move through the walls of houses. If a door is closed, they cannot get through it - and this is why the school for the blind works as a shelter towards the end of the movie. If they were intangible all of the time, they would just immediately overrun the shelter, which has the highest concentration of living humans in the area. 

Okay, so now that we've established that they are physical and can be touched - we can operate under the logical assumption that this means that they can also be trapped or maybe even hurt. They cannot get through walls, closed doors or even thin glass windows without someone else opening it for them (many supernatural creatures can't cross boundaries without being invited, but nobody ever invites the BirdBoxers in, so I'm saying that they don't operate under this same rule). Thus, we could theoretically capture one of them in an enclosed space. But to do this, we would need to be able to see it - and know how big to build the space. 

In the scene towards the end where the monsters are chasing Mallory and the children through the forest, we see them quite clearly part a group of trees to move towards their intended victims. 

[The exact moment ](https://imgur.com/gallery/TrB4CMo)

Here we can see that the monsters are quite sizeable creatures, and we can also take a guess at the species of tree that they are moving through. First I found out where the movie was filmed - that specific scene took place in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park (1) - and then went on to take my best guess at what sort of tree it is that we see being pushed by the creatures here. Judging from the look of it in the film, and some helpful information on the park's official website - I have concluded that it is most likely a Port Orford Cedar (2). These trees are between 150-200ft tall (3), meaning that we have a minimum height for the monsters. If we take the middle value of that range, cos that's most likely to be closest to the truth - we could say that the monsters are, at least, 175ft tall. Obviously this is a minimum height for the monster in that scene, and in order for the monsters to seamlessly pass underneath lampposts and other structures as they do in the first outbreak scene, they would presumably need to be smaller. Being supernatural in nature, they would presumably be capable of shapeshifting. All that we know from my previous research is a height that they assume at one point in the movie - but this is helpful because I somehow doubt that they get much taller. You wanna know why I think this? In the first outbreak scene, two things are distinctly lacking from the suicidal chaos: 

1. People jumping from roofs. I know that Olympia chucks herself out of a window (haha lol SHUT UP OLYMPIA), but that was only on the second storey of a building. 
2. Any mention of planes falling out of the sky. Falling planes would be very destructive, with the pilots presumably having either already died or aiming to kill themselves by crashing their aircraft. We see this to a lesser extent in Avengers: Infinity War when a helicopter crashes into a skyscraper in the end credits scene after what is essentially the apocalypse. 

The conclusion that I can draw from this is that they have a maximum height that they can reach. This may not make much sense in the context of a spiritual creature, which is presumably capable of travel by air - but it's what the research suggests. I know that there is a cut scene in which suicidal birds attack Mallory's boat, but that was cut out and I'm only operating by film logic here. I would say that their height would be somewhere around 200ft in the forest scene, and so I would also double this to 400ft to make room for shapeshifting in the scenario that I am about to suggest. 

I say that we catch ourselves a monster. Build an airtight structure with solid walls on all four sides, and have it be at least 400ft tall. The average skyscraper is at least 330ft tall (4) and so this is not unrealistic to ask, especially if we would be repurposing an existing building in this post-apocalyptic setting. 

Next, we would need some bait. The creatures are clearly attracted to human presence - they follow our survivors when they are driving through the city and they track down and chase Mallory and her kids pretty quickly in the forest, which is far away from the city - so they would've presumably had to do some travelling to get there. This means that they actively hunt and seem to know where living humans are. So originally I thought that we could use someone on death row to act as our bait, but then I remembered that sociopathic individuals seem to become maniacal worshippers of the monsters and this is most certainly unhelpful for our investigation. Instead - I think that our country's bravest would have to volunteer themselves. The military are trained to be capable of giving their lives to a cause, and what better cause than that of potentially saving the entire human race? So we have a military volunteer. We strap said soldier to an upright gurney (think Hannibal Lecter) with tight straps around their arms, legs, neck and head. Two blindfolded guards will stand on either side - there is no way that soldier is killing themselves. Okay so we put the soldier, turned away from the door, in the room and have a powerful light source coming from one of the adjacent walls. This will mean that the monster will cast a shadow when it comes into the building - and we can know when it is fully 'in' the room before we close the door. There will be two doors in the room, one on either side of the room - and the soldier is facing towards one of them right now. The monster is trapped in the room, and so now we turn the gurney around so that the soldier can see the monster. Obviously the soldier will become suicidal, but will not be able to kill themselves. Now we open the second door, which is actually connected to a double door system - like a cleanroom airlock - and wheel the soldier through while making absolutely certain that the creature does not follow it. We do this by placing one of the same light sources in the small space between these two doors, thus enabling us to observe the movement of the creature without suffering the ill effects. That way, we can know if the monster has followed the test subject. 

Now, we have a suicidal soldier, a confined creature and still no way to hurt the monsters. Don't worry - that's coming. Although suicide is the main thing on the minds of those who have seen the monsters, we have observed twice in the film that they are still capable of other things. For example, Tom shoots at one of the cultists before shooting himself, and Olympia says 'you're not too bad' before hurling herself from a great height. Therefore, it is evident that some degree of higher awareness and concern for completing prior tasks exists in the minds of the victims, and so it would not be unreasonable to assume that we could get the restrained soldier to talk about what they saw, and we could even put the soldier in the space between the airlock doors and then have them directly observe the creature's reactions to later experiments. 
Okay so the next thing we're gonna wanna do is work out how to kill or hurt the monsters. I have some theories, and although they're not very fleshed out yet, we have a captive monster on which to test them! 

Theory one: Salt, silver and iron. 
Although Supernatural has sorta turned it into a meme, the folklore behind using these three materials to hurt supernatural or demonic entities is long and rich. Everything from werewolves to fae can be seriously hurt if not killed by exposure to silver, and the monsters from Bird Box are certainly spirits in nature. I've seen another poster on this sub suggesting that the creatures are actually Zana from Romanian folklore, which would make sense seeing as that was where the outbreak started. I don't really think that mass suicide is Zana's MO, but that's beside the point. Zana (and the Pooka mentioned by Charlie as a possible candidate for the identity of the monsters) are both fae - and so would be hurt by silver and iron. Fae are all obsessive-compulsive to a degree, meaning that they have to pick up and count each grain of a substance dropped on the floor. Salt (which hurts demons and ghosts (5)) would count as a granulated substance against fae. The Varios Daevas and the other creatures mentioned by Charlie would all ostensibly have a negative reaction to salt, iron or silver. So we test it out and see the creature's reaction in its shadow - or get the suicidal soldier to tell us what happens. 

Theory two: Another religious/folkloric one - prayer and exorcism. A YouTube video I watched about the movie came to the conclusion that the monsters represent a warped form of faith - the belief in something without being able to see or explicitly interact with it - and were somehow demonic creatures come to punish humans for lacking faith. And so we  get leaders from all extant world faiths to come and perform a blessing/prayer/exorcism while standing, blindfolded, in the space between the airlock doors. We see how the monster reacts. 

Theory three: Literally just cycle through the periodic table. If silver and iron don't work then maybe some other element that we overlooked might? 

Theory four: Water. They don't actually swim after Mallory and her family while they are on the rapids - instead choosing to get one of their cultists to attempt to lure them to shore. No whispers from nearby are heard during the rapids scene - correct me if I'm wrong. Perhaps the creatures are capable of being drowned? 

Theory five: Bright, focused light. This is the second weakest, with theory three being the most slapdash by far. Gary draws the monsters as shadowy creatures of various body shapes, but always as dark beings. What gets rid of shadows? Light. Obviously if this was the case then it would've become apparent earlier on in the investigation when we used the bright lights to observe the monster's shadow. And no, this wouldn't impede on their ability to move around outside - they might only be hurt if they are hit with very high intensity light. 

Okay so let's say that none of these theories were correct. This is the last bit of my massive essay, cos I think it had certainly already strayed into TL;DR territory. We need to find a better way to coexist which doesn't involve the entire human race dealing with blindness and the whispers of malevolent spirits for the rest of our existence. I propose the use of an amnestic drug. Seeing as the creatures' abilities are clearly not based on pheromones or more biological phenomena - as BD Wong's 'Greg' character dies from observing one of the entities on a CCTV screen. This must mean that there is something specifically in their appearance which drives humans insane and forces them to kill themselves - and so what if someone was exposed to one of the creatures but was then made to forget what it looked like? The most commonly-used group of medical drugs which can cause amnesia are benzodiazepines, and a 2010 study suggested that use of drugs could be used to remove the emotional response to traumatic memories in PTSD patients (6). If this doesn't work, then we could first take brain scans of our suicidal soldier before running one last test on him/her. We see if the suicide-inducing effect has a cooldown period. Perhaps, once the sudden raw emotion of seeing one of the monsters subsides, the extreme desire to kill oneself also fades? I suggest testing the soldier's behaviour using a fake knife every 24 hours for a year or a month - whichever is more feasible - and if that does not work then anaesthetise them in one last attempt to save their life. 

Okay so when I said that that would be the last bit of this essay? I lied. One more. If we can't work out how to hurt the monsters or how to survive seeing one, then maybe we could repurpose the sort of motion detector that was on the car to be a handheld device. This wouldn't require any wifi or mobile signal - cos of course those are the first things to go in an apocalypse - but would allow the blindfolded survivors to tell when there is a creature close by.

EDIT: For all those asking how we could observe the creature's shadow without dying, I've drawn a rather crappy diagram of the whole setup with the light sources and everything. The window is covered in paper like it is in the survivors' house. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/KiUmzpV**Who Framed Roger Rabbit**

The weasels were not actually killed by Eddie when he was getting them to laugh to death.

They were just doing shtick, caught in the moment. Like Roger pointed out earlier in the film, when you do something like sing "Shave and a Haircut..." a toon cannot help themselves but finish the shtick. 

Turning into angels was shtick. They were still able to interact with their bodies and environment in their angel forms, as well as the fact they were visible at all in angel form.

Discovering the "Dip" (which is actually just paint thinner), was a big deal since it was noted as the **only** way to kill a toon.

Only one of the weasels died; the "main" one, was kicked in balls by Eddie, flying into the Dip Tank. Notice he did not turn into an angel. He just disintegrated.

Only three characters were killed by Dip in the movie: the Shoe (by Judge Doom demonstrating the Dip), the main weasel (kicked by Eddie) and Judge Doom at the end. None of them turn into angels, they just disintegrate into an inky mess.TL;DR: “This weapon is your life.” 
If being a Jedi is your life, then your lightsaber is the representation of that life. Obi-Wan takes his former Padawan’s Lightsaber as a symbol that not only has Anakin lost himself to the Darkside, but also his life(so he thinks).  Obi-wan later gives this lightsaber to luke, metaphorically placing Anakin’s life in Luke’s hands. 

The Theory:

Obi-Wan hands Anakin’s lightsaber Back to him. “This weapon is your life,” he says

This seemingly throwaway line could point to more in the lore of Star Wars than previously thought.  The lightsaber is key to the prequel era Jedi. Building one is an essential component of becoming a Jedi Knight. It is built using the force by a Jedi student to complete their training, and through that, it becomes a part of that Jedi.

 It is a symbolic representation of who they are and what they are. If being a Jedi is your life, then your lightsaber is the representation of that life. It is your very being represented in a hilt of metal and a beam of light.

The Breakdown

When Obi-wan defeats Anakin on Mustafar, he takes Anakin’s lightsaber representing that he is taking away this symbol of Anakin’s life physically and as a Jedi. The sith have taken his mind, but Obi-wan takes his life(so he thinks). Obi-wan keeps it all those years as a token of the brother he lost and the life he could not save. Though Vader lives, Anakin is gone.

When he passes the Lightsaber down to Luke, He is Literally and metaphorically placing Anakin’s life in Luke’s hands. A life that Luke will redeem later. He is also placing the life of a Jedi into the hands of luke, starting him on a destiny that will turn him into a Jedi master.

I know the sabers change, but it is not really about the specific saber. Both Anakin and luke change theirs. It is more about the symbol that it represents—the life it symbolizes.I always thought the reason he could slightly move Mjolnir but not actually lift it had nothing to do with Mjolnir's judgement itself. I honestly think he would have been deemed worthy. So why couldn't he? Because he doesn't consider himself worthy.
We saw in the first Avengers movie that Thor biefly couldn't summon the hammer to him after Coulson's 'death', which I interpreted as him feeling like he failed. He was able to pick it up a few minutes later, after all, and I don't think Mjolnir is that picky.
Bringing it back to Cap, Age of Ultron almost directly follows an entire movie's worth of events that would have him consider himself unworthy. Terrorist organisation he thought he'd wiped out had really been alive and well all along? Check. Previously dead BFF is actually alive and could have been saved? Check. Probably hundreds of people die whilst bringing down terrorist organisation for the second time? Check. Fails again to save BFF and now has no idea where he is? Check.
If the poor guy didn't have self esteem issues after all that I'd be concerned.
So when the hammer budges that's the sign of its approval, but it couldn't go any further because he didn't have his own approval.I forgot which movie it was but they talked about how the stronger the Avengers get, the greater the threat to their world and the universe gets. My theory is that Iron Man had a direct correlation with this arms race accelerating. At first, we see his tech directly accelerating a personal arms race, then a city wide arms race, then country wide capable of destruction. This ramps up all the way until we get to the Age of Ultron where Tony’s tech is supposed to defend the world but is also capable of destroying it. This launches us into the age of Thanos. Everyone gets exponentially stronger during this period up until the end fight where both Thanos and Iron Man die. We get a minor reset in the timeline until what I believe is that his daughter comes of age. Let’s say she’s around 4-5. The next spike in universal struggle will be when she’s around 15-18 and becomes a prodigy that takes over the Iron Man (iron woman) and Stark mantle and those like Spider-Man will have to step up again and defend the world/universe from the next existential threat. 

Maybe this isn’t as much as a theory as an identification of causation but I believe we a gap in the technological growth that can be achieved at rapid speeds without a stark on the map. Yes, wakanda has future tech. But we don’t know how fast they accelerate that tech. Tony and his father were developing things at such rapid speeds it that it caused difficulties as well. (Both positives and negatives)The common interpretation of Luke Skywalker's final moments seems to be that he died because he was exhausted. However, I believe that he didn't really die, at least not in the way we usually think of it. Typically, the Jedi would die and then become one with the Force. However, I think Luke just became one with the Force and could not escape it, no dying required.

When projecting himself across the galaxy, the Force was flowing through him so strongly that he was **levitating**. He obviously wasn't doing it himself, since it serves no practical purpose. He was just so in tune with the Force that it was lifting him naturally.

The Force has been described as letting go of your conscious self. So I think he completely let go of himself on the island, using all of his strength to place himself on Crait. With his mind so connected to the Force and spanning such a huge distance, he was only able to return to his own body just long enough to see the twin suns. And it's not necessarily that he surrendered himself willingly. I don't think he planned to die. I think he just couldn't come back after what he managed to do.

In addition, it makes sense that his mind might leave his body. I mean, by it's design, this move needs his entire consciousness to be within the Force. This isn't just reaching out to others, like we've seen many times before. This actually has an effect on the physical world. And he himself, all of his mind and feelings, is consumed by the Force. If you think about it, he was basically a ghost before dying. You could say that he was already one with the Force before he faded away.

Rey says that he died with "peace and purpose," but I don't think dying from weakness is really peaceful. No, I believe he was at peace because he had finally experienced the true power of the Force. Like he had achieved enlightenment and was worthy of moving on. Think of Dave at the end of 2001. Don't get me wrong, it clearly took a toll on him, but I don't think that's what killed him, especially since he seems to rest as he watches the suns. You'd think that if he was too weak to go on, he would've drifted off to sleep like Yoda did.

This is probably the most powerful use of the Force ever seen in a Star Wars movie before. So powerful that he **became the Force** in the process. Ultimately, he's in the same place as the other Force ghosts of course. But he got there in a very different way. The difference is that Luke did it through sheer power, while Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin did it as a result of dying.

So Luke didn't exactly die. Well, he did. But it's more like he ascended to the next level. And he sure as hell didn't die from being tired.

Edit: TL;DR Luke didn't die from exhaustion. The act of projecting himself required such a strong connection that it made him one with the Force before dying.The ending to far from home (were everyone learns who Spider-Man is) was put in place to explain why Spider-Man is not in the upcoming movies. 

In short Disney knew they were gonna ask for more money from Sony and Incase Sony said no they had this set up to send Spider-Man into hiding to explain why he doesn’t appear anymore, and if they ever do get the rights back then he comes out of hiding.

Not the best theory in fact it’s more of a passing thought but thought I’d share anyway

Edit: 

In light of the recent news I guess not lolHaven’t found anyone to really discuss this with so wanted to bounce this idea around.  I’m pretty certain the monsters are similar to Lovecraftian Horrors.  The monsters of the lovecraft world are other dimensional creatures defying human understanding and logic.  They typically either create madness within those who encounter them or they inspire cult-like devotion to worship them as gods.  

When you combine how they affect people, with the drawings of black tenticled monsters sketched by one of their fanatics, it almost becomes clear these monsters were at least inspired by, if not fully part of, the lovecraft universe.

Now, on to my theory about Tom.  Everyone who saw the monsters got weird eyes.  When they did, they usually had a moment of clarity and began to worship them, or their eyes and mind went blank, they had a completely subdued or “Gone” look to them and then seemingly killed them selves without any cognition or control over their actions.  It is alluded to, with the criminals for example, those who suffered from a form a clinical psychosis became followers, while more typical people lost control and killed themselves.  Aside from the fanaticism, the worshipers retained cognitive function. They could think, act, respond, have free will, etc.

Now lets look at Tom’s death.  Tom sees the monster, his eyes go crazy, and you don’t see terror, or vacancy in his expression. You see anger and determination.  He kills the last fanatic to save his family, and then, of his own free will seemingly makes the choice to end his life.  No blank stare, no mindless suicide, a choice to kill himself.

Now look at tom’s back story. He was a soldier serving in a war-zone.  He saw things which deeply changed him and alludes to this a few times.  My theory is Tom suffers from clinical PTSD from his time in the military.  When he saw the monster, he retained his cognitive ability because he too, was turning.  He knew what he saw, he knew what he would become if he allowed himself to live, so he made the conscious choice to kill the fanatic and then end his own life before he could become one of them. I think its safe to say Forrest ran a sub 4.4 - 40 yard dash and more than likely could have won the Heisman trophy while playing college football for Legendary Coach Bear Bryant at Alabama. He was named an All-American.. He was so fast he was almost untouched everytime he returned a kickoff. 

He also was strong enough to carry multiple soldiers off the battlefield by hurling them on his back and running at a full sprint. 

He only tried ping pong because it was easy for him and it was all he could do while in recovery. He pretty much won medals in ping pong because he couldn't run track. So his eye hand coordination was world class to say the least.

He had a point in his life where all he did was run all day. For years...he was questionably the best athlete of his generation.

Also want to point out that at no time was he ever rivaled by anyone athletically. He is literally the superior athlete throughout the whole entire movie in everything he does.Theory first stated by japanese Twitter @Ink_Virtue and put together for you guys by me:

The First Generation (RBY) is the beginning of our timeline, happening at the same time the Third Generation (RSE) takes place in different region.

Three years later, the Second generation (GSC) happens at the same time that the Fourth Generation (DPP) takes place in different region.

Fifth Generation (BW) happens 11 Years after this.

Two years after, B2W2 happens.

Evidence to all of this is present on games.

So, where would Pokemón Go be located in that timeline?

It is the beginning of the Pokemón Era! PoGo happens before all generations, without early Pokemón history.

**Here are the evidence:**

* Not all of the 151 First Generation pokemon are present in game. Professor Oak, years later, would be the first to make a PokéDex containing all pokemon in Kanto region.

* Just like in Safari Zone, when you encounter creatures in the street, trainers ONLY throw (recently invented) PokéBalls and try to capture monsters without battling to weaken it's opponents.

* That happens because the concepts of strategic battles were not invented at this time. There are no experienced trainers in this universe yet.

* Because those concepts of strategic battles were not invented, trainer still don't know how to teach new moves to their pokemon.

* Also, trainers don't know how to use battles to rise the levels of their pokemon, so they use Candies. Those candies were overused and in the future, by the time RBY takes place they are very very rare to find. They are now called "Rare Candies".

* The traditional fixed Gym Leaders, as all the structure of the League Pokémon has not been established. That's why Gym Leaders change all the time and there's no Gym Badges.

* Trades don't happen because the huge machines used to make the pokemon respect another trainer where not invented yet.

* Aerodactyl, Omanyte and Kabuto that are long extinct by the time of RBY can be seen in the wild.

**So who is Professor Willow?**

We have seen him before. Willow in japanese is Yanagi. We had have met another trainer originally called Yanagi by the time of GSC. It's the Gym Leader Pryde. Now let's have a look on both of them:

So, whats your thoughts on that one?

**TL;DR:** Pokémon GO is actually the first game in the Pokémon Timeline, taking place even before the original RBY games.

EDIT: [Here's how an youtuber plagiarized the whole thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5et05o/plagiarism_the_guy_from_the_game_theorists/)The new end credits scene will tie past and future together. 

The original theatrical run had just the sound of hammering as a call back all the way to Tony in the very first MCU movie and symbolized what Marvel has forged since then. I think that this sound will still be present in the new end credits scene but there will something new. Fading in during the hammering will be a metal mask which will look suspiciously like a certain famous villain. 

With the acquisition of Fox’s comic properties, Marvel now has access to some of their incredible villains, like Dr. doom. He is a human villain so if done right audiences will be able to sympathize with him. He is a genius intellect, a king, practices magic, and is tied to the fantastic 4. This will allow him to interact with Marvel’s technology focused heroes - Shuri, the Iron Family and the Ant-Family. He can interact with our royal heroes like Black Panther and Namor. Act as a rival for Doctor Strange & co as well as play around in the cosmic pool. 

By including the metal mask, Marvel would tie past and future together with the sound clip and create a ton of excitement for phase 4The "snakes" that St. Patrick famously drove out [were actually Celtic pagans](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/recycled/2009/03/st_patrick_revealed.html), who, for the purposes of this theory, will be actual witches and wizards. Salazar's ancestors were the only survivors, and for generations they lived and propagated in secrecy. By the time they produced our founder, the values we've come to consider classically Slytherin were well entrenched in the family, and for good reason. Of course you'll be cunning and ambitious when you're fighting extinction. Of course you'll be proud when you're the last of your kind. Of course you'll distrust Muggles when they nearly wiped you out. Those traits haven't aged well, but what comes off as snobbery and bigotry to modern witches and wizards was vital to the Slytherin family's survival. Among the numerous lightsaber battles depicted in the Star wars films, the one that tends to garner the most laughs and not counted as the best depicted fight- would be first one we see- between Obi Wan and former apprentice Darth Vader.

It's no triumph of choreography, they tap swords and lightly spar like- almost toying around like two friends almost playing rather than two enemies honestly trying to do the other one in- but that would be missing the point.

That's because it's not a fight, it's a conversation. It's an attempt at communication under the guise of Jedi/Sith protocol. See a Jedi: Draw lightsaber. See a Sith: Draw Lightsaber. It was mandatory.

In truth- the fight could probably have been over in seconds- Vader overpowering Obi Wan rather quickly- but instead they hold a rather lengthy conversation with one another. Vader, gloating at his gained strength and Obi Wan sending his message of warning.

Also Obi Wan never intended to make it off the Death Star. His sacrifice was deliberate- meant to allow him to pass on become a stronger force to aid Luke, as well as to create the perfect distraction to keep Vader from focusing on the real problem; Luke and Leia escaping.



In the films of the franchise, we see Bond using many trinkets that are impossible to be real. Invisible car, explosive pen, etc. And I believe that for he good work, MI6 created a human pheromone for he to win over all the women he sees ahead. He also serves him to locate criminals he is looking for on a mission. This can also be used in the theory that Bond is just a codename, because he would not make sense that all James Bonds would be conquerors, but because they all use it human pheromone.Been playing Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit again and it got me thinking.

Every time the cops send out a [roadblock](https://i.imgur.com/QTrUo3j.jpg), there's one car length missing (with a stop sign barrier in it's place). From a video game perspective, it's just the spot for the player to aim for to not hit the roadblock.

But realistically, why would cops leave such an easy target? Well, because one cop didn't show up to work today, you. In the game you have a career as both a cop and a racer, and under the same name even. It's not overtly implied it's a different timeline or anything.

I think the player hates roadblock duty, and when he's assigned it, goes racing instead because he knows there will be a weak point in their strongest defense.

This would also sort of explain how a random illegal racer has like Knight Rider technology specifically designed to deal with cops technology, even going as far as to have the same spike strips. Where might one get the *exact same* spike strips as the cops? Perhaps his job, at the police station.

This would also explain things like the Level 3 Jammers "always updating database of police frequencies"

In Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, you're a rogue cop.Every problem in that household comes from them buying a TV.

In the first episode, they spend their savings on a TV. Which depletes their savings. Which causes stupendous problems after Frank loses his job. 

Frank’s depression is amplified as he spends hours watching TV. It emasculates him further by forcing him to watch “real men”, which are real sexist pigs living out power fantasies. He has no control over what he watches much like he feels like he has no control over his life.

In the final episode of season 2, when Frank gets his job back and a sense of love and security is restored to the family, they also get rid of the TV! 

Because a house is happier without TV.

Watch Netflix.
So I was watching Encanto for the 18th time because I have kids and was thinking that not all of the gifts made sense for the way the family was presented. It makes sense to have a daughter with flowers to support florists, a healer in a town with no doctor, strength in a town with no construction equipment, but some of the other family gifts don't make so much sense in a purely beneficial/benign family that is tasked with leading a town.

It wasn't until i got to Camilo's ability to shape shift that was briefly explained as "Baby Sitter" that got me thinking: This is a skill/power normally associated with infiltrators and spies. 

The inciting incident for the miracle was an attack on innocent villagers by unspecified attackers on horseback. Colombia has had a long history of armed conflict and a scene or two from that is on screen. The miracle was spawned during an act of war. 

Now all the powers make sense. The original miracle sealed off the valley and provided an automated fortress capable of repelling attackers. When setting up a resistance, the first step is securing a safe base of operations. The miracle did that. Not only do the Madrigals have a defensible headquarters in a sealed off valley that will keep out future incursions, they also have a population of loyal civilians to support any on-going efforts.

The three Madrigal children represent the bare minimum for a defensive position:

* Bruno's foresight would provide advanced warning of an attack and allow for defensive preparations. 
* Pepa's weather ability would make traversing the mountains surrounding the valley nearly impossible, and it being tied to her emotions means that any attacker who posed a threat would be on the receiving end of some gnarly weather. 
* Julieta's healing makes her the medic, capable of healing anybody who were harmed in battle or through the fortification efforts.

The grandkids continue this but get even more specialized. 

Recon/Infiltration/Intel: 

* Dolores continues Bruno's recon role, but can hear everything in the valley which would include attacking soldiers. 
* Camilo could infiltrate the enemy by posing as an enemy soldier either for recon or sabotage. This also could be used to gather information.
* Antonio's ability to talk to and command animals puts him in a split role of intel gathering and infiltration.

Logistics: 

* Isabella is the murkiest and most perplexing use case until i realized that while her overt role was making flowers and being perfect, maybe as an ambassador role, her true logistical power is creating food. If she willed it, she could raise a field of corn or wheat to wait out a siege. 
* Luisa would singlehandedly be able to raise fortifications. At one point she was sent to divert a river. She can also move buildings and relocate supplies. 
* Mirabel appears to be the inheritor of the fortress. She has the strongest bond of any of the Madrigals with Casita, including Abuela. She's also shown to be the next natural head of the family when she matures. 

So, no wonder the town loves the Madrigals so much. They are the town's benevolent dictators, defenders, and well-intentioned gods on their own Mt. Olympus. I also kind of want to see the Madrigals try to take down Thanos.

Edit: TL;DR: The Madrigals gifts were born of war and they are warriors of one sort or another.There has been some trouble connecting the worlds of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto franchise with its Red Dead series. 

While there are some similarities such as places, items, and characters (or their similarly named/looking descendants) being found in both game worlds; there are also undeniable differences, most notably the names of locations.

For example: the state California and New York City do not exist in GTA, being the state of San Andreas and Liberty City instead. However in Red Dead Redemption, California and NYC definitely do exist.

By further muddying the waters and introducing Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower' multiverse to the equation: I think I've figured how these two worlds can be so similar and so different at the same time, and also offer some interesting insight into the nature of the worlds and how they differ from reality.

In The Dark Tower, there are multiple realities and they are all connected to the titular Tower.

Notably, many of these worlds are incredibly similar to ours, but none are exactly alike. Cities will have different names, like the Metropolitan city of Lud instead of New York City, or sometimes places will be slightly off like when two characters from slightly different versions of NYC argue over where Co-Op City is located.

These slightly different manifestations are known as Twinners, and they pop up all over Stephen King's work.

There are definitely twinners in Rockstar Games, most notably the Bigfoot Hunter who appears in the Old West and in San Andreas, telling you he's been on this mountain for "longer than you'll ever know".

In addition to connecting the worlds through the Tower, this also helps explain some other interesting facts in Rockstar Games: Why everyone is so hostile or aggressive and The Dead-Eye Trigger.

In The Dark Tower books, the Gunslinger Roland explains to his proteges that there are forces trying to destroy the Dark Tower, and that without it and even increasingly as it weakens, the multiverse would fall into chaos. There are also beings from the space between worlds (Pennywise from IT being one of the most famous of these) that amplify and then feed on negative emotions.


In the Red Dead games our protagonists are crack shot gunslingers who possess and ability known as the Dead Eye Trigger, literally able to slow down their perception of time for pinpoint accuracy. I mean, it would take like 15-20 government agents ambushing you to kill you in a gunfight.

But those games are supposed to be about Cowboy Gunslingers so it's probably just a cool feature, right?

Well, in the GTA series, there's also one person who can perform the Dead Eye Trigger, playable character Michael Townley AKA Michael De Santos. No matter how much gun-play you engage in as other PCs Franklin or Trevor, they can never get this ability, suggesting it is something innate to Michael, perhaps even something passed down genetically.

This has been a little all over the place, but to sum up:

The Rockstar Games share a multiverse with Stephen King's The Dark Tower. This is why the Rockstar games are both in slightly different Americas that are both different from our own; this is why the Rockstar games have aliens and supernatural occurrences; and this is why some characters in the Rockstar games are natural Gunslingers.After re-watching Up, I actually find the reason for Russell lacking his final badge at the start of the film to be quite simple.

At the beginning of Up, we know that a construction company is continually expanding, by buying up all the land in the area and replacing it with skyscrapers. We also know that the company is aggressive in its attempts to gain land, with Carl being offered ever increasing offers to sell his land, before ultimately being evicted by court order to Shady Oaks Retirement Village.

My theory is that most other elderly people in the city are being influenced by similar offers and/or threats, and as a result voluntarily give up their homes and either move to the retirement home or away from the city completely. This explains why Russell was so desperate to assist Carl, despite the latter initially refusing any requests for assistance, because Carl's stubbornness meant he was one of the very few elderly people left in the city that were not in the retirement home. And therefore, if Russell failed to assist Carl, it would be virtually impossible for him to earn his last badge, as there would be no one else left for him to potentially assist.It's often said that we get our *ahem* "IQ" from our family 

In fact it's been proven that if you come from a family individuals with low IQ scores, you will in fact attain a low IQ as well. 

Of course this can increase or decrease due to effort drugs etc, so its not definite, however its been proven to be true time and time again. 

So this begs the question, where did Jimmy get his intelligence from if both his parents are average minded? 

The answer is simple, one of them is playing the fool. 

Have you ever noticed how eccentric Hugh is? 

How he always tries to act stupid or be the center of attention?? 

It is also often said that highly intelligent people play the part of the fool to disguise their superior intellect for fear of criticism. 

So why would Hugh act stupid? Well there are several reasons. 

1- he is a grown man and he doesn't care about being a genius, what does he have to gain? He is a simple man. (This does not reflect upon his intellect, mind you), he just wants to eat pie and be the best father for Jimmy he can be, thus he has no reason to demonstrate his genius because it's more fun playing the fool. 

2- he doesn't want to steal the spotlight from Jimmy. He knows that if he acts smarter then Jimmy, people will recognize him as the genius, and he wants what is best for his son. 

So what evidence points to Hugh Neutron as the one who gave Jimmy his genius? 

He was president of the Brain Teaser club in highschool 

Despite being an "idiot" he always knows how to turn on or use Jimmy's inventions, (almost like he wants Jimmy to save the day so he becomes popular and beloved) 

He has a high memory storage capacity and is shown to remember every type of pie, although he forgets Apple. (Possibly intentionally). 

In the episode with the time rewind device, Hugh "accidently" sends Jimmy back 2,000,000 years ago so he can use the device for lolz, but the odd part is that he is "dumb" enough to know to stop his wife from stopping him and he seems to know how to rewind time when leaping out of a plane to exactly the moment before he jumped to avoid falling to his death or breaking multiple bones. In fact he seems to use this device with accurate perception, (whereas a fool would likely kill themselves using it in some manner)

He knows a lot about ducks and possibly even their anatomical system for all we know. 

He is able to clean up Jimmy's lab (as he states he has been doing for a few years now) WITHOUT destroying it or causing chaos.


Hugh always seems to act stupid intentionally, (as stated before) possibly even lying to feign stupidity, in one instance when he went to Jimmy's school play, he stated that he paid $125 for tickets, which his wife replied "Hugh, this is free" and he goes (almost dramatically with his hands over his face) "I should've known better.."  it is unlikely he actually paid and he is simply lying to play the fool, as he would have nowhere to present these tickets and thus would've known beforehand. 

Another odd thing is the episode with Taco Shack, Hugh talks about just driving by and waving to Jimmy and heading to Taco Shack, and even brings a stick with him to smash the pinata, replying "what am I supposed to do with this stick?" It seems..forced. why would there be a pinata at a restaurant? Maybe Taco shack does have a pinata. But it seems like he brought it so he could go "wow look at goofy hugh again, he has a stick! Hyuck!" Again, playing the fool. 

Or the episode when they are painting Jimmy's house, Jimmy falls off the ladder and hugh just goes "well, you're the genius" and does the same. A NORMAL person, hell, even a person with low IQ would not do this. They would make sure Jimmy is ok, or would climb off the ladder and check on him, it's hard to explain but they wouldn't do it. 


If anybody can muster up any more evidence to back up this claim, please leave it in the comments. 

I haven't watched Jimmy Neutron in ages so I cannot remember a lot of it. HahaHe was made by a nine year old Vader wasn't as confused as he was surprised. He knew what happened, Obi Wan warned him that he would be more powerful if struck down.. He gives a hint to the power he was promised by Palpatine, eternal life. A power he could not get from a a Jedi

Yet we know that in Episode II Qui Gon has contacted--in a way - Anakin during his slaughter of the sand people. He heard his voice. We can assume Qui Gon had been contacting Anakin/Vader in some way throughout his life, and if we assume that Vader has at least had a suspicion of becoming one with the force, it brings much more context to Vader awkwardly pushing around the robe after Obi-Wan disappeared. 

He can't believe what happened. He can't believe it's true, the Jedi can teach eternal life, Palpatine lied to him, and he's been manipulated the entire time. This is the turning point we see in Vader this early on in the trilogy, and gives more credence to his turn from the Emperor and request to Luke to join him. This is the moment he learned the true nature of the dark sideSpoilers ahead for the boys comics and probably tv series.

So the creators and writers of the boys have done a great job of subverting the audience expectations to think that the show won’t follow the same plot as the comics, and the main reason I read that is because the main twists and conclusions of the comics are too well known at this point that it wouldn’t surprise the audience. But I believe that the reveal that Victoria neuman is a vought plant at the end of the season as well as several other clues given throughout the season show.

First and foremost let’s discuss the character V neuman, Victor in the comics and Victoria on the show. In the comics Victor is a complete moron who basically does whatever vought tells him to do and eventually rises to become Vice President in an attempt to get the govt to legalize compound V. In the show we all thought they weren’t going in the same direction when they transformed Victor into Victoria and made her a smart ambitious politician who seemingly was against vought at every turn, but then it’s revealed that yes she has powers and yes working for vought, so despite spending the entire season trying to convince us otherwise, in the end her plot is in line with the comics plot for her character. 

This logic of trying to subvert the audience while in the end following the same original plot lines can be applied to almost every character in the story.

People think there’s no way Black noir can follow the same comic book path (spoiler: he’s a clone of homelander in the comics) in the show, especially after we saw a portion of his face in the almond bar scene, but in the finale we learned that he’s in a coma. Don’t be surprised to see him come back in episode 1 next season as if nothing happened, because what better opportunity to put a new person under the black noir mask than when the original one is in a coma.... the face reveal was clearly to throw off the scent of the audience to think well ok that characters arc is changing.

In the comics hughie ends up taking compound V and getting powers. Well almost all of his dialogue talks about how normal he is and how he wants to be something more etc etc... foreshadowing

In the comics Mothers Milk gains super powers when he drinks his mother’s breast milk after she was injected with V. We learned this season that his family including his father had a long legal battle with vought... over what? Probably what vought did to him and his mother.

I can go on and on about every character but all this to say don’t believe the show writers or YouTube reviewers and theory crafters when they say that the plot of the show and characters arcs are changed for the tv series, they may try to trick you with gender swaps and clever writing, but without a doubt they are following the comic book plot to a T.**!!!Edit 4 has been made!!!**

**\*Also i wanna thank whichever one of you crazy mfs giving me gold. Stay humble\***

I was re-watching the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-dvTjK_07c) for nostalgia purposes and came up with the idea while watching.

&#x200B;

The video starts off in an empty and trashed nightclub, a party that time forgot. Time is rewound to said party and Usher appears on the scene. I believe usher is reliving this party, as a kind of goodbye to this plane of reality

Now, throughout the video Usher is shown to be able to control time, slowing down time so he can bust a few extra moves. He also looks rather out of place at the party, almost like he isn't actually there. Nobody pays attention to his  presence and I don't know about you, but I'd notice a guy doing 2010 style moves at near light speeds. Thus, this has led me to one conclusion. Usher is dead, and is a ghost reliving this night in this club. Maybe its the night before he died, maybe its his favorite night of his life, but he's reliving it one last time.

Now what about Pitbull? He is also shown to be observing Ushers time manipulation, but not directly controlling it. This would mean he is a ghost too, but he doesn't appear to be there for the party. He could simply have died around the same time as Usher, and are both experiencing this same party.

That leaves one final question, how did they die?

The line "Last night of our lives" is used frequently in the song, It is possible he knew he was going to die, a fight may have broken out after the night ended, or he could have simply partied a little too hard.

&#x200B;

Hope this was somewhat entertaining, I'm gonna go find a better use of my time

&#x200B;

**Edit:** After a previous commenter u/Jooks64 mentioned, the end of the video has Usher not going into the light, the screen then goes black. I believe Usher was sent to hell or limbo, not before having one last night on this earth. This can also explains how Pitbull ties into this. **Pitbull is the Grim Reaper**, which explains how he can perceive Ushers time manipulation. He's there to keep an eye on him while he has his last (last) night of his life (life) before hes taken to his final destination

If anyone else wants to add to this, comment. In the mean time I'll be trying to figure out how this is got to the Hot page on r/FanTheories

**Edit 2:** A number of users have mentioned the lyrics of the song and how they may add to this theory. I wanna thank u/Polenball and u/D_Comic_Boi for mentioning this.

"I feel like a zombie gone back to life" Usher has been 'reanimated' in a way, similar to a zombie. (Usher's almost making it *too* easy)

"no control of my body" Given that he is a ghost, hes got no actual control of his body.

"downin' drinks like there's no tomorrow, there's just right now " As this isn't actually reality and he is just a ghost, there IS no tomorrow.

u/Polenball also brought up a good point about pitbull's possible roll as Grim Reaper

In English folklore there is a black dog that's associated with death, going as far as signifying death in a family if spotted. Pitbull's are known for their aggressive behavior a and feared for the disproportionate number of deaths attributed to them. Pitbull is seen wearing a black suit in the music video.

&#x200B;

u/PSiPostscriptAlot also mentioned a similar situation happening in the music video for [Love in this club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB5e0zHRzHc). Is there a possible connected universe going on here?

&#x200B;

**Edit 3:** We may have figured it out boys. I wanna thank u/tauntthechicken for expanding on this idea further

So, I've come to the conclusion that Usher is in limbo, and has been given the ability by Pitbull and the other spirit's in these videos to relive his best moments in life over and over. But, he cant change them. Any regrets that he had in the living cannot be undone, and thus his regrets never go away, slowly creating negative energy. This is what Pitbull and the others feed off of. They create these Illusions such as the girl in Love in this Club to constantly remind him of what he could have done, but never did

This shit is getting really dark, anyone got any ideas on how to lighten this up?

**Edit 4:** I wanna thank u/sirius4778 for pointing out another video that may connect to this Usher Expanded Universe

In the music video for the Usher song  [Climax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNTyfVh3nmU), Usher is shown murdering the husband of the woman he is making love to, while simultaneously witnessing these events. I believe this is the moment when he realizes he cannot redo his mistakes, and will have to live with his regrets forever, which can be seen in his facial expressions in the end of the video, and him driving away from where the murder would take place.

u/keaunutheives also mentioned a possible connection to Pitbull's music videos, how his time manipulation and Grim Reaper like appearances show up in some of them, along with Mr 305's calling out how he came from "The bottom"The paper itself extensively covers the topics and conclusions of the abstract below. I decided to write down all the ideas I had floating around in my head regarding metalbending, but never imagined it would turn into a project of this scale. At first I never intended to share it, but 20 pages, 81 sources, and 3 kind editors later, here we are.

As I state in the preface, I would love any and all feedback, as I envision this piece as a living document which contains the most up to date and accurate information possible. I hope you enjoy reading this piece as much as I enjoyed writing it; I hope you learn something, and I hope it makes you think analytically about the topics at hand and the world around us. Thanks :)

**EDIT**: link now directs to v1.6 as of July 10, 2020.

**EDIT v2**: link directs to v1.7 as of August 23, 2020. This version contains updated canon info from the second Kyoshi novel

To comply with the sub rules, here's a pseudo-abstract:

In the canon of Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra, metalbending is a sub-discipline of earthbending developed by Toph Beifong in 100 AG. For the following 70 years, this skill, long thought to be impossible, was refined and eventually passed along by the Beifong matriarch to countless students, where it became a—still rare—but well-known feat of earthbending. The canon explanation for the phenomenon of metalbending states that earthbenders cannot bend pure metal and that the act of metalbending requires the sensing of impurities within the metal, which can themselves be bent. This explanation raises the necessity for a geological, physical, or chemical rationale for what can and cannot be bent.  The investigation of earthbending and its sub-discipline of metalbending has revealed a set of theories which may be applied in discussion and analysis of metalbending abilities, and which are consistent and scientific in their application. First and foremost, most of the refined metals known to be bendable are able to be manipulated due to the unavoidable layer of oxidation which forms upon exposure to the atmosphere. The mechanism of action for metalbending pure metals and alloys involves the manipulation of this oxide layer. Platinum reacts slowly if at all with oxygen under atmospheric conditions and as a result is predicted by this theory to be unbendable if purified or slightly alloyed. Gold is similarly unreactive in the atmosphere and is hypothesized to be unbendable as well. Sample homogeneity also appears to play a role in the relative difficulty with which a material may be bent. Evidence indicates that samples which are more heterogenous on the structural and chemical level are easier for earthbenders to manipulate. Although it is unlikely to be a major factor with regards to bending refined metals, this theory can be applied in justification of the relative ease with which metal meteorites are observed to be acted upon in comparison. It is, however, notably inconsistent with depictions of crystalbending, a seemingly novice-level earthbending sub-discipline of a very homogenous material. Finally, it appears that the manipulation of metal ions either free in solution or chelated by ligands is possible, but only for the most advanced metalbenders. This technique is surrounded by uncertainty due to the infrequency of its use and scarcity of its practitioners but is evidenced to be possible all the same, and the ability may be inversely correlated to an ion’s hydrated radius. Its application by Avatar Korra in the removal of mercury ions from her own body presents the discussion of a new Avatar level application of metalbending: control of oxidation and reduction of metals—at least in one’s own body.Note: this theory is not my own. Also *Spoilers* for the ending.
But here goes: 

In the Episode “Slapsgiving” Future Ted when your Ex dates someone new, your brain tends to exaggerate their flaws and so It made Bob look a lot older despite him only being 40. Now considering that Future Ted is the narrator and throughout the entire series he still has feelings for Robin, and at the end of the series Robin and Barney get married, whose to say that maybe Ted did exaggerate Barney’s flaws being a womanizer and a horrible person?**Edit:** A lot of you are getting very defensive of Prof. Hulk's strength as if I called him weak. I know he's strong, I still think it's clear he's not as strong as OG Hulk.

**Edit 2:** There are a lot of people here who don't seem to understand how a collapsing building works. Prof. Hulk does not hold up an *entire* building. A collapsing building, especially one that is blown up by weapons and has debris flying all over the place, does not have all its matter fall in one, Hulk-sized spot. It's even crazier to me how many people ignore that point in my comments and try to claim he is, or try to claim I'm downplaying the strength it takes to hold that rubble up. Let me make this as clear as I can, **I am not saying Professor Hulk is weak, so there is no need for ya'll to get so damn defensive about him.** I am *only* comparing his strength to OG Hulk, who is noticeably bigger and angrier than Professor Hulk.

I believe Banner is actually now stuck in his Professor Hulk form. We're led to believe he has complete control over Hulk now, but I don't think that's really the case. First of all, he is clearly smaller than the Hulk we're used to, and we don't see him display his strength nearly as much as Hulk does, even in the heat of battle. I believe in Professor Hulk form he is weaker than Hulk, and can't even get stronger from being angrier.

If he was able to increase his power to higher Hulk levels, then we would've seen that happen in the most important battle of the universe. He's still very, very strong, just not Hulk strong.

Another reason I think he's stuck is because of his eating habits. Wouldn't it make sense to turn back to his normal Banner form to reserve as much energy in his body as possible? If he could remain in Banner form, he would require much less food and other resources that he needs in Professor Hulk form simply because of his size. In my opinion, it would be weird for Bruce to be choosing to remain weaker in fights, as well as choosing to remain in a form that requires more sustenance.

The only two explanations I can really think of that would make him choose to stay in that form is if it's a type of PTSD, and he remains in that form out of fear of being attacked with his guard down, or because he's afraid that if he leaves that form he may not be able to control it again.After watching Man of Steel, I was left with the obvious question of 'why don't Kryptonians exist outside their solar system?'. Why do they shackle themselves to a planet with a sun and atmosphere that is literally poison to them, especially when it is shown that they had colonies at one point, though these colonists have all since died. Did they just voluntarily withdraw to a backwater hellhole of a world, rather than enjoy a galaxy of superpowers? This seems odd. Seems like bad writing.

Then in Batman v Superman, when Lex attempts to create a mutated Kryptonian, the computer warns *'Action forbidden - it has been decreed by the council of Krypton that none will ever again give life to a deformity so hateful to sight and memory - the desecration without name.'*

This clearly indicates that a Doomsday-like entity has occurred before, most likely through mutation, and presumably caused such destruction that anything risking the creation of another such being was forbidden. This potentially sheds light on why all Kryptonians are generated from the Codex, which appears to be a repository of DNA from an ancient ancestor - doing this would ensure that the gene pool never strays too far, that genetic drift never moves them away from baseline kryptonian stock into mutant, doomsday-ey territory. This is why natural Kryptonian conception is [HERESY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOHFCuLj2uI), as the random mixing of genes could potentially create an unstoppable monster.

My theory is that, at one point in the distant past, the Kryptonians had a decent interstellar empire, expanding and colonising yellow-sun worlds with access to their full kryptonian capabilities, and reproducing naturally, until eventually one or more Doomsday mutants started to be born. As shown in the BvS, Doomsday just gets more and more powerful the longer it is alive. Assuming they have all of superman's powers dialed up to 11, they are capable of flying in space, potentially becoming a roving, interstellar threat. Before long the empire would be beset by unbeatable monsters destroying colonies left, right and center. 

The last Kryptonians retreated to the only place the monsters couldn't go - Krypton. The red sun would drain the doomsdays' powers the moment they entered the star system, and the atmosphere would render them weak to their weaponry. The codex was set up to regulate births and the population indoctrinated with a fear of leaving the planet (even in the face of certain destruction) as doing so might risk luring this mutant threat to Krypton. Eventually the doomsdays died off but by that point Kryptonian civilization had turned too stagnant and fearful to venture out again.

tl;dr: The threat of doomsday mutation shackled kryptonians to a dead planet and stagnated their societyWhen I was a kid, I used to think Ratatouille took place in the present, around 2007, the year of the movie's release. However, looking back on it, that doesn't make sense. There is a lack of contemporary technology: no cell phones, no computers, and no color TV. After doing some thinking, it seems to me that the most likely time for Ratatouille to take place is in the mid 1960s, around the same time as The Incredibles. This is due to a number of factors: Larousse, one of the chefs at Gusteau's, is said to have ran gun for a resistance group that lost. As this is in Paris, France, the last war there was World War Two, implying that Larousse ran gun for the Vichy French, which were the Nazi puppet government who ultimately lost to the Free French and Allies. Considering the war ended in 1945, and Larousse is around 45, he likely ran gun as a young adult (maybe 25). This points to the film taking place roughly 20 years after the end of World War Two, so around 1965. This is corroborated by the presence of Bomb Voyage from The Incredibles. That movie has a known date, 1947 in the flashback and 1962 in the present. As Bomb Voyage was a superhero at the same time Mr. Incredible was (1947), he too was certainly forced to renounce the superhero life and blend into society. It makes sense that he would return to Paris and lead a normal life, and as 1962 and c.1965 match very closely, it seems like the two films could take place around the same time. Finally, there is the issue of Mabel's gas mask. The mask appears to be from World War One, which ended in 1918. The fact Mabel still has it implies that she has owned and lived in that house at least since the war. Say that Mabel is 80 years old. Assuming the film takes place around 1965, she would have been around 30 when the war was going on, which means Mabel, or perhaps a late husband of hers, were perfectly old enough to own the house. Thus, I suggest Ratatouille is set sometime in the early to mid 1960s, around the time of The Incredibles.Fairy Godmother and Fiona's parents had it all planned out for Prince Charming to rescue Fiona. Fairy godmother especially was banking on the arrangement, as it would allow her son and by extension *her* to inherit the Kingdom of Far Far Away.

Just imagine how earth-shatteringly furious she and Fiona's parents would have been after finding out that some stunted, egotistical, petty and impressively chinned Lord had made a deal with a grumpy Ogre with a heart of gold to save their daughter and FG's ticket to Far Far Away, for him to marry.

Duloc is a small Lordship that is utterly dwarfed by the Kingdom of Far Far Away. Duloc isn't very defensible either, as this answer by Matthew Zehl on Quora regarding the defensibility of Duloc clearly shows:

"Duloc, the fortified city of Lord Farquaad in Shrek, isn't all that defensible.

The wall surrounding the city is actually pretty good. We don't get much screen time with the outer wall but it is clearly tall enough and thick enough, with towers spread across its length. The first issue is the location. The city is in the middle of a flat field, and there are zero obstacles to prevent an army from reaching the walls or setting up seige equipment. Even a simple dry moat would be a big advantage here, but the location is really terrible. Then there is the castle.

This structure clearly draws its inspiration from early medieval period square keeps, common in England and elsewhere as the defensive centre of a fortification. The big issue is its size. The castle is HUGE, stretching hundreds of feet into the air. Such a monstourous structure would collapse under it's own weight, but evan assuming the Shrek universe has some magical building techniques, this wouldn't be a great defensive structure.

There don't appear to be any arrow loops or even windows on most of the castle, meaning the battlements hundreds of feet up would be the main spot to challenge attackers from, but it's so high effectively engaging enemies would be near impossible.

Additionally, the castle is huge, and the garrison needed to protect a keep this big would need to be huge. Combining the huge size, poor structural stability and flat surrounding ground, this castle would be very vulnerable to seige engines and undermining. The massive size of the place would require a big garrison, which would make hunger a very real threat. All in all, not a very effective castle."

Not to mention FG is a massively powerful magic user who could easily turn Duloc into a pile of rubble.

So in short, Farquaad's newly found Kingship wouldn't have lasted very long at all. His death at the jaws of Dragon was likely a far more merciful end, than what FG and Fiona's Parents would have had in store for him.In *Avengers: Infinity War*, Thanos talks at length about how overpopulation and overconsumption has thrown the universe out of balance, and how half of all life must be destroyed in order to restore the equilibrium.

As evidence for this, he cites his own world of Titan, once prosperous, now desolate, and described how his plan to randomly kill half of the population would have saved them. He also points to the worlds he's conquered, which are now apparently thriving.

All of this makes it seem like Thanos wants the Infinity Stones so that he can save the universe, so that he can save the *people* of the universe from themselves.

But I don't think that's true. With the Stones, Thanos has nigh-omnipotent power. He could have doubled resources instead of halving the population, for example, or sterilized half of the universe, which would gradually bring population numbers down without killing anybody.

But he didn't do that. Why? Not due to lack of creativity, but out of spite.

Thanos was furious that his plan to save Titan was ignored, and he viewed the universe at large as a mass of greedy, selfish, base creatures. They didn't *deserve* to be saved. So instead, Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to punish them, and to teach them a lesson about their own avarice.**TL;DR** Wanda tried using Arnim Zola’s mind transfer tech to save Vision, but it went horribly wrong and she inadvertently resurrects Zola and creates Westview.

**Here’s the setup**:

After the events of Endgame, Wanda starts looking for ways to bring Vision back to life. In the Avengers files she discovers that Hydra leader Arnim Zola was able to transfer his living mind into a computer. Seeing this technology as an opportunity to either bring Vision back, or for Wanda to digitize her mind to be with Vision, she travels to New Jersey to look for any remnants of Zola’s computers. 

Wanda finds backups of Zola’s mind in an abandoned bunker in New Jersey and begins tinkering with the software, unknowingly resurrecting Zola in the process.

The newly resurrected Zola quickly starts to control Wanda’s mind using the same techniques used to brainwash Bucky. Though Wanda’s mind is far more complex and begins to fracture, creating the Westview pocket dimension. 

Inside Westview, Arnim is posing as Ralph; Agnes’s husband. He stays hidden because he knows if he gets too close to Wanda she will notice him.

Arnim’s main goal is to upload his mind to Vision’s bodySo, over the last few days, I have been thinking about what the Riddler says in the trailer for the new Batman movie: "If you are justice, please do not lie, what is the price for your blind eye?"   
While yesterday someone who apparently worked on the set commented on Reddit that the first Riddler victim (the guy that was suffocated) is apparently the Mayor of Gotham, which would fit with the whole press-conference we saw.   
So what if the Riddler is trying to prove a point here? I believe the following - the reason why Riddler starts killing is that due to Batman's inaction/unwillingness to kill, the Riddler or someone close to him gets hurt. That could also partially explain why the Batman seems so much more brutal in the trailer than regular - because he wasn't brutal *enough* he created a serial killer.So Heihei is obviously an unusual chicken, but not just because he’s stupid. Let’s look at evidence:

1. He is shown at the beginning when Moana is a baby, but appears the same age when she is an adult. He doesn’t age.

2. He survives incredibly dangerous situations. ‘Fortune smiles’ upon him, even preventing him from being eaten by their starving village.

3. He is always with Moana, as if he’s inexplicably drawn to her.

My theory is that Heihei is a guardian sent by the gods to help Moana on her quest, which he succeeded in. He was judged worthy based on his heart, rather than intelligence.

Edit: I forgot Heihei is also too stupid to eat unless he is force-fed, further proving that he is kept alive magically.42 is the alphanumerical sum of "To Be".
T is the 20th letter of the alphabet.
O is the 15th letter of the alphabet.
B is the 2nd letter of the alphabet.
E is the 5th letter of the alphabet.
20 + 15 + 2 + 5 = 42

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a modern retelling of a Tibetan Budest tale of a man’s trials and tribulations in his search for the meaning of life.

What is the meaning of life? To be.
I believe 001 was planning on “dying” before the glass game as the VIP’s were coming for that and he didn’t want them to know he was playing.

I believe that he had planned on being the only person not picked to have a partner, and that would give him a perfect way to get out. Especially since it’d be a little hard to make sure he died during the randomness of the marble game and not have any of the remaining players question it.

He had naturally thought that no one would choose an old man as a partner, he doesn’t even talk to anyone to try and get a partner. But when gi-hun offers to be his partner, he see’s a perfect opportunity to guarantee his friend made it to the next level.

This also explains what happened to the annoying woman. On all the other games, there wasn’t an option of one person being left out. And killing anyone due to the old man suddenly switching things up and choosing a partner wouldn’t exactly be fair, so thats probably why they just decided to save her to have more meat to grind out.The film has a song, "A Girl Worth Fighting For", in which all the men want a domestic feminine woman, and Mulan is there, uncertain what she thinks of it all. Does she have a girl worth fighting for? The song doesn't give her a chance to say, but there is an answer, and it's not herself.

The song cuts right as they come upon a destroyed village, where Mulan picks up a small doll. We know for certain that it used to belong to a little girl that lived in the village, since earlier, Shan Yu gets the doll from his hawk, and says:

> Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll. We should return it to her.

That's her girl worth fighting for, and little girls in general. We see a  hint of this early on in the movie - during "Honor to Us All", Mulan walks by a boy who's swiped a doll from a girl; Mulan takes the doll from the boy and gives it back. Note also that after "A Girl Worth Fighting For", Mulan is more concerned about saving lives than honor until after the end of danger with Shan Yu's defeat.

So yeah, those little girls are Mulan's "girl worth fighting for".So, according to the rules of the MCU there are two types of "Magic" (en quotes)

1) There is the magic practiced by witches, and sorcerers such as Dr. Strange and Agatha Harkness. This magic is simply Science that normal people can't understand. Which means it follows the basic rules of our universe (More notably - the Conservation of Energy)

"Your ancestors called it magic, you called it science, I come from a land where they are one and the same." -Thor

2) There is Chaos magic, which breaks the rules of our universe. This is magic that is considered extremely dangerous, and is used by the Scarlet Witch.

Because Marvel very specifically separated these two, it's safe to assume that the Infinity stones are in-line with the first case. They are a product of science that us mortal meat-bags can't understand. So if Thanos was going to just poof them out of existence to never be used again, how would he do that?

He didn't...at least, he didn't do it for free. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. And in order to preform such a feat, you likely pay something equal in value. For the stones to be destroyed they have to be replaced with an equal power. The Power Cosmic.

This is how I believe that Galactus will be introduced to the MCU. We know that there are dimensions that hold beings MUCH more powerful than our own (See: Dormammu), so it wouldn't be crazy to assume Galactus is one such extradimensional being in the movies. Just plucked into our universe due to Thanos' divine tampering.***The Theory:***     We don't know what's really happened in the real MCU because we haven't been part of the prime MCU timeline since *The Avengers.*

By botching the Time Heist and allowing Loki to escape with the Space Stone, Iron Man rewrote the future so that option #14,600,005 cannot occur, so Dr. Strange traveled back in time to make sure it did happen because option #14,600,005 is a paradoxical alternate timeline where he reigns unchallenged and supreme.

&#x200B;

***Evidence:***

**A FEW NOTES ON TIME TRAVEL**

**The Hulk only knows enough about time travel to be dangerous.**    Though The Hulk literally says in *Endgame* that “changing the past doesn't change the future” like in the movies, he's wrong.  Time travel is not The Hulk's area of expertise, bio-organics is.  Stark is the one who's the time travel expert and he never really explains how it works, instead he just glosses over everything with his Macguffin wristwatch. The Hulk doesn't know what he's talking about.  He barely even knows how to use the time machine which is the easiest part of time travel.  Indeed, he and his sausage fingers nearly kill Ant-Man by pushes time through him.  The Hulk has absolutely no credibility with regards to how time travel works.

**MCU time travel is basically like Back to the Future time travel.**  Other than Iron Man, who would know what all about time travel though?  The Ancient One who guards the Time Stone.  When The Hulk comes to acquire the Time Stone from her, she tells him removing an Infinity Stone and failing to return it to the point it from which it was taken would change her reality from that point on.  In other words, **changing the past** (removing the stone and not returning it) **does change the future**, specifically HER future (and the future of all the other non-participants of the Time Heist), but not the future of the players with agency (the Endgame Avengers).  And that my friends is more or less how time travel plays out in just about every other time travel movie we know of.  The time traveler goes back in time, tweaks something and returns to a future where only they retain memories and physical wear of the original timeline.  For everybody, that original timeline never happened.

**The one horrifying difference between Endgame time travel and Back to the Future time travel.**   In *Endgame,* instead of shifting to the corrected, rewritten timeline per standard time travel movie rules, we the audience return to the original timeline along with the Endgame Avengers.  This happened because forces were at work to place us there in that paradox.  We are no longer part of the prime MCU timeline.  We are now part of an orphaned alternate timeline with no past because the Endgame Avengers having killed a younger Thanos before he assembled the gauntlet, have prevented the snap and erased the very situation that brought them into existence.  We now exist in an adjunct to the proper MCU timeline. We have no idea what happened in the real MCU because in the real MCU Loki got away with the Tesseract and Thanos died before he assembled the gauntlet.  Our new manufactured paradox reality is just what the doctor ordered though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WHY WOULD DR. STRANGE DO THAT?  BECAUSE HE'S A MADMAN**

**Strange has had a blatant disregard for the space-time continuum since the beginning.**  The first time he uses the Time Stone, Mordo warns him about the paradoxes that he could have created with it.  Wong tells Strange, “You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum, you were breaking it.”  If using the Time Stone to play with an apple is breaking the space-time continuum, what would using it to create a time loop to defeat Dormammu or to view 14 million potential futures do to it?  Obviously, Strange wasn't too concerned because he continued using it whenever he could, at least 5 times after that that we know of (to freeze Kaecilius in Hong Kong, to reverse the destruction of Hong Kong, to release Wong from the time reversal, for the Dormammu time loop, he tried to use it against The Maw, and to view futures on Titan).  It was only a matter of time before he succeeded in producing the paradox Mordo said would happen.

**Human nature and history tells us Strange is destined to go mad with power.**  We all know the saying “power corrupts and absolutely power corrupts absolutely.”  Well, as Sorcerer Supreme there's no one more powerful on earth.  Now look at Thanos, who Korath in *Guardian of the Galaxy* called the most powerful being in the universe.  He needed four Infinity Stones and for Strange to ultimately take a dive in order to “beat” him, so there's not many beings outside earth more powerful either.  Strange wields near absolute power.

**Strange is already OCD and a control freak when we meet him.**  We see evidence of this in *Doctor Strange* in his perfectly ordered apartment, with a shrine to his own accomplishments and an entire shelf just for watches with a designated spot for each and every one.  We see it in how he turns down a difficult surgery in order to preserve his perfect record.  We see it in how he embarrasses Dr. West because it was more important to put him in his place than focus on the brain surgery he was in the middle of.  We see it in *Ragnarok* in how annoyed he is by Thor accidentally knocking over a knife display.  We see it in *Infinity War* where he formulates an entire plan on how to defeat Thanos and then shares it with nobody, which is exactly what he did in *Doctor Strange,* when he abandoned the fight with Kaecilius to take on Dormammu directly without so much as one word to Wong and Mordo.

**Strange was driven insane during his negotiations with Dormammu.**    He was killed over and over again (10+ times that we saw), but who knows how many more times he died that we didn't see?  No one is coming out of that kind of trauma the same.  The good doctor who sought to do no harm died (literally and figuratively) in the Dark Dimension and the Sorcerer Supreme working for the “greater good” at any cost emerged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WHY IS FUTURE # 14,600,005 SO IMPORTANT TO STRANGE?**

**The “greater good” is really just about total control.**  In *Civil War*, General Ross tells us that his heart attack gave him perspective.  The change in his perspective is that you can't fight fire with fire anymore.  There is a better way; you have to contain the chaos and bring it under your control.  Strange comes to the same conclusion.  As protector of earth and guardian of the Time Stone, the greatest good isn't a reactionary response to an attack, but a preemptive strike that nullifies all possibilities of attack.  Just as General Ross used the tools he had available to him (The Accords) to reign in the Avengers, Strange uses what he has (the Time Stone) to bring the universe under his control.

**No one on earth is left to challenge Strange.**  In future #14,600,005, all potential threats on earth capable of taking on Strange have been eliminated.

* Stark, Vision, Ultron, The Ancient One  – dead.
* Thor – fled to parts unknown.
* Hulk – crippled.
* Captain America who could theoretically rally and unite who's left – too old.
* Wakanda – looming political crisis as whoever's been running Wakanda for the last five years probably isn't going to just step aside for T'Challa.
* The only threat left is Wanda who he's either going to battle or “help” her in The Multiverse of Madness.

**No one outside earth is left to challenge Strange either.**

* Thanos, Ronan, Loki, Hela, Ego, Odin  – dead.
* Asgard – destroyed.
* Xandar and the Nova Corps. – decimated.
* The Kree – now so weak that they reluctantly agreed to end a 1000 year war with their archenemy, Xandar.
* Surtur – exploded and tumbling endlessly through space.
* Malekith and the Dark Elves – extinct.
* The Grandmaster (who *Ragnarok* told us created Sakaar which means he's either a celestial or has celestial-level power) – toppled.
* The Collector (who as The Grandmaster's brother is also a celestial or potentially has celestial-level powers) – dead/fled to parts unknown.
* Captain Marvel – considering that prior to Endgame she hadn't been to earth in 20+ years, apparently has no interest in what happens on earth.
* The Living Tribunal – didn't step in during Infinity War or Endgame, so apparently has no interest in what happens on earth either.
* Dormammu – restricted from returning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PROOF STRANGE IS A TIME TRAVELER**

**Project Insight knows who Dr. Strange is.**  For the most part, up through *The Avengers,* the audience was shown everything happening in the MCU on screen as one movie built upon another.  However, that changes by *The Winter Soldier.*  Something happens off screen and is alluded to, but never explained and its more significant that we knew at that time.  While being interrogated by Cap and Co., Agent Sitwell tells them Project Insight identifies current and future threats to Hydra and name drops Stephen Strange.  Why?  Because off-screen, a future version of Strange from the period when he still had the Time Stone saw a future version Loki escaping with the Tesseract in the past and ruining future #14,600,005 in real time.  He used the Time Stone to time traveled back to the end of *The Avengers* to prevent that from happening.  Project Insight flagged Strange at that point as some kind of anomaly which is why Hydra knows who he is.

**Sitwell's name drop is awkward.**  When Agent Sitwell starts naming off targets, he starts with generic examples (a TV anchor in Cairo, a high school valedictorian, etc.), but at the end he names two explicitly (Bruce Banner and Stephen Strange) as if Cap and Co. know who they are.  Obviously they knew Banner, but they didn't know Strange.  That was a slip-up on Sitwell's end.  Project Insight keeps telling Hydra that this Stephen Strange guy is a major threat, but is unable to say why.  Project Insight's handlers, like Sitwell, likely often discuss him around the watercooler trying to figure out who the heck Stephen Strange is and what Project Insight sees that they don't, so he'd be in the habit of casually referring to this anomaly by his name, Stephen Strange, instead of by something generic like “a surgeon from NYC.”

**Nothing in Strange's life could possibly hint at his future.**  Hydra doesn't understand why Project Insight keeps telling them Strange belongs on the kill list.  Unlike others, whose political activism, life choices, or browser history is easily accessed and can be used to double check Project Insight's predictions, there's nothing in Strange's life as far as we know to indicate he'd become king of the wizards one day.  Everything in his file that we know of all point to him never being anything more than a brilliant, arrogant surgeon who's entire sense of self is dependent on his possessions and accolades; he didn't even believe in the metaphysical.  Someone like Strange should have been exceptionally easy for Hydra to control.  Project Insight should be telling Hydra that Dr. Stephen Strange is an huge medical asset to them, not a threat.

**Project Insight has occult connections.**   How could Project Insight possibly know about Strange's hypothetical off-camera time-traveling adventures though, you ask?  Well, Project Insight is a product of Hydra.  Hydra is a product of the Nazis.  History tells us that the Nazi leadership were very much into the occult.  Hydra's leader, The Red Skull certainly believed in the occult/mythology strongly enough to lead an expedition to Norway to recover the Tesseract based on it.  Project Insight is not 100% a science project, it has a magic component to it somewhere and it's that magic side of it that picks up on Strange's time travel.

**The Ancient One blames herself for the snap.**  In *Endgame*, when confronted with the fact Strange willing gave up the Time Stone to Thanos, The Ancient One immediately and rather cryptically believes she did something wrong to bring this all about.  Why would she though?  Because in that moment she realizes that Strange is just like her – a holier-than-thou rule-breaking hypocrite – but to the nth degree.  She admits in *Doctor Strange* to peering through time and orchestrating events to prevent countless terrible futures.    She now knows Strange took that same course of action to its time traveling extreme and that it had to have happened on her watch as she's Sorcerer Supreme during *The Avengers* and *Age of Ultron.*  She knows that she didn't then and won't now step it to prevent it because she's convinced herself that Strange is the “best of us.”   Now, she's in for a penny, in for a pound and she has no choice other than to trust Strange's plan hoping she's right about him.  That's why she feels guilty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE PRIME MCU TIMELINE VS. OUR TIMELINE**

**We don't know what happened in the real MCU.**  Both the prime MCU timeline and the alternate one from our paradox begin the same way and are identical up until the last 10 minutes or so of *The* Avengers.  In the prime timeline, at the end of *The Avengers*, Iron Man from the future shows up, botches the Time Heist and Loki escapes.  After that, it's anyone's guess what happens, but it didn't include future #14,600,005, because if it had, Strange would have just sat things out and gone with it.  However, in the alternate timeline we know as the “proper” MCU, we saw Loki taken to Asgard (because Strange time travels back to the end of *The Avengers* right before *The Winter Soldier* to “unbotch” the Time Heist which is when Project Insight identifies him as a threat).

**Stitches in Time.**  Stopping Loki is not the only time Strange edited the timeline either.  He made several trips through time to ensure future #14,600,005 happened.  He went back in time to send The Hulk to Sakaar at then end of *Age of Ultron* so he'd end up on Thor's ship, so Heimdal could rainbow blast him into the sanctum as the signal that the endgame had begun.  Originally, The Hulk would have just gone into hiding.  The Avengers also originally thwarted Thanos by destroying the Mind Stone before he got to it.  Strange called a re-do so he could personally hand deliver the Time Stone to Thanos allowing him to complete the gauntlet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TYING UP LOOSE ENDS**

**No Infinity Stones, no problems.**  The Infinity Stones have been atomized in this paradox reality.  That means no one can use them and escape from or change the custom universe where Strange has set himself up as the supreme power.

**What about Dormammu?**  But with no Time Stone, how will he prevent Dormammu from coming back, you say?  Dormammu's attack on Hong Kong was essentially Strange's first day on the job as Sorcerer Supreme.  He knew how to sling ring, cast the Mirror Dimension, use the Time Stone, make a glowy whip and that's about it.  Yet, he still beat Dormammu.  If he returns to earth again, he'll be facing a Dr. Strange with an entire paradoxical universe as his personal fief.    

**It's tragically poetic**.  Benedict Cumberbatch as Dormammu lorded over an entire reality.  Now Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange lords over a custom reality of his making as well.  Strange stared too long into the abyss and became the monster he fought.   

**The timeline checks out.**  Loki escapes at the end of *The Avengers*.  Project Insight flags Dr. Strange by *The Winter Soldier* which happens right after that.  *Guardian of the Galaxy* also happens around the same time.  Per *Endgame*, the younger Thanos who died had just allied with Ronan.  We know this because Gamora and Nebula are still on his ship instead of Ronan's.  Thanos vanishes from the real MCU (to die in our alternate MCU) before Ronan ever gets the Power Stone, while Loki makes off with the Space Stone and the Hydra has the Mind Stone.  At that same time, the Reality Stone is still hidden, as is the Soul Stone and The Ancient One has the Time Stone, so there's no way Thanos could have completed the gauntlet in the real MCU.  Yet, we saw Thanos complete the gauntlet, so we cannot be part of the real MCU timeline.   

**Spiderman: Homecoming – 4 or 8 years after Avengers?**  It's a moot point now.  What we saw is part of a paradox reality.  It's both.   

**Cap's time traveling makes no difference.**  What about Captain America traveling even further back in time?  If were working under Back to the Future rules, that would erase what Strange did and fix everything, right?  Nope.  The Cap that travels back in time to be with Peggy Carter is an Endgame Avenger who's trapped in the paradox.  Whatever past he traveled to was part of the paradox universe which paradoxically doesn't have a past to travel to anymore.  However, a paradox universe is exactly what you would need to explain Cap's convoluted story where there's now two Captain America's running around at the same time.  One is frozen in ice for 70 years, one isn't.  One is married Peggy, the other trying to hook up with his niece.  One is always tries to do right by Bucky, the other knew Bucky would be used a Soviet science experiment and does nothing.  One tries and fails to stop the snap, the other knew the snap was coming and chose to sit and watch it happen instead.  The reason Cap can't do anything to change the future simply because there is no real past for him to change.  His/Their very existence is locked into the paradox with the rest of us.    

**Dr. Strange's time traveling makes no difference either.**  Strange doesn't become Sorcerer Supreme until after *The Avengers*.  Doesn't that mean that Strange only gets the Time Stone in the alternate MCU, so he shouldn't be able to affect the real MCU to do all this stuff and split us off into a paradox?  Good question.  And to answer that question, yes, but no.  We don't know because we never saw what happened in the real MCU after *The Avengers*.  Welcome to life in a paradox.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That wraps up my third and final of DR. STRANGE IS A BAD GUY theory.  I had fun writing them up.  I hope you had fun reading them.

Missed the other two theories?  Read about how Strange used Thanos to take out Iron Man, Vision, Thor, The Hulk and the Infinity Stones [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ehd8kg/dr_strange_engineered_the_snap_in_inifinity/).  Read about how Strange's first move setting up his endgame was sending The Hulk to Sakaar [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/evjkgs/dr_strange_sent_the_hulk_to_sakaar_then_tried_to/).So this theory is taken from the YouTuber Spumwack. Its a great theory and the best about the history of the MC world, but many people dont know about it.

So basically when observing the MC sky, we see something strange. The sun and moon are always opposite of each other. This is impossible. Since the earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the Earth, the sun and moon have seperate paths in the night sky and only rarely cross paths. The only way the sun and moon will be opposite of each other in the night sky is if the Earth is always between the sun and moon, which means that the 'moon' isnt actually revolving around the Earth, it is actually the next planet over. 

This would be the end of it, but there's one problem: the stars. The stars in the night sky also revolve around the Earth at the same rate as the moon. This means that the Earth is at the center of the sun and moon, with the stars also rotating at the same pace. According to the laws of astrophysics, this is impossible, but it would make sense if we are observing the sky from the sun. This is where the dead sun theory comes into play. 

Billions of years in the future, all life in the universe will be facing a mass extinction. This is the Dying Light. Stars will be losing their fuel and start to produce less energy. Also, at this point, other stars will be so far away because of the expansion of the Universe, and new stars will stop being born. This is why even though the Minecraft world has basically no light pollution, the sky has much less stars than our sky. 

A hyper advanced civilization noticed that their star was dying. So, in a last ditch attempt to save the species, they allocated all the energy that their planet produces into making a bomb. They then sent some members of their species to space along with resources and embryos. Then finally, they detonated their planet, and the bomb was powerful enough to kickstart nuclear reactions, and their home planet became a brand new sun. 

On the stone core of their old sun, they started importing stone,water,  grass, and life. The crew sent to space entered a cryostasis and waited millions of years for the planet to become habitable. You, the player, are the last of the crew members, making a life in this familiar but not so familiar world. 

This theory explains many things. First, there's inpenetrable rock just 50m below the surface because thats the incredibly dense remnants of the dead sun, and everything above it  is just imported. The villagers/pillagers are the descendants of the embryos you imported, which explains why they're not quite  human because they evolved for millions of years on a seperate planet. These not-humans had their own civilizations, as evidenced by the ruins scattered across the land. The animals are also not quite right because they also evolved on the dead sun. The hostile mobs may be mutated animals who evolved naturally in this new environment or abnormally after an apocalyptic event the not-humans had. 

And then there's you, the spaceship crewman, who woke up after millions of years of cryosleep. You will use the resources to make a life on this world you created. And you will look up at the sun, the burning remnants of the place you used to call  home.

EDIT: Original video this theory is from: https://youtu.be/flGjWc8KF-MHere's a disclaimer aimed at the R&M writing staff, on the off chance you see this. If you're not Justin or Dan, you can skip to where I put an arrow. I heard there was once a secret story that you all dropped the idea for when you saw someone had predicted it on the internet. Here's my take on why that's not worth doing, from a comment I made to another poster: You can't have a story that no one would ever see coming. If you did, it would have to rely on such stupid contrivances and lack of foreshadowing that it would make your narrative worse. If anything, a story being predicted by just *a few* people is the ideal for a twist. It means you provided good foreshadowing without beating the audience over the head with it.

In other words, don't let fans on the internet change what you're going to write if you still believe in your story. Just because we see something coming by looking *really* hard at the clues you lay out doesn't mean we'll love it any less. In fact, we'll love it more, because it means you were thinking ahead, that we were too, and that ~~Justin, Dan, and I should rent a Yacht and sail the Mediterranean, filling our bellies taut with grappa and smoked cheeses while we explore one another's bodies under gentle Aegean skies~~ rewatching the series from the beginning will let viewers understand layers they hadn't before.

 ---->> More accurately, I think Morty has the *potential* to be as smart as Rick, and that Rick has intentionally suppressed this intelligence. This would explain a lot of Rick's behavior. Pardon if this theory has been espoused before, I am not a subscriber to this subreddit. This thought just occurred to me, and I wanted to jot it down. If similar threads exist, please link them. 

Evidence:

1. Rick discourages Morty from going to school, saying, "It's not a place for smart people."

2. When discussing procreation and romance, Rick tells Morty to, "Break the cycle. Focus on science." If Rick didn't believe Morty had the potential to follow in his footsteps, that would be a very strange comment.

3. The existence of Evil Morty suggests that Morty is capable of taking on the Council of Ricks and *winning* in an extended guerilla campaign.

4. In that same episode, Rick explains that his 'genius' waves are cancelled out by the...'Morty' waves. He pauses before saying this. Viewers have assumed this was an effort to spare Morty's feelings. However, that's not really how Rick works. He calls Morty stupid *all the time*. He seems to be deliberately avoiding talking about why exactly Morty works as camouflage, and this evasiveness is something we've seen from Rick many times. It's when he's hiding something. I don't think avoiding calling Morty stupid is sufficient to merit this. If he just needed some idiot, he's got an infinite multiverse to choose from. Why pick Morty specifically in *every* iteration of himself? Because Morty has the same 'genius waves', which Rick has known since his birth. Rick inverted Morty's brainwaves (which Rick quite literally draws for us in Close Rick-counters') to camouflage himself, and to spare Morty an existence like his own. Rick only claims that Morty is 'as stupid as [he is] smart' once Morty's ticked him off. He's just making shit up to piss Morty off.

5. In this episode (again) Rick claims that 'A cocky Morty can be a real bad thing for everyone." Morty asks 'How is that?" And Rick dissembles, "Uh, I'll explain when you're older." This directly cuts to the scene revealing Evil Morty as the mastermind of the episode's plot. Rick is clearly aware of just how dangerous and smart Morty *can* be, and also that Rick intends to reveal this to Morty someday.

EDIT: 6. Morty has (apparently with some frequency) disarmed Rick's neutrino bombs. He can do this in a matter of minutes. Rick has apparently been so shitfaced every time this happens that he has no recollection of it, which makes it likely that Morty had to figure it out on his own. However, Morty has certainly failed at this in the past - otherwise he wouldn't know how many of them are duds.

EDIT: 7. Rick must have a motivation for bringing Morty on adventures other than simply hiding him from the Galactic Authority or Council of Ricks. Both of those entities have been dealt with in Season 3, and Rick still drags Morty along for all these zany missions. My theory is that he wants to prep Morty for a future of Super Science.

So, my theory is as follows: Whenever a Beth gives birth to a Morty, their respective Rick (of course) performs various analyses on the child. Grandparenting 101 stuff. They inevitably discover that Morty has inherited the full force of their genius. Ricks then decide to invert their Morty's brainwaves. There are a lot of reasons to do this: an inverted genius wave acts as camouflage (as mentioned), it reduces competition, it allows for Morty to have a relatively normal childhood (something he never had), and if Morty can learn to survive with a handicap, he'll be that much more dangerous when Rick undoes the damage. For the record, I think this is something Rick can do at any time, and indeed intends to do. Hell, he probably just uses that gizmo that made Snowball go all Lawnmower Dog.

This is why Rick disappeared for so long from Beth's life. Morty couldn't have a normal life with him around. It's also why he came back; he needs to prepare Morty for the life ahead of him by taking him on adventures. Evil Morty is just a version that had one of the following happen: independently discovered how to reverse the damage his grandfather had caused, his Rick never inverted his brainwaves, or his Rick decided to uninvert the genius waves too early and Morty took over.

I think this is gonna be a big reveal eventually, and Morty is going to realize that if being as smart as Rick means you can't connect with anyone, can't care about anything, then it isn't worth it. He'll go back to school, start dating Jessica, and live a quiet life of ~~happy~~ not bat-shit-insane-and dangerous mediocrity.Tony and Pepper have a conversation at the beginning of Infinity War. Tony dreamt Pepper was pregnant and said, "It felt so real." Later Pepper calls Tony and begs him to stay on Earth, but the phone call is cut off.

I think Pepper is pregnant during all of Infinity War.

This will make Tony's potential death in Endgame much more suspenseful. And if Tony dies (which I think he will) it will make the death more dramatic.

This also gives Pepper a way to cope with Tony's death. A child is a way that Tony "lives on" for her so to speak.We will be going by all continental US time zones so if it's posted anywhere from the start of monday on ET to the end of monday on PT it will be allowed. All Marvel related theories posted any other time of the week will be removed.

Possible questions:  
Q. Why Marvel and not just MCU?  
A. Making it just about MCU allows too many edge cases which would make this significantly harder to moderate. 

Q. Why are you doing this at all?  
A. In the past we've let the hype movie theories just blow over (star wars etc) I think this one has ended up different because of how directly connected its story is to the next movie which won't be out for quite a while. Usually after a month or two things about return to normal and that's the trend we will likely continue to rely on in the future. In addition to all that in this case we're taking community feedback about this into account from a metapost that was made and from moderator messages.

Q. Why just a month?  
A. I like to have trial periods with a set sunset date to review rules changes. Depending on how things go and how november and december seem we may see this be enacted on a longer term basis, possibly all the way till may.

Q. Why not a megathread?  
A. The main reason is that I feel that megathreads too heavily stifle replies and discussion related to top level posts in them. Especially when those top level posts are supposed to be long form written out theories and not a sort of general discussion.

If you have any questions not answered here, need clarification on something, or want to suggest something feel free to write them in the comments on this post.Here's what I'm talking about-

* **Episode 1- The Rise of Skywalker**
   * This is where we meet Anakin Skywalker, kind of a dead giveaway in my opinion.
* **Episode 2- The Last Jedi**
   * This is where it kind of falls apart, but it could be a foreshadowing tool for ROTS by referring to Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Yoda.
* **Episode 3- The Force Awakens**
   * It "awakens" due to the birth of Luke and Leia at the end of the movie.
* **Episode 4- Return of the Jedi**
   * Luke is trained by a former Jedi Master, and the tradition continues.
* **Episode 5- Empire Strikes Back**
   * Since it's smack-dab in the middle of the franchise, I don't think a whole lot needs to be said.
* **Episode 6- A New Hope**
   * The death of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine and the destruction of the second Death Star bring hope and freedom to the galaxy once again.
* **Episode 7- Revenge of the Sith**
   * A pretty clear reference to the First Order.
* **Episode 8- Attack of the Clones**
   * Double meaning that could refer to the First Order's assault on Crait at the end of the movie, or the commencement of the attack by a clone of Palpatine.
* **Episode 9- The Phantom Menace**
   * Palpatine, who's supposedly dead for 30 years, makes a surprise return.From the very beginning of the show, Toby seems like a decent, quietly friendly guy. He's a little sad, and his crush on Pam sometimes gets weird, but overall he's one of the nicer people at Dunnder-Mifflin. 

Yet Michael hates him.

Sure, he says its because Toby is from HR, but if we look at all the stuff Michael gets away with, it's clear that Toby isn't ever coming down on him as hard as he could. As the corporate HR rep, Toby could have gotten Michael fired literally dozens of times.

My theory is that Michael's parents divorced when he was young, and he now channels his anger and feelings of abandonment towards Toby, who is a divorced father. Michael has no sense of subtlety or nuance, and so doesn't see that Toby is a far better father and human being than his own dad. 

TL;DR: Michael hates Toby because he reminds Michael of his own father. The force by default always wants to be in balance. It's not good or evil, dark or light, it is just the force. 

Just as in thermodynamics the force needs to be in balance. If you use the dark side a light side must exist. 

Now let's look at how many Sith there are. There are only 2. Wielding strongly the dark side of the force. 

Whereas during the clone wars "there were over 10,000 Jedi wielding the light side of the force".

Just by that we can see that to keep the force in balance the dark side would be highly concentrated within Sidious and his apprentice.

Whereas for the Jedi no single Jedi was powerful enough against the sith. 

Now let's look at what happened post order 66, all the Jedi save a few are alive. Hence the light side of the force starts concentrating within them. 

Leading Ashoka, Cal, Kanan to gain power faster than they otherwise would have. The force itself needs to be in balance. 
And it will do what it takes to remain in balance. 

Unfortunately what that means is that just like The Sister, if one side of the force is destroyed, the other must be destroyed. 

And most likely true peace in the galaxy will come only when there are no more Jedi or Sith. Just balance.In the movie Batman Begins, the League of Shadows enlists the help of Scarecrow to contaminate Gotham's water supply with the [fear toxin](https://chrisnolan.fandom.com/wiki/Fear_toxin). The toxin is added to the water supply over the course of weeks, but it must be inhaled to take effect. In the climax of the film, a [microwave emitter](https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Microwave_Emitter) is used to boil the city's water supply, unleashing the fear toxin on the people of Gotham.

It can be assumed then, that other methods of vaporizing the water supply could have similar effects. My theory is that over the course of weeks, as the concentration in the water supply continued to increase, citizens of Gotham were slowly exposed to the fear toxin every time they took a hot shower. The effects would be subtle, given the smaller quantities in the water supply, and the majority of the shower water not being vaporized -- but it would be enough to create a subconscious aversion to showering. By the time the plot is uncovered, and Batman stops the attack, Gotham was probably getting pretty smelly from all the skipped showers.

Corollaries to this theory:

* a similar effect could probably be observed with the consumption of hot beverages
* Those who showered more often may have developed a slight tolerance to the fear toxinSo anybody who's even vaguely familiar with TV knows the Simpsons, and anyone who is even vaguely familiar with the Simpsons knows that Bart often likes to prank call Moe by asking to speak to fictional people with embarrassing and inappropriate names. Upon realising he's been had, Moe often flies off the handle and rages bloody murder towards Bart who takes utter glee in Moe's vitriol.

Today I propose to you, Reddit, a modest fan theory that Moe always knew Bart was the mystery caller, but never showed it, instead deciding to play along to make Bart happy. 

Let's begin by proposing how Moe might know the caller is Bart. Well, frankly, it's easy. It's always the same voice which calls and pranks him with ridiculously obvious setups ("I'd like to speak to a Mr. Youcuddleme, first name, Will"). While very few people in Springfield are smart (even fewer when crayons get thrown into the mix...), the bar to hurdle this particular mental challenge is pretty low. 

He is shown to know what Bart's voice sounds like in some random episode whose exact spot in the series I can't remember, where Bart goes to Moe's with Homer, full of fear that Moe will recognize him and make good on his threats and flay him alive. Upon entering, Moe says "I know that voice... It's little bitty Bart Simpson!" and picks him up to give him a hug. While people's real life/phone voices aren't EXACTLY the same, they're generally similar enough that you can easily make out who's who. 

Why does Moe put up with these juvenile pranks every day? Because he's a sad, lonely guy who loves children and always wanted a family of his own. He's even shown to be particularily drawn towards Homer's family, as evidenced by his first name basis with all family members, and the special, uncharacteristically kind treatment he gives the children. He's shown to be kind to Lisa, and in one episode developed an extremely strong atttachement to Maggie. It is not out to left field to think he may harbour similar sentiment towards Bart as well. Allowing Bart to make a fool of him is done in the same way parents will let their children play petty pranks on them, because Moe loves Bart and takes joy in his joy. 

To further attest to Moe's attachment to Bart, Moe has plenty of ways to easily foil Bart, but never does. He could *69 the number, he could go to the police, or he could just not honour any requests by the caller with Bart's voice which he gets ALL THE TIME. But he chooses not to out of love for Bart, and possibly a loneliness so crippling he's just happy to get a phone call of any sort

Anyway Reddit, thank you very much for reading my long winded theory, I'm eagerly looking forward to hearing what your feedback!

EDIT: Some users have pointed my attention to a scene where Bart claims to be Jimbo and brings Moe's wrath upon the house. I think that it was probably just a one time joke and doesn't debunk the theory, as the Simpsons only takes the rules of logic and reality as a loose guideline. Ex, how they can live in a mythical state with harbours, mountains, forests, etc. nearby, and border upon AK, OH, MA, and KY. 

TL;DR - Moe always knew Bart was the one crank calling him, but played along to make Bart happy 

**TL;DR:  In A New Hope, when Obi-wan scares off the Tusken Raiders and finds luke in the desert, for a moment, he is visibly startled. Something comes over him, an understanding. He has seen this day before, these events. Qui-gon Jinn had shown Obi-wan a vision of these events years earlier, his destiny. This is why Obi-wan has been waiting on Tatooine all those years—waiting to fulfill his destiny. The destiny to teach and lead Luke down the path that leads to Vader’s defeat and Anakin’s redemption.** 

**The Theory and Speculation:**

Alone in the desert, Obi-wan communed with the late Qui gon Jinn. After the fall of the republic, Obi-wan is in a bad place. The order he loved is gone, he is in self-exile, and his ex-padawan, the one everyone told him not to train, is currently ripping the galaxy a new one. To say he might be a little depressed is a fair assessment. Qui-gon reveals to Obi-wan in a vision, his true purpose. He shows him the events that will transpire, how he will find luke and the droids in the desert, the ship he will rent, the fight at the bar, everything down to his death on the death star by the hands of Darth Vader. 

Qui gon teaches him how to live past his mortal body and shows him that his destiny is to lead luke.

*To Obi-wan, Luke is the chosen one to erase the Jedi order’s mistakes and Obi Wan’s part in their folly. , luke is Obi Wan’s messiah, his ultimate redemption by righting his own past mistakes.* 

**Why it works:**

This is why Obi-wan has been waiting on Tatooine all this time. He is not protecting luke. He is waiting for his time to fulfill his Destiny and redeem himself. When he sees luke lying on the ground, and later when luke asks him who he is,  Obi-wan looks visibly shaken and thrown off guard. This is because he recognizes this as the start of his path towards his destiny. He had seen this before, heard those words.  After he shakes the initial shock, he is calm and collected. He knows the steps. This is why he doesn’t bother bargaining with Han and even offers him more., this is how he knows where to go on the massive death star. It is because he has seen it all before. When he sees Vader, he knows that the end is here, and he accepts it. 

I believe that we will see Obi-wan receive this vision from Qui-gon in the Series, and that will bring him peace knowing that he has a chance to right some of what was broken.

He smiles as he sees Luke and Leia escaping because he knows that’s the last part of the vision. He, he has succeeded and played his part in a grander destiny.In the Bikini Bottom universe, it seems like money doesn't matter to anyone other than Mr. Krabbs. 

Prices at the Krusty Krab are super low and seem to be chosen at random. 

Spongebob and Patrick both pay Mr. Krabbs for the "privilege" to work at the Krusty Krab.

Squidward is able to move to Tentacle Acres at the drop of a hat.

Squlliam seems to just be fancy because he runs fancy restaurants and has fancy friends.For some reason, I think this might've come up before. But, just gonna throw it out there again, if it has.  

The first time we meet the Ewoks in the series, they capture Luke and the crew, and C3PO translates that basically their intent is they're going to eat them. This is before C3PO gets treated like a God and gets them to let his friends go.  

...In the end scene in the movie, they've just defeated the Death Star, blew that son of a bitch sky high, and the Ewoks are having a feast.  

...What exactly are the Ewoks eating? There is a *xylophone made of storm trooper skulls and chest plates*...and they're having a feast.  

The Ewoks aren't celebrating the death of the Empire. They don't even understand anything about the socioeconomic structure of the galaxy outside of their little forest. They thought C3PO was a God, so clearly they are unaware of technology. Their celebration wasn't because of Freedom, it was because they just got the motherload of tender human flesh vittles.  

That cute little Ewok plushie you had as a kid? You know the one. Wicket? Yeah, that little fucker *eats people*.  

And, by extension, the entire main cast of Star Wars *might* be cannibalistic, too. I mean, I dunno. They're attending the banquet. Hopefully they had some fruit there, too, and some berries that the Ewok women scavenged from the forest. I'm really hoping Luke and the gang didn't try the veal. &#3232;\_&#3232;In the Silmarillion we learn a lot about Gandalf's history. To keep things simple, he was pretty much a minor demigod named Olórin sent to Middle Earth as a wizard along with four others of his kind to help fight against Sauron. He lived in a place called the Garden of Lórien, and was hesitant to go to earth because he was too weak to fight Sauron. This was actually the reason he was chosen in the first place, the gods favored his humility and since he was said to be the wisest of his kind they needed someone with a level head and patience to help the inhabitants of Middle Earth, not just a group of super powered wizards. 

So fast forward to Fellowship of the Ring, specifically to when Gandalf catches Sam eavesdropping on his and Frodo's conversation about what must be done. Here he is, looking down upon a meek gardener who wants no part of this grand adventure because he thinks too little of himself. That may not be conveyed right away, but as the series progresses you see that Sam doesn't recognize his own contributions to the cause until the very end, and even then it's with a lot of assurance from Frodo along the way that he is invaluable to him.

I think that when Gandalf looked into Sam's eyes that night he saw himself ages in the past, sitting in his own garden home terrified of the journey ahead of him. That's why he chose Sam to aid Frodo, because in that moment he saw in Sam what his master had seen in him when he was sent to Middle Earth in the first place.In the earliest interviews he seems confused as to why it’s a mystery. Then for years he kind of wink wink nod nods at it. And toward the end of his life he got tired of the game and tried to explain it but it was too late by then.  He simply meant it literally: The ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything

Of course they asked a supercomputer and to a computer it’s all ones and zeros anyway so a computer sees everything as an abstraction. Thus the ultimate answer literally is 6 times 7 
6 as a symbol for bad (ie 666) and 7 as a symbol for good (ie 7th heaven etc) 

So the computer said the good times the bad but being a computer 42 seemed more efficient. 

It’s a classic example of GIGO 
(garbage in garbage out) 

It’s the kind of lateral thinking joke Adams makes  in all of his works which is why he was so delighted no one “got it”Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, and Sam Neil are not playing Asgardians in Ragnarok in Loki's play. They are playing Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, and Sam Neil, human actors whom Loki has transported to Asgard to star in his play, because the actors feed into his ego. 

Basically, when Loki was casting the play about his heroic death, really, what actor is brilliant enough, handsome enough, to play Loki besides Good Will Hunting? 

And with Luke Hemsworth, he has an actor who looks close enough to Thor to be an older brother... just comically six inches shorter. How emasculating to be represented as such!

I've got nothing really for Sam Neil. He just kind of goes along with the rest. I'm assuming he and Damon share an agent. One of the things that bothered me about Vol. 2 was the convenience that the first child that Yondu didn't deliver to Ego just by a massive coincidence happened to be the first child with Celestial powers.... but then I got to thinking what if the reason Ego's children up until Quill didn't have Celestial powers is simply this; the powers don't develop until puberty.

The very fact that Yondu was delivering the children to Ego before puberty meant that they would appear non-celestial and Ego killed them off until they had the chance to develop the powers. Because Yondu kept Quill back he allowed him to age past puberty and therefore become old enough.Everyone knows this scene, Im talking about the scene where Butch and Mr Wallace are captured by those two rapists at that general store. So Ive always tried to understand why did Butch return to save Marsellus, I mean, its plausible that he thought that, by saving him, things would be alright between them, and thats what in fact happened, but It was impossible for him to be sure about that, cause not only Butch didnt went down on that fight, he killed one of Marsellus "best" hitman (Vincent Vega). After watching this chapter a lot, I finally came with a more solid reason to why he returned to save him, and to understand this better, we have to remember a few things that happened earlier.

Butch's chapter starts with Captain Koons doing a monologue about the watch, the import thing about this scene is where did the watch come from and what happened to Butch's father. Cristopher Walken's character says that the watch was bought on an old general store in Tennessee way back in WWO by his great grandfather, dont forget about this info. Moving on, about Butch's father, Koons says that he died on a Vietnamiese prison camp, the same camp he was in and before he was gone, he gave Koons the watch and told him to deliver it to Butch.

Finally here we are, at the general store basement, Marsellus is being raped on one room while Butch is tied up and waiting for his turn on another room, but he fights back and unleashes himself, knocks down the gimp and manages to get out of there. When Butch is about to leave, he stops for a few seconds, at this scene, you can clearly see a Tennessee sign right next to him, and its not even out of focus, its definitely there intentionally, but why? Because this whole situation is new perspective of his father's story. The Tennessee sign is a reference to the place where the watch was purchased, and the situation is a reference to the prison camp, but this time its Butch's prison, and now he has the chance to save not only his "partner", but the metaphoric representation of his own father.So I've been thinking about Madagascar again. (Shut up I don't need to go to rehab)
I've come up with a theory. 

So, you know how at the beginning of Madagascar 1, the animals break into the subway and get stunned? I don't think those were stun guns. I think they used real bullets. The ship cruise and Madagascar were respectively the journey to and the afterlife. 

Now I know that this sounds like one of those shitty "It was all a dream"-theories, but hear me out. If we do assume that Madagascar is the afterlife, then how do the animals escape from it? Easy: With the help of the Grim Reaper. 
You probably haven't seen All Hail King Julien, but that series shows Mort taking the life essence of people, silently pulling the strings and resisting the so-called sky gods. These sky gods, too, play an important part in my theory. Because while on Madagascar, prayers to the sky gods are usually answered and people get asked for help by the fruits in the sky (not a slur, they're literally mangoes and pineapples). But outside of Madagascar, they are powerless. 

What makes Madagascar so special? Why would Mort, who's quite literally able to read minds and shapeshift, stay on such a dull island? Easy. Because it's his prison. 

Now I don't think that Madagascar is the whole afterlife. Over the course of the show, lemurs leave the island multiple times, one time even going to another island. Those islands, I think, are different parts of the afterlife, where normal animals end up. Madagascar on the other hand is the domain of Mort, or Death if you're French. Quite literally by the way, as at the end of Madagascar 3, Mort is the death of Chantel DuBois, shooting her in the back. The movie shows her then on a ship, arriving nowhere else but Madagascar.

But let's take a step back. If Madagascar is the prison of Mort, why are any other animals there? And doesn't the fact that King Julien is the thirteenth of his name kind of disprove the fact that Madagascar is a shadow world? Now here I'm going to lean far out of the window. Mort sometimes manages to pull a soul in, god knows how. In the Madagascar-movies, he managed to hit the jackpot: Four at once. And those souls that he catches he forces to play a sick role in his scheme. Or rather, his entertainment. In one of All Hail King Juliens episodes, he manipulates people into literally giving him their souls and children. How, I aks you, would any mortal do that? Not even Shakespeares Iago is that cunning. Mort messes with the brains of people. And I don't think he just does it for that one game. I think all the lifes of people on Madagascars are faked.

Do you know the religious theory that the world was created last Thursday and everything before that was just planted into your brain by God? That's what's happening on Madagascar. Mort, who has been shown to love writing plays, is forcing all those people to play their roles. I bet King Julien XIII isn't even related to King Julien XII or his parents/aunt and uncle (don't ask. Seriously.) Mort has just decided that Julien must be king now, and the king needed a dynasty.

But I'm rambling on and on. This is of course in no sense of the word a completed theory, but it's an outline I might come back to one day. Know just that Mort is the God of Death and Madagascar is the domain he resides in.

"I just rewatched infinity War and noticed one big detail- After Thanos sacrificed Gamora, a portal was opened above him and Red skull, this portal look similar to the one that teleported Red skull to vormir at the ending of "Captain America The first Avenger", I believe that not only the portal teleported Thanos to Soul stone but it also returned Skull to earth coz he was free from his curse after Thanos collected the stone. So Red skull is on earth now and he may return in Endgame or future MCU movies."I’ve been obsessed with this movie the last week, I’ve been looking all over for speculation over my question- I’m surprised no one asked it yet.

Obviously, the ending is the only way it could have turned out- but what would have happened if he agreed to continue starring on the show, after proving to himself that his reality was a fabrication?

Surely, it couldn’t be the same as it was before, right?FFH says Fury was swapped out for Talos. When though?  

Fury was swapped out with Talos when he almost died in Winter Soldier. Perfect opportunity. He didn't do all that stuff with the special chemical to reduce his heart rate. He basically died. The Skrull have the technology to heal him, and they owed him one. So he was taken to space to heal. Talos has been serving ever since. 

In Captain Marvel, Fury says if his toast is cut diagonally, he can't eat it. In Age of Ultron, he is clearly seen eating diagonally cut toast. This isn't Fury, it's Talos. I guess you can say Fury just adjusted to diagonal toast within 20 years, but that seems strange. Law of conservation of detail; they wouldn't give such a weird detail if it was never going to matter.  So, it had to be sometime before Age of Ultron.

In the Inception universe, a totem is a clever method, devised by Mal, of detecting if you are in someone else's dream. A totem is a physical item that secretly behaves abnormally in the real world; for instance, the weight or feeling might be different than one would expect. Therefore, if an Architect attempts to recreate your totem in their dream, it will not feel right and you will know it's a dream. 

So let me reiterate: a totem behaves *normally* in a dream but *abnormally* in the real world. 

But this contradicts the action of the top, which behaves *abnormally* in the dream world and *normally* in the real world. Why would an Architect assume that the top would behave so strangely? Any person would rightfully assume that the top would fall over in a dream and make that the reality, making the totem check useless. 

There's a popular fan theory going around that Cobb's wedding ring is his totem. This is a silly proposal in my opinion because of one simple fact: he wouldn't need to check the top as his reality test if he could just glance at his finger (I'm overlooking the fact that this totem, too, would violate the original definition described above). Why does he compulsively check the totem after waking up from Yusuf's workshop in Mombasa?

Clearly, something more is going on. Cobb, as the world's most skilled extractor, has developed a better test of the dream world. 

Once a dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming (becomes lucid), they gain the ability to manipulate their reality within reason. This is why the team was able to summon guns out of nowhere and how Eames is able to project himself as different people. 

Cobb's reality check is to assume that he is in fact dreaming and attempt to bend reality. In this case, he focuses on making the top keep spinning. If it topples despite his focus, then it must be reality; but if he is able to keep it spinning indefinitely, it must be a dream. Notice how intently he stares at the top whenever he spins it. 

This theory lends special credence to the end of the film. Cobb spins the top and walks away. The top is wobbling, obviously preparing to fall over, but this doesn't prove anything since without Cobb willing it to behave strangely this will prove nothing. However, notice that Cobb isn't watching anymore. He doesn't care if the top spins or falls because this reality is where he wants to be, dream or not. 

EDIT 1: I forgot to do this: credit to /u/SpareLiver for giving me the idea for this post. 

EDIT 2: /u/Handsome_Claptrap posted a [link](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/05/christopher-nolan-finally-explains-inceptions-ending) that proves the ending of my theory from Nolan himself. So, I'm not saying anything new by saying the Ginny/Harry romance is kinda out of nowhere and underdeveloped. It's so bad some in the fandom think she dosed him with love potion (basically magically roofieing him). But I don't think this is the case. Not only is it way too dark to have been what was intended, but Harry doesn't show the obsessive qualities we've seen of a love potion victim in universe. It's much more likely to me Ginny was awkwardly thrown in as a substitute for the person originally supposed to be Harry's long-term romantic partner: Luna Lovegood.

Now to back up a bit, one of the things that's always bothered me about the Ginny relationship is how it fit in with the Cho Chang arc, which itself I thought was conceptually good but isn't executed that well, especially given the future Ginny relationship. That is meant to serve as the teen crush that works out way better as fantasy than it does in reality, as one of the many coming of age aspects of the series. But the actual events that cause the relationship to fizzle before it starts is Cho defending her friend despite her friend doing something shitty, which is the kind of thing I'd think Harry himself would do say, after Ron leaves them on the Horcrux journey. The other is Cho becoming emotional and wanting to talk about Cedric and Harry's dissatisfaction with how she goes about handling that grief. That's not only a bit immature on Harry's part IMO but more importantly doesn't seem to work with Harry eventually ending up with Ginny. Ginny never really has any deaths close to her until the end of the series, and it's never said one way or the other how she handles that grief, so we don't get why she'd be a better match vs. Cho. 

Now let's look at Luna in contrast. Now as the series is currently composed, her role is kinda strange. She is a stranger who becomes an acquaintance to the main group in OOTP, ingratiating herself by believing in Harry at his lowest, when barely anyone else did. After this... she's just kinda there. She's still an acquaintance, who kinda pops up and leaves seemingly randomly, but never has her role grow. But right off the bat, she has some interesting parallels to Cho (as well as Ginny). She and Cho are both Ravenclaws, and (also like Harry) both dealt with the loss of someone close to them. But unlike Cho but like Harry, the grief is more personal to her, as both saw a person die directly. And neither feel the need to talk directly about the people close to them (including Harry's parents) they lost much. She's also a canon heterosexual girl who is introduced in the very installment where Harry, a heterosexual guy is having the fullfillment and end of the Cho crush he's harbored for a few books. Cho is very much more the person you'd assume suits him in the series as a whole, a popular Quidditch player for  the famous "Boy Who Lived", a Quidditch star himself. Luna is by contrast bullied and treated as unusual. But key is, unlike usually, this is also how Harry is seen in this installment. To me, this should've been, and I believe in an earlier draft was the reason for the inability for it to work with Cho. The one change I think happened with the end of that relationship with the transition from Luna as final SO to Ginny was that I think during the argument that spelled beginning of the end for Harry and Cho, she either outright said or hinted she might not believe Harry about how Cedric died. That would make far more sense than what actually happened on page, would be the type of thing Harry as a character couldn't forgive even if Cho took it back, and might make him think of Luna in a different way.

But even the way it happened in canon, I think there's some compelling reasons for Harry/Luna. Processing grief is what led to beginning of end with Harry and Cho. Well in the last chapter of OOTP and last conversation of book with Luna, what Harry and Luna talk about is Luna's trauma and grief over losing her mother. This is the same chapter as well when Harry's new disinterest in Cho is made most clear. I don't think this is a coincidence. This seems like a lot of subtext and importance long before JK knew Luna would be a fan favorite. But as I hinted at before, I think Luna's role in later books just makes things even more clear. 

I mentioned Luna has different qualities that parallel Ginny too. They're in the same year. But more importantly, Luna's oddness fits perfectly with Book 6's arc about Harry not wanting to admit he has romantic feelings. With Ginny it is written off as because he doesn't want to upset Ron by dating his sister. But Ron has been upset at him before and it hasn't stuck, so wouldn't Harry know it'd be the same with this? And wouldn't he realize (as is revealed to because anyway) that of all people Ron would rather Ginny end up with Harry? Whereas Luna's very different personality and social standing would more naturally lead to Harry questioning his feelings in that case.

In fact, they pretty much do this, when Harry asks Luna to be his date to Slughorn's party. This is an unusual plot point that doesn't seem to fit in the series' current narrative or Luna's canon role (being one of a few times she randomly drops into the narrative before just dropping out). Being someone's date has been linked to romance the whole series. But now, Luna is the first person Harry asks out after Cho, which is never explained in terms of his reasoning. The school takes it as romantic and is shocked in the way Harry might've been worried about if Luna took Ginny's role of his crush throughout the book. but instead they just say it was a "friend" thing and leave it at that. Put in a scene where Harry re-establishes the shared trauma and bond he has with Luna which matters more than their social status or other differences instead of just making out with Ginny after she wins a Quidditch match and it fits perfectly. Whereas, what was the reason for that whole storyline in the current narrative? There is none, like much including Ginny/Harry and Luna, it doesn't fit. 

Then in Book 7, the book opens with a plan by the OOTP to dispatch Harry in secret. And their secret location to smuggle him to is... the Burrow? Any number of people could link him to Ron and the Weasleys, including Draco, who at that point is at least to save his hide, loyal enough to Voldemort. That should be one of the first spots the Death Eaters would suspect Harry would be going. So why did JK have this in the narrative? To bring him to his SO Ginny of course. Whereas a recent relationship with Luna wouldn't be as well known. Luna's place is (coincidentally in the main canon) near the Burrow, which would allow the Weasleys a safer place to have Bill's wedding. Xeno is pro-Harry enough he'd take them in. That'd allow Harry to be with Luna before the Horcrux journey, along with giving more of a chance to discover something related to the Hallows in a few weeks living in the house, rather than the main canon, where Xeno who has many eccentric interests and beliefs, just happens to wear a Hallows necklace the one day Harry meets him.

Finally, this would provide more stakes to the eventual return to Xeno's to ask about the Hallows and Malfoy Manor fight and make the whole sequence make way more sense. In the current canon, Luna is taken because of what Xeno published in the Quibbler. But why does Voldemort care. Even in the established narrative, it's established most see it as junk and it's even called a "lunatic rag". If anything, wouldn't it help Death Eaters, publishing truths that all assume are lies? But Xeno harboring Harry as well as them maybe realizing his connection to Luna would explain them kidnapping her. The other part of the narrative that doesn't make sense is why the Snatchers have been instructed to take Harry to Malfoy Manor if they find him, of all places. Why not the Ministry where there are far more wizards on their side to hold him? Or anywhere other than trusting the Malfoys, who are already disgraced for screwing up the prophecy business (which is even mentioned)? In the current narrative, they find out about Luna, a side character, who again pops into the narrative randomly, do nothing, then a couple chapters later happen to be brought to where she is and they can all escape, with no explanation.

Now if Harry/Luna was canon, Harry is now more willing to explore the Hallow thread, which in normal canon and normal terms, doesn't seem important, to see Luna. The frustration at Xeno's lies about Luna being around and coming soon build frustration more organically with Harry, more easily causing him to realize the truth, and making the reveal work better. In this version, he finds out Luna is held in Malfoy Manor (as a far less important prisoner than Harry) and they all go there to save her, which they do. All in all, this makes her work in the story as Harry's romantic partner far more than Ginny, to an extent that I believe can't be a coincidence, and makes me believe this was Rowling's original plan.

But why, you ask, would JK change her vision? An obvious one, the same reason many may question this theory. The pairing just was so odd, she was worried about how fans would react. So instead, she scrambled to write Ginny into the "Harry SO" role, and changed some plot points to try and write the basic stories with this new pairing. Ginny specifically was chosen as a replacement for the same "wish fulfillment" reason JK admitted later to having written Ron/Hermione, that she thought it'd be great if the golden trio's kids were family and Harry was officially "family" with the Weasleys.

Thoughts?The course of the movie almost perfectly follows the progression of the theatrical play put on during this episode. This would explain why it got so many details wrong, such as pronouncing Aang's name and grossly misinterpreting the characters' personalities, while also being ridiculously over the top and melodramatic.In short, M. Night Shamalyan trolled us all, pulling another plot twist by making people think he was adapting a beloved TV series, when in fact his movie encompasses only one episode.A huge part of the film is about Michael Myers supposed obsession with killing Laurie Strode, however I don't think he actually cares about her.   
  
In a similar way to how people look for someone to blame after natural disasters and the conspiracy theories that arise after tragedy, the characters in the film have constructed a narrative of revenge to either make money (the podcasters), further their own careers (Dr Sartain) or to cope with survivors guilt (Laurie Strode).
  
Each character brings another piece of the story: the podcasters bring the mask and antagonise Laurie, the doctor frees Myers on Halloween and drives him to Laurie's house, while Laurie spends a lifetime convincing herself that Michael is only after her and prepares to fight him. 
  
In reality, we see Myers committing random murders throughout the film, he is knocked unconscious by the police car, wakes up in the woods and then continues to attack the next house he sees - Laurie's. Nothing about his behaviour indicates he is motivated by revenge, only the need to keep on killing. It's the other characters who have imposed the story of the Halloween killer on him.
  
I think the film does an incredible job of displaying the human need to rationalize tragedy. Because in truth Michael Myers is just a cold blooded killer with no motive other than to satisfy his blood lust.Hear me out here, I know it sounds crazy but let me break it down:

Imagine if each character is actually a character in a game, controlled by players, and what we are actually watching is the campaign. The whole series is 3 separate parties playing together. 

The first party are older members in the group that have played before in previous campaigns (Joyce, Hopper, Bob) who frequently played together but maybe grew apart, but then the person controlling Bob rejoined the party. 

Characters like Jonathan, Nancy, and Steve (and then Billy) have played before together, so they generally party up themselves during this huge campaign, which mirrors the storyline.

The final party is the younger newbie party, consisting of El, Mike, Lucas, Will, Dustin and Max. They are new, so the gamemaster uses them for his campaign, which includes taking Will, giving Eleven weird powers, and making their friends try to save them without help from the other two parties. 

Each party has their own campaign and goal in mind, but as they continue to play that learn that they have to rely on each other's help for any of them to win the campaign. 

Each season is a different 3 part campaign. With small side quests for certain characters (like when Eleven has to meet up with her long-lost sister in order to be able to rejoin her previous party).  
Thoughts?The reason I say this mainly is because theyre both extremely traumatized with grief and losing everything they have.

There's a metaphorical 'throne' they'll live up to and prophesize that they're the end of the world (in Daeny's case, Westeros)

Over time she becomes way too powerful to the point no one is able to stop her. As seen in Endgame, she basically 1v1'd with literal ease the biggest villain in comic movie history, and she wasn't even at a quarter of her power level.

Agatha Harkness says she is stronger than even the Sorcerer Supreme, just like how Daeny's association is to her dragons, she'll become way too powerful to stop.

And all it takes is one major showing off of her power (ripping the multiverse, destroying Kings Landing) for people to realize how much of a threat she is to the world.

Maybe Vision/Jon Snow will be the foil to her powers and maybe she won't suffer the tragic death Daenerys ends up in.Squidward's reaction to it implies that it's barely abnormal, if even that. 

"No, they always do that" 

Algae is green, it's an ooze, and it accumulates anywhere with sunlight, something the all glass walls of the Krusty Krab would certainly provide.I don’t have a lot of crazy facts to support this, but I do have a few that can support the theory as plausible. 

1:) Neither Jim nor Pam really like to make all(most) aspects of their lives known to their coworkers. 

2:) Jim and Pam basically lied for weeks, to everyone, about even dating until they got caught. 

3:) Jim sort of hates his coworkers. After the house party Jim threw back in season 2 he actively avoided hanging out with coworkers. Down to refusing to go to Kelly’s summer party, constantly turning Michale down for even lunch, trying to get out of Andy’s play, Mikes dinner(even tried to ditch Pam there), the Crime Aid auction, Robert California’s party... the list goes on. 

4:) Pam try’s not to tell pretty much everyone anything personal, especially after Angela uses anything to slam her.

5:) They planned to get eloped and told nobody. They go to the dance in MSP Co.’s old office and just suddenly change to a big wedding?

6:) Pam is a real homebody, she doesn’t like the idea of being out of the Scranton Area. As a person who actually lives in Scranton(since birth) there are fucking TONS of super popular wedding destinations here. Gorgeous places that are really fucking close and easy to access. So why would she agree to a wedding in Niagara Falls when she doesn’t even like the Idea of moving an hour away to Philly?

7:) The most glaring point to support this as true is the fact they picked Niagara Falls(and still eloped before the wedding). Jim and Pam said they’d picked NF in hopes nobody they worked with came, but they rented out almost an entire hotel...?

The Documentary people clearly had to convince them to have a big wedding, they had to have given some assistance to them in exchange for a pretty decent bit of story. PBS probably flat out paid for the hotel and probably any location they’d want to marry in as long as they allowed them to film and share it. They didn’t seem to have any wedding photographers at the wedding (Bob and Phyllis did) and that’s because per the agreement they’d also do the film and photography gratis along with more than likely the location and accommodations. If I’m wrong hit me with it, even aside the fact they asked for money from people instead of gifts.. they did still pay for shit probably a hefty chunk but PBS definitely convinced them and helped.

Edit. To supplement my reasoning for assuming they rented out the entire hotel, excluding current guests and prior reservations of others outside the Dunder Mifflin family and the Beesley/Halpert clans, they are supposed to staying at the Red Coach Inn at Niagara Falls. The RCI only has 35 rooms to rent, so even excluding those prior guests and reservations, it’s not completely unlikely they rented out a majority of the hotel. Two sides of the family, along with coworkers, and possibly the film crew they could have a need for almost all of the rooms(if not all available and more in  another hotel).I was rewatching Avengers Infinity War on Netflix and something stood out to me.  After Dr. Strange has looked through the possible futures and after Thanos has sacrificed Gamora to the Soul Stone, they confront each other and Thanos says the now famous line, "The hardest choices require the strongest wills."  Then Dr. Strange says "I think you'll find our will equal to yours."

So at this point, Thanos has sacrificed Gamora, and Dr. Strange knows that Thanos sacrificed her to get the soul stone.  So when he says that the Avengers will is equal to Thanos own, I believe he is hinting that the Avengers   
will have to make a similar sacrifice in order to (eventually) win.

Furthermore, since Dr. Strange gives up the time stone to spare Iron Man's life, I believe that Iron Man will be either the sacrificer or the sacrificee when the time comes, because Dr. Strange may have seen that any future without Tony Stark there to help make the eventual sacrifice, will lead to the necessary sacrifice not being made.Have you ever wondered why the player's actions each missions killing dozens of people never get's much media attention besides a small news headline?

It is a popular theory that GTA is set in an alternate reality where the 1930s business plot succeeded.Basically Capitalists seized control of the US and its institutions hence the corporate reality portrayed in the games.

A capitalistic society relies on a certain stability and complacency from it's populace. If the public is hearing about mass shootings every other days combined with the borderline terrorist activities the main characters get up to, it would lead to mass panic and unrest. The Union Depository heist if it happened in our world would be treated like a 9/11 event rather than just one headline. To alleviate the unrest, the media companies only share barebones information about the player activities like stating it was shootout without mentioning the exact deathtoll or total destruction caused.The story if you listen to the ingame radio is then buried by a celebrity story to distract the listener's mind.A lot of people are wondering why the Terminator does not do things that would easily aid in his mission to kill Sarah Connor. For instance, how come he bothers to shoot Sarah when he could have easily snapped her neck or stomped on her head, or dressed up as a mailman, find her and then punched through her face. All of these scenarios operate under the same assumption: that the Terminator is able to be creative in how he completes his mission. As a machine programmed to kill people in the most efficient way possible, creativity is not included because while snapping Sarah's neck can get the job done, it's not as efficient as shooting her. This efficiency is shown when he kills the first "Wrong Sarah". While physically, he could have killed her in any way possible with his bare hands, it would have taken more effort to do so than to just shoot her.Joker was a killer the entire time. He enjoyed other people's misfortunes, riots, and the idea of killing people.

As soon the movie begins, on the radio you can hear about the uneasiness in the city, he starts the giggle and then he manually makes himself frown.

But he was also upset that nobody was discussing him murdering people. In his journal, that he claims to have written jokes in but it's actually disturbing things he's done and talked about, you can clearly see pictures of people in it. This is relevant later.

He asks for more medication because he's not enjoying killing people. He doesn't realize this is because the medication is working. He thinks it means it's not working.

When he gets the gun and makes innuendo about working on his material, getting ready for the club, he actually is straightforward. His fantasy about wanting to be a comedian was just to fool the audience/viewer.

When he's working with the kids and the gun falls out, this was intentional. He was "happy and he knew it". He thought they would find this funny. They didn't. But that's why he really does believe he got fired for not being funny enough.

When Joker kills the 3 guys on the subway, the media finally starts acknowledging joker's killings. He makes the obvious to the song saying his "clown" name and feels like people finally see him

Joker's mother clearly knows about his true nature. That's why she started writing to Thomas Wayne in hopes that he wouldn't defund the social services. 

Once Joker found out about Thomas Wayne being his "father". He rips out a picture of him and puts it in his journal. He does this because he plans to kill him. This explains the other pictures earlier

When that failed she started working with those 2 detectives to come up with the fake stroke scheme to keep her away from home.

When Joker reads the asylum file, the film misdirects you. "adopted mother allows son's assault" means the sons assault on the mother, not the assault on the son. That's why she was battered.

Penny was actually having that interview to defend Joker, not defend her own actions. She allowed him to get away with things because it made him happy. He was apparently always happy.

I'm going to assume that joker killed her boyfriend. That's why Arthur was in the asylum previously even though he acted like he had no reason why.

When Arthur finally is about to kill his mother, he explains to her that he was never happy, because the only thing that would have made him happy was to kill her, not just beat her.

His laughing condition actually wasnt anything at all. He actually found those situations to be funny. The joker card was an obvious Easter egg.

In the end, when he says this is actually how I always imagined it, he really did mean thatIt's been frequently noted that the image of sharks as merciless killers, perpetuated by Jaws, helped rapidly decrease their numbers. Hollywood is aware of this, which is why most shark movies since then have been absolutely mindless laugh-fears.I have a 14 month old son who loves this movie and I’ve seen it probably 20x the past month. One interaction kept standing out to me that Aladdin asks Genie about his magic abilities, ‘so are you magic, or is this thing?’ (Referring to the lamp) ‘we’re kind of a package deal’ was genies answer. 

Aladdin is obviously portrayed as the diamond in the rough, poor, hungry, homeless, talented and just thief etc., Abu is an amazingly talented monkey who not only understands everything and everyone around him but he risks his own neck multiple times in critical situations. Abu is the original reason Aladdin has to go find Jasmine, stealing the bracelet, he is the one who catches a literal diamond from the rough in the cave, he steals the lamp from Jafaar as he kicks Aladdin into the cave, he saves Aladdin from drowning by throwing the lamp in after him, he finds and heroically keeps the lamp from a giant Lago. 

I’m not sure if one or the other is the real ‘diamond in the rough’ maybe together they are. Which brings me back to the interaction that stands out to me, ‘we’re kind of a package deal’  I think the same rule applies to Aladdin and Abu.Some discussion around the new trilogy I’ve seen makes some accusation about Rey being an overpowered character with no real explanation for her ability. I was particularly struck by a post suggesting that she was clearly incapable of lifting the boulders on Crait on her own, and must have had help from Luke.

I disagree. Rey lifted the rocks on her own, not because she's strong but because she isn't held back by preconceptions of how the Force works. Let me explain.

The whole theme of the new trilogy is New supplanting Old. The core conflict, as seen throughout TLJ, is *how* that should be done. Ren advocates for a blank slate destruction of the old order, violently if necessary. Rey represents a blending of old ideals with openness to innovation. This is what I see as the central theme of episodes VII-IX - that the old is actively detrimental to the potential of the new. Much of the complaints I see about Rey center around her being stronger than people believe she should be, without the training they believe she needs. I would argue that the whole point of these movies is that the dogmatic adherence to a specific training program has been at best holding Force users back for millennia, and at worst causing explosive and genocidal outbursts in the form of powerful Sith.

Consider the following:

- The Old Republic era Jedi had become stagnant and obsolete. The extent may be debated, but the fact is that they had become a frustrating bureaucracy that, despite the Jedi code preaching impartiality and distance, had become involved in such trifling matters as trade disputes. For all their benevolent intentions, Palpatine was right that they had become a bloated and corrupt order that was unwilling to change with the times.  
- The Jedi training program did not work for Anakin, in part because he was too old to be properly indoctrinated. With some exceptions, we hear of very few Jedi-trained individuals rejecting the order and turning to the Dark. Anakin was one of these, not because he was an angsty teenager who felt he deserved more, but because he hadn’t been told from early childhood that he needed to follow orders and never question the Jedi mindset.  
- Even then, the Jedi could have brought Anakin back in line with patience and careful planning. But instead, the more Anakin rebelled, the more they clamped down. Explicitly denying him the opportunity to go through the Trials, denying him the rank of Master, all of these could have been easier to swallow if the order had less of black-and-white approach. In the strict authoritarian world of the Old Republic, anything that wasn’t a reward was implicitly a punishment. Padawans and knights in training weren’t allowed different teaching styles based on their temperament – they were assigned to a master and shipped off to essentially be locked into whatever lesson plan the master decided upon. And if they fail, as all people do, they’re reconditioned. And if they fail greviously, as some people do, they’re essentially either executed or excommunicated, left with a shattered worldview and no support system to bring them back to a more prosocial mindset.  
- Ben falls to the Dark Side when Luke becomes afraid that Ben isn't adhering one-to-one with the Jedi ideal. The repression of strict training causes an out-of-control spiral as Ben rebels against his master and ends up causing countless deaths as the spearhead of the First Order.  
- Yoda, Kenobi, and Luke all meet their failure not with adaptation, but with self-imposed exile. One could argue that in each case, they hid to avoid notice of a much larger Dark Side threat, but the truth remains that all three had the opportunity to join the rebellions of their time and confront their enemies. Instead, as soon as the Jedi order Plan broke down, they shut down and shunted the responsibility for fixing things onto the next generation.  

The point I’m trying to make here is that Ben and Luke are both aware of this legacy of the Force. Luke had formal training from Yoda and stories of the Clone Wars, Ben had formal training from Luke and stories of the Rebellion and Empire. Both grew up in an environment that taught them, “This is what the Force is, this is how you learn it.” Both were subject to the restrictive philosophies of the old Order – the “You’re not ready” and the “beware of powerful emotion” and the “if you screw up once, you might just get executed in your tent while you sleep”.

*Rey has no such restrictions*.

We know from the early scenes of TFA that she is aware of and, to an extent, idolizes the Rebellion (a handmade pilot doll in her room). But here’s the thing - her Force abilities are not only not sanded down to the old Order’s expectations, but they’re almost completely latent. Her force abilities come out when she needs them, in times of heightened stress (escaping the torture room, fighting Ren in the woods). Her natural Force abilities aren’t hampered by questions of “should,” but only questions of “can”. She’s able to go toe-to-toe with an albeit incompletely trained Sith because she doesn’t have a lifetime of people telling her “these are your limits, stick to them.” Rey is exactly as strong as Force users *should have been* since, like, 45,000 BBY.

How do I figure that Force users are inherently capable of these feats and that Rey is, in herself, not particularly strong or weak? Well, throughout the eight core movies and countless supplementary material, there have been examples of Force users accomplishing feats ordinarily considered outside the norm. The one thing these events have in common is that they aren’t the result of specific study or formulaic, procedural action. Lifting an X-Wing, stopping a blaster bolt in midair, pulling a lightsaber from an ice wall in time to save yourself from a Wampa – all of these are the result of either giving in to emotion or blanking your mind. These aren’t dissected, scientific moments. They’re moments when the individual and all of their training get out of the way and the individual then becomes just a channel for the Force.

Tl;dr, The Force-sensitives of the galaxy have been held back by an unrealistic code, and only by eschewing its stricter tenets can they achieve their true potential.
**WARNING: READING THIS COULD POTENTIALLY SPOIL THE LAST JEDI. READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.**

It's so inevitable that the second film of the sequel trilogy will feature a major wtf moment that Lucasfilm themselves have already promised "shocking revelations of the past" in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

So what then could possibly, *possibly* rival perhaps the most famous line ever delivered on the silver screen? 

*No, I am your father*

A twist so shocking it had to confirmed again in Return of the Jedi.

First let's take a look at that twist and what it meant to the story at large in Star Wars.

The original film was a space western, a classic hero's journey, rescue the princess, good vs evil film. 3/4 of the way through Empire, the film was still about good vs evil, and it looked like that was the direction the film would keep heading: Luke Skywalker recouping some how from this defeat and rising to the occasion in the next film to defeat the evil Darth Vader.

And then the greatest twist in cinema history so far happened.

*No, I am your father.*

The story from then out completely shifted. It went from Luke Skywalker wanting to defeat Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker wanting to redeem Anakin Skywalker. 

It changed the direction of the story. 

Now so far in this sequel trilogy we've got a young woman embarking on her own hero's journey whose goal now seems to be convincing the retired, slightly bitter old warrior to take up arms again and join the fight. Then the story will presumably be about good vs evil yet again with Rey and company looking defeat Snoke and his First Order and save the galaxy. 

But we know better. Something awaits us in this tale that is about to flip the narrative on its head. To take our expectations of this story and completely go the opposite way. 

But what?

---

**Let's talk about Snoke**

*What a way to make an entrance for the big bad guy! Literally towering over Hux and Ren, voice echoing throughout a massive cathedral, he's huge! He's intimidating! He's... wait... did he just flicker?*

*It was just a super huge hologram? Why am I reminded of The Wizard of Oz?*

Tell me this wasn't your exact thought process as that scene unfolded! 

Snoke is so shrouded in mystery and darkness that fans the world over have come up with crazy theories as to some secret identity of the Supreme Leader, be it Darth Plagueis, Emperor Palpatine, Mace Windu, Boba Fett, Leia, Kylo Ren from the future, that little blonde kid Anakin kills in the Jedi Temple, and even Chancellor Valorum and Jar Jar Binks! And the people involved with this film will be the first to tell you:

Your Snoke Theory Sucks. 

But at the heart of all these crazy theories lies one common denominator: everyone wants Snoke to be someone he's not because if Snoke is just Snoke... that's boring. We don't really care about a Snoke that is just Snoke. He's just a bigger, badder emperor with better style, right? A villain who will be replaced by a bigger badder version of him in the next trilogy. 

Well let me tell you why all your Snoke theories suck:

**You don't know Snoke**

First of all look at that name. It's obviously derivative of "smoke" and "snake". Smoke as in **distractions**. Snake as in **deceit**. 

Did you know that a *snoek* is a type of fish? But not just any type of fish, folks. It's a **herring**. 

[Check out this picture of Snoke, Ren, and Hux](http://ll-c.ooyala.com/e1/5qOHluYjE6mCRdi42eX9bbtskF67g_ST/promo322348794)

You've probably seen it a thousand times. Have you ever noticed the rays of light? How they kind of look like strings propping up the Supreme Leader and Kylo Ren? Like they were almost... puppets?

Folks the first scene we are introduced to Snoke could not be more metaphorical: despite initially appearing as such, **SNOKE IS NOT OUR BIG BADDIE IN THIS TRILOGY**

------

**THE TWIST TO END ALL TWISTS**

If your minds are not completely blown and/or you haven't been scared off to this point that you might spoil The Last Jedi for yourself then now that we've established that Snoke is just a puppet we need to figure out who is pulling his strings.

Whoever is controlling Snoke has to be powerful. Snoke is said to be strong in the dark side of the Force so his master must be stronger.

From a narrative standpoint it has to be someone we'll actually care about who is pulling the strings. Sorry Plagueis fans. 

It must be a natural continuation of the story, something that doesn't retcon past events or bring back dead characters. 

And with that I will point you to the very first freakin clue JJ Abrams planted for us in The Force Awakens:

*Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence the sinister First Order has risen from the ashes of the Empire*

Luke disappeared, and the First Order just... rose up?

And how about that burning temple we keep seeing, what *actually* happened there? 

Why is Snoke willing to let the map to Luke Skywalker, the most powerful man in the galaxy, be destroyed rather than use his super weapon on the system Luke's in and eliminate the threat for good? 

The answer ladies and gentlemen to all of these questions is:

**LUKE SKYWALKER FELL TO THE DARKSIDE**

Just as Yoda warned him in Empire that if he started down that path it would dominate his destiny forever. Luke absolutely started down that path in Return Of The Jedi.

The power of the dark side is and has always has been analogous to drug abuse.  It alters mindsets, changes physical appearance, and changes the eyes of people who use it. 

Luke used it and succumbed to that power. 

If you need any more convincing, Fisher and Ford got what they always wanted for their characters in the Sequel Trilogy: Han Solo died and Leia is a strong independent woman whose passion is her duty to doing what's right. Well, Hammil always wanted for Luke to go evil.

----

Coming full circle this twist does what "No I am your father" did for the original trilogy by flipping the narrative on its head and sending our characters after a whole new endgame. Luke being evil not only will blow minds around the world but suddenly we'll find ourselves invested in this villain and caring about what happens to him in the end. 

It makes the endgame of IX bringing Luke back to the light.

Like his father before him.







ok so this one is simple   M'Baku   had his people steal the heart-shaped herb while he was fighting for the throne 

its why he wasn't tempted to take it when it was offered to him later 

it's also why he seems to much bigger later In the film   

if I understand how it works in the comics ( and hopefully in the films )  his powers would be more akin to his great ape  spirit animal as a posted to tch T'Challa's panther spirit animalWhat if the reality that we saw played out in Endgame was one of the scenarios where we lost? Technically we won, but what if Dr Strange was talking about a reality where no one died and it was an absolute victory. Quite a few of the realities he had seen did have the Avengers best Thanos, but with serious casualties, and so Dr Strange considered those to be losses (because part of Stephen Strange's character is that he's a perfectionist). So maybe the 1 finger gesture was him asking Tony to wait just a minute for backup to arrive or for Captain Marvel to get back in the fight, but Tony saw it as this being the only way to beat Thanos was for him to snap. And so Dr Strange inadvertently caused a reality where one of earth's mightiest heroes died, despite technically winning, thus it was not an absolute win, thus it was not the victory Strange was talking about in Infinity War.I think that Cap is Star Lords biological grandfather. The actress who plays Meredith Quill, is in 3 movies. She’s Peters mom in Guardians 1&2, but she also plays a woman who grabs caps attention during his tour in the first avenger in the 40s. Every other town he stops in was displayed on the screen except the one where he meets her. St. Louis was a super popular spot for stuff like that, Peters family is from MO. The scene goes he’s blowing past everyone, he’s on autopilot going from town to town doing the same show over and over again but then he sees her and stops dead in his tracks and his mouth opens, and there’s a big flash from a camera. I THINK, that they had a one-night stand and she got pregnant, then later met the man that plays his grandfather in the first guardians. 

More evidence is that if Peter is just a normal guy, how come he has the inner light and none of the other MILLIONS of egos kids didn’t?  Almost NOTHING is done in movies by accident, why would they cast that same woman for those two parts?

Also, merediths mom isn’t in the hospital room when she dies a young death. Of course life happens, that’s not necessarily PROOF, but it’s just another thing that fits nicely.

The timeline and age of actress match up too. Gma has Meredith in the mid 40s, Peter was a young boy in the late 70s early 80s, actress was 30-31 when filming GOTG2 in the scenes when she meets Ego. 

Now people’s hang-ups with the theory: 
1.) Peters grandfather is in the hospital room with Meredith when she dies. 

     -Right, but it’s possible to have one-night stands and her mother met him after her run-in with Cap.  Knowing that Cap is a good guy and would have raised the baby, shield/the gov likely would have made sure it was kept secret from him. 

2.) people, based on nothing, assume Cap is a virgin. 

-He was getting a little cocky and arrogant around this part of the movie as he was beginning to become a celebrity. Plus, Peggy shoots at him to test the shield because he’s getting this way and it’s implied she’s jealous. 

TLDR: cap is Star lords gpa cause the actress who plays Meredith quill has a part in TFA where it’s implied something happens with her and cap. Fast forward to GOTG2 where Peter is the only offspring of Egos’ millions of kids to have the inner light.  Plus timeline matches up pretty perfectly


UPDATE: many of you pointed out the most likely reason Peter was the only success cause he was older than the other offspring. I think this is likely the actual reason Peter had the inner light. It’s a good point guys, especially when you factor in the “it’s not ripe yet” joke in the beginning. 

BUT, my devils advocate reply, though, not super strong, is that ego is as old as time itself, so if he collected one kid per year of his life he’d be well over a billion kids. Even if he was just as old as earth, that’s 4.5 billion kids. I’m gonna guess he was going we s higher clip than 1 kid/year. Not 1 made it past puberty? Not 1 was old enough?We all know the medical droid in ROTS says that Padme is dying because she has lost the will to live. This is of course not something a droid is really capable of determining, so it’s likely just speculation. Personally I hated the “lost the will to live” thing because it makes a character that is strong look weak. My theory: Padme did not lose the will to live, she was drained of her life energy from saving Luke and Leia. Yes, I know this sounds similar to the “Palpatine drained Padme’s life force to save Anakin” theory, but the problem I have with that theory is it suggests Palpatine is far more powerful than he ever shows himself to be, by draining the life of someone across the galaxy. No, I believe when Anakin choked Padme, it didn’t harm her so much as it harmed the twins. Padme, being pregnant with two very Force sensitive children was connected to these children through the force. After Anakin choked her, Padme, likely on an unconscious level used her life energy to save the children. Essentially Padme sacrifices her life to save her children.Dr. Strange couldn't even maintain his shield when fighting Kaecilius the first time.  Only a day or so later he goes up against Dormammu.

Like resetting a video game over and over again, he gets to practice endlessly.  By the time the deal is done, Strange has honed and perfected his techniques.  He has become a master in one day.

In the official timeline, the entire movie takes place in 2016.  It bothered me how he could go from completely ignorant of magic's existence to the world's best sorcerer.  By the time loop he is able to develop his skills to perfection.Bender is constantly seen drinking beer, despite being a robot. This is explained in the show by the fact that robots run on alcohol. My theory is Bender is seen drinking so much more than other robots is since beer isn't 100% alcohol, he has to drink more of it to stay powered. And the reason he drinks beer instead of drinking pure alcohol is the same reason he smokes: He thinks it makes him look coolIn James Gunn’s *The Suicide Squad* we are introduced to Nanaue a.k.a King Shark. A sentient shark man who is thought to be a God - based on a Hawaiian deity. And true to that perception he is kind of super powerful and impervious to most attacks & beings. However while its shown he can be beaten back by smart or clever means & even bleed (thanks to the little critters from Jotunheim) it’s clear that Nanaue probably is indestructible.

Now, almost every weapon and even a collapsing stone tower were shown to be unable to kill him. Even getting thrown by Starro didn’t phase him. So what makes us the viewer think it was possible for a manufactured syringe to pierce his skin?

Nanaue however is also shown to be rather… simple. His intelligence isn’t quite to an average human. But bless him he tries. This is why it’s my belief that Nanaue isn’t actually injected with a nanite bomb like the rest of Task Force X. The immediate solution was that Waller or Rick Flag just told Nanaue he had the bomb implanted in him. He thus believed it which got him to cooperate with the team.Yes, this is another I posted on TVTropes' WMG section for the franchise. I know I should stop posting them here, but I came up with a lot of fan theories that I posted in the WMG that I think are good enough to be shared here.  And this is one of them.  So, sorry if I bore you guys with repeats.


Now, no one ever questioned why the DeLorean's engine in the first film cut off as Marty attempts to head back to 1985 from 1955, or why it cuts off again when he gets there. There is a possibility: the DeLorean time machine gets "interference" (the best word I can think of to describe it) from other DeLorean time machines. Think about this: When Marty attempts to head back to 1985, he gets into place and everything is set. Then the engine cuts off. Maybe the reason why is that at roughly the same moment in time (by a few minutes at least), the future DeLorean (as seen in Back To The Future Part 2) gets struck by lightning and is sent back in time to 1885. Somehow, when the DeLorean travels, it emits something that interferes with the engine of other nearby time-traveling DeLoreans. And it takes time for this interference to dissipate (which explains how Marty was able to start the engine again only a few minutes after it cut off). When he gets back to 1985, it is at 1:24AM, three minutes after the DeLorean's first time jump. This is what causes the DeLorean to conk out again shortly after arriving, because whatever the interference that was generated by the previous DeLorean's time jump was still in the area and hadn't completely dissipated when the Libyans drove by. The only time that one DeLorean time machine doesn't affect any other is the one residing inside of the cave that Doc put in there in 1885.So I have a theory on Jerry (Gary? Larry?) Gergich from Parks and Rec.  This doesn't require any mental gymnastics or oddball theories on he and his family being "Soviet Sleeper Agents" or anything like that.  This theory is pulling facts from the show and drawing a simple conclusion that ties them together and explains why he's always so clumsy and dumb when not at home.

**Here is a small list of facts about Jerry's personality while away from home:**   
    1. Jerry is extraordinarily clumsy and easily distracted.   
    2. Jerry is often the butt of everyone's jokes at work, usually aimed at his ineptitude while working.   
    3. Jerry is ACTUALLY inept while at work, constantly messing up even the simplest tasks.   
    [Evidence](http://www.vulture.com/2015/02/parks-and-recreation-jerry.html)

**Now here is a small list of facts about Jerry's very puzzling home life:**   
    1. Jerry has a beautiful wife, and three gorgeous daughters.   
    2. Jerry has been married for almost 30 years.   
    3. Gayle seems to genuinely love Jerry very much.   
    4. Jerry's confidence, agility, and happiness are much higher while at home.   
    5. Although not confirmed, Jerry's daughters are old enough that the eldest one used to date Chris Traeger, a 46 year old man.  This puts his oldest daughter well into her mid to late 20s, and the other girls are probably not far behind, as they all look very close in age.  This tells me that Jerry had his daughters early into his marriage.   

**Finally, some other random facts about Jerry that I feel are important to my final conclusion:**   
    1. [Jerry has the largest penis that this doctor has ever seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIsxkiWE1M8)   
    2. Jerry astounded Donna by not getting tired or bored while licking hundreds of envelopes.  In his words, that task "just made sense" to him.   
    3. Jerry once licked ketchup off of Leslie, but only because he was checking to see if it was blood.
    
**Here is my conclusion:**   
Gayle is actually a massive sex-addict.  Jerry, having the longest penis that doctor has ever seen, plus being very skilled and very willing to use his tongue, was the perfect man for Gayle.  She locked him down, and they immediately popped out three children early on.  At this point I am assuming that they had to do something to keep from getting too many children, so Jerry opted for a vasectomy.  From this point on, Jerry and Gayle had a very happy marriage, with sex being the glue that keeps them extremely cheerful.  Going to work, however, depresses Jerry, as he spends most of the day distracted by thoughts of Gayle.  Additionally, any arousal that he feels will instantly make him uncomfortable, as he knows that his massive penis will either be obvious to everyone else, or it's so far down his pants that it trips him up while just walking around.

The moment Jerry goes home, he and Gayle decide to unwind with some early evening sex, basically rebooting him into the calm, collected man he truly is.This may be a little farfetched. But when I saw the new trailer, I noticed the passport number of Peter being 5S280806. I might have just gone crazy and joined the wrong dots. But ... If we convert the latter part into a date, we get 28/08/06. This is when the Amazing [S]piderman was in it's #[5]33 issue. It was the Civil War Event and at the end of Civil War #2, he is revealed as Spiderman. This continues in issue #533 released in Aug 2006 (can't find exact date) where we finally see him tell his story to the world. Could this be a clue to the film doing something similar? The reason we don't see Uncle Ben die in homecoming, even in a flashback is because they are prepping Tony to fill that role.

Tony has this arc with Spidey where he recruits him, becomes his mentor, then watches Spidey disappear. When the "deaths" are undone, Peter is in trouble again at some point in Endgame and Tony will sacrifice himself to save the kid. It will complete his arc and will also mirror what we usually see with Uncle Ben.Jafar, the creepy, twisted, parrot abuser, for all his faults, brings to mind an interesting point that isn't explored in the movies. His first wish, as a previous theory has pointed out, was squandered out of stupidity because of his low view of what was important. But his second wish is where things get interesting. He wishes to be "the most powerful sorcerer in the world". Now, if Genie had have given him the power of illusions and parlour tricks, I wouldn't really bat an eye, thinking "ok, yeah...sorcery is hard." But he basically gives him physics defying, matter creating, baller powers that allow him to conjure chains and giant hourglasses out of nothing. Then he turns himself into a giant snake with the majority of the body forming out of fire...into solid matter. That's pretty freaking powerful in my opinion. 

Which brings me to the point of this post. Who was the "most powerful sorcerer" before Jafar? Because, though other theories have proven that Genie goes all out when granting Aladdin's prince wish, he likes Aladdin. He does not, however, like Jafar. So my idea is that he made Jafar only marginally more powerful than the next most powerful sorcerer. Who the hell is that badass? Is there a cabal of sorcerers we don't know about? A council of mages that push each other to the limits of magic? These are questions I would like answered...Dwight and Angela frequently used to meet in the warehouse to have sex, who else worked at the warehouse? Roy. In Season 2 Roy revealed to everyone that he would sleep with Angela, even though he was engaged to Pam. In a webisode where 3,000 USD goes missing, we find out that Angela likes Roy. I believe that Roy had an affair with Angela.

1. Roy used to work in the warehouse, since he couldn't leave Angela would meet him there to have sex, she also met up with Dwight at the same spot after Roy had been let go.
2. Angela always had something to say about Pam. I think she was jealous that Pam got to be with Roy, and that's why she made such unnecessary comments towards Pam.
3. Roy didn't let Pam go out for drinks with the office, why? Because he was afraid Angela might say something about her and Roy's relationship.
4.  In season 5, everyone found out that Angela was cheating on Andy, we know that she had sex with Dwight, but Pam also pointed out that she believed she was sleeping with multiple men. It's possible that one of these men could have been Roy, if they hadn't slept together before they definitely had now.So Perry mission is usually to stop dr.doofenshrmitz , but that may not be his only mission ,his second mission may be monitoring Phineas and Ferb ,as potential threats.
Why are they threats? Because they can create whatever they want, ¡heck! they can destroy the earth if they felt like it.
As seen in the movie he does scan Phineas and Ferb's previous inventions 
Also when Phineas say his iconic line "Ferb, I know what were gonna do today" Perry always leaves, because with the context of that line Perry knows that there gonna something harmless for the day.
In the episode that Perry dreams that they found out his secret identity, a swat team comes and takes Phineas and Ferb  , probably to lock them up for a more extreme way to prevent them to be a threat.
This "second mission" goes to other people's pets like Isabellas Chihuahua . Isabella is a potential threat because she's shown many times to be highly skilled in combat, and she's the leader of the fireside girls which are very militaristic and extremely organized.
The reason they have this "second mission" is to decrease the existince of people like doofenshmirtz , who are incredibly gifted but use their gifts for evil,  or  when the "threats" are  old enough they can  recruit them.Hello! Welcome to this very spontaneous theory I have thought up in the past 8 minutes. We all know that Disney has been able to incorporate a few adult/mature/dirty jokes in their films. A quick google search will deliver unto you a plethora of Buzzfeed lists and subpar Youtube compilations outlining these subtle and not-so-subtle "hidden" jokes. This brings me to my theory: The 1997 Hercules film made a joke about Meg giving a blowjob to Nessus, the River Guardian Centaur. Let us discuss.

When we are first introduced to Megara (her friends call her Meg, or at least they would if she had any friends) she is seen being accosted by Nessus at the river. Hercules arrives and saves the day, and also Danny Devito is there. When Meg is later confronted by Hades after the encounter, he questions her about why she was unable to get Nessus to help with Hades' plan to take over Olympus and such. Meg says "Sorry but he made me an offer I had to refuse." I do not believe this phrasing to be a coincidence. We all know in the Godfather, there is the famous line about the "offer he couldn't refuse." What did that offer end up being? A horse head.

Horse. Head. Nessus is a centaur. For those of you playing along at home, that means he is half horse, half human. Nessus made her the same offer (except she did refuse it but that's besides the point). He offered Meg his "horse head" ;) 

Thank's for reading my crackpot theory!

EDITS: People commenting about is this actually bestiality because centaurs and sentience and stuff. I honestly have no clue. All I know is it involves a horse dick. Also thanks to the guy who commented and explained the Godfather quotes/references fully!I've been sitting on this one for a while now because I view it more as a subtlety than as a theory but the more I discuss this movie with others the more I find it completely goes over most people's heads.

I was always a big fan of the film but it became my favorite when I realized this one core component to the story.

In the beginning we are exposed to the Wuxi finger hold via Master Shifu and Po. Po is standing before a Kung-Fu master that has just insulted his personal hygiene and told him that it is impossible for him to be the dragon warrior. Taking offense and fancying himself a bigger deal than he is, Po  threateningly menaces a pointed finger at him. 

"Listen, Oogway said that-" 
the obvious continuation "I am the dragon warrior." but doesn't get to finish his sentence because his finger is snapped up by Shifu into the Wuxi Finger Hold, which Po immediately recognizes.

Po, despite his fanboy attitude prior, for a brief moment thinks himself a big deal because he has been chosen as the Dragon Warrior and in that brief moment of pride he is immediately shown his hubris.

He cowers, apologizes and is released.
His very first lesson, is immediate and swift; pride and disrespect have no place in Kung-Fu.


That is also the fundamental lesson that Tai Lung could never learn; it is why Oogway would never acknowledge him as the dragon warrior and it is inevitably Tai Lung's downfall. 


"You can't defeat me!" He raises a pointed finger at Po disrespectfully

"You're just a big....fat...panda!"

And he lashes out at him with an open claw to try and swipe at Po's throat.


While not a quote from Kung-Fu panda one of it's great idioms is that "Benevolence is at the heart of Kung-Fu"


To lash out with an open claw at Po's neck is to embrace a killing blow. He has disrespected the most fundamental principles that Kung-Fu is based on, and that is why he is left vulnerable to the Wuxi Fingerhold.


Even after Tai Lung is caught in what he knows is a death sentence, he refuses to believe that Po could've learned or been taught one of the most powerful Kung-Fu techniques in existence despite carrying the title of Dragon Warrior.


Even in the face of death his pride doesn't let him apologize or repent or lament or even acknowledge the skill of his opponent.


The Wuxi finger hold is all about respect. If you wave your finger around in people's faces and point at people or try and lash out with a lethal claw you leave yourself open to humiliating downfall at the hands of great masters. 

Practice respect and humility above all else.

EDIT: SkidooshI havent seen this anywhere but that is only after a 15min ecosia search so sorry but...Interstellar had a very grapes of wrath opening with dust bowls and soil erosion issues leading us to believe that that was the cause of the lack of crop diversification. The last 2 were okra and corn. I wondered why those 2 and many can say well they are actually very hardy plants that can handle a wide variety of soil and are relatively drought tolerant, but there are plenty of plants like that, so what gives. Well neither need bees to pollinate. Corn is grown closely together to allow for wind pollination and okra is a self pollinator with both M/F parts. I think this is a big reason they are the last major crops, there are no bees to pollinate the crops.This is a theory that has been floating around the comic book shops for years now, but I figured I share it because one of my favorite head Canons.

J.J. Jameson sees Parker come in with some average and rather unspectacular photos of random crap from NY that really has no place being in a newspaper. Then, suddenly this kid comes back with beautifully taken pictures of Spiderman from seemingly impossible angles. Jameson is not an idiot, he's been in the newspaper business for over 20 years and knows a fraud when he sees it. He soon realizes that Parker is Spiderman and decides to run a smear campaign against Spidey. Why? Because he knows Peter. He sees how dedicated Peter becomes when you give him a challenge. So Jameson challenges Spiderman to do better through the newspaper. He challenges Spiderman to prove the Daily Bugle wrong and to his credit, Spiderman does exactly that. Every time the Bugle runs a nasty a piece on Spiderman, Peter gets right back out there and tries even harder to do right. In short, Jameson keeps Spiderman from getting complacent; he makes sure there's always a villain for Spiderman to fight even if it's himself. If Jameson really wanted good news stories, he'd focus on the real villains that cause mayhem (Carnage, Venom, Sinister Six, etc...) and while he does write about these other characters he knows that bad news makes for good headlines, so he creates his own villain in Spiderman without having to glorify the other real villains in the world. Jameson gets his headlines, Spiderman gets a challenge, and the true villains aren't glorified too much.The four Thorsmen of the apocalypse. Sorry I couldn't resist.

Phase 4 of the MCU is set to be the strangest yet, with the recent addition of time travel, the upcoming multiverse and the possible altered reality in wandavision, literally anything can happen.

The Theory/speculation 

In Jason Aaron's fantastic series we are introduced to three Thors. One from the distant viking age past. One from the present and King Thor from the distant future. In the series the Thors are brought together by a series of events caused by the god butchering villain, Gorr. An epic Fight ensues.

I believe that the upcoming Thor:  love and thunder will pull from this storyline but will change some of the details to match the MCU.

Here's what i think will go down..

While adventuring through the galaxy with the Guardians of the galaxy, Thor will be pulled out of his timeline and into a distant future. There he will meet the future King Thor version of himself and younger, brasher version. These Three will not get along . In the future almost all the gods are dead or enslaved, Gorr rules with a iron fist. Thor will have to come to terms with his violent warrior past and his bleak future and lead "himselves" against Gorr.

This would work well to see how Thor has matured and changed since his days as a viking god and the bitter lonely old man he will become.The three will have to put aside their differences and band together to defeat Gorr.

But more importantly young Thor has brought an old friend with him from the past.
Mjolnir!!!

Mjolnir immediately leaves the trio and flies to earth,  landing at the feet of a cancer stricken Jane Foster. Upon picking up the hammer her strength returns and she is given the power of Thor. In this idea the hammer is connected to Thor and it is designed to protect those he loves. The hammer does not go to her to give her power but to extend her life. The Power of a thunder god is a nice side effect, but it comes with responsibility. 

With all three Thors out of the current timeline Gorr Attacks Valkyrie and New Asgard hoping to extinguish another pantheon of gods(that's kinda his thing). Jane takes up the mantle of Thor and goes to New Asgard to meet Gorr head on.Yesterday, I wrote a [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/gabrap/the_office_brian_the_boom_mic_guy_is_not_in_love/) for *The Office* that dives into the characters of the documentary crew a bit. That got me thinking of the "documentary" being filmed for *Parks & Recreation* and the floating logic behind it.

The documentary crew behind *Parks & Rec* likely does not exist within the world of Pawnee. They are constantly able to film intimate and impossible moments, characters never seem to mind being filmed even when caught in compromising positions, and the crew is never outright acknowledged or shown. While in *The Office* you have characters interact with the camera crew in rare moments (removing/muting mics, bumping into cameramen, eventually seeing and releasing the documentary), *Parks & Rec* has none of this. Also, knowing what we know of Ron Swanson, why would he *ever* agree to be constantly filmed for ten years?

In the episode *Practice Date*, Leslie gets drunk and shows up at her future boyfriend Dave's house in the middle of the night. She winks to the camera and states that she believes things are going well, and Dave openly asks her who she's talking to. This is a clear acknowledgment that either this scene did not happen in their reality, or *the documentary is in Leslie's head*.

We know that Leslie knows an almost encyclopedic knowledge of all of her friends due to her gift giving abilities and thoroughness when it comes to studying behavior. It isn't too often that she's surprised by her coworkers and in the rare instances that she is, we're often surprised too. We know she has a [knack for impressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqIfVBEH8bs) and would probably be able to guess how a lot of her friends would react to certain situations. Because of this, I believe that she would be capable of picturing what an accurate documentary of her life would probably look like.

An unrelated show kind of showcases this concept: in an episode of *BoJack Horseman* called "Ruthie", the great-great-great granddaughter of Princess Carolyn narrates the events of her day via a class project set in the distant future. At the end of the episode, it's revealed that Princess Carolyn only fantasized about this scenario as a way to cope with the stress and heartache of her day, and that she pretends that one day everything is going to be okay and it's just going to be a part of her story.

Knowing what we know of Leslie, I think it's very fair to guess that she's the kind of person who would fantasize about people years from now watching a documentary about how the deputy director of the parks & rec department in a small town in Indiana climbed the ladder of government. I believe that everything in the documentary *does* happen, but the talking heads are just very accurate guesses from Leslie of how her friends and acquaintances would react in certain situations.In The Last Airbender,Zucos uncle knew where Aang was THE ENTIRE TIME. Even though Aang randomly traveled in the first season,Iroh always somehow KNEW where Aang was. HOW? The spiritworld. When Aang dreamed about a storm coming,Iroh also told Zuco the same thing. Aang knew cuz of Avatar shit but how did Iroh know? It would explain why he was always trying to calm Zuco down. And he never caught AAng because after blowin up an entire city Iroh wanted to end the war from the inside. Next time you watch,watch how he plays chess at the beginning and end of ALOT of episodes, He controlled EVERYTHING from the jump yo.What exactly ARE Muggles?
----

So everyone in the wizarding world is very wrapped around the idea of "magic blood" right? Wizards have it, Muggles don't. Which we know is bullshit right away because of Hermione. But even Harry and friends believe that magic "runs in families" and Muggle-born wizards happen when two Muggles' latent magical genes pair up *just right* and so on.

Now Harry is not exactly the sharpest broom in the closet (under the stairs) otherwise he would have realized this story is full of holes.
----

If magic were *in any way* genetic then Squibs would not be ostracized, because a union of two Squibs would be quite likely to produce a "full-blood" wizard. Squibs would simply be thought of as "magic skipping a generation." Instead Squibs are treated as imbeciles and evolutionary dead ends, the same way medieval societies treated people with learning disorders and mild mental disabilities.

It's interesting that Harry never thinks to investigate how the 

airtight magical tests that supposedly distinguish Muggles from Muggle-born Wizards
---

 *actually work*. Some examples of spells that do this are the Hogwarts acceptance letters, the Muggle-repelling wards around Hogwarts, and so on. If these pieces of magic are not mere shams by Dumbledore and his allies, if they *work* - remember they're magic not science, Lucius Malfoy should have no problem understanding them - then how is there any legal or social controversy over the status of Muggle-born Wizards?

Also, we hear that wizarding schools like Durmstrang have at times not accepted Muggle-born students. Okay. So what happens to them?

In the later books we learn that the Ministry has 

a pervasive spying network that invades potentially every household in Britain to detect underage wizardry
----

and Harry for some reason does not think this is *overkill* to track the *at most forty Hogwarts students at any given time* who have Muggle homes? Most of whom are far more obedient than Harry, anyway, and don't *need* a spy network to detect if they're dropping cakes or inflating aunts?

Reality check time. If wizarding ability is the result of genetics, then why do beginning wizards have to learn long strings of meaningless codes ("Wingardium Leviosa!") that have to be pronounced *just right or the magic won't work?* Yet at the *same time* there are Muggle-born wizards out there ***"didya-ever-make-anythin-happen"-ing*** their hearts out without knowing a *word* of Wizard spells?

It's pretty obvious - contrary to *everything* that *everyone* tells Harry - that wizarding ability is like language. It's latent in the deep structures of the human brain, but has to be brought forth and shaped by human culture, otherwise it remains wild and feral. 

Humans raised by wizards in Britain turn out to be wizards - naturally, just like they turn out speaking English.

And spells are language-like - or like strings of nonsense words - because they interact with the language center of the brain. Spells are the brain "fooling itself" into unlocking magic. Which is why mature wizards can cast without speaking, just by visualizing.

So it's worth underlining:

There is no genetic key. Every single human being is a potential Wizard.
----


***EDIT: because people didn't understand the full implications I am editing an explanation here.***

Basically everyone has the latent ability to become a wizard, you "unlock it" by one of two means:

1. Being raised by wizards in wizard culture.

2. Having an early childhood experience where you are put in danger, or call on your magic to help someone (e.g. you wish really hard that you could help your friend who is being bullied, all of a sudden the bullies are hanging from a chimney by their underpants).

It's clear that BOTH explanations apply to Harry. For the first year of his life he was "raised Wizard" and "exposed" to lots of powerful bits of magic (including a **Fidelius Charm** and **Avada Kadavra**, to name a few...). Then for the next ten years of his life he was raised as a Muggle but periodically "broke through" to his innate magical abilities because of neglect and bullying.

For most Muggle-borns (or so-called Muggle-borns) they probably 'unlocked' their magic by the second means (the "breakthrough") or by accidentally stumbling on magic. Even though they didn't understand it at the time or were Obliviated to forget, the magic made its impact and unlocked the magic bit of their mind.

Anyway, this explains how VERY FEW "Muggle" children end up unlocking their wizard abilities, but NEARLY all "Wizard" children do so.
----

***end EDIT***

See the whole "wizarding world" is just a charade of a few privileged families trying desperately to hold on to power...they want to pretend that they're better than us. And the way to keep holding on to that fantasy is by tightly restricting who can *learn* about magic *by attending Hogwarts.* 

If *anybody* could attend, it would become clear that *anybody can learn.*
---

 (as long as they start young). It would also become clear that Squibs are simply wizards with the equivalent of "language disabilities" in the wizarding-language part of their brains. And that there is no distinction between "Muggle born wizards" and "Muggles." See... all this time... Albus Dumbledore has simply been picking Muggle names out of a hat.

Whenever a kid manifested particularly wild and feral magic... the kind that might make adults *actually notice* instead of dismissing it as  "strange coincidences" or whatnot - that kid is bound to get a Hogwarts letter. A letter which absorbs him into the masquerade of the Wizarding World, makes him a Wizard...

by making him believe he is "better" and "different" from the Muggles who raised him or her
---

which makes him determined to keep the secret... marry a Wizard and join the Wizarding World... and carry no secrets back to the Muggles.

Muggles who don't get absorbed into the WW, but demonstrate feral magic ability, simply get Dementored.

So along comes a wizard who basically wants Wizards to try to rule Muggles. "For the Greater Good" he said. He didn't say whose.
----

Grindelwald knew that Wizards could never rule Muggles because *Muggles don't exist.* The purpose of Grindelwald's war was to play on the pureblood snobbery of families like Malfoy, to incite a war that WOULD REVEAL WIZARDRY TO MUGGLES. Thus 

allowing Muggles to realize that they're aren't Muggles.
----

which would make the gift of Magic free to everyone on Planet Earth. But you know who stopped Grindelwald? Dumbledore.

And when another wizard came along, a ***half blood orphan*** who nevertheless trumpeted the pureblood propaganda (and people believed *he* believed it! what fools!) and tried to incite a similar war, even tearing apart his soul to ensure that he could never be killed until the war escalated to the attention of "Muggles," do you know who plotted his demise?

Albus Dumbledore.

That bastard.In most of the Super Mario games "dying" is represented by Mario or any playable character being thrown down and out of the screen, under the screen there is an empty black "underworld" no visible to the player, any time a character falls into a "bottomless pit" they are also falling into this underworld, once they fall there they pay Lakitu with a green mushroom to be fished back to the surface, during the Mario Kart cups Lakitu is paid a large amount of green mushrooms in advance in exchange to fishing up any players that fall out of the tracks as many times as it may be necessary, when a player runs out of green mushrooms, they don't die, they are just stuck into the underground and have to track back and search for a place where the surface and the underground connect so they could climb up by themselves, that is the reason why, when you get a game over in some of the games, your character is forced to move back the beginning of the current World, it is because that is the closest point where the underworld and the surface connect.I was rewatching Chamber of Secrets and noticed an odd image. Harry flips between a photo of James & Lily and then a photo of himself with Ron & Hermione. Ron & Hermione are in the same position as James & Lily.  In some regards they are not only his friends, but the only "real" family Harry has.

**Love Protection** is without question a major theme of the series. People may not love the ship of Hermione & Ron , but as the series has an arc based around their love - it's not absurd to believe that their love growing together was one of the elements saving Harry from Voldemort and many other things.

The theme of Sorcerer's Stone and other books is that the parental love of Lily (and James) was an unbreakable force that Voldemort couldn't destroy.

It slowly caused me to contemplate something deeper than the friendship of the trio.Harry often refers to Hogwarts as a home.Now I am not referring to a theory that Ron & Hermione are re-incarnated James & Lily.

But I believe Dumbledore saw into the future and knew that Ron & Hermione were a couple that was bound to happen and have a pretty strong family of their own one day.

Think about the first thing we really know about James & Lily. They both died sacrificing themselves for Harry.  What happens in the final chapters of the book?  Ron & Hermione , out of love , offer to sacrifice themselves in both of their preferred challenges for Harry to move on and defeat Voldemort. These are sacrifices they make like parents. Not kids. Not friends.Hogwarts is a boarding school, but the one thing that Harry lacked to get through school was an experience in a normal family dynamic.  He doesn't have parents to rely on when it came through the emotional turmoil. Instead he's given the next best thing. Two people who provide that for him that will (together) be parents one day.   In many ways, Ron & Hermione not only saved Harry from various plots to end his life - but they kept him from reaching a darkness that any orphan dealing with trauma might go through --- the same kind that tormented Tom Riddle.

Despite being young , there is a Fatherly & Motherly love that Ron and Hermione bring to Harry that he never had.Ron teaches him how to socialize, play games, and make light on dark topics. Hermione keeps him up to date on what he must learn, helps him deal with complex problems, and worries about him.

They fearlessly nag with each other , often over what Harry should do.In the first 3-4 books they are almost like new parents, focusing on Harry - searching for him when he's gone , talking about him relentlessly.

Behind this theory....

Keep in mind that Dumbledore sends Harry with Hagrid to 9 & 3/4 and they arrive late. The Weasleys are traditionally late to this experience - not even knowing where 9 & 3/4 is (spell?), meaning Ron had the best shot of being Harry's friend on the train to Hogwarts.

Now Ron is also the perfect person to represent Gryffindor for Harry. Not only is he a funny / kind friend that has his own unluck issues.  But he has a whole wonky family that is part of Gryffindor... something Harry longs for in the earlier chapters.  Without this there's really no reason why Harry would care so much about joining Gryffindor (swaying the Sorting Hat)

Now - using magic even get a Dumbledore card in the Chocolate Frog.  ( Ron, the 6th child, has 6 Dumbledore cards)

Hermione meets Harry & Ron.... while CHASING A LOST FROG ( Nevilles).

Hermione in Book 1 is pretty certain she'll make Ravenclaw, however her heart's desire was to join Gryffindor.  This seems a bit strange , however it's possible that Dumbledore may have done something behind the scenes to change her mind to Gryffindor.

The puzzles at the end of Book 1 were obviously made for Ron & Hermione in specific. Both not only required their special suit of skills but they were also requiring Bravery & Loyalty.

As far as I am aware Book 1 is the only book where Hermione/Harry/Ron are in every single class together.  The odds of this happening are slightly small.

There's also an elements of Dumbledore being relatively aware of R&H. Promoting them both to prefects. Calling them out for points in the last book also felt a bit weird.  Leaving both of them in his will.  Think of all of the important people in Dumbledore's life. Yes, Harry was important, but somehow he had a strong affection for both R&H as if he owed them something (yes, I realize that there's a horocrux adventure ahead but still).

By putting around a married couple (before they were married or even expressed their love for each other) around Harry it reduced the horocrux from growing.  Ron & Hermione's love was accepted/confirmed in Harry's 17th year during the final battle. It protected Harry after his mother's spell went away in his 17th year.

As a parent , I sort of realize in my re-read of the series that being a parent sometimes requires the sacrifice of the romance that is there but sometimes put aside.  Ron & Hermione almost have an unspoken agreement about taking their relationship forward , due to the worry that - should it go sour or simply take too much of their time - it might affect their oath to protect Harry until Voldemort is defeated.

&#x200B;**Background:** T7S is known for having one of the worst, inconsistent timelines in all sitcoms. However, rewatching it, I realized that in the first half of the series, the timeline really isn't all that bad. There are 13 episodes in 1976, and mid-season one until near the end of season three is in 1977 (containing one Halloween episode and one Christmas episode).   
It's after it turns to 1978 that things get hairy, with the year lasting until season six, with several holiday episodes repeated, and birthdays not making sense. 1979 lasts until the final episode (season eight).

**Proof:** In the episode *Tornado Prom* (4x15), it centers around Eric and the gang going to the Snow Prom. Eric forgets to pick up Donna at the radio station, and ventures out to get her, without hearing that a "Code Red" tornado warning has been issued for the town. On his drive, the tornado is even shown behind the Vista Cruiser. A side story takes place in the basement with Kitty and Red. Nothing about this is important **EXCEPT** their last scene, where they find out the tornado warning has been lifted. If you listen, after the announcer mentions it's been lifted, you'll hear this:

*"And updating our top story, a local teen is in critical condition...."*

This theory thinks that teen is Eric. The tornado is shown going REALLY close to his car. None of his friends would suspect anything was wrong until the storm died down. Donna was at the radio station, assuming he didn't come because of the storm (she's surprised he turns up at all in the episode), and everyone else was at the prom, thinking he was safe with Donna. With the tornado warning in effect, if the Formans received a phone call from the police or hospital, it's possible they didn't hear it. The nearest phone is in the kitchen upstairs, and their lines could easily be down anyway. 

I think the announcement is the first the Formans have heard about the situation. Eric is in a coma from injuries sustained by the tornado, and the reason the timeline beyond that episode is so messed up is that it's Eric's mind filling in the blanks. His mind tries to resolve any unresolved conflicts, and possibly forms new ideas (like new couples or careers) by his friends and family talking to him. Maybe some of those things actually did happen, but just not in the same timeline (or same situations) that he imagined.

In the last season, his brain decides that it's time to test what his loved ones' lives would be like without him. He sees that everyone would eventually be okay and move on, and he finally lets go. Him returning in the last minutes of the last episode is most likely his mind's way of saying goodbye to his loved ones. The significance of finally leaving the 70's is Eric's mind finally being ready to let go.In 1966, Andrew Dufrense escaped from Shawshank prison.  After meticulously planning every detail of his escape for around twenty years, he stole the Warden Norton's shoes the night of his escape.  Why risk guards catching him stealing the warden's shoes which would almost certainly set off a chain of events foiling Andy's plans and destroying Andy's life forever?

When bloodhounds were turned loose on Andrew Dufrense following discovery of his escape, they were given his scent.  But Andy was wearing Warden Norton's shoes.  These shoes were carrying Norton's scent.  This confused bloodhounds and kept them off Andy's scent long enough for Andy to make it into town with Norton's ledger in a waterproof package (along with Norton's suit Andy had also smuggled out, or enough of it to allow Andy to purchase the rest without raising suspicion), and close out Norton's account in town.  The rest is history.That Odin or Bor may have been in pursuit of the Infinity Stones before Asgard became benevolent? The gauntlet in the asgardian vault was disregarded as fake by Hela, but that implies that there is a real one that she is aware of. It couldn’t have been Thanos because he had his gauntlet forged after Ragnarok because that’s when the dwarves were not protected. Also it is a right handed glove and Thanos uses a left handed one meaning that it was for a different weilder. Odin is right handed, Bor appears to be left handed so I’m more inclined to believe that Odin was after the gauntlet. We know Asgard had a War over the reality stone and some of their nine realms held Infinity Stones. Odin had the Space Stone presumably during is bad years. The Time Stone was in Midgard and Reality Stone is with Malekith and the Dark elves. That’s 3 within Odin’s domain. We are unsure about the locations of the Power and Mind Stones at this point in time. Hela could’ve been kept around by Odin the same way Thanos kept Gamora, because he knew of the sacrifice that needed to be made for the Soul Stone if Odin found its location. Not my strongest part of my theory, but Odin may have also been after the Fire and Frost giants because he thought The Casket of Ancient Winters and The Eternal Flame were Infinity Stones. 

Assuming that this theory is in fact true it would retrospectively make Malekith more interesting of a villain. Maybe he was protecting the Aether because he knew that Odin was after it and the other Infinity Stones. When Malekith returns post-benevolence, he isn’t aware that they changed and likely thinks they are still pursuing the same goals. His plan to have eternal night for the 9 realms may be him trying to hide the other Infinity Stones in these realms in case anyone else was trying to collect all the Stones. This makes Malekith far more interesting of a character. Any exposition about him from Odin is probably reimagined history to hide their darker past.

I’d love to hear everyone else’s thoughts on this theory. I know it isn’t perfect and I’m happy to hear criticism and other ideas

TLDR: Odin had 2 Infinity Stones, a model for an Infinity Gauntlet, domain over Midgard which had the Time Stone, and control over a forge capable of making ways to wield the Stones. He was also extremely power-hungry pre-benevolence and it makes sense character wise for him to pursue the Stones. We also know there was a gauntlet before Thanos’s because Hela disregards the one in the Asgardian Vault as fake implying she knows of a real one before Thanos made his

Edit: 
The Malekith and Hela parts of this theory are kind of weak. If anyone has better ideas of how they fit into the puzzle let me know. Also does anyone have thoughts as to how Odin used the Stones he had (he had reality and space at one point). Do you think it’s plausible he used them to create the Bifrost or the Odinforce?Consider this, Dude where's my car is about 2 bumbling idiots Chester and Jesse who don't remember a thing about the previous night. What if Jay and Kay that night attempted to defeat the super hot giant alien and failed then Chester and Jesse being the witnesses of this incident had there memories wiped by a Neuralyzer the super hot giant alien stole from the men in black. The nordic men are actually members of the men in black to fill in for Jay and Kay after they failed.
If any of you can find any more evidence please leave it in the comments down below.Now think about this, in Infinity War Thanos is more obsessed with his malthusian bullshit than the infinity stones. He considers it a tool for his objective for the entirety of the movie.

Gamora talks about how he was obsessed about culling half the population not about how he wanted the Stones. The way that dialogue is structured makes one think that the stones were a more recent development. He was probably just going planet to planet murdering half their people. He also must have been moving at a really slow pace like all the charities trying to solve world hunger. He also probably had the mind stone ,I'm thinking it was from Titan. He must have used it as an aid for his calculus culling spree.

He also must have believed that no single person can hold an infinity stones yet alone all six. That's why he kept it in a scepter.

Then one day the frozen blue Prince of Asgard crash lands on his ship. Loki notices the mind stone. He was probably trying to trick Thanos to get the scepter and jump back to Asgard to stab Thor again. He must pointed out that Thanos was doing nothing in the overall scheme of  universal population density. He must have argued that if Thanos helped Loki he could be King of Asgard and help Thanos in his universal hunger prevention initiative. Loki might have talked about how much resources and knowledge Asgard had and how it had a prototype glove in the basement that could hold not one but all your six infinity stones and grant you a power of a god.

Thanos being intrigued used his scepter to make Loki more irrational to control him and offer him more  information. He must have learned about Nidavellir and probably they're the ones who made the stone holding guantlet from Loki. Loki's a bit less subtle due to the scepter and promptly wants to squash his big brothers things i.e earth. He finds out about the tesseract tells Thanos about it and Loki talks about how if he was given the scepter and a small army  he can in a show of good faith cull half the population of earth and bring him another infinity stone if he help him with Asgard and simultaneously give him something to become a god with so he can stop people from ever being hungry by killing half the people in the entire fucking universe.

So in essence Tony Stark dying in Endgame is Loki's fault.

tldr; My theory states that Loki is the one who gave Thanos the idea and know-how for the snap by giving information about the model gauntlet in Asgard and how  something like that made by the dwarves of Nidavellir could help Thanos.First off, I haven’t seen the movie since I was a little kid, and I've just refreshed my memory through youtube clips and the wikipedia synopsis, so there’s probably a lot I’m forgetting, but here we go: 

It’s pretty common to joke that Belle has become a princess just in time to get her head lopped off, or to compare the mob that attacks the Beast’s castle to the mob that stormed the Bastille.

But I propose that the film actually takes place a fair bit later than the French Revolution—more specifically, BatB takes place in 1816 or 1817, in the immediate aftermath of the deposition of Napoleon and the [Bourbon Restoration.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_France). 

Firstly, this would explain why [no one in the village seemed to notice the disappearance of the local prince.](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/148706/how-come-the-beast-in-beauty-and-the-beast-was-unknown-to-the-villagers) Say the Enchantress laid down her curse on the prince c. 1791. After the Revolution had started but before the establishment of the Republic or the Terror, and before the nobles starting losing their heads. 

When the prince and his courtiers suddenly vanished, the townspeople probably assumed they had seen which way the wind was blowing, and lit out for Germany or England like so many other [émigrés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_emigration_(1789%E2%80%931815)).

Next, notice that—with the glaring exception of Gaston—there don’t seem to be any young men in this village. Watching the big ensemble scenes, [Belle’s introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW1t7w8YxHY), [Gaston’s song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVdgaSuAjII), and [the gathering of the mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh98Kscctw4), there are older ladies, younger women – most notably Gaston’s pretty young groupies—and children. But there is a conspicuous dearth of farmer lads. All of the male villagers are drawn heavily bearded, paunchy, or greying. Most of them appear to be at least in their thirties. 

Why is this?

Because from 1792 to 1815, excepting [one very brief period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amiens) at the beginning of Napoleon’s reign, France has been at constant war with the rest of Europe. For the last twenty-five years, Belle’s village has seen every generation of its young men taken away to die in Spain, Russia, Germany, and Italy. 

This explains why everyone’s so enamored of Gaston even though he’s kind of an asshole. It’s not just that he’s handsome and a good hunter—it’s that he’s really all the town has got left. All of the other young men are dead or missing. 

And this all helps lead into the next point—why are the villagers distrustful of Maurice and Belle? Is it really just because he’s a whacky inventor and she’s a free spirit? Or is there more to it?

Some background—much of the French peasantry was not all that enthusiastic about the French Revolution. The strongest support for the Revolution—particularly its more radical Jacobin phases—came from the urban poor and middle-class professionals. Most peasants were pretty conservative. They were devoted to the church and the king and resented the anticlerical and republican policies of the revolution. And once the revolutionaries killed the king and then instituted mass conscription, demanding peasants who had no love for the Republic in the first place give up their sons to fight in a republican war, that was the last straw. 

From 1793, [Huge swathes of the French countryside erupted into open revolt against the National Convention in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e). What resulted was an absolutely vicious royalist vs. revolutionary civil war where the massacre of civilians was commonplace. 

During this period, the National Convention sent commissars of sorts called [représentants en mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repr%C3%A9sentant_en_mission) out into the provinces. These were radical, committed Jacobins who went out to the territories where disloyal sentiment ran high and made sure the decrees of the Convention were carried out—they were empowered to close churches, enforce conscription, ferret out counterrevolutionaries, and not infrequently engage in mass murder of opponents, real or imagined. Naturally, they were widely loathed by the restive people they were sent to govern. 

Which brings us back around to Maurice.

We know Maurice and Belle aren’t from this little town. At the beginning of the opening song, Belle sings “since the morning that we came to this poor provincial town.” Maurice is, of course, an inventor. A tinkerer. A man of science. A man of the enlightenment, let us say. And since Belle bemoans that they came to a “poor provincial town” it’s probably pretty safe to assume that wherever they came from wasn’t another such poor little town. Rather, it was likely a large town, or even a city, maybe Paris itself. 

So, we have Maurice, man of science, who’s moved from the city to a backwards little peasant village where people seem to be pretty leery of him. Why? 

Well let’s say Maurice is around sixty, which seems right. If Beauty and the Beast takes place in 1816, then in 1793, at the height of the Revolution and the Reign of Terror he would have been in his thirties. A big city guy in his thirties fascinated by the Enlightenment spirit of science and invention would have been prime Jacobin material. 

I posit that when Maurice was a young-ish man, he lived in Paris, and he was a fervent supporter of the Jacobins. So much that he volunteered as a représentant en mission and was sent—bringing his wife and young daughter—to the rural province where BatB is set, in order to keep an eye on the royalist element there. 

For whatever reason, after the Revolution died down and the Terror ended, Maurice decided to settle down here. Maybe because his daughter had already grown up in the village and learned to call it home.

Presumably, he was pretty mild for a French revolutionary—he doesn’t seem like the type to conduct mass drownings or mow down prisoners with grapeshot. That’s why he hasn’t been run out of town or lynched. But nevertheless, this is why the townspeople are not well-disposed towards him. Not just because he’s a bit kooky, but because while he may be a harmless old man now, they still remember that he originally came to their town as an agent of the despised republic, to enforce its laws and draft their sons for its wars.  

Furthermore, this is at least in part why the villagers ridicule Belle for always having her nose “stuck in a book.” Her father being who he is, besides fairy stories, Belle is probably also reading Voltaire, Diderot, Montesquieu, etc. It's not JUST that Gaston is a chauvinist ass--though he is--but when he says that when a woman reads, she starts “getting ideas,” he means the kind of ideas that, as the townsfolk see it, end at the guillotine.  

(It is surely relevant that the invention of Maurice’s with the most prominent role in the plot is an automated chopping machine). 

To sum up so far, the little town is in deeply conservative royalist country, probably in the Vendée. Maurice originally came here twenty-odd years ago as a representative of the revolutionary government, earning him the enmity of the locals. Things have simmered down since then. Napoleon tempered the worst excesses of Jacobinism, and now even he is gone, and the monarchy is restored and the villagers probably feel the wicked revolution has been suppressed at last and they can relax a little. They can even tolerate the presence of a couple of Jacobins like Maurice and his daughter. But old political hatreds die hard. 

Then comes the Beast. When Gaston shows them the Beast in the magic mirror, the villagers are naturally terrified. But for them, the Beast is not just a monster. In their minds, he puts their town under threat the same way the Revolution did. 

And this is why they turn on Belle and Maurice so quickly—they’re already on thin ice for siding with the Revolution, and now here they go siding with some kind of monster out of Hell. 

The song they sing is instructive. Gaston begins by warning that “the Beast will make off with your children,” and a woman murmurs that he’s “said to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite.” 

So, the townsfolk respond the way they did the last time a beast ["as tall as a mountain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain) came to [sacrifice their children to his monstrous appetite.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_en_masse). 

Notice in the “Mob Song” sequence that despite being, in fact, an angry mob, they are quite well-disciplined and organized. They immediately set about chopping down trees to use as battering rams, and march in pretty good order to the Beast’s castle, while women wave their handkerchiefs from the window like they’re seeing them off to war.

That’s because the older men still remember participating in the royalist insurrection of the 1790s. They know what they’re doing and probably would have done pretty well if they’d gone to fight humans and not enchanted furniture. 

While they go off to storm the castle, they sing: “sally forth, tally ho…praise the Lord and here we go.” Surely an old song they sang while fighting with the [Catholic and Royal Army] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_and_Royal_Army) against the hated, godless republican troops back in the day. 

And yet, despite being pretty well-organized and fired up, they don’t have any firearms. They carry axes, cleavers, pitchforks, and Gaston goes after the beast with a bow and arrow. Why?

Well, the real reason is probably because Disney thought that firearms would be a bit too threatening.

But if you ask me, it’s because after the last time the region revolted against the Republic or against Napoleon, once the rebellion was put down by the government, all firearms were confiscated. That’s why they go on the attack with farm tools. (Gaston does briefly fire off a gun in his song, but it’s possible they managed to hold onto a fowling piece or two.) 

The biggest problem with this is that it doesn’t really work with the timeline we’re given for the Beast. The cursed rose was supposed to expire on his twenty-first year. If he was cursed c.1791 like I said at the start, then in 1816, the rose should have lost its last petal years ago. Lumiere says they’ve been rusting only “ten years.”

All I can suggest is that because it’s magic there’s some time-warping stuff going on, but that’s admittedly something of a copout.Superman doesn't wear a mask. And even when he is walking around as Clark Kent, he doesn't go to any extreme lengths to disguise himself. He puts on a pair of glasses, parts his hair differently, and adjusts his posture slightly... that's it.  Sure, it might have been easier back in the golden/silver age of comics, but nowadays? In an age of facial recognition, social media and everyone having a camera in their pocket, how does he stay hidden? 

The answer is simple. People don't go looking for his secret identity... because he doesn't hide it. Think about it. Characters like Batman, or the Flash, or Blue Beetle have masks. There is an element of mystery about them, and people cannot resist a mystery. The best way for Superman to get people off his back is to remove the mystery. They can't solve a mystery that's already solved.

Hiding in plain sight is often the best way to hide. And even if he wasn't wearing the glasses, he'd probably still be able to hide just fine. There's real world evidence to support this. In this [image](https://i.insider.com/56ec046652bcd025008b72c3?width=750&format=jpeg&auto=webp) and [article](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/henry-cavill-sat-in-times-square-wearing-a-superman-top-no-one-noticed/), Henry Cavill stands in front of a giant billboard of his face and goes completely unrecognized. Presumably actors and superheroes would have the same amount of fame in the DC universe. If Superman's actor can go unrecognized when standing next to a giant picture of his face, how would the average person in the DC universe recognize Superman while he's flying way up in the sky? Speaking of which, we also have to consider whether the average person is getting a good up close look at Superman, let alone Clark Kent. Superman might be famous, but Clark Kent is not (at least not at the same level).

But what about facial recognition software? We live in an age where companies like Facebook and Google can scan images and compare them to almost every other image on the entirety of the internet. Billionaires like Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne would most likely have access to computers that would have the sufficient capability of doing something similar. How does Superman get past these?

Again, the answer is somewhat simple. He puts on a pair of glasses, parts his hair differently, and adjusts his posture slightly... that's it. That might not sound like much, but it goes much further than you might realise. You can try this yourself. Take an image and simply reverse it, or even just crop it a bit, and Google's reverse image search tool will have a hard time analyzing it. Granted, facial recognition and reverse image searching are slightly different, but the principal is the same. It will have trouble comparing the faces if it has poor quality pictures to work with.

The [comics](https://comiclists.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/superman-superfacetwist.jpg?w=584) seem to support this idea.

In short, as long as Clark Kent keeps his glasses on whenever he steps in front of a camera, Superman will be fine.[If you look here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=jofNR_WkoCE#t=58), there is an old man reading a book to a young boy in the video.

---

"Grandpa! Grandpa! Read me a story!" The little boy said as Grandpa hobbled over to the chair.

"Okay, but just one!" Grandpa gave into the boy's request and grabbed the book his grandson wanted him to read. He cleared his throat and started reading....

"Here is a dog. What does the dog say? Woof!" He turned the page and read more. "Here is a mouse. What does the mouse say? Squeak!" He went through several animal before reaching the last page. "Here is a fox....what does a fox say?"

And **JUST** then, Grandpa's brain went haywire as he suffered a massive stroke (either from lack of medication or too much of it).

"RING-DING-DING-DING-ING-ING-ING!"

"Grandpa?"

"WA-PAPA-PAPA-PAPOW!"

"Grandpa, what's wrong?"

"HATEE-HATEE-HATEE-HO!" Grandpa twitched and squirmed, almost like he was trying to dance!

"You're scaring me...what does the fox say?!" The boy begged to know.

"FRAKA-KAKA-KAKA-KAKA-KAKOW!"

"What does the fox say?! What is it's sound! What the fox say?!" The boy shook the old man as he slowly slipped away. The boy had to watch helplessly for a full three minutes and forty-five seconds.  "WHAT THE FOX SAY!? WHAT THE FOX SAY?!"

"Abay-ba-da bum-bum bay-do...." And then it ended. Grandpa was gone.

---

The guy throwing the party in the music video is the boy grown up.

He never learned what sound a fox made because he associates foxes with his grandpa's death and thus never researched the sound. Note how sad he looks at the party.

The mention of a guardian angel in the song is another clue to this ancient mystery.

Behind the gate, right before you go up the stairs to the church safe house in Bill's town, there is a woodshed. Inside, there is nothing but a few bags of fertilizer and [this piece of rope hanging from the ceiling](https://i.imgur.com/0ewpUdG.jpg). I think Bill tried to kill himself. But since he's a heavy guy, the rope tore and he lived.

Why I think this theory is true:

* Bill was going, or had already gone, somewhat insane. He was all alone in that town after he parted ways with Frank, with nothing but Infected and other survivors that were trying to kill him, and had already started talking to himself. This way of living was clearly taking it's toll on him, so it makes sense that he would think about suicide.

* [He's wearing a scarf](https://i.imgur.com/qn6M9VZ.png), despite the fact that you meet him during the summer chapter, and the clothing that Joel and Ellie wear indicates that it isn't very cold. The scarf is supposed to hide Bill's scar from his suicide attempt.

* He wouldn't have killed himself **inside** the church, since he was clearly a religious person. Otherwise he wouldn't have picked a church as his safe house. So the shed would have been the next best safe location where you could hang a rope from the ceiling.

* The placement just seem to deliberate. Knowing Naughty Dog and their attention to detail, this can't just be a coincidence.So, a though that I've had for a long time is how little we see of pre-Mustafar, pre-suit Darth Vader.

Anakin's storyline in the prequels mainly builds up to the climactic moment where he becomes the ruthless villain Vader, however, ROTS falls a little short on displaying how terrible this transformation actually is.

From the moment he betrays the jedi and becomes a sort of an assassin/initiate for Palpatine, to the moment he is left maimed and wears the black suit for the first time, he only has a few minutes on screen. Now, I love how those sequences are managed and I love them as they are, but 16 years later we can say that the "sith baptism" scene is not very iconic by itself, and we're left only with a hooded Anakin instead a full-fledged Vader. Whenever these parts of the film are discussed, people never even refer to him as Darth Vader, even though he is.

So, I figured that the best way to show us a more visceral (and badass) transformation could have been a small change to the "You shall be known as Darth...Vader" scene:

Palpatine gives Vader his new Sith identity. Anakin complies and submits himself to his new master. The chancellor pulls a lightsaber from a hidden compartment in his desk, and offers it to Anakin. He says something along the lines of (cue creepy voice) "I had forseen the jedi would try to hold you back. This weapon has always belonged to youuuu. Now, take it...and your rightful place as a Lord of the Sith. Once more, the Sith will ruuule the galaxy, and we shall have...peace". Anakin would drop his old lightsaber, and the scene would end with him grabbing the new red one and Palpatine smirking.

Obi Wan would get the blue lightsaber from the office floor after the scene where he sees the security holograms with Yoda.

The younglings scene and the Mustafar duel would look much more intense with the red saber, and the story and film would remain basically the same. We'd get a better look of Vader "in his prime", and a better closure of gaps with the Original Trilogy.

What do you think?

Edit 1: I know how the story really goes down in Canon, this is just a fun take on the same situation, ignoring canon a bit.

Edit 2: Thank you so much for your feedback! I was told this is not a real theory. I apologize! I thought it was because of the "would have been" situation it proposes.Hey, everyone. So, I've been rewatching the MCU films and last night I was watching The Avengers and a thought came to my head. At the end of Loki's attack on the helicarrier, Coulson approaches Loki alone. Instead of simply shooting him with the gun that he was holding, he starts talking to Loki. Loki stabs him in the back and escapes. I think he wanted this to happen. As Tony says later on in the movie, Coulson should have waited for help. Why didn't he call someone? Also, when Coulson dies talking to Fury, he tells Fury that they (The Avengers) needed this. Fury understands this and bloodies Coulson's Captain America cards and show them to Tony and Steve. He tells Maria Hill that they needed the push. Before Coulson's death, they didn't work as a team, but Coulson knew that his death would be the push they needed. He made the sacrifice to help bring Earth's mightiest heroes together, and, honestly, that makes him an even better character.

What do you guys think?Forget die hard. A TV series about a baby that the empire wants to kill. Who has powers. Who will likely one day be someone significant. Who has caught the attention of Ancient Orders. A show which features animal herders and people dressed in desert attire. leads me to propose that "The Mandalorian" is a Christmas TV Show!

Also the showrunner did say he got inspiration for the characters off the star wars christmas special.Matt Groening famously based "The Simpsons" on his real family, naming them all after his parents and sisters while naming his character (Bart) after an anagram for "brat."

Through the series we see Bart underachieve without much care for anything but playing pranks on his family and the town of Springfield. We do, however, see his strong passion for comedy (Krusty the Clown being his hero, his love of Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" as a baby, his admiration for MAD Magazine) and animation (Successfully writing an Emmy winning episode of "Itchy and Scratchy" with Lisa, successfully creating an Academy-Award winning short based on his popular "Angry Dad" flash animation series). Bart fails to make friends at his school in Springfield until he discovers his love for making other kids laugh, which comes to the annoyance of his parents and principal but they have all yet to acknowledge just how creative and comically gifted Bart really is.

In every flash forward to the future, Bart is portrayed as something of a loser. A jobless, divorced, moocher who lives in poor conditions unless taken in by his parents or sister. I believe that this isn't the end for Bart. I believe that Bart Simpson, the half-EGOT winning writer and animator, is destined to mirror his real life counterpart and create the record shattering sitcom based on his adventures with his family.We know Biff is an “alpha”. We know he can recover from embarrassment pretty easily since none of Lorraine’s shutdowns nor his manure accident deterred him from continuing to be a popular douche. So why does one punch from George send him down a path of subservience where he timidly details cars at people’s homes?

My proposal is: It doesn’t. He didn’t become cowardly because of one punch. He purposefully changed his life so he could to stay close to the McFly’s and their connection to to a time traveler. 

In the first timeline he witnessed a guy invent the skateboard who was named Calvin Klein. As dumb as Biff is he had to have noticed the rise of the real Calvin Klein and the advent of skating as time progressed. Not only that, but I’m sure everyone told him about the exploits and musical performance of “Calvin” which would cause him to think twice when he heard Johnny B. Goode later. 

It was at this point that Biff became obsessed with the McFly family and decided to do anything he could to stay close to them. 

George and Lorraine were the only ones Biff knew that were definitely tied to “Calvin”/Marty so he ignored job offers and opportunities for years and continued to clean cars for income just to stay close to the McFly’s....and he’s probably ready to give up ....until bam! Marty is old enough for Biff to recognize as Calvin. 

At this point Biff knows he’s onto something. He even polished up Marty’s Jeep in the garage probably hoping to find his secret. 

Before Biff has a chance to get far from the McFly home in BTTF a Delorean picks up Marty and flies away. This confirms Biffs suspicions 

He spends the next 30 years following Marty. Hell, he even polishes his ungrateful grandsons car out front of a diner in 2015 because Marty’s kid is there. (Who also looks like Calvin) 

Then he finally sees the DeLorean . It all makes sense. He’s seen that car enough in the last 60 years to deduce that it’s a time machine. 

All of this was to explain why Biff not only stole the DeLorean but also knew to use it for time travel. 

If not for this theory Biff would’ve had to figure out a whole lot in 2015 and his entire life would’ve made no sense. 

If you like this, I’ve also got one about 2015 Marty being the wrong Marty.In the Terminator franchise, it's said that only living tissue can utilize the Time Displacement Field, because anything non-living will be ripped apart. This whole idea, while illogical as fuck, is what keeps Skynet from sending nukes and Hunter-Killers back and calling it "Easy Mode".

It's a plot contrivance, but a necessary one; and if you're willing to put on your Disbelief Suspension Goggles, it works just fine.

So, to the heart of the matter: Why, with that the rule the story has put in place, can something like the T-1000, a machine comprised entirely of "Liquid Metal" utilize the Time Displacement Field?

There are three possible reasons:

A: Because it doesn't matter if it gets ripped apart. The T1000 is a nanite-hivemind. Every cell of its form is an machine capable of functioning independently. So, it mostly like appeared in 1991, got vomited all over the pavement, and rebuilt itself before the officer arrived. Check out the scene [in which it arrived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HuPANafBQ4). Robert Patrick's glorious nudity isn't shown on screen for a full minute after his arrival.

Compare that to the scene where he employs some awesome [Floor hiding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovq9xOQNamk)
were it goes from basically 2 dimensional to full security guard in 30 seconds. And, this scene in which it goes from [shattered ice-bot back to glitchy muder-machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5ydeWWr4A) in roughly the same time.

* This would also account for the T3000

B: The T1000's naninte composition is complex enough to fool the Time Displacment filed into thinking that it is, in fact, made of flesh.

* This theory would also account of the TX

C: Every member of the resistance who subscribes to this theory about the Time Displacement Field is just plain wrong. I means seriously. They have no basis for this theory. The most likely reason they believe it, is because the first and only thing they saw go through it was the T800 back in T1. The Resistance didn't know about the T1000 or the TX. And as for the T3000, it was likely that the Nanites that were injected into John didn't complete their transformation until after he'd been sent back.

----

Okay so if the flesh-theory is false, why wouldn't Syknet just send nukes or tanks back and just Scorch LA into oblivion? Because it doesn't want to. Without going into the whole "perpetual time-loop" shenanigans, it only want to kill members of the Resistance, not everyone. Skynet knows that any non-resistance member could have even a small hand in it's creation. it doesn't have records on everyone who worked for Cyberdine, or every defense contractor, or programmer, or electronic engineer.

The only person Skynet knows about, with regards to its birth, is Miles Dyson. Who, if you notice throughout T2, Skynet leaves the fuck alone.The Truth About the Joker in The Dark Knight 

https://imgur.com/gallery/MJgj6GI

I’m posting this because I have broken the Nolan Code of all the Nolan Movies and Shows (Westworld), and am aware that both Nolans are Messiahs for the Black World of Technology.
In a standard deck, there are two Jokers—and Heath Ledger played the role of 2 Jokers in The Dark Knight. That’s right: the Joker has a twin brother.

Only Christopher Nolan, Johnathan Nolan, and Heath Ledger were in on the secret. It was all to be revealed in The Dark Knight Returns, but due to Heath's passing, the world never learned the truth.

Here’s how it works:
Both Jokers are ex-Special Forces.
One Joker specializes in Explosives Ordinance Disposal—we’ll call him “EOD Joker.” The other is MI (Military Intelligence), so we’ll call him “MI Joker.” Both are very proficient special forces operatives.

EVIDENCE:
The Bank Heist
In the first scene of Dark Knight, during the bank heist, the henchman asks, “Why do they call him ‘the Joker’?” and complains that "He thinks he can sit this one out."
Who supplied the weapons, grenades, and ammunition?
It was MI Joker, while the bank heist was carried out by EOD Joker. MI joker provided the transportation afterward.

The Origin of the Scars
MI Joker says his father was a drinker before executing Gamble, while at Harvey Dent's fundraiser at Bruce Wayne Penthouse, EOD Joker tells Rachel his scars come from his wife getting in too deep with loan sharks.

Other evidence:
While MI Joker tortured Brian (the Batman copycat), EOD Batman was setting explosives and mixing ammonium nitrate.
While MI Joker carried out the attack in which Harvey was acting as bait, he was eventually captured and kept in Gordon’s Cage, While EOD Joker was wiring up Rachel and Harvey Dent.
It was not Maroni's men that wired up the 2 locations, it was EOD Joker who rigged the henchman, and the 2 locations. As an "inside joke" for his brother MI Joker, EOD Joker switched up the locations in which Harvey and Rachel were being held.

While at the docks, MI Joker burns his half of the 12.6 billion dollars ripped off from the mob. They never reveal what happened to the other half of the mob’s money (this is a major plot hole).

While EOD Joker is at Gotham General Hospital rigging up the explosives that will bring it down in one hour, MI Joker interrogates Harvey and sets him free.

At the tower, MI Joker switches place with EOD Joker and takes charge of the hostages. EOD Joker then finishes wiring up the Liberty and Spirit ferries.

The detonators on each ferry at the end were linked to the bombs on the SAME ferry, not the other ferry. (Both brothers are huge into game theory.)
Conclusion

During the “battle for Gotham’s soul,” when Batman saves MI Joker, MI Joker talks about his "ace in the hole." Many think it's Harvey Dent, whom his brother freed from Gotham General Hospital.
In reality, it’s EOD Joker, who has left Gotham with the remaining fortune of the mob. He’ll use this to create more havoc around the world, leading into The Dark Knight Returns.

MI Joker sits in Blackgate Penitentiary waiting for his brother, the true "ace in the hole," to break him out.
This is what was truly meant to happen.The most popular theory I’ve seen about Bran is that he is somehow the Night King. I think this is a fun theory, but unlikely. As far as we know, Bran wants to stop the Night King and can see everything that has ever happened. The theory usually says he goes into the past maybe to stop the Night King at the source, wargs into a person there, gets trapped, and eventually gets turned into the Night King. Bran would know this would happen though so why would he even try? Maybe there’s a simpler solution.

Based on a few storytelling devices it is almost certain that Bran will go to the past and become trapped there. They have brought up that it’s possible to get trapped in the past, but this has had no pay off yet. They have shown that he has the ability not just to travel into the past, but interact with it. Ned hears his voice from the past and he was able to warg into Hodor to change his mind so he would eventually save them. Even though he can affect the past though, he can’t change it. The past has already happened. Ned had always heard Bran’s voice and Hodor was always Hodor. Bran knows he can’t stop the Night King in the past because the Night King is still around in the present. 

He can, however, make sure he has the necessary training abilities to stop the Night King in the present. Something he knows has already happened that needs to be done. Bran travels into the past as himself, the three eyed raven, and remains as the three eyed raven. He attaches himself to a weir wood tree and waits for thousands of years. He possibly helps the children of the forest, the odd wildling tribe, and maybe even some of the first men who build the wall. Eventually, his young self stumbles into his cave and he can begin training him. 

Some further evidence is that we never get a name from the three eyed raven. It’s left a mystery. Another is what the three eyed raven shows him, his childhood at Winterfell and his family. It could be young Bran choosing where he goes, but Bran always seems a little confused of where they end up. This suggests that the old three eyed raven has an interest in the Starks and Winterfell. He even looks at Hodor in the past with a small smile. And finally the line “You died in that cave.” When it’s said, it’s of course referring to the fact that he has lost his personality and isn’t the same but what if it’s actually foreshadowing the reveal. Bran really did die in that cave. When the Night King slices the three eyed raven, we are witnessing Bran’s final fate. 

One last thing, (minor season 8E1 spoiler)
It could be argued that Bran waiting for multiple days in the Winterfell courtyard just to wait for Jaime to arrive is also foreshadowing of the eventual 1000 years of waiting Bran will have to do before his young self arrives.Originally posted this to r/shittyfantheories but they told me that this might qualify as actual r/fantheories material.

Now, this theory sounds stupid at first, but there's a lot of evidence that humans are in fact Pokemon. For example, in a library in the Sinnoh region, it's said that humans and Pokemon were once the same. Actual evolution still exists in the Pokeverse, as mentioned in several pokedex entries, so this might refer to the fact that humans and Pokemon such as Machoke and Jynx share a common ancestor. Also, literally every animal and most of the plants in this universe are Pokemon, including various gods, and scientifically speaking, humans are animals. 

There are also several instances of humans turning into Pokemon, mainly various ghost-types. It's even said that a boy with psychic powers once woke up as a Kadabra. There are psychic type trainers with these abilities, but where did they even get them?

Note the fact that there is even a human-like egg group for Pokemon that are humanoid in appearance. Obviously, humans are humanoid, and if they're Pokemon, then they'd lay eggs and belong to this group. It's easy to assume that a human would be normal type, but perhaps if they had genes from other Pokemon, they'd be able to use psychic moves. While Pokemon eggs are always the mother's species, they do inherit traits from both parents, so therefore someone with an Alakazam father and human mother, or just a psychic type ancestor, could telekinetically move pokeballs with their mind. 

Basically what I'm saying is that we've never SEEN a human give birth and/or lay an egg in Pokemon, therefore we can't conclusively say they don't lay eggs. 

TLDR; humans are Pokemon and therefore must lay eggs, if Mr. Mime fucked a human woman you'd get a psychic-type trainerSince I haven't seen much music related post personally, I decided to post this little theory that has been in my head for a couple of weeks. Now let me explain why Black Hole Sun is a prequel and why Mr.BlueSky is the sequel. 

I know both of these songs might have different meaning behind them but, just by listening to Black Hole Sun first and the Mr.BlueSky you can see some differences and similarities. Black Hole Sun is more dark while Mr.BlueSky is all cheery and some what happy. In Black Hole Sun there is this lyric  "Black hole sun. Won't you come. And wash the rain way". Now that a look at this Mr.BlueSky there "it's stop rainin' everybody's in the play and don't you know it's a beautiful new day, hey hey". Now who could of stop the rain? It Was Black Hole Sun or Mr.BlueSky.

Now to conclude this theory. In Black Hole Sun is was like some was reaching out to help but, in Mr.BlueSky they finally got the help they need but, they ask "Mr.BlueSky please tell us why. You had to hid away for so long (so long). Where did we go wrong." Of course implying that Black Hole Sun/Mr.BlueSky took awhile.

I know this theory like alot of theories is probably not true but, I just had to show this off and I was bored.Except maybe Gob.

I know the joke is supposed to show the disconnect between the Blueth's and middle class, but I choose to believe that they actually developed their coos/chants/dances to irritate Michael is the same way they patronize and tease each other (and Lucille  2, Egg, etc.), and they have more fun with it knowing that Michael isn't in on the joke, or in control of the situation. It obviously upsets him, and often it causes the argument he's having with them to redirect it's focus to the dance. Shortly after, he doing pretty much exactly what they wanted him to do to prove them wrong, but the dance puts him over the edge, and suckers him in.Okay so Jimmy Neutron is the smartest person on Earth in his universe. Able to invent complex alternative energy sources, use time travel and inter-dimensional travel, and create inventions which would each be worth millions if not billions of dollars and create revolutions in their various fields. So, why don't they? Why is Jimmy Neutron so smart? Why is his cerebral deformity seen as normal? And why is there a top secret military base (Area 86) nearby? Why do all the things Jimmy and his friends discover just become discarded in the next episode? I'll tell you. Jimmy's inventions are used in one scenario and rarely are seen again because their being taken and developed by the United States government. The entire town of Retroville is a large-scale experiment in genetic engineering. The entire town and everyone in it besides Jimmy, Sheen, Carl, Cindy, and Libby, is ersatz and made up of government-employed actors. That's why everyone seems to be so excusing or oblivious to the group's hijinks, they're not. Each kid has been genetically engineered with a certain superpower and then implanted with a fake family to cultivate it. Why? Because the city is a testing ground. Cindy has increased strength and reflexes, Libby has enhanced vocal cords, Carl while relatively unintelligent can mimic anyone, and Jimmy has the super brain. What about Sheen? When exposed to one of Jimmy's inventions, Sheen is shown to have the intelligent capacity beyond anyone else in the group, in fact his brain is shown to be quite larger than Carl's. It's just that he's ruined his brain with sugar, causing his various neuroses and developmental issues. Retroville and all the children's adventures are secretly staged development grounds for Jimmy's inventions. Even when they're discovering something new like the pirate wreck or the Egyptian tomb in season one, they've been guided and manipulated to that goal. The whole show is a documentation of Jimmy and his friends unknowingly testing gadgets and abilities that will be obtained and used by the united states government, thus the presence of Area 86. This goes with the common saying "history is written by the victors" and also how the Starks are portrayed in the show.

First, the Starks are always shown to be morally right. For example, Ned Stark is shown to try and raise his children while also trying to govern the realm. When he learns of King Robert sending assassins to kill Danaerys and her unborn child, he's vehemently opposed,  despite their explanations that if she births a som it will lead to a new war. Next is Robb's army; when one if his generals is executed, the reason give is that he killed two kids. Not any tactical or political reason, but a moral one. I could go on about all the Starks, but I think the point has been made. Jon Snow at one point even gets betrayed and killed essentially for doing the right thing.

Second is how their allies are portrayed. These, in a historical record, would most likely be more true to what the case was. Danaerys is shown to be good, but she has a temper and is unwilling to compromise. Tyrion is a good guy, but has occasional lapses in judgement. Consider the scene where Jon counsels Danaerys after they lose High Garden: Dany is shown to eschew her loyal, high ranking follower's advice but immediately asks what the Stark (who gives the best advice) thinks.

Lastly, look at the Stark's enemies look, especially those who harm them directly. Walder Frey is a cowardly, cantankerous, and obscene old man who takes little girls for wives and can't remember their names. Cersei is shown to essentially be an alcoholic sociopath who has sex with her own brother. Similar to Tyrion's plans, her backfire as well, albeit much more frequently. Ramsay Bolton and Joffrey are shown to just he total psychos. Between Joffrey mentally abusing Sansa and Ramsay raping her, it kinda makes sense why they would be portrayed on such a way.

The Starks are the ostensible good guys in the whole show, make few lapses in judgement, and their enemies are utter scum. If this is their record and their accounts, then of course that's how all this would appear. I originally came up with this when Steven Spielberg casually mentioned that ET is over 300 years old. Many people assume ET is the equivalent of a domesticated pet or a child. This is disproved by Spielberg's statement. No species can stay in the juvenile stage that long, but if ET is not a scared wandering  child, than what is he?  He's a confused old man.
   The wrinkles, baldness, pot-belly, and awkward waddle, all of which might very well be completely normal for his species, are not the only evidence of this. ET demonstrates great power and intelligence, but seems to lack control or finesse in its use. He accidentally psychically bonds with a human child. This may be his species equivalent of Alzheimer. 
       ET's intelligence is another matter to consider. He obtains a very primitive grasp of English in only a few days. He builds an interstellar transmitter out of household appliances. This is not the actions of an idiot. In addition, his team seem to be scientists of some sort. It's possibly he may be their equivalent of a horticulturist. Despite this, he's startled by flashing lights, loud noises, and flashlights, and has trouble comprehending the concepts of "stay hidden" and "its fake". This is further evidence of the senility theory. Anyone who's had a loved one who's losing their mind from old age can tell you they can still be remarkably sharp in some ways, while being frustratingly idiotic in others. 
      So why would a Horticultural scouting team from an advanced civilization, which is what the landing party seems to be, bring alone a senile old fool? There are several possibilities. ET's species may lack humanity's intolerance for the mentally challenged and view caring for them as simply part of being a member of civilized society. He could be the equivalent of a tenured professor and impossible to fire. It could be that he's been hiding his condition as best he can out of a desire to continue working in a field he loves. It could be one of the crewmembers is a relative and they brought him along out of love. The possibilities are endless.In the Prequels and the Clone Wars TV show, R2's relationship seems unique among Jedi and droids. Most droids have little personality, and follow the commands of their Jedi without question, even if it kills them. The Jedi mostly also seem to view them as little more than tools; most show no real emotion their droid is destroyed. R2 however is independent and passionate, frequently beeping out what are probably some very vulgar insults, and taking action on his own. Mace Windu even notes this, and suggests that Anakin have R2's memory wiped, or get a new droid. Anakin however flat out refuses. When R2 was captured by the enemy, Anakin refused to leave him for dead, and risked his own life to save him. He also gives R2 an unprecedented amount of freedom, outfits him with weapons and tech, and treats him as an equal and a friend. Why?

**Anakin gives R2 freedom because he knows what it feels like to be a slave**

Right from the start of ANH, Lucas made the Droid/Slave metaphor pretty clear. R2 and C3PO get captured, then sold, they have restraining bolts put on them to stop their escape, and they're denied entrance to a restaurant because "we don't allow their kind in here". RotJ shows Luke giving two droids as a gift, which is treated as a normal thing, and they're shown the droid torture dungeon, where misbehaving droids (RIP Gonk) are punished. Solo continues it with L3's crusade for droid liberation, and shows how much of the galaxy uses droids for forced labor, using restraining bolts to override their free will.

Anakin grew up on Tatooine as a slave. He had a chip implanted in his head that would detonate if he tried to escape, controlling him just as much as a restraining bolt. In addition, he was treated as subhuman property. From the Prequels and TCW, we can see how much that experience messed Anakin up. Upon learning that Zygerians were slavers, he's filled with rage and nearly butchered a group of prisoners. He's then barely able to control himself while undercover there, and doesn't even try to hide his disgust for slavers.

So to Anakin, forcing another sentient being to serve him would be morally reprehensible, even if they were a droid. That's why he lets R2 act how he wants, and why he values R2's life and would save him. Also, it's likely why R2 has weapons and tools available to him that no other droid has: Anakin wanted to make sure R2 would be able to protect himself from anyone trying to force him to do anything.So, as I was rereading Goblet of Fire, I had a though: How the hell did Barty Crouch manage to pass as Moody for a full year? Physically, he had polyjuice potion, that's logical. But Moody was one of Dumbledore's oldest friends (and it's implied Hagrid's as well). Crouch also had to repeatedly deal with ministry officials, many of whom had worked with Moody. Yes, he had access to Moody, so he could use Imperio to get information out of him. But imagine the level of *detail* required. From the timeline in the books, Crouch had less than 12 hours after replacing Moody to interrogate him. In that time, he had to figure out how Moody walked, talked, and behaved.

The one thing we know about Moody was that he was *incredibly* paranoid... and that paranoia often paid off. Upon meeting Harry for the first time (for real), Moody immediately performs a check to see if Harry has been replaced or controlled, by asking him a question only he'd know. It seems fair to assume that he has some kind of code word or security question for his close friends, including Dumbledore. Also, given his extreme paranoia, Moody may even have created a fake code word, to be told to his kidnappers, then informed his friends that if he'd been replaced, he'd have his kidnapper say that word. Given the Imperius curse, Crouch could have forced it out of him. But, as we learn from Harry, people can resist the curse, or at least, maliciously comply, giving only partial information. One of the top Aurors in history seems like he'd have plenty of practice doing just that.

When he arrived at Hogwarts, Crouch already had a large supply of polyjuice potion on hand. That means that Wormtail must have had access to potion materials, as well as knowledge and time to brew a complex potion. From that, we can make the logical assumption that Pettigrew also made some Felix Felicis. By having Crouch take a few drops of that at key points, he could easily manage to get lucky: saying just the right things, acting just the right way. We only see him interact with Dumbledore a few times, so he wouldn't need much of it. He also likely used it to make sure his plan went off well. After all, Crouch's entire plan hinged on a large number of tiny details going right: He had to be capable of tricking the Goblet of Fire (which was an extraordinarily difficult magical feat), then have Harry be allowed to compete (instead of, y'know, just having him show up at every event and choose to forfeit), then have Harry succeed in his tasks, have Neville and Dobby help Harry, have Harry be the first to the cup, etc. Using Felix Felicis would allow him to shift the odds on those events, augmenting his planning even more.During the press conference scene, Tony calls on a reporter he names as "Ben". Retroactively, Spiderman 3 could explain that Ben Parker was a journalist with the Daily Bugle. 

Peter working at a newspaper hasn't been established yet, so if they go that route in SM3 they could use Ben's previous employment at the Bugle as Peter's drive for getting a job there.

Just a fun little theory!At the Art Show during Business School, Pam starts to walk up behind Oscar and Gil and is about to greet them before she hears Gil insult her art. We're sort of led the narrative that both Gil and Oscar were critical of her work, but were they?  
Gil is the one doing most of the talking and actually it was Oscar who said back to Gil, "It's her first time..." defensively.  
Oscar seems to be rather skeptical of Gil's assertions and his statement that Pam's strong points aren't courage and honesty seems more of an observation on her character and not an insult of her art.  
In fact, Gil doesn't even know Pam, so Oscar clearly went to show support. He could've picked any event for Gil's "needed culture".  
  
Later on in Season 3 we find out that Oscar has been wanting to get out of his relationship with Gil and even said "Maybe I'll try women".  
  
Before that though, he was so happy with Gil that he went with him on his "don't sue us" settlement trip to Europe.  
  
**Michael's Salary**  
  
I didn't want to make two threads for this so since they're in the same area of the show, I'll just address them in one post.  
In The Negotiation, Michael tries to dismiss Darryl's request for a raise by showing him his check.  
Darryl laughs at him and says that's barely more than he makes and Michael goes to corporate to negotiate a raise.  
The thing is, that's not what Michael earns.  
Michael is a regional manager and regional managers in sales fields *still* earn commission and bonuses. Those payments are separated from standard salary for tax purposes (your salary makes contributions to your 401k and is taxed much lower than bonuses). It's been proven that Michael is not only one of the company's greatest salesmen in history, but he still maintains clients and large sales (As shown with the Lackawanna County and Pretzel Day sales). It wouldn't make sense that he makes those sales and does NOT make commission, or else why would he do them?  
  
In the end, the reason they gave Michael a raise at corporate wasn't because Darryl makes more than Michael's base pay (which makes sense, he's a warehouse foreman and doesn't earn commission at the time), but because Michael had absorbed more "management" responsibility by merging the branches, so his base pay should go up reflecting the added management responsibility of his larger region.  
  
It was probably the same type of raise they were going to give Josh when they were originally going to merge the branches, but Michael never asked for it because he was only thrilled that he didn't have to fire his employees.  
  
They didn't attempt to explain to him that he earned far more from his sales commission and bonus because they had already attempted to explain this to him before and had given up.   So I was re-watching Disney's 1999 Tarzan film today and saw a discrepancy I didn't notice when I was a kid. Sabor (The leopard that kills Tarzan's parents at the beginning of the film) manages to hunt, fight, and defeat adult gorillas and humans armed with shotguns and other technology, but Tarzan, our hero, manages to kill him with the broken end of a homemade flint-napped spear later on in the movie.  


There's no doubt that Tarzan is incredibly athletic, strong, and agile, but he isn't superhuman, at least not enough to be stronger than Kerchak, a fully grown silverback gorilla, or more dangerous than his biological father was with a fucking shotgun. How in the absolute hell did he go up against Sabor with a sharp rock and win, physical abilities be damned?  


Well, I did some research, and then it hit me:

&#x200B;

The film takes place over the course of 20 years, from when Tarzan is a baby to when Tarzan is, well, a 20 year old man. Sabor is around at the beginning, and still around (and dangerous) by the time Tarzan is fully grown.  


Leopards only live between 12 to 17 years on average, and males reach sexual maturity between two-and-a-half and four years old. Let's say that Sabor is some sort of mutant leopard super chad, and reached maturity around two, which was when he killed Tarzan's parents. This would make him 22 years old by the time Tarzan has grown up to the age of 20 years old in the film. That is fucking ancient for a leopard, let alone a leopard that has to hunt and support itself in the wild. To be honest, the fact that Sabor is still around and kicking in the African jungle at all, let along able to defeat Kerchak and go a few rounds with Tarzan directly afterwards after 20 years and keep him on the back foot the entire time is astonishing.  


It is amazing that Tarzan was able to kill a leopard, but just as amazing that that particular leopard was able to put up a fight AT ALL.  


tl;dr: Leopards only live like 17 years max, by the time Tarzan fought Sabor, they were both around 20 years old, Sabor probably even older. Tarzan still beat a fucking Leopard in basically hand to hand combat, which is impressive, but it was a decrepit, super old one, which is probably the only reason he survived at all.A. They both have blue eyes, but lots of people have blue eyes, so that isn't a very good piece. But they both have bright blue eyes, and unless i missed one,  I don't think anyone else had blue eyes.

B. You know how people remark about how expensive eggs are? Well gaston said that he ate 4/5 dozen (thanks beehivesandglass) a day, but since he is a prince eggs are nothing too much to buy 4/5 dozen of a day.

C. His looks. This is the explanation about why they look different: (**I'M CHANGING THIS ENTIRE SECTION WITH MORE COMPELLING EVIDENCE**) Now we know that there is some sort of magic going on in this world (the witch turned the prince into a freaking beast), so it wouldn't be too far fetched to say that gaston asked a witch to make him look more handsome.

D. When gaston dies, I think a part of the beast dies. A part of himself that he never wanted to see again. He then turns back into the prince. **WHAT IF THERE WAS A PART OF THE SPELL THAT WASN'T MENTIONED, A PART OF IT THAT HE HAD TO OVERCOME HIS SELFISHNESS TO TURN BACK INTO A PRINCE**

This all kind of came to me suddenly as I was watching this, so feel free to criticize it. If there is any additional info, please chip in because I think there is potential behind this one.Resubmitted with proper title.


There is a common theory that Stark goes back in time and collects the Infinity Stones, but I think it is more subtle. I think they've been building their own set of "weapons" with the same capabilities in their own way, and that we've seen it color coordinated throughout, with each series developing one.

* Blackpanther, Heart Shaped Plant, purple and grants increased strength -> Power Stone
* Thor, Stormbreaker, blue lightning and now has Bifrost abilities -> Space Stone
* Ant-Man, Pym's Time Machine (theory), Quantum Realm was green when visualized -> Time Stone
* Iron-Man, Vision, Jarvis' brain was yellow when visualized -> Mind Stone
* Captain America + Hydra, gave Wanda her powers, her power "reality warping" is red when visualized -> Reality Stone
* Dr Strange, channeled mystical energy, spells are visualized as orange -> Soul Stone

The Guardians series didn't generate one, but Gamora's life was obviously important. One specific thing that brought this to mind was re-watching Ultron and being reminded of how Wanda could hijack people's minds just like the Reality stone and the obvious red coloring. Hulk might tie in a bit with the time machine's development, double up on the green factor...When Thor and Banner steal the Grandmaster's orgy yacht, Thor tells Banner to pilot it. Banner insists that he can't, as none of his PhDs are in piloting alien space ships. However, Banner somehow does a decent job. How could an Earthman with zero experience manage to pilot a completely unfamiliar alien craft?

Simple: it's an *orgy yacht.*

It's designed to be flown while blind drunk, stoned beyond all reason, and coated in any number of fluids. As such, it has an exceedingly simple control scheme, and in all likelihood, a very accommodating AI built into the controls which takes any given sloppy input, says "Yeah, you probably meant to go that way," and adjusts accordingly. Banner didn't so much pilot the ship as he gave it some general cues, and it helpfully filled in the gaps. If at any point during his fumblings he slapped the "Self Destruct" or "Dump All Fuel" buttons, the pilot AI ignored it, as those inputs wouldn't make sense during an orgy cruise. Fireworks and birthday music? That's probably what you really wanted.

TLDR: The Grandmaster's orgy yacht was easy to pilot because it was built to be driven while intoxicated.I mean at this point, I highly doubt any theory is truly new, but it sort of combines two prominent theories: that 1) Cobb's reality is a dream (so he's still dreaming at the end of the movie), and that 2) Cobb is the one who Inception is being performed on. Two links below explain these two theories:

[https://whatculture.com/film/film-theory-cobb-is-the-real-dream-target-in-inception](https://whatculture.com/film/film-theory-cobb-is-the-real-dream-target-in-inception)

[https://arcdigital.media/the-ultimate-is-inception-a-dream-theory-11152a73a226](https://arcdigital.media/the-ultimate-is-inception-a-dream-theory-11152a73a226)

Then, it adds a third clue that hit me after I rewatched the movie for a second time, as I realized it is a MAJOR plothole, something too big to be a slip-up by Nolan. I Googled it and discovered that it's definitely been discussed before, but I don't think people put enough emphasis on it. I've seen people acknowledge it and then kind of dismiss it as reading too far into the movie or something. This clue is that the **top totem is a paradox and doesn't work properly.** I explain more below. Here's a quick outline of the theory, maybe some others can help me flesh it out or disprove it, but I wanted to get my ideas down before I forgot them or confused myself more lol.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-Cobb is the one stuck in a dream; when Mal killed herself, she actually woke up in reality.

\-Cobb is essentially stuck in a coma-state in the real world, where Mal and others are continuously entering his dream and trying to figure out how to convince Cobb he's still dreaming and wake him back to reality. The reason Mal can't just enter back into his first-level dream and tell Cobb he's still dreaming is because he's in denial, and he has to convince himself that he's still dreaming **on his own,** essentially the whole point of the movie. They need to perform Inception on him to convince him he's still dreaming, they can't just tell him outright for it to work.

\-Cobb is the one who got lost in his dream. He purposely "forgot" his actual totem, and made up the intricate backstory about taking Mal's totem (the top), so he can fool himself into believing his dream (first-level) is a reality. **The biggest support for this is because the top totem and it's quirk is a plothole - a totem should be unique in real-life, so when it behaves normally in a dream, the dreamer will know it's a dream. The idea is that if someone else is trying to convince you a dream is reality, they won't know what is unique about your totem (or what it even is), so they would naturally make objects, including your unknown totem, act normally in a dream. A top would normally fall down eventually, so if a spinning top was actually going to be a totem, it should spin perpetually in real life (or at least an abnormally long amount of time), so when it topples after a normal amount of time in a dream, the dreamer will know they're dreaming. As it is, the top is pointless as a totem, since if it topples, Cobb will think he is in reality. In reality, the top would fall, but in a dream, another architect would also make the top fall, so Cobb will always be convinced he is in reality. The top works antithetical as it should, which suggests that Cobb's reality is actually a dream, and he created the top totem as part of his fantasy because he subconciously wants to believe his dream is reality.**

\-Adriadne and Saito were hired/involved for two reasons:

1. **To perform Inception on Cobb:** The group performs Inception on Cobb in (potentially) two ways. The first idea they need to 'incept' is the idea of Inception itself. Almost too meta. Cobb ultimately believes he's the one that discovered the possibility of Inception, but the idea is planted when people around him begin asking if it's even possible. The second idea to be 'incepted' is the whole "do you want to become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?" question. It's said 3 times in the movie - the first time Saito says it to Cobb, the second time Cobb finishes the sentence after Saito starts it, and the last time when Cobb is "rescuing" Saito from Limbo, you can see Cobb have an epiphany when he says it himself, showing that the Inception has worked, as the idea has manifested in his own subconscious. This idea helps Cobb overcome his (fake) guilt for "killing" his wife. If he can't overcome this guilt he will never be able to wake up from his fantasy.
2. **To extract information from Cobb's mind:** they need to figure out how his fake totem works. If the whole backstory about how he took Mal's totem etc. is part of his intricate fantasy, no one, including real-life Mal, would know the mechanics. Once they know how the totem works they might be able to convince Cobb that he's still dreaming.

\-Adriadne gets Cobb to reveal his totem and its quirk, this is the extraction succeeding.

\-The end of the movie when Cobb spins the top, is the first time he spins the top in his first-level dream state (what Cobb is convinced is reality), AFTER Adriadne finds out what his totem is and how it works. If Cobb had kept looking at his top, he would have seen that it keeps spinning because Adriadne could have incorporated it into the dream architecture. However, after moving on from the guilt of Mal's 'death', he no longer cares, and just wants to spend time with his kids. He already grew old and lived a life with Mal, now he wants to live a life with his kids. He may have his doubts if this is reality or not, but he would rather not know, since he believes it's not worth the risk if he's wrong (because if he's convinced he's dreaming and it's reality, he will die if he kills himself.) However, if he accepts his current state as reality, "it doesn't matter, because \[we'll\] be together", meaning Cobb and his kids. Alternatively, maybe he just couldn't wait to go say hi to his kids, comes back a couple minutes later to see the top is still spinning, realizes he was dreaming all along, and kills himself to go back to reality.... kidding. Kind of.

(edit 1: rephrased a couple sentences and fixed grammar mistakes)

(edit 2: fixed a couple more grammar/spelling mistakes and elaborated on a couple points)Monsterication is establish as a state where people become what they’re obsessed with, and my theory is that the more successful you monsterise, the less ridiculous you look, hence Saitama breaking his limiter is just a more successful case of monsterication. 

The power system in One Punch Man is very simple: You pursuit your desires and they come true. This simple mechanic hence have many varieties: Crab man loves eating crabs, so he became a crab. >!Amai Mask wants to be handsome, so he became as handsome as he is now.!< Saitama in this case also wants to be stronger, but he’s focused on surpassing his limits than becoming strong enough, so he achieves unlimited power. >! Garou is very similar in this sense, he wants to be a monster so he became one, and he started breaking his limiter in his fight against Saitama to beat the ultimate hero, but his desire is not pure enough so he gradually declines.!< If the idea of monsterication is put in this way, then we can basically explains the origin of everyone’s power in the One Punch Man universe and scale who is more powerful by their appearances. Bang devoted his entire life in martial arts, so he appears to be a pretty normal geezer with insane skills, as opposed to someone like Sourface who is also a martial artist but look way more stereotypically anime. Saitama while strong have a relatively normal body build, so he’s stronger than Darkshine who became cartoonishly buff. 

To summarise, everyone who’s shown certain degree of obsession is monsterised, and those who are more pure and devoted to their goals control their powers better instead of being controlled by them (like altering their body shape and appearance to suit their power). As such, we can conclude that Saitama is the ultimate normie because he kept his ideals.You have to figure that through the beginning of phase one, it was more akin to isolated outbreaks of violence up until the arrival of Loki in the avengers.  And that is probably when life starts to go downhill.  This is the beginning of cities being destroyed for no apparent reason other than a doucher shows up and the avengers kick his ass all over town.  But how terrified are these people? All of the sudden, the skies open up and bam aliens show up.  So here we have an instant proof of life outside of earth.  And amazingly enough all 8 billion earth residents simultaneously learn that almost 100% of the other planets are hilariously more advanced than them. Not to mention, they think of earth as primitive (no matter how many times they get their ass kicked off the planet.) 

So in the next three phases, defenseless humans are at the mercy of being protected by all of these superheroes (which is its own mindf*ck) but what happens when the heroes get tired of babysitting the public?  Even if that never happens, a portion of the population has to seriously fear that it can come to that. 

Then bam, the blip.  The single biggest event for humanity.  Humanity’s worst fears are realized in seconds. Then 5 years later half the population shows back up. 

So now we have humans living every day wondering if they’re going to die.  Their entire belief system has been shattered so they probably feel like they have no place in the world and what they do doesn’t matter.  Violent crime would increase and people would probably lose control or start cults devoted to some of these other alien races. 

There is so much more BS happening to these people that I cant even comprehend what the life of a background character in a marvel movie would be like.It is very common for video game players to drop the resolution when certain game mechanics overwhelm system resources. Also VERY common amongst players of FPS games so as to have lightning quick reflexes without the graphical lag.

Neo figured out the Agent's spawn bug immediately and took actions WITHIN the Matrix to counter them, including the infamous "low detail fight". I sum up that Neo dropped the resolution in the area to give him that edge, but allowing for the Agent's to experience less lag and the Agent spawn to increase and forcing Neo to escape as he did.

&#x200B;

Edit: Also, Neo's sunglasses never show a reflection in this entire scene.

Edit: Also at the beginning of scene when Smith approaches, Neo literally removes the crows with a blink.In Captain America 1, Howard Stark shows the Cap a bunch of shield prototypes he designed before Rogers notices the vibranium shield tucked away on the bottom shelf. A lot of people wonder why Stark didn’t show Rogers the vibranium shield first, since it’s obviously the best choice. 


My guess is that Stark knew the vibranium shield was the best one, but he was hoping Cap would choose a different shield so Stark could use the vibranium for other projects. Stark likely knew how versatile vibranium is, and given that it’s all the vibranium that the military has, he likely didn’t want to give it all away for just one soldier. 


Since it was the military’s vibranium, they probably ordered Stark to make a prototype shield with the vibranium for Rogers, but Stark likely saw this a waste of the precious metal. So he made a few more options with more bells and whistles to distract Rogers from vibranium shield. Too bad Cap is a man of simple tastes. Just saw The Killing Joke last night, I highly believe that the Joker killed the Batman. 

1. Barbara is the narrator from the start of the movie; indicating that she is in present time recalling a story
2. The storage unit with the dead bodies tied to chairs laughing and stage; indicating that the Joker killed with a Joke
3. At the end, Batman finally shows emotion after being deadpan and emotionless the entire movie by laughing.

I think the Joker’s joke at the end of the movie was “The Killing Joke” the same joke he told at the storage unit which causes the victim to laugh uncontrollably until they dieIt’s well established that you quickly lose your mind before turning into a runner. This transition into insanity is USUALLY extremely fast, but my theory is that, with Ellie, it is extremely slow.

She consistently makes the terrible decision of continuing her quest for revenge in spite of all it is costing her, which we may attribute to her PTSD. But what if she is slowly morphing into a rabid animal just like every runner eventually becomes, and all her thoughts and actions are subtly driven by her slowly creeping insanity from the fungus infection?

Edit: Ellie, in TLoU 1:

>Back in Boston - Back when I was bitten, I wasn't alone. My best friend was there. And she got bit too. We didn't know what to do. So...She says, "Let's just wait it out. Y'know, we can be all poetic and just lose our minds together". **I'm still waiting for my turn...**So I have seen people complaining that after Thanos killed Loki, he didn't transform back into his frost giant form. Or after he entered TVA, where magic doesn't work.

I think that his skin color has nothing to do with magic. He was blue only on Jotunheim as baby, when ice giant touched his hand and when he was holding Casket of ancient Winters. This could mean that Loki (and other ice giants) are blue only, when they are cold.*"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."*

*"Or a genius."*

\- Star-Lord and Thor in Avengers: Infinity War

Why did the Asgardians give such a powerful item to a being who is clearly untrustworthy and a bit unstable? Even if they don't want to keep it with the Tesseract in the vault at Asgard, surely there's a safer place somewhere in the Nine Realms they could hide it.

Thor knew what he was doing: The Collector is obsessed with collecting. Once he had one Infinity Stone, he would be obsessively driven to complete his collection. They could watch him from afar and let him do the dirty work of scouring the galaxy, seeking out the stones that were still hidden.

This proved to work in Guardians of the Galaxy, when The Collector contacted Gamora and offered to pay her to bring him the Orb. Without Tivan's interference, the stone likely would have gone directly to Ronan, the Guardians wouldn't have a reason to join together, Xandar would be destroyed, and Thanos would have got the Power Stone much earlier.

Looks like Thor really is a genius.They even throw things at the Green Goblin, and say stuff like:

 **"You mess with one of us, you mess with** ***all*** **of us!"**

The citizens of NYC save Peter multiple times during the trilogy, also picking up his body as he passed out  so that he wouldnt fall off the train, and surrounding/protecting him when Doctor Octavius showed up. 

[seen here ](https://youtu.be/r_W6mXqzJNU?t=356)

The average person in NYC simply had a heightened appreciation for local heroes such as firefighters, police, and Spidey too.

They had *just* been shown the extreme value of having local, neighborhood, heroes.

The recent 9/11 attacks were also why media outlets like The Daily Bugle were so ready to spin Spider-Man as a villain. 

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

#Proof:

The Twin Towers existed in the promo short, released ahead of the movie:

[seen here](https://youtu.be/Ozz8uxW733Q)

-as well as other promotional material surrounding the first movie. You can still see the towers in the reflection of Spider-Man's eyes in a lot of promo material and covers.

[promo image](https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B1%2F0%2F8%2F6%2F9%2F10869936%5D&call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D) and here it is [zoomed & enhanced ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/StyBUGhLrISErq-R6RWcCR7yRE_9kIVgA-KdU9ch6hjsSiQREPYEjyfH_71ApiIE4uvG_iloI22DWzjs0Oeg3Lx6vrrDVu2zcNFFUHpJ6t1jmAKvKLOz63AwmC0fUfDDtufNiIPjb4XRWkUucpM)

The Twin Towers are there, and then they are suddenly gone.

So, the 9/11 attacks happened when Spider-Man was still getting his bearings as a hero, and we were simply never shown how he dealt with that situation. 

It would have happened during the montage of him being a new hero.

**In addition:**

New Yorkers are presented as being more rude and selfish in the beginning of the first movie, but after Spider-Man has his powers, the general public are shown to be much more compassionate and cooperative.

*-LogicDog*You know, everyone says Star Wars the clone wars (the animated series) is so amazingly spectacular, and I agree!
But there's one thing, one glaring thing about it that I can not forgive.
How they treat Count Dooku.

In the show, Dooku is a 2 dimensional villain who has no motive other than "I am an evil Sith, ooh look at me, I'm Christopher Lee animated. I want a worthy apprentice!"

If you'll remember, in the films they state that Dooku is a Jedi turned Sith. Well that's all fine and dandy until you actually take a closer look and listen to what he's saying. You realize Count Dooku is right.

In Episode II he warns Obi-Wan the Jedi are being manipulated. He says they can work together and destroy the Sith.
Even throughout all his dialogue he has little hints to his true allegiance, like still referring to himself as a Jedi, 
"My Jedi powers are far stronger than your own"
In Episode III he has a look of genuine sadness and betrayal when he pleads for Anakin not to kill him.

What am I getting at? Well only something so glaringly obvious that I'm surprised more Star Wars fans don't know it.
Count Dooku WAS A GOOD GUY!

He didn't turn to the Sith. He was a double agent for the Jedi.
Now, the Jedi order didn't know about this. He realized if they knew what he was up to Palpatine would eventually find out. As he routinely wormed his way into Jedi affairs.
So he didn't tell them. The only person who knew he was still loyal to the Jedi was himself. 

You're thinking "But he did all those horrible things!"
Yeah, yeah he did. You can't be a convincing Sith without getting your hands dirty.
Dooku soiled his name, reputation, and conscience, all for the sake of the greater good. 

The world would never know of his sacrifice, he'd go down in history as a war criminal of the worst kind. Count Dooku was a true patriot of the Jedi.

In the end though, he did tell someone. He took a gamble. A young Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi.
He told him what he'd learned, about the Sith influencing the Jedi from the shadows. He tried to get Obi-Wan's trust. He needed someone now who was still a trusted Jedi, someone who could continue the part of the job he no longer could. He needed his help, he... was his only hope. 

And Obi-Wan refused. Blinded by years of Jedi dogmatism he refused to believe there could be any good in Dooku. Even until the very end he fought against him not believing a word he said.
Until he died.
In the following days Obi-Wan remembered what Dooku told him. Suspicion grew in his mind that perhaps the Jedi really were being manipulated. It was this suspicion that led to them becoming wary of Palpatine. Eventually uncovering that he was indeed a Sith and forcing his hand. Palpatine converting Anakin and killing all the Jedi.

Yes, this was his plan from the start. Would anything different have happened had they not begun to suspect him?
No, not really. He would have converted Anakin anyway and still initiated Order 66. 
The end result would be the same.
Except for one thing, something so small yet so large.
Time. Because of their suspicions Palpatine, aka Darth Sidious, enacted his plan sooner than expected.

What would this have changed, you ask?
Luke, the son of Skywalker.
Had the events of Episode III happened any later than they did, Padme would have already given birth to her twin children. You could argue that she gave birth at the end because she was dying and had to save her children, but just by looking at the babies you can see they were perfectly healthy and would've been born soon anyway.

Had Anakin's children already been born, it's certain that Sidious would have hunted them down and killed them. But he didn't, everyone though Anakin's children died with Padme.
And from the ashes of apparent darkness, hope was born, _a new hope._

All thanks to the sacrifice of one Jedi who will forever be known as a traitor and criminal, Count Dooku.Has anyone considered that in Pokemon go you are all collectively playing as the bad guys? Think about it. Team Instinct, Team Valor, Team Mystic. When was there ever a team in a Pokemon game that wasn't the antagonists?

And finally, in an attempt to not get removed due to Rule 3: [Source 5](https://imgur.com/B3gYPcR)I mean Iceland basically runs off geothermal. It's an extremely reliable and powerful source of energy. The trouble is it's either impractical or just not around in most places. A live volcano would provide easy access.If you watch the [final showdown between Yoda and the Emperor](https://youtu.be/iu3qoIsGzUM) it all comes down to a standoff with Force lightning. Palpatine is blasting away, but Yoda holds his ground and then starts forcing it back.

The Emperor howls in rage and fear and pain and then, like two repelling magnets, they both get flung backwards. 

Palpatine, being the larger of the two, merely rolls backwards over the ledge and manages to grab a rail.  Yoda, however, shoots off like a champagne cork and ricochets off of a few platforms.

It's the size difference that loses the fight for him. The final face off was in essence a sumo wrestling match using the Force.  Had he been human-sized he wouldn't have been knocked back so far. He would've retained the high ground, killed the Emperor, and stopped decades of bloodshed and war.

As it was, his diminutive stature caused him to lose the advantage.  Battered and weakened, he is forced to limp away to lick his wounds.

From then on he is acutely aware of size.  "How you get so big eating food of this kind?"

Yoda's insistence that "size matters not" is an overcompensating defense mechanism rooted in his deep insecurity. He *knows* that size matters, but he wants to deny it loudly to everyone, especially a snot-nosed farmboy brat who happens to outweigh him by 150 lbs.Watching Family Guy the other day, I noticed a running joke is whether everyone can understand Stewie or not and it got me thinking.

The whole show is Stewie's interpretation of the world. How an infant sees the world and tries to understand it from his limited knowledge. 

That's why each episode seems so exaggerated, so extreme. Stewie is interpreting his family's actions and filling in the blanks due to his limited vocabulary and understanding of the world.

In episodes where people talk to Stewie, it's usually short conversations. This is akin to people making baby-talk with a toddler - they do engage him in conversation, but they are not as elaborate as Stewie interprets them. 

That's why Brian, a dog, talks. He sees Brian as another member of the household, not able to understand that different species cannot communicate with one another. When the family talks to Brian, they are in fact talking to him in the way a petowner would talk to his/her pet, not engaging him in conversation. Stewie doesn't understand this, and sees the dog communicating with everyone as a normal person would.

This explains Peter's stupidity and Louis' strict demeanour. You see, Peter works all day, and when he returns from work, he spends his time with his family, and like most fathers does silly things to make his infant laugh and smile. Stewie interprets this as the way that Peter actually is (and exaggerated highly) because he doesn't know Peter any other way than the silly acts he performs to his child in an attempt to humour him. Louis seems strict and naggy because she is a stay-at-home mom, and Stewie spends all his time with her. He sees a side of her that he doesn't see in Peter, which is why she comes off as a firm woman to him. I'd even go as far as say that she is the one that disciplines Stewie in Peter's absence, which is why Stewie has such a hatred and desire to kill her because of it. 

My suspicions later got confirmed in an episode where Stewie went on the show "Kids say the darndest things". They were interviewing Stewie prior to the show and asked him a question, to which Stewie replied in a well thought-out eloquent response, but was met with silence from the interviewers. This is because he just babbled a long sentence of baby-speak, instead of saying anything comprehensible. Only when Stewie changed his vocabulary to that of a small child, where they able to understand him and started laughing. 

Tl;dr - The show is about how Stewie sees the world, which is why it's so wacky and extreme. 

  This is so dumb and I apologize for both it  and spoilers

 Dominic Toretto is part of the Madrigal family encanto, from the new Disney film Encanto.  

&#x200B;

Dom's power is the ability to do impossible physics-defying things in cars.  

the franchise starts off pretty normal, with Dom and his crew doing normal but extreme things in cars.  as the franchise moves forward the stunts get more extreme and impossible. This is a manifestation of the gift from the encanto.  In the first few films, the things they do are reasonable because Dom has been removed from his powers. but as his crew grows what they can do gets ridiculous. 

The reason his power regrows is that the gifts from the encanto [are all about Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk).It would make sense Fury would keep such an important, one of a kind, object in a safe place.  A place like a safe.  Fury had no idea Loki was about to appear, no idea Earth was about to be invaded and no idea the base was about to be destroyed.  No reason to keep the pager anywhere but in a safe or a vault.  It wasn’t until after the Battle of New York was SHIELD able to dig through the rubble and retrieve it.The actor playing the Mayor in Groundhog Day, Brian Doyle-Murray, also plays the janitor that plays with the rejuvenation of Matthew Perry/Zac Efron in 17 again. In it, he's portrayed as some kind of time manipulating god, who creates a time space vortex during a storm. He also walks aroun as a janitor that doesn't interacts much with the characters and keeps a low profile. 

The reason because he causes Perry/Efron's problems seems to be really to entertain himself from afar. As a superdimentional being in control of time and space, he must be really bored, so he amuses himself propitiating both Perry/Efron's ex wife and daughter have a crush on him at the same time. 

In Groundhog Day the same character (in my account) is more involved in the action (more of a gamer experience in this one). Before the first loop he identifies Bill Murray as his victim, because of all the obvious personality problems he has and the clear disgust for the people having a good time. Here Time God is the Mayor, who is obviously enjoying every minute of the festivities, the wedding party, etc. In this dimension he even has a wife, so he must have been here at least a few decades (Harold Ramis, the movie's director, once said the time spent by Bill Murray's character in the loop was thousands of years, so for Time God to spend 40 years pretending to be a nice human life is nothing). "The Mayor" is a public persona, he uses to cover his true identity. As extra evidence, in the recent Jeep ad where Bill Murray is again trapped in a time loop, Time God is still the Mayor, 40ish years later.

In It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's double episode "The Gang Goes to Hell" (S11E9-10) Time God has a job as the captain of a Cruise Ship, a great place to play with people's timelines unnoticed. It's a dry Christian trip, so he can play creating religious experiences for the passengers. The Gang starts the episode seemingly dead in Heaven, recounting how they drowned and sank the ship. In the episode the Captain catches Frank and Charlie smuggling drugs and alcohol in the ship. Time God seems to decide to punish them and teach them a lesson, like the previous times. Yet here the Gang being the Gang, his plan fails and the never grow or learn anything. So the last time they die, we see them in afterlife, and he transports them to a police station. How they save from drowning is not explained, because they didn't do it.

Lastly, the Time God appears in Wayne's World as Noah Vanderhoff, the owner of video games venue "Noah's arcade". Notice that the other stories involve violent water/snow phenomena, like storms in 17 again and Groundhog Day, and a ship sinking in IASIP. In the one story that doesn't have this, he uses a name directly related to floods and storms, so maybe that satisfies a limitation of his power. Here Wayne and Garth make fun of him, but as they aren't lacking any serious character growth, like people in the other movies (Wayne and Garth don't change a bit in their journey), they get a "time wish" that they use in the end, when they change the outcome of the story several times (the Scooby-Do ending, and then the mega happy ending)Spoilers below. 

So we all think it’s fair that Boba Fett got his armor back but does it really make sense for Mandalorian tradition. Mando seems okay with it once he finds out that Jango was a foundling. However Boba has said multiple times that he ain’t a Mando and he don’t follow the creed. 

The significance of Mando giving the armor back is because he is thinking like a dad and not a Mandalorian. He relates to the relationship Boba had with Jango, and as long as the armor did rightfully belong to Jango, he’s cool with Boba taking it. I’d also go so far as to say that while he has no intention of Baby Yoda being trained as Mandalorian, he would want his armor to go to him since that’s basically his son. I’m not sure if it’s Beskar but doesn’t Baby Yoda still have that mud horn trinket?So my nieces LOVE Caillou and I've always thought it was weird how the series focuses on Caillou while simultaneously showing how Caillou is just a story character.

It got me thinking about how Caillou is bald while Rosie has hair straight outta the womb, and how he's always doing expensive things and how his parents generally let him get away with whatever he wants.

So I think that when Caillou was two-three (we see in the episode where Rosie is born that he is already bald) he was diagnosed with some type of fatal cancer, causing him to lose his hair. Because of this, his parents are always trying to make his life as fulfilling as possible by taking him on rare experiences, and they don't get mad at him for doing bad things because they know that there is no point in trying to correct it.

Caillou eventually passed away while Rosie grew up to live a regular life, and I also think think that the 'grandma' reading all the stories is a fully grown Rosie, reflecting on the brother she lost so early on with the stories left behind by their parents.

Thus, the legit, OG Caillou passed away long before his little sister grew up to tell kids stories about him, the main focus of the series.

And that's it, folks. Whaddya think???[As soon as the attack happens, Shuri switches from rearranging individuals pathways to copying and uploading Vison's primary sections.](https://i.imgur.com/BznyZtH.png)

This may seem a little far fetched but certain aspects of the wizarding world strike me as odd. 

It is revealed that at the time of the fourth book the Minister of Magic was required to tell the Prime Minister that he was bringing a dangerous magical creature into the country (a dragon). Why would this rule exist? It doesn't sound like something the wizards would have made up. Their typical policy is to hide things from muggles. This sounds like a rule we would make.

Taking this a step further to the Ministry of Magic in general. Why is it called the Ministry of Magic? That doesn't sound like a name of a government. It sounds a lot more like the name of a department. They call the head of this government the Minister of Magic. People in the United States don't call the President the President of America and in Britain the Prime Minister is simply called the Prime Minister. Why is this distinction necessary when wizards don't even seem to know what type of government muggle nations have? Furthermore, no elections are every mentioned. Where did this government come from? From where does it drive its authority?

The most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that the wizards are generally lame now a days. Yes, Dumbledor is powerful but compared to the Peverells he is pretty weak. In fact much of his power came from one of their artifacts that now no one knows how to make. Even Nicholas Flamel could construct an artifact that no one was able to reproduce. The founders of Hogwards and Merlin were powerful as well. What happened to the powerful wizards? Why do wizards not experiment with magic more? 

One reason is that the ministry strictly regulates it. Wizards must register all spells, they must register as anamagi, and they even collect hide powerful artifacts like time turners (which by the way wizards can't make anymore). Another reason is a general culture of complacency and lethargy that seems to permeate the wizarding world. They are ignorant to muggle affairs and technology that may be to their benefit, they see no reason to advance magic or their rather antiquated culture. By and large they seem almost pacified. 

My theory is that some time near the end of the middle ages the muggle trials were more successful than the wizards were led to believe. We found some way to defeat the most powerful of the wizards (by some magical means or perhaps from trickery or shear numbers). Muggles killed the most powerful of the wizards, destroyed magical knowledge, and created the Ministry of Magic to keep wizards in check. The entire government is actually a clever plan to make wizards believe they are doing this to themselves. After centuries of living under this bureaucracy its policies have become part of the very culture of magic. The wizarding community seems to be withering and I think this may be by clever design.

TLDR: The wizarding world is on a steep decline in large part because of the Ministry of Magic. My theory is that Muggles set this up in order to cause the decline and eliminate the threat of magic.

Edit** Changed dark to middle for more historical accuracy and so the timeline matches up.In Tarzan, you can see that the Porters brought all kinds things to their camp, such as books, plates and typewriters. I can understand why they brought things like books (obviously for academic purposes) and plates (everyday utensils). But I always wondered why they would bring things like gramophone, grandfather clock and telescope. After all, the Porters went to Africa to study gorillas.

My theory is that while studying gorillas were their main goal, they had a side goal in their expedition: **to educate "savages".** 

The movie is set on the late 19th century, where imperialism was still going on.  Just as the poem White Man's burden shows (interestingly enough, they mention Kipling in the movie), Europeans believed it was their duty to "educate" the "savages" in Asia and Africa. They brought all those objects to show and teach them to the natives. 

The best evidence to support this theory would be the projector. The projector contained a wide variety of images from trains to planets. What better way to teach non english speaker about the western world than to show pictures? 

And if my theory is correct, Jane and her father not only succeeded in their goal of studying gorillas, but they also succeeded in their goal of educating a savage . They did introduce Tarzan, a "savage" man, to the cultures of human.I believe the movie will end with the Snap, that leads to half the universe disappearing.

The Russo's have stated that everything Barton does is a huge spoiler, but I think he only appears for one significant scene.

Thanos will Snap his fingers. We then see Hawkeye with his family. He turns, but when he looks back they're gone. Likewise, with Ant-Man, his daughter Cassie disappears. This leads them to reunite with the Avengers in Avengers 4, where Hawkeye goes Ronin.So the common perception of Squidward is that life has given him the shaft. He dreams of being a musician or artist, but lacks the inherent skill or talent to actually make any money off of those dreams. He's a lowly cashier with a cheapskate boss and neighbors who irritate the hell out of him. 

But while it's true that he lacks the skill for his true passions, he has a much better chance at happiness than you might realize. The problem is that he he's terrible at handling his money.

We do have a reference for Squidward's income in one episode, but first let me establish that the figure I'm going to come up with is reasonable and that he does, in fact, have plenty of money to spend. Here are some of the things Squidward has been able to afford:

1) First and foremost, he lives alone in an enormous, multi-story house with lots of art decorations and musical instruments.

2) He's able to move to an entirely new community (and then back home) on a whim.

3) In the episode where Spongebob breaks his butt, Squidward has set up a table and tea set on the mountain slope. This is presumably around the price of skiing for a day, not to mention a lot of hard work.

4) In the episode Good Neighbors, he casually orders a pedicure and foot massage to his home. He then orders a military-grade home security system which must have cost thousands.
 
5) In Band Geeks, it's stated that he rents out all of the instruments needed for a full marching band to play in. He also rents out an entire factory to practice in.

6) In Chocolate with Nuts, Squidward has reserved a table for himself at an extremely high-end restaurant - the same restaurant where Mr. Krabs racked up a bill of $100,000 dollars.

7) When he's fired from the Krusty Krab, he becomes homeless. However shortly after being hired back, he's able to buy back his old house and be back to his normal life.

That's what I can think of off of the top of my head. But hopefully it establishes that he isn't completely broke. Now for his actual salary:

In the episode where Squidward becomes obsessed with the toy crane (season 4, episode 4a), Mr. Krabs hands Squidward his paycheck - all in quarters. And the sack of quarters is enormous - about a foot in diameter. The volume of a sphere means its volume is 900 in^3. This isn't a fan calc sub, so for brevity I guess I'll just expect you to believe me, but the volume of a quarter is about .2 inches. 900/.2 = 4500 quarters = $1125. Since the episode came out in 2005, we need to [adjust for inflation](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1125&year1=200505&year2=201802), and it turns out Squidward is making $1,440 per paycheck. Let's say that his pay is biweekly and he's making $720 a week. That's $37,000 per year. 

Given Squidward's spending habit, it's no wonder he's miserable. Imagine if lhe ived in an apartment for a couple years, and saved up his money to take some art or music classes so that he could actually have a shot a creative career? 

An adjustment in lifestyle would absolutely let him.I made the joke to girlfriend that Captain America has been in the Army for 66 years and is still just a captain. She told me yeah but he's been frozen since 1945. Then I said oh my gosh that means that they owe him 66 years back pay because technically he was never relieved of Duty. So I did the math.

The O-3 pay grade in 1945 for someone with two years or less experience was $313.50 a quarter. If you had specialized training such as parachuting and Special Operations (which he does) you received an extra $100 per quarter. Plus a quarterly living allowance without a dependent of $82.50. That comes out to $496 a quarter. That's $1,984 per year for his first three years. So that's $5,952 right there, considering that he was commissioned the same year that he exited basic.

Also, there is an biannual increase of pay for service with a pay cap at 22 years with no increase of specialized pay or living allowance. Now provided that they kept him at the 1945 pay scale, for the 22 years after that, he would have received a total of $81,684 plus the previous $5,952 giving him a grand total of $87,636.

Now, provided that they kept the pay scale constant for the 66 years after, and they thawed him out in 2011 and immediately returned him to active duty with current Commission (which they did), adjusted for inflation, the government owes him the back pay amount of $3,154,619.52.

After doing this calculation, the saddest part to me is that is still ridiculously low for the danger that he and all other American soldiers, past and present, put themselves in. God bless the American troops.

EDIT: Holy crap! Who knew the army would actually respond to this?!

EDIT 2: oh my gosh I'm going to be on CBS 11 in DFW at 6 pm

EDIT 3: http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/05/12/captain-america-fan-crunches-numbers-says-army-owes-hero-3m/At the start of Avengers 4, Earth is experiencing the apocalypse, while Thanos is chilling on Titan. The Gauntlet is a wreck, but he can still use it to harness the Infinity Stones - after the Snap, he used them to restore his homeworld to the bucolic paradise he remembers. The Gauntlet might not be capable of another Snap in this state, but restoring Titan shows Thanos can still control the Stones and is still massively dangerous. So it's a surprise to him when Titan suddenly reverts to the desolate ruin it was at the end of INFINITY WAR.

That's part of Doctor Strange's plan. We saw in DOCTOR STRANGE that he can cast a spell on the Time Stone to impose an infinite time loop, represented as a green energy ring rotating around his left wrist.  No matter what happens, it always resets to the point in time when the spell was cast. The Stone and the spell on it keep working, even after Doctor Strange gets (repeatedly) killed. This point is important, and ties in with Strange's later reminder to Ebony Maw that spells he casts on the Time Stone will persist even after he dies. When he finally gets Dormammu to relent and releases the spell, the energy ring on his left wrist isn't seen again.

In INFINITY WAR, once on Titan, he sees what needs to be done for the one future where the Avengers win. He knows the Snap is coming, and knows he gets dusted in the Snap. His plan is to trap Thanos in the same time loop he used on Dormammu. But his confrontation with Dormammu was in the Dark Dimension, a realm where the normal rules of time don't apply and presumably, they're easier to muck around with. In our reality, simply trapping Thanos in a time loop wouldn't last, especially with him being the strongest guy in the universe and all. We saw how he bulldozed through the other spells Doctor Strange launched at him, like the multiple avatars and the Mirror Dimension.

So Strange needs a way to bind Thanos himself to the time loop spell without him knowing, even if he zips a million miles away.  For that, he needs Thanos to be carrying the Time Stone. Strange keeps it hidden during the fight, knowing Thanos will win (which is why Quill's freakout didn't spoil the plan, but was necessary for it).  We may even find Strange was manipulating the fight just to prevent Avengers from getting killed, say by using portals to get them away from Thanos the instant they landed a blow.  He needed a believable way to surrender the Time Stone to Thanos, without him catching on. His claim that he was trading it for Tony Starks' life was just an excuse to make it credible - as he said, he wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice Tony to protect the Stone. It wasn't because Strange saw Tony ends up being crucial to victory, though he may well be. It was a way to get the Stone past Thanos' skepticism, which we saw in his "No tricks?" comment. 

When Strange hands over the Time Stone, he's already cast the time loop spell on it. In the whole sequence, *we never see Strange's left wrist - and in fact, we never see it again in the whole movie*. We see full shots of every other character, and we see Strange's face, and torso, and right arm... but not his left hand. Maybe he's got it hidden under the cloak, maybe he's sitting on it, but he's hiding that time loop spell. After Thanos heads to earth, the Stone has a time loop spell active and he doesn't know he's trapped in it. At some point in the future, it will reset time to the moment Strange cast the spell, on Titan before the Snap.  The time loop is literally the "endgame" Strange refers to, as it was with Dormammu.

Unfortunately, Thanos is a smart fella and he'll deduce pretty quickly what's going on, just as he deduced how to use the Stone to turn back time in the first place. Once he figures it out, he'll just break the spell and that's that, so there's very little time to act. That's where the time travel in the movie comes in, driven by Ant-Man, who has discovered how to use time vortexes in the Quantum Realm to get where and when you want to go.  They can use the Quantum Realm to travel in both space and time, but using them can screw up the timeline and maybe destroy it.  (The Time Stone, by contrast, can't move you around in space, but we've seen it can reset time back to a particular point safely.) The Avengers regroup at a base of operations in the future, then go back to various points in time where they know Infinity Stones were available, scenes shown in CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER and THE AVENGERS.  

Some theories say they're going to change history this way. That won't happen, it's too Back to the Future for an Avengers movie. They'll need to go undercover (or masquerading as their younger selves) to avoid changing history, because they need to have history happen *exactly as it did*, up until the time loop. They'll bring along B.A.R.F. tech because reliving and observing memories of a certain point in space-time is the key to traveling there via the  Quantum Realm (in quantum mechanics, conscious observation is what causes uncertainty to resolve into a particular reality, a la Schrodinger's Cat).  The Infinity Stones are taken out of the timeline and collected for one task, taking down Thanos before he breaks out of the loop or repeats the Snap. The Avengers would be able to use time travel to confront Thanos the instant the time loop resets, and if they win, will be able to return the Stones back to the exact instants in history they borrowed them. That leaves the question of how they're even going to harness the Stones' power, seeing as no one but Thanos was powerful enough to handle more than one, and in the time loop Thanos will still have at least four of the Stones.

And of course the answer to that is the new Gauntlet, designed as much by Shuri as by Stark, and made of nanotech vibranium for its ability to absorb energy and protect the wearer from it. They'll recreate Thanos' journey to collect at least some of the Stones - say, the Space, Mind, Power and Time Stones - and bind them onto the vibranium Gauntlet. (Along the way, it may be the Mind Stone that reconciles Banner's mind with Hulk's mind, and produces a Hulk that integrates both.) I have a hunch the one wielding it against Thanos won't be Thor, but Captain Marvel - you have to be a cosmic badass just to wield one Stone, let alone several. Captain Marvel will be key to retrieving the Power Stone, which has ties to her Kree heritage, and she's just recently reconnected with Nick Fury, who's been busy building a secret underground version of SHIELD to protect Earth. My hunch is that the battle ends not with killing Thanos, but exposing him to the Soul Stone and showing him the devastation his mad journey has caused. He ends up contrite and living out a peaceful solitary existence, just like in the original comics.

Anyway, that's my theory and I'm sticking to it.


Edit: **TL;DR:**  Strange saw the Snap would happen in every possible future.  It was even necessary for the future where they win, because it traps Ant-Man in the Quantum Realm and forces him to learn to use time vortexes to escape, leading to a new method of time travel.  Strange casts a hidden time loop spell on the Time Stone (like he used on Dormammu) and tricks Thanos into accepting it, by pretending to want to save Tony.  At some point it'll reset time to before the Snap.  This gives the Avengers one chance to time travel out of the loop to regroup in the future, heist Infinity Stones from the past, and build a new vibranium Gauntlet.  They have to do it undercover to avoid changing history, so they can return to the same moment they left.  Thanos chases them through the past, but also knows history is too fragile to risk changing it.  When the time loop resets, if the Avengers win against Thanos, they can return the Stones to their places in history at the instant they were borrowed.  If they lose, the Stones never get returned, and our reality gets completely borked.  Once they steal the first Stone, they're literally going double or nothing on the Snap - so they need to be willing to make any sacrifice to win.After Jeff graduates from Greendale, he refuses a job offer from his old firm and instead starts his own practice, but fails miserably. Why did he fail? I think I've figured it out. I think that Hamish, Hamish & Hamlin (the firm that hired Jeff, HHH for short) knew Jeff's law degree was fake, but hired him anyway and structured his job around him not doing legal work.

Arguing in front of a judge is only a small part of any criminal or civil lawyer's job description. There's also interviewing witnesses, discovery, finding legal loopholes, finding precedents, filing briefs, etc. Things that are considerably harder without a law degree. 

HHH knew that Jeff would be absolutely useless with that stuff if he never went to a real law school (it's implied he got his degree at a Colombian diploma mill). But they also recognized his undeniable persuasive talent, and refused to let that go to waste. HHH is established to be a pretty shady law firm (at least one employee hunts people, and another tries to have sex with a teenager), so they would almost certainly not care if one of their star employees faked his degree. They probably had paralegals and other attorneys doing the real legwork for his cases, and then just sent him into the courtroom to deliver the killshot. 

But Jeff erroneously assumed that this was all there was to being a lawyer. So when he started a practice on his own, he was completely lost when it came to doing everything lawyers do other than arguing cases. Which is why his law practice failed so disastrously.The poison mushroom item is dropped exclusively by portrait ghosts, who for the most part, are meant to appear as formerly living people, as opposed to the regular ghost enemies in the game, who appear as more stereotypical bed-sheet ghost. A peculiar, never explained detail about the poison mushroom is that it appears to have a [bite mark](https://www.models-resource.com/resources/big_icons/7/6887.png) . This bite mark is only present in the Luigi's Mansion version of the item.

There was an unused animation where Luigi would go into a [choking fit](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/336iUm4ZN0E/hqdefault.jpg) whenever he touched the poison mushroom. In the animation, his eyes would blacken, resembling the [zombie Luigi](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/someordinarygamers/images/5/52/Game_Over.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140727025205) seen in early trailers. [Uncle Grimmly](https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/c/cd/Uncle_Grimmly_Platinum_frame_LM3DS.png/120px-Uncle_Grimmly_Platinum_frame_LM3DS.png) also has very similar eyes.

According to the bio of the portrait ghost Sue Pea, she went into a short nap that turned into an "eternal rest".  An IRL effect of digesting a poison mushroom, particularly the [Amanita muscaria](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/2006-10-25_Amanita_muscaria_crop.jpg/1200px-2006-10-25_Amanita_muscaria_crop.jpg) (which is what the classic Mario mushroom is based on), is severe drowsiness. According to the North American Mycological Association, "Drowsiness is a common symptom, and many who ingest these mushrooms fall asleep and can not be roused. In rare cases the coma-like state can last for more than 24 hours." Also Lydia and Neville appear in bed robes. Neville's ghost is stuck doing what he did the moment he died, yawning while reading a book, unaware he has just been poisoned.

How and why did they all die? I believe Shivers the butler was responsible. His bio states that he "wanders the house, endlessly searching for his master's will. He hopes he's included in it!" Shivers was 72 when he died while his presumed master, Neville, was 42. Shivers, afraid he would be outlived by Neville, decided to kill him and his family so he can be the sole beneficiary of the will. He did this by poisoning their dinner with poison mushrooms ( since there isn't any chef ghost, I'm gonna assume he was the chef as well as the butler for the family.) Before he could find the will, Shivers died. Either by old age or, perhaps, burning to death since he lights himself on fire with his candelabra before you capture him. ( a recreation of the moment he died)After watching Casper again it is clear that he was just pulling the D.E.N.N.I.S. system to get that kiss on Christina Ricci.

Demonstrate value - Protect her from the other ghosts, which happen to be his three crazy uncles who seem to pose a threat.

Engage physically - Grab her by the foot and take her screaming through the air to the lighthouse. 
 
Nurture dependence - Oh, you're lonely in this mansion? The kids at school don't like you? Be her only friend.

Neglect emotionally - Ignore her when the other boy finally gives her attention and asks her out.

Inspire hope - Turn into a human. Hey, it's me, 90's teen heartthrob Devon Sawa!

Separate entirely - But I'm only human for ten minutes so give me that kiss then PEACE.Something that has never sat right with me about The Office is the identity of Michael Scott’s father. We barely ever get any form of information about his real parents aside from hearing his mother on the phone maybe once through the whole series. There have been quite a bit of theories that suggested his step father Jeff (whom he hated) was abusive, and his mother was neglectful of him.  I don’t think this is accurate. From what I can tell Michael has lots of symptoms of someone who has childhood PTSD.

Allow me to elaborate:

Michael Scott was born March 15th, 1965 according to what I can find online. 

Robert Mifflin killed himself in 1972.

Michael would have been 8 years old when this happened, and this is important for multiple reasons.

- Michael tells the camera crew that he was held back in 2nd grade, and the average age of a 2nd grader is 7-8 years old. Roughly the time of his father’s passing.

- Michael’s mom appeared to have married Jeff around the time he was 10-11 years old. Relatively soon after the passing of Mr. Mifflin.

- Michael is shown as a child for having a tendency to wear suits. He even talks as a child about wanting to be a manager. I believe this is because his father was a respected owner of a business that would have been taking off around that time.

- Michael mentions that his grandmother sends him lots of birthday money due to her declining mental health. If his father was Mr. Mifflin then it would make sense for his family to have distributed his wealth following his passing. This could also explain how Micheal’s mother could afford suits to be made for him.

- It is commented about multiple times that Michael acts like a 8-12 year old. It would make sense for him to have become mentally stunted around that age after the tragic passing of his dad.

Now, back to the present. Michael’s bosses put up with WAY more out of him than they should. I suspect that this is because they know the identity of Michael’s father due to HR records.

Michael also appears to have never worked anywhere other than Dunder Mifflin, and he was promoted with what seems to be little to no qualifications. It would make sense for him to have started work at the very same place he knew about his whole life. Maybe he was even offered a job there as soon as he was of age as a strategic move by the company.

David Wallace at first seems a bit unsure about Michael, but soon appears to be blown away multiple times by Michael’s natural talent for sales and leadership. The same talents that his father would have had when starting a company. David would naturally want to keep Michael in the fold due to his true identity being a positive look for the company.

This could also explain why Michael hates Toby. Toby would have access to Michael’s confidential information, and could be very well aware of the true nature of Michael’s situation.

Michael also hires his nephew Luke, and was accused of nepotism for tolerating his bad behavior in the office. That would make sense if Michael was hired and promoted due to an estranged form of nepotism. He wouldn’t know any better than what he has been through.

Michael is noticeably shaken when he speaks about Suicide in the episode “Safety Training”, this could be because of a relapse of repressed memories. Sometimes when a victim can’t face the reality of a situation they repress memories so far down that even they forget them. The overall material of the course could have been enough to set Michael off.

Finally, Robert Dunder came to speak to his branch with seemingly little to no pushback. Now, yes. He was elderly and retired, but it would have made sense for him to have declined a long trip to a cold place for exactly those reasons. Yet, he came maybe as a favor to Mifflin’s son. 

I’m not sure that any of this is true, and I get that this is an incredibly dark theory. However, it’s something I’ve thought about before and I would love to hear all your thoughts.

Edit:

- Fixed the spelling of his name in the body of the post. That is was my bad. It’s one of those things that I’ve always had trouble with spelling correctly. Unfortunately I can’t change the title.

- I know that his name isn’t Michael Mifflin. I also know he told Toby about his step dad taking him to a baseball game, and that is where he learned that he wanted to be a manager. However, I believe that on some level this didn’t happen/he places all his mentality here to block off his father’s death. We also never learn Jeff’s last name. His mother could have changed her name to Scott after she married Jeff, and because he was a minor changed his too.

- No, he wouldn’t have necessarily inherited anything, because his mother and grandmother are still alive. He was a minor, and if Mifflin killed himself suddenly he may not have written a will. Meaning everything would have went to the next of kin or spouse. Michael’s mother is still alive during the course of the show as he speaks to her over the phone when telling her he is “getting married”. 

- This is a fan theory. I feel like some people are taking this way too seriously as if I am trying to make my theory canon. I am not. Not at all. This is just something I thought of, and there were quite a few interesting coincidences.

- As another user pointed out. Michael did have a job before DM at a Men’s Warehouse. Completely slipped my mind.

Edit 2:

- I Hate to be that guy who does like a million edits on the post, but I would like to give a huge thank you to all the people who have responded to this. You guys are awesome, and I completely understand and agree that there are plot holes in my theory. I haven’t watched the show since it was removed from Netflix, but I had watched it 10+ times while it was there. One of my favorites ever. Thank you for all the upvotes, complements, constructive criticism, and discussion.If you look st the first Nightmare on elm street the kills and dreams are creative but still attempt to scare the kids after Nancy brings Freddy into the real world and 'kills' him he doesn't die. I think after this knowing he is absolutely invulnerable and unable to be truly defeated he starts to just become more ridiculous and goofy to keep himself entertained knowing he'll never stop and keep boredom from setting in.When Peter (Robin Williams) wakes up in Neverland, he is in the pirate village. We follow a scene where Smee (Bob Hoskins), Captain Hooks second in command and right hand man, is seen picking up Hook's hook and carrying it back to the ship. 

When Smee passes by the whore house, all of the ladies call for him excitedly.

As Captain Hooks closest compatriot, it stands to reason that Smee receives not just a higher than standard compensation, but has access to all of Hooks gold and other plunderings. Smee even eats with the Captain off of the same table. Yet Smee is dressed just as sloppy and dirty as the rest of the crew. 

Smee is spending every last gold coin he gets to spend time with ladies of ill repute.It is well established that wizards go to Olivander's when they're 11 to get their wands. Right? Well, actually no. Harry does this because he was raised by muggles and didn't have a wand. Later in Deathly Hallows we see another muggle-born witch explain how the wand "chose her" at Olivander's. But other wizards (like Neville) use inherited wands or, my theory is, get them long before 11. This is a subtle way to keep muggle-borns inferior. I based it on 3 things:

1) There is no reason at all to start wizarding school at 11. School in the real world starts around 5, and pre-school or school-like daycare can start as early as birth. So do wizards go to public school before Hogwarts? Well obviously not, because most of them know nothing about muggles. And can you imagine Draco Malfoy in public school? My guess is they go to private wizard schools, or cheaper family co-op educational centers. Maybe they can't "do magic" or maybe they can because the rules are relaxed, but they either get to practice or at least learn all about wizarding. This gives them a big head start (get it?) on muggle-borns. 

2) Speaking of Draco, he already knows Crabbe and Goyle before they first enter the Great Hall. Maybe he met them on the train, but what are the chances that 3 death-eater kids and future Slytherins just happened to get into the same car? They were probably friends for years. Most wizard-borns would have multiple same-age friends going into Hogwarts, while muggle-borns would have none. 

3) This goes along with the popular theory (and I guess canon because the Weasley brothers say it in the books) that wizards are generally terrible at magic. Can't even cast basic defensive spells. And yet some are excellent. The Hogwarts curriculum is generally terrible because students come it with wildly different knowledge and background skills. The first-year spells are actually pretty advanced (levitating something? Like the thematic climax of Return of the Jedi is a first-year thing?). The whole thing is geared toward muggle-borns who have studied and practiced already. And yes sure some of them are still terrible, and some muggle-raised ones like Hermione and Voldemort studied obsessively and caught up or got extra help like Harry. But in general most wizard-borns will be the great ones and most of the others will just coast by, barely able to summon a patronus because they are constantly taught a curriculum that is too advanced for them. 

( Yes I realize that the author said offhand somewhere that most get homeschooled or go to muggle school. But again, most know nothing about muggles so I doubt that. And most wizards work so I doubt there is a huge homeschooling trend. If anything the "homeschools" would be collectives with other kids, also bound for Hogwarts. )

Anyway tl;dr most wizard-borns learn about magic and probably get or have access to wands and practice long before age 11, giving them an edge on muggle-borns that everyone just accepts because obviously a theme of the books is racism.Another Avatar: The Last Airbender theory!

As we all know, Katara nearly heals Zuko's scar (in S2E20 "The Crossroad of Destiny") using the spirit oasis water from the North Pole, but then has to use it instead to heal Aang. (To be clear: if she'd used it on Zuko, Aang would've died...)

After the series completes and the Fire Lord is defeated, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord. Unlike his father, Zuko is known for having helped the Avatar in saving the world, and he is respected and loved. So, if the Aang Gaang so chose, they could pretty easily return to the North Pole and ask for more spirit oasis water to heal Zuko. Granted, the North Pole isn't going to be handing that out willy-nilly, but when the *freaking Avatar* and his friends who just *saved the world* showing up intending to heal the *good* Fire Lord... yeah, they would oblige.

So why does Zuko still have his scar in Legend of Korra? Simple: He chose to keep it. Why? For two reasons:

1. Although there is indeed more spirit oasis water, it is still a limited supply. Zuko's scar is not harming him in anyway, it is not cancerous. Healing it would be solely for the sake of vanity, and Zuko has grown enough to know there are better uses for that water.
2. After his entire journey, Zuko has used what's happened to him to grow. In his own words, "I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth." (S3E12 "The Western Air Temple"). Zuko's scar is no longer a symbol of his lost honor, but it is now a symbol of his past journey which he *had* to go through to restore his own honor. Thus he is able to wear it as a badge of pride - "My father burned and banished me because I dared speak up for what was right. It helped me learn the truth of how the world sees us, and so I helped restore balance to the world."This theory is short and based on the effects we saw in the MCU. The infinity stones are powerful and devices are needed to use them properly. Here what happens without those devices.

- The space stone teleported Red Skull through space.
- The soul stone turned him into a wandering soul, unable to quit the planet. He traded a soul for a soul and got cursed after getting his hand on the stone. He perhaps sacrified his own soul.
- The power stone is made of pure energy and incinerates the holder. (GOTG).
- The mind stone turns people insane, super sane or overly aggressive (behaviors of Ultron, Vision and effects of the specter on the Avengers). 
- The reality stone erases the holder from reality, slowly drawing strength from its life force.

Hypothesis : 

- The time stone probably teleports people through time, projects people into the Quantum realm or in unending loops of time.

Do you other ideas about the effects of the Time stone?
I don't necessarily mean this in a time travel way, more that they all pretty much represent what the health system in America does to it's doctors.

JD is that doctor starting out: wide eyed, naive, optimistic and innately wants to help people and not used to the uglier side of healthcare.

Dr. Cox is that same doctor when he's been at the job for a while: the job has worn him down, he's much more jaded, cynical, and rude but he still wants to do the right thing and will fight tooth and nail for his patients.

Dr. Kelso is that same doctor again towards the end of his career: he's had to do things that haunt him, but he tries not to show it and he's often has to play the monster, haven gotten so good at it you only see his mask slip occasionally.

Dr. Cox explicitly mentioned to J.D. that he reminded Dr. Cox of himself when he was younger. It's also heavily implied that Kelso used to be idealistic and loving before the hospital system made him jaded. We even seen them all acting like another one when Kelso retires and he mocks them both, as well as a scene where J.D. imitates Dr. Cox right to his face.

These three are the same doctor, who starts out as a wide eyed idealist, and gradually ends up selling more and more of their soul, to the point where the only way they can live with what they do is act like the monster those less experienced see them as and pretend it's not getting to them. By the end, everyone will hate him, but no more than he already hates himself.

The cherry on top? After Dr. Kelso retired, Dr. Cox ends up in the same position as him.The shark Bruce is a pred who wants to be vegetarian and be friends but no one believes in him besides Dory. 


This is exactly what we see in Zootopia where prey and preds live together in harmony.  


Finding nemo might take place ages before Zoomania before the animals became anthropomorphic. Its like nemos time was ancient. 


Dorie knows how to read which means she is able to write. She wrote the ideals of her friend down which became later the law of Zootopia.

Many of you corrected the theory. Nonmammals and fishes aren't seen in Zootopia and it's even stated that they eat seals. 

But if we assume that all the animals on became anthropomorphic while all the fishes don't it's still possible that they have the ability to dive or take a submarine. This way they found the writing and took inspiration from itIn Infinity War Loki very confidently tells Thor that the sun will shine on them again. In the Loki trailer, he says he's 10 steps ahead of everyone. He's been wrong before, but I think both these were very intentional. Then you've got the logo/branding of the "Loki" logo and mixing between different variations. Loki has always served himself and now he's a part of a show that deals with alternate timelines. I think the show will lead up to Loki working with himself in multiple timelines. It's very possible that from the beginning of his capture, he actually knows how it all goes down and the season is actually a full circle.So my theory is that right before the start of grade 2 for Calvin, he is killed in an accident of some sort.  In a trial to get to heaven, he must relive his final year over and over again until he is considered worthy of entering heaven/ the afterlife. Whatever you believe in. This is why there are many years worth of events, such as many different Christmases and events that I will mention. He finishes the school year, and is back with Mrs. Wormwood in September again, which is the start of the cycle. His friend, our beloved Hobbes, was only a stuffed tiger in Calvin's life. He appears alive in the afterlife as a guide for Calvin to get into heaven. Many times, his death is foreshadowed. His mom telling him he thinks he's going to be 6 for the rest of his life, their car breaking down multiple times, (which leads me to speculate that he was killed in a car accident), His parents saying they're going to kill him, (which if they were driving the car, they likely did), and that he has a habit of crashing his bike, wagon, and sled into things, which always result in him getting hurt. In the very last comic strip, Calvin comes to terms with everything, and tells Hobbes that it's a magical world. He gets into heaven, and that's how the series ends. With Calvin getting into heaven after years of trying.The new trailer didn't had much info, it was essentially just shots of characters looking determined with a Cap voiceover, but there was one shot [that grabbed my attention]( https://imgur.com/pWX31l2).


In Infinity War, when Tony suits up, we see that [the nanoparticle housing is stored external to his body](https://youtu.be/7lVolULFxX8), a point he makes clear with Pepper.


[But in this new shot, it looks like the housing unit is underneath an undershirt](https://imgur.com/pWX31l2), not at all how we saw it prominently displayed in IW.


My theory is that in some manner necessary to his survival, presumably to maintain his internal functions as food and water become scarce, Tony is forced to graft the nanotech to his body, leaving him with a permanently mounted arc reactor once again. 


Ideally, this will also involve seeing him in some kind of hybridization of the bleeding edge and extremis suits, but who knows what his final suit will look like. 


So yeah, tl;dr, nanotech in Tony's bodyMy theory is that General Grievous will make a brief cameo in the next episode during a flashback continuation scene of Mando's childhood village attack.

I don't think the final shot of the B2-HA bearing down on him is the end of Mando's origin story. Based on the evidence presented during the village attack flashbacks (below, Edit1), and my own timeline estimate, I theorize that **Mando's village was attacked by Confederacy forces led personally by General Grievous**. I believe Mando saw and/or interacted with Grievous during the attack and **it was Grievous (not just the battle droids) who left such a lasting impression on Mando**.

Without context, a child wouldn't have been able to tell Grievous' organic nature in one glance (and probably had never seen a Kaleesh warlord before), so Mando would naturally have assumed Grievous was 100% droid. Grievous was exceptionally intelligent, terrifying, and ruthless. If Mando witnessed him giving orders, being cruel, or interacted with him directly (Grievous was known to goad his victims) it would be even more reason to hate and mistrust droids.

I also believe (and hope!) that later on, a simple "you know he wasn't a droid, right?" from a friend... combined with IG-11 going ape on the imps to protect the child and thereby changing Mando's opinion of it as Mando depends on it more and more for the child's safety... will be the character development trigger that begins Mando's progress toward accepting droids.

&#x200B;

EDIT1: Some supporting evidence re: the flashbacks...

There are no B1's in the flashbacks... Grievous was known for only having Super Battle Droids in his personal army and its unusual for a civilian village to be attacked by exclusively B2's.

The B2's we see in the flashback look advanced, perhaps customized (red glowing eyes, flat armoured torso, etc.) and iirc Grievous had custom units.

We also see an HMP droid gunship which [we know Grievous liked to use](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/HMP_droid_gunship).

The presence of super battle droids, the likelihood of a Mandorlian attack (ie. hit contract on a VIP target), and the possibility of the B2-HA that we last saw being called off by an order, all support the likelihood of a high-ranking separatist leader on scene.

&#x200B;

EDIT2/3: Abridged. Thanks for all the feedback! Its not the strongest theory but its been fun to writeSo by using my basic Chemistry knowledge, hints given throughout the many Marvel movies, and the internet, I am going to attempt to discern what Vibranium and Adamantium would be if they existed in our world. Let us begin.

(tldr at the bottom)

&#x200B;

So let's start with Vibranium. What do we know about it? It's strong, rare, and has a multitude of chemical properties. Its rarity is easily explained, as the only supply came from a meteor that came to earth 10000 years ago. Its strength come from the fact that it absorbs vibrations. And as for the many chemical properties, it still remains unexplained. So let's start figuring it out. We know Vibranium is an element, as it is referred to as an element numerous times and listed with other elements in the quiz bowl session Peter Parker has on the bus in Homecoming ("Strontium, Barium, Vibranium"). The other two are group II elements or Alkaline Earth Metals, which has lead people to believe Vibranium is one as well. But based on its other properties, Vibranium simply couldn't be in group II. For 1, group II elements are highly reactive, and wouldn't be stable. 2, alkaline earth metals aren't found freely in nature, so if it was in group II, Wakanda wouldn't be mining it up, they would be synthesizing it in a lab. So Vibranium is found somewhere else on the periodic table. Based on the fact that it has many chemical properties, it is most likely as transition metal as they have electrons in their d-orbitals and have many different oxidation states (they can give up different amounts of electrons to react with different elements). Transition metals are also highly stable and are the metals we see daily (Iron, gold, silver, etc.). So it's a transition metal, but that doesn't explain its ability to absorb vibrations, as that ability come from structure, and transition metal atoms simply sit next to each with free flowing electrons, no ability to disperse vibrations. That ability would come from a crystal lattice structure, like diamond. And that got me thinking, as diamond is a network solid, meaning instead of being just a bunch of molecules coexisting, after the individual molecules form, they form bonds with the other molecules around it, which contributes to the diamonds strength. As you may or may not know diamonds are pure carbon, that form from being put under intense pressure and heat. But what has that got to do with Vibranium you may ask? Well entering our atmosphere on a meteor and crashing into the Earth would generate a lot of heat and pressure. So I theorise that Vibranium is a transition metal that has formed a network solid making it one of the strongest metals on earth.

&#x200B;

So what about adamantium? It's properties are more unknown, with the exception of being nearly indestructible. However, it is most likely not an element, as indicated by the line "There's a tricky thing about adamantium. If you ever manage to process its raw, liquid form, you gotta keep it that way. Keep it hot. Because once the metal cools, it's indestructible." (X-2) Meaning that you can simply mine it, it has to be made. Based on the fact that it is made by melting rather than another form of synthesis, and its incredible strength, it is most likely an alloy. But not just any alloy, an alloy that is part Vibranium. Now at first I wasn't going to say that because one strong metal makes another strong metal felt to easy, but then I remembered Wolverine Origins, and in the beginning team-X heads to Nigeria to find a fragment of a meteorite containing a rare metal (or to be exact a rare *element*). Let see meteor containing rare metal in Africa, sounds like Vibranium, all right. This explains why adamantium is so expensive and hard to make. So Vibranium takes care of one of its strengths impact strength (A material's ability to resist sudden force or impact without breaking or shattering) but adamantium also has impressive yield strength (How well a material resists deformation or how much strength it takes to bend it). For this they would most likely use stainless steel do to it's abundance and impressive yield strength. Finally, I believe Iridium would be a component due to its high melting point and resistance to corrosion, which seem to be properties of adamantium. Also Iridium is extremely rare, also contributing to adamantium's expense and difficulty to make.

&#x200B;

tldr: Vibranium is a transition metal that forms a network solid and Adamantium is an alloy comprised of Vibranium, Stainless Steel, and Iridium

Let me know what you guys think, and if there are any real chemists out there let me know if I am even close (theoretically)

Edit 2: Fixed some wordingNote: After taking the time to write this down and think it through, I’m 100% this theory is accurate. Here me out.

I got heavily into Star Trek this last year and a half, and inevitably encountered the big argument: Kirk vs Picard, who is the better captain. 

Kirk is the more interesting and fun character but “the better captain” is obviously Picard. Picard acts like an *actual* captain. Kirk is incredibly reckless and his incredulous luck is his greatest gift, not as much his legitimate skills. We see Kirk constantly taking bold risks that throw caution to the wind and regardless of how ludicrous some of his actions are…and somehow, it always works out for him.

But then it occurred to me…that’s exactly how Kirk would *want* to be portrayed: bold, daring, fearless in the face of overwhelming odds. Reality doesn’t play by the adventurous ideals of a young man yearning for excitement, as we see in plenty of episodes where politics and ethics get in the way of sci-fi escapades.

I think **the captain’s log is how Kirk claims his adventures went down** and we’re watching/listening to his version of the story play out. Think about Kirk’s personality and ask **‘Why wouldn’t Kirk fudge a few details to make him look better?’ He’s Kirk!**  That cocky but lovable bastard pulls this shit all the time.

Why would it matter if *some* details were altered for the sake of building a good reputation, Kirk would think. Maybe it’s because Kirk’s ego needs stroking or maybe it’s because he’s intentionally trying to play the political game for career safety, but the result is the same: people viewing his logs interpret him as a confident, level-headed, flirtatious, thoughtful, fearless, unbeatable hero, which is exactly how Kirk wants it.

This is also why some of the sets and monster costumes lack detail and look cheaply made: Kirk spent more time explaining how great he is than the scenery. 

He’d never deny credit when his teammates do a good job (some logs/episodes show how great Spock and McCoy are), but this guy survives battles all the time, gets with every girl effortlessly, and comes to conclusions about whatever they’re encountering oddly quickly for someone who is supposed to be unfamiliar with the situation.

Some of the corniness in the original Star Trek can be justified by Kirk embellishing details about himself. Here are a few examples…

---

Reality: The enemy put up a hard fight. No one was killed. Kirk received several minor injuries including a black eye and a bruise rib but ultimately the crew of the Enterprise succeeded with their combined efforts.

Captain’s Log: I knocked out three guards on my own. One punch each, because all I need is one punch.

---

Reality: The beautiful girl flirted with Kirk a bit before kindly rejecting him, if not for his brashness but how inappropriate it would be to do anything but flirt with a man she just met.

Captain’s Log: We totally made out. Suck it Spock.

---

Reality: Kirk blasted the alien at point blank range and fast, phaser set to kill.

Captain’s Log: I killed the alien and felt terrible about it. When back on the ship, I went to my quarters to sit in quiet contemplation as I pondered the philosophical ramifications of what I had done, silently wondering if I could ever face my crew again. After sometime, I pulled himself back to the captain’s chair, knowing that part of my commitment to Starfleet is to carry the weight that others can’t.

----

Reality: The alien was 7 feet tall. Scotty fired on the alien as per protocol.

Captain’s Log: 12 feet tall, and growing right before my eyes. I had to act quickly before things got out of control. My phaser malfunctioned so I quickly ordered Montgomery Scott to open fire.

---

**Plot Hole 1**: “Wouldn’t people read his log and call bullshit?”

As far as I know, Kirk’s log is stored in his private quarters and no one goes there but him and the women he fucks. Plus, everyone on the Enterprise have jobs to do, so most wouldn’t have the time to listen to all his logs. For a five-year journey, there must be hours of data to go through. Who is going to go into his room, sit down and listen all of that data?

**Plot Hole 2**: “Reports would surely conflict, right?”

Yeah, but who is Star Fleet going to believe? A red shirt? Ha! Kirk is the highest ranking officer on the Enterprise. And his fibs aren’t actually hurting anyone, they’re just embellishing details so does it really matter?

**Plot Hole 3**: You’re saying Kirk can’t do anything on his? That’s he’s a total fraud?

Of course not! He’s a highly capable captain overall. I’m just implying his ego often gets in the way of common sense. He’s a risk-taker and a show-off. These traits would surely persist in other aspects of his professional life. I’m guessing maybe 80-90% of what he records in log is actually true, but rest...the parts where Kirk doesn't get so much as a bruise after a Kilgon hits him...that's Kirk showing off.
Futurama has a lot of cool stuff, a lot of really funny and intelligent satire and parody on not only popular culture but humanity in general. What I love most is the dark humor that flavors the lore of the show. I realized something about the suicide booths in the show. 

There is a popular theory is that the Suicide Booth is the only way to guarantee death in the future because of all of the medical advancements and increased longevity.

But do you ever really see anyone die? A lot of people do die or come close, survive mortal wounds and things that would cause shock or are far away from amedic facility. A quick Google search revealed the only 'deceased' characters are ones from Frys past and Calculon, who is a robot.

Now, as I said in futurama there are many parody and satire references. And there are plenty of allegorical references with religion but interesting enough it's portrayed with robots, specifically robot hell, and the fact that the only character to "meet"God was Bender, another robot. No mention of afterlife or Heaven is there for humans aside from weird cult members. 

Which got me thinking. In the year 3000, humanity has realized that there is no religion, no God, no afterlife, no heaven. To help people combat and reject the instinctual notion of a spiritual connection, they invented suicide booths to give people the actual see-for-yourself expericne of death and no afterlife. The machine is likely fitted with medical tech to fix you after death. You die, see the black nothingness and come back to continue on. 

Further evidence : the machines are modeled after phone Booths, an outdated and antiquated technology that has long been out of use. A phone booth was a place to connect with someone, in a private and intimate place to have your conversation. Only in this case it was a private conversation with your God and no on is on the line.


Edit: additional thoughts. 

If not religion, it's possible these booths exist to provide a sense of purpose and meaning in a life devoid of any real struggle or hardship. Something that has plagued humanity in times of societal and personal depression, a lack of purpose has historically been cured with a heavy dose of spirituality. In fact in the future where no one wants for anything and everything has been explored already, and death is meaningless, depression and mental illness should be rampant. Near death experiences have been shown to completely eradicate depression and renew a sense of purpose in suicide survivors. A quick death provides a clarity of what is really important in life, and now you can continue less hindered.

In futurama there is nothing more to need in way of survival so all capitalism is by way of experiences. You aren't sold goods you are sold services. Even things like slurm have addictive properties.it makes sense the booth wouldn't sell an end product but rather an experience. And it's so cheap, its likely the only way the company makes their money is on repeat customers. It's bad business to kill off your customer baseThis is pretty common speculation in the real world, but I think in the MCU it’s almost a given. 

Thor is my primary example. Everything about Asgard and Norse mythology exists in “Midgard” as legend/mythology (I’m sure he could’ve avoided a lot of headache with Hela had he read up on his own mythology). 

Even “El Dorado” is real in the MCU. In Black Panther, Klau straight up says that Wakanda is what that legend is based off of.  

Since Thor, and “El Dorado” are real then it only makes sense that other legends/religions are based off of real things too. Another example? In Ant-Man and the Wasp, when everyone is discussing Ghost and how her powers work, Kurt compares her to the Baba Yaga of Russian folklore. 

That’s when I got thinking about this speculation. It’s entirely possible the Baba Yaga was a real witch (she could’ve been a sorcerer like Dr. Strange), who managed to control Quantum Phasing with magic. 

In the comics, there are many more direct references from mythologies, so it’s entirely possible that the MCU is similar in that those legends are real in some sense, but have scientific or cosmic explanations. If they ever decide to introduce Blade it could be expanded upon even further. A stranger enters the home of two children while their guardian is away and wants to play.  In order to do this he releases two "Things" that he keeps in a box.  

Notice that the latch is *on the outside of the box*.  Thing 1 and Thing 2 are not free, they are slaves.  Child-sized slaves that do the bidding of the Cat.

The kids don't recognize him -- he's a stranger.  This will land you in jail in pretty much any country.  

And the Cat is clearly not just an ordinary anthropomorphic cat.  He has abilities that suggest the use of the supernatural.  Many of the actions he performs violate the laws of physics -- pulling objects from thin air, balancing/levitating objects, cleaning/repairing broken objects, etc.  He is undoubtedly a practitioner of some form of magic.

The reason that a sorcerer like this engages in home invasions of minors is that this is how he procures new "Things" to put in his box.  He goads the children into doing increasingly reckless stunts in order to ensnare them.  In a similar manner to the [boys being turned into donkeys in Pinnocchio](https://youtu.be/tgmfV5VLHvs?t=42), the Cat must get the children to transgress in order for them to be transformed.

This is why the Cat abuses the Fish and attempts to silence him.  As the voice of responsibility, the Fish is curtailing the children's actions, thwarting their transformation.

Fortunately for the kids, this is where the story ends.  Their mother comes home early and the Cat flees, careful to remain unseen.

Had the mother not returned when she did, Sally and her brother would have ended up in that box wearing silly, vacant grins as Thing 3 and Thing 4.
So in the old cartoons I and many others grew up with Bruce and Diana have chemistry but never act on it. In fact in this episode clip they address why. 

https://youtu.be/LemY3KuQs-M

Now Bruce makes valid points but I believe he left out the biggest reason or was about to get to it before being interupted. 

Batman is paranoid, he has plans to take down the JLA and even set up the league as a way to take him down if he ever went rogue. He uses logic and sticks to the facts over wants and desires 9 times out of 10. Paranoia keeps him from being with Diana. 

Imagine Bruce Wayne: photographic memory, iron will, incredible genetics, genius level intellect, one of the greatest forensic minds in the universe, incredible funding and resources gets with Diana: deadly warrior woman, incredible strenght, magical weaponry, skills in leadership and problem solving, equally powerful will and slight inclination towards violence due to her upbringing. 

That child would be arguably the most powerful and dangerous individual in the world equal to only the child of a kryptonian and most likely far more intelligent and violent. The natural heir to the world of amazons and possibly the most saught after to lead the league of assassins. If this child were led astray by say an enemy or just overly protective parents who didn't have very good parents or stable upbringings themselves you have the biggest threat anyone ever heard of. 

*In conclusion Bruce+Diane= Hyper intelligent, highly skilled, super powered heir of two powerful armies/empires that could possibly be less than stable as either a hero or villain. The possibility of birthing the greatest villain in all of the history of the multiverse would absolutely cause Bruce to keep his Lil Wayne under wraps and deny himself a happy life with the woman he respects. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for nerding out. Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the main character of No Country For Old Men. The film begins and ends with his character, and the title refers to him. With that in mind, allow me to show you why I think we never see the real "Anton Chigurh" in this film. I'll try to break it down into three points.

# 1. Ed Tom Bell is telling the story

At the beginning of the film, Ed Tom Bell is narrating the story. *"The crime you see now it's hard to even take its measure..."* Then, we see Chigurh being arrested by the side of an empty road, seemingly being escorted out of the desert itself. (This represents Ed Tom's lack of knowledge about where he comes from before the beginning of the story). Every time Chigurh commits a crime thereafter, a few scenes later, either Ed Tom shows up at the crime scene or is told the details of it by Wendell. Now, that's fairly standard fare for cop-and-robber stories, except one unusual detail is this: Every single time, Ed Tom takes one look around the crime scene and perfectly guesses what happened. He looks at the dirt, the bodies, the blood, and then just lays out exactly what we saw happen three scenes earlier. He never gets one detail wrong. Not one. This is because Chigurh's side of the story, as we see it, is not what *actually* happened. It's what Ed Tom Bell *thinks* happened. The film is not an objective view of the story, it's a **subjective** one.

# 2. Ed Tom Bell doesn't know what Anton Chigurh looks like

Given that we understand that this is Ed Tom's subjective version of the story, we now need to establish that "Anton Chigurgh" is also Ed Tom's subjective version of "the bad guy". And this is the part of the story he knows the least about, because there is very little information to work from. Ed Tom and Anton Chigurh never meet in the film, nor is Chigurh ever photographed. Ed Tom is never even told his name. The only thing Ed Tom actually knows about Chigurh is what he deduces from the crime scenes. *"Looking for a man who has recently drunk milk..."* Everything about "Anton Chigurh" (including that name) are imagined by Ed Tom as he looks at these crime scenes and tries to piece together how things ended up the way they did. This is why the name Anton Chigurh is so hard to place. What's the country of origin on that? That's why Chigurh looks so strange. Ed Tom is trying his best to merge the eye witness accounts of what he looks like with the carnage he leaves behind, and ends up with this strange looking image in his mind's eye.

There is even a scene where Ed Tom Bell sits on the couch in Llewellyn's trailer and looks at himself in the reflection of the TV. A few scenes earlier, Chigurh did the exact same thing and the shots mirror each other perfectly. Why? Because Ed Tom knows that Chigurh sat on that couch and drank a glass of milk, but he doesn't know any more about him than that. So the view he gets of Chigurh is the exact same view he has of himself in that same spot.

Then of course there is the climactic scene where Ed Tom returns to the motel and finds that the lock has been shot off (indicating that Chigurh either is inside, or was inside at some point). Ed Tom draws his gun and moves to the door. Then, we cut inside the motel room and see Chigurh lingering in the shadows. When Ed Tom enters the room, we discover that it is empty, and there is nowhere Chigurh could've escaped to. So, clearly, Ed Tom was imagining Chigurh on the other side of the door. And given that Chigurh looks the same in his imagination as he does in every other scene, then every other scene must've taken place in his imagination too, right? Otherwise how could he have known what Chigurh looks like?

For these reasons, I think it's quite clear that Chigurh and everything about his identity are figments of Ed Tom Bell's imagination. But why is this theory even worth entertaining? Because, everything about Chigurh's depcition in the film gives us a greater insight into our protagonist, Ed Tom Bell.

# 3. Anton Chigurh doesn't literally flip a coin

Given that we now understand that Anton Chigurh is a figment of Ed Tom's imagination, we can delve deeper into the specifics of his characteristics and figure out why Ed Tom imagined them that way and what they represent. I believe that, to Ed Tom, Anton Chigurh represents evil. And one of the things in the story we know Ed Tom cannot understand is evil. When he reads the story in the newspaper about the couple who kill old people and cash their social security checks, he can't fathom it. He figures maybe the TV set was broken. And when it comes to Anton Chigurh, he can't wrap his mind around the apparent lack of reasoning behind who is killed and who is left alive. It seems almost... *random*. And this is represented in his mind as a coin toss. A coin toss is the only way Ed Tom can make sense of these acts of evil.

# 4. Chigurh's dialogue reflects Ed Tom's internal struggles

As this case becomes more and more important to Ed Tom, Chigurh begins to speak more and more to his victims, eventually having fully formed philosophical conversations with his victims before he kills them. At one point, he asks Carson Welles: "If the rule you lived by led you to this, of what use was the rule?" To me, this seems more like a question Ed Tom was asking himself than a question Chigurh would ask.

# 5. Chigurh gets away

The ending of the film is infamously open-ended, but to me, through the lens of this theory, Chigurh escaping the car crash alive and disappearing off into world again represents Ed Tom Bell's acceptance that evil does exist, and that he cannot stop it. The shot of Chigurh walking off cross fades to Ed Tom Bell staring out the window, lost in thought, clearly imagining that very moment in his mind. Then, he turns back to his wife, and tells her about a dream of meeting his father out in the wild. He has accepted that the world has moved on without him, that you "can't stop what's coming", and that the country he lives in is...

No Country For Old Men

EDIT 1: This theory is specifically about the film. I am not talking about the book whatsoever.

EDIT 2: Another point that occured to me today, relating to the book vs. film topic, which I will lay out below.

# 6. The changes from book to film

The Coens changed two important parts of Chigurh's story: The beginning and the ending. In the beginning of the book, we know where Anton Chigurh comes from (including the reason for his arrest), and at the end we know where he goes and what happens to the money. But because Ed Tom Bell doesn't ever have this information in the film, and the film is told from his perspective, these details are not depicted. In the beginning, he shows up out of the desert. And in the end, he hobbles off down the street. This represents the blank spots in Ed Tom's understanding of Chigurh.  It isn’t a secret how beautifully intricate Gravity Falls is. From Blindin Blandon popping up all around the episodes of season 1 leading up to his episode, to little details like Stan finding Ford’s old glasses and just mopping with them for the whole episode. 

 In a book, Dipper and Mabel basically meet God whose name is Axolotl. And each are allowed to ask one question. Dipper asks about Bill’s origin and when he does so, the god responds with a poem.

Sixty Degrees Come in Threes,
Watches from within Birch Trees,
Saw his own dimensions burn,
Misses home and can’t return,
Says he’s happy. He’s a liar,
Blame the arson for the fire.
If he wants to shirk the blame, 
He’ll have to invoke my name,
One way to absolve his crime,
A different form, a different time.

Although the book isn’t canon, Hirsch said that this origin of Bill is canon. Especially with Bill’s last words are Axolotl which would be invoking his name.

So, my theory is, that poem is actually the lyrics to the Gravity Falls theme song. While rewatching the show, I started singing it with the song for fun and it lined up nearly perfect. 

And lastly, the final image of the theme song is Bill’s outline. Which lines up with A different form a different time.

But, why would that be the theme song? That’s easy. Gravity Falls is Bill’s story. As much as Gravity Falls is about Dipper and Mabel, the main characters are Stan, Ford, and Bill. Ford made the deal with Bill, Stan tried to avenge his brother and fell into Bill’s trap. And Stan kills Bill in the end.It seems like Dumbledore is just blatantly favoring Gryffindor by giving the exact right number of points it takes to beat Slytherin at the end of the year. However, given that Dumbledore has always been a very fair and reasonable person, I don't think that this is the case. 

The movies put a (somewhat) more reasonable spin on Snape, but in the books he's straight-up abusive and makes no attempt to hide his blatant favoritism toward Slytherin. He takes points from Hermione just for having the right answers (10 points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all) and for helping Neville brew a proper potion when Snape threatened to feed whatever botched concoction Neville makes to his (Neville's) toad. Snape, while refereeing a Quidditch match, allowed Slytherin to get away with blatant fouls and rule-breaking. Etc. 

Dumbledore would be aware of his favoritism. It's probably in part why Slytherin wins the house cup so many years in a row before Harry arrives at school. And so I think when several students did something truly noteworthy toward the end of the year, he had the ability to award liberal points to make up for those lost. This is my first fan theory, go easy on me

So from what we see, the joker a very smart tactician, has very good fighting skills, and also very knowledgable of officials. This has me to speculate that he may have been a war veteran. 

His superb fighting, being able to overpower a door guard, almost beating batman, and easily making a pencil disappear might be from military training. his precise planning, from the bank heist, to the escape from the police station, even the last scene, it's all planned perfectly, might imply that he was a high ranking general or tactician of some sort. And he knows a lot about "the system", meaning he probably worked for the government, but ended up hating it. Another note, during the police burial ritual, he seemed to know what the movements were, perfectly, implying he has had some training.

Also, war has been known to make people " Insane", and his strong almost painless resistance to batmans interrogation might imply that he was a prisoner or even a hostage once.

Thoughts?

Edit: a lot of people have pointed out that he was probably more of a spec ops agent, when you think about it, it may be true. And his psychological manipulating might mean he was some sort of spy.

Let's start with what we know about the movie. Noir thriller, giving us an flawed Batman. It has been strongly rumored that we'll get 6 villains; 4 of them are confirmed: Riddler, Catwoman, Falcone and Penguin. However, everyone involved is always talking about corruption (remember this), not mafia ou serial killers. From here, we can already assume that Gotham is dirty. Police, politicians, wealthy people. 

Now, the theory starts: Reeves is going to do with the Riddler the same Nolan did with Ducard and Ra's. The Riddler will be a Talon too. Maybe one that was kicked out of the Court, maybe not. Look at his mask and glasses. And this leads us to something else: he knows pretty much everything about Gotham corruption, including the Wayne family direct involvement. That's why he says Batman is a part of it on the trailer. As the movie goes, Bruce finds out Thomas Wayne corruption and ties with the Court, and this breaks his mind, that's why he is practically ending that thug life at the end of the trailer. 

Now, what about the other villains? Well, let's go with Catwoman first. Zoe Kravitz already said that her character will represent being a strong woman, while Batman represents being a strong man, and implying that she will be the feminine counterpart to Batman and probably has a big role. Catwoman will probably be an anti-hero, stealing information and secrets and maybe working with Batman at some point. 

Then, Penguin and Falcone. I believe the movie will show us how the city is dirty especially through this characters and Pete Savage (the Commissioner). Falcone will represent the Mafia involved with praticallly everything, Pete Savage will represent how Gotham police is dirty and The Penguin will show us how the rich families are tied with everything bad. I can see the Penguin being alongside the Court, and this being explored in the sequel. 

Now, the remaining two villains from the 6. One of them is of course the Court of Owls, as I've been saying. But what about the other one? Well, we'll get the Joker being almost exactly like Hannibal Lecter. And maybe we get Joaquin Phoenix, as his character knows how Thomas Wayne really was, Batman identity (he clearly realizes that at 'Joker' ending) and is at the Asylum. The young and inexperienced Batman will need help to understand a psycho head, and he'll go to Arkham Asylum to get this kind of assistance. There's a whole theory about it, on another post in this sub. Mattson Tomly and The Leopard whole script is exactly what I'm talking about, I linked the theory at the end of the post.

As the movie goes, Batman will eventually catch up to Riddler, but at what cost? His sanity. Batman will be reckless and brutal as murders happen and he can't stop them, showing us a relationship between him and Gordon close to identical between the two detectives on Se7en(Pitt and Morgan Freeman). He eventually locks up Riddler, but the Court will keep their power, leading us to the sequel, where Batman is obsessed with ending this evil empire, and most importantly, being what he thought his father was.

Edit: sorry for the English mistakes, it's not my first language.The Sorting hat is generally believed to be sorting based on the values or the characteristics of the students. People think that people who are brave are sent to Gryffindor, and so on. It's stated in the books that the hat has been around since the founding of the castle, and that it's highly intelligent. It's so intelligent, in fact, that it can recognize dangers and issue warnings about repeating the past. A simple object that sorts people based on personality or values doesn't need predictive intelligence, nor does it need to hide a valuable and deadly sword. In fact, it hardly needs to talk to kids at all. There's really no point in creating a singing, talking, mind-reading, genius hat to sort kids, when you could magically enchant the castle itself to sort the students, or to have their robes change colors, or something magic like that.

Instead, the hat is made to be a performer, who impresses the children with the values of each house, before very publicly and forcefully declaring them to fit in one house or another. Why is the hat a performer? because he's trying to sell the first years on a message - that they fit in the house they've been sorted into. The entire weird house system is set up to convince the students that the house system works. The first year Griffindors don't start out brave, they become brave over the course of the books. The Slytherins certainly aren't cunning and dangerous in the first few books, but by the last two book they're running elaborate plots and scheming together. Students become who they are because they think they can, because the magic hat (which is generally thought to be infallible) says so. **The hat's entire goal is to ensure that students are sorted into the house that they will succeed in the most, not the house they fit the best.**

The hat starts off with a loud performance, but that's not to entertain the kids, it's to establish his credentials (I am a genius hat who will sort you correctly), establish his goals (I will sort you into a house you fit into), and make sure the new students don't notice the rest of his game. 

He then proceeds to sort kids based on not only what they think will help them, but based on who they would be surrounded with, with the goal of maximum educational and life success. 

* Malfoy goes to Slytherin because, despite the obvious benefits of teaching Malfoy better attitudes in another house, Slytherin would work best for him. In other houses, Malfoy would be ostracized for being a shithead. In Slytherin, he may perpetuate unpleasant attitudes, but he works hard and prospers none the less. 

* Hermione is sorted into Gryffindor because (not despite) she would fit better into Ravenclaw. In Ravenclaw, she would be part of the pack, marginalized and content to hide in the corner and read. In Gryffindor, she is an outlier and becomes popular and gains confidence, and is never treated poorly for her flaws. 

* Ron goes to Gryffindor because his brothers are there, so he will be safe to develop and get over his issues with being poor. He would have been better suited for Hufflepuff (unpopular I know), because he's loyal, kind, and friendly in the start of the book. However, in his attempts to live up to his family name, he comes into his own, and finds good loyal friends who can encourage him to excel. 

* Harry only ends up in Gryffindor because he asks for it. The hat, being an intelligent object, recognizes that it's placebo program only works if people buy in. Due to his traits , Harry deserves Slytherin. He's cunning, quick witted, and able to work with others well. He would be respected and protected in Slytherin, and thrive there in a vacuum. However, the Hat recognizes that Harry's reputation would create conflicts there, and so instead sends him to Gryffindor. In addition, he knows that since Harry wants Gryffindor, he will function best in Gryffindor. 

All the kids assume the hat is seeing these traits in them, but in actuality, the hat is engineering the situations in which those traits are created. 
When you are travelling at very high subliminal speeds in space, even small space debris can punch a hole right through your hull and destroy your spaceship, Therefore, aliens usually have forcefields because of simple natural selection: only civilisations that have invented forcefields are capable of travelling through space to invade other planets in the first place. 

Secondly, alien invasion movies always show huge ships being parked over cities, shooting powerful beams at cities instead of just firing nuclear missiles. Again, this isn’t a ridiculous plotline as these so called guns are actually the propulsion systems of the spacecraft, here used to blast away cities, after which the craft is simply parked into the crater becoming an instant city on the planet, killing two birds with one stone.The only people who seem to regard "Doofus" Rick as stupid are other Ricks. And it's clear throughout the series that Rick isn't a great judge of character. 

It's clear that Doofus Rick isn't stupid. We see him make ovenless brownies using only some chemicals, and we see him make an insightful observation about the value of Jerry's collectibles. I don't think that other Ricks consider "Doofus" Rick to be stupid in terms of book smarts. It's something else. 

We've seen that Doofus Rick doesn't care about the fate of the galaxy, or tracking rogue Ricks. His methods of science are about simple ways of improving his life. He doesn't pursue wanton destruction, he doesn't bully others. He puts people first. 

Rick sees two types of people: bitter, edgy nihilists and naive rubes with convictions. It's clear Doofus Rick is the latter. And they find that mind-numbingly stupid. Dr. Strange saw millions of possible futures and only saw one that ended in victory and that was the one that happened in Endgame.  He knew that there was no possible way to win on Titan but that several things needed to happen and if they did not happen exactly according to his vision victory would be statistically impossible.

1.  Tony Stark needs to survive.

2.  Tony Stark must do enough damage to Thanos to make him bleed and demonstrate to him that he can be defeated.

3.  Tony Stark must earn the respect of Thanos during the fight so that he does not simply kill him because he can.

4. None of the other allies can die.  They all play an important part in the battle and in Endgame.  

5. Thousands of other tiny variables that could affect the outcome of the battle.  If even one person is standing a few feet away from where they need to be they could be killed, injured, or too slow to help out another.

Seeing that this battle is as important as it is Dr. Strange decided that he can not leave it up to chance.  If even a small mistake or deviation from the plan was made he would rewind time and try again.  He did this for who knows how long until everything worked out exactly how he planned.SpongeBob actually doesn’t say “I’m ready” that much, but he’s still known for it. In the first episode when he applies for the Krusty Krab fry cook job, he is at first afraid he can’t do it but then gets convinced by Patrick he’s ready. This is essentially what the show is about. SpongeBob doing whatever he always wanted, making Krabby Patties, and in his free time jellyfishing with Patrick or having company from Gary. SpongeBob is succesful and happy cause he was ready to be.

The other characters, not so much.
1. Mr. Krabs is a middle sized business owner. Krabs could very well open up a chain, hire more and better personnel than Squidward, and become even richer, but his attachment to his money and possible fear of failing when he expands disallows him from this. He’s not ready to invest and get even richer.
2. Squidward always thought he would become a clarinet player and the Krusty Krab was just a stop on the way. Besides not having the talent for being clarinet player he also doesn’t have the guts to leave the Krutsy Krab for a better job, because leaving the KK means he’s letting go of his dreams and admits he didn’t end up succesful after the Krusty Krab. Note how most of the time he’s just hanging at the KK doing the bare minimum and hating his job, sounds pretty depressed to me.
3. Patrick is shown to care about success in some episodes. He wished he had something he was good at but he’s afraid that he will fail. Hence he sits at home and copes with eating a lot.
4. Sandy came down to Bikini Bottom to do research but instead most of her activities are just recreational; karate, chilling, inventions that only serve herself. This is why she almost got fired by her bosses until the peanut cracker (which was again only made for her personal use) turned out to be good in peeling bananas. Sandy def. wanted to help the world with science, but got lost in luxury and entertainment. She’s like the main character from Hemingway’s Snows of Kilimanjaro, only instead of going up the Kilimanjaro she went under the water.
5. Plankton could very well steal the Krabby Patty formula making someone buy him a patty, but he can’t, he feels like he needs to mentally beat Krabs himself to feel good. He also doesn’t follow up on any other attempts to success as he is scared he will fail so he uses the fact he hasn’t stolen the Krabby Patty formula yet as an excuse to not do anything else that he could succeed in.

So TL:DR SpongeBob says “I’m ready” as it signifies he was ready to try and succeeded achieving his dream in working at the Krusty Krab, whereas the other characters could have been something they aren’t because they weren’t ready, for instance stalled out of fear of failingAfter the Destruction of the 2nd Death Star, the terrorist group known as The Alliance to Restore the Republic, or more simply, Rebel Alliance heald a feast with the native savages. At said feast they dinned on fallen and executed Imperial Stormtroopers. Evidence listed below.

1. The pure amount of meat needed for such a feast would not have been on hand for such a feast. It would need to have been hunted. But even for the most efficient hunters this would be a days long process. Unless you already had dead creatures, in this case Imperial Stormtroopers.

2. Human is said to be a rather "tasty" food. Much better than the rations that the starved terrorist fighters had to try to keep down every day. We know from Imperial records that around the time of the Battle of Hoth, the standard Rebel ration contained only simple items. With what can very generously be called a burnt sausage being the only protein sources. They were bad enough that even starved pilots, who crash landed in locations such as deserts or swamp planets were still known to forego eating them. Perhaps a heartier, tastier meal would have piqued quite a few interests.

3. Rebel leadership KNEW that the native Ewok savages had a taste for human flesh. Terrorist leader Leia Organa as well as the two men who committed the act of destruction against the first Death Star killing over 1,000,000 Peace Keepers, knew first hand of this. They themselves had been captured and almost prepared to be eaten by the natives. Only trickery from Terror Leader Skywalker kept them alive.

4. Where are the bodies? Having rewatched the historical documents numerous time, I have yet to see footage, or any evidence of captured Imperials. Either the Prisoners were transferred off planet(unlikely as to the Rebels battered fleet licking its OWN wounds, with little time, space, or resources) or the more likey scenario of the Rebel terrorists executing the captured garrison.  Which would lead to a problem of where to put the hundreds if not thousands of bodies. And I ask, have you ever seen images of as much as mass graves? Didn't think so.

The terrorists had the means in which to prepare this feast, being as there would be a lot of captured or dead Imperials. As well as the motive of being near starving, and needing protein. And the opportunity to do so after their decisive victory over the garrison. As well as no over sight as the peace keeping government was in shambles after the attack. I believe a combination of hunger and bloodlust lead to the consumption of human meat, and I believe there is no way Rebel leadership at least, if not the average pilot/ground insurgent, could not have know what they were doing.

Edit:Spelling is hard at 2am on a phone and you are dumb.

Edit 2: there were no mistakes. Just Rebel propaganda.No one really understand how the Scranton branch is doing so well. Not even Michael, or David. My theory is that the camera crew realizes how funny they are and if they turn this into a T.V show they will make millions of dollars. So they invest money to keep the branch alive. They buy loads of paper to keep the branch going thus keep the show going.With Signs being so old, I'd be astounded if someone else hasn't already come up with this theory, but I haven't seen it after searching so here goes.

To begin with, whole idea that "water hurts the aliens" is ridiculous on its face. The Earth is covered with water. There is water in the air. In fact there is a LOT of water in the air. There is water in the human body. There is just no way that the aliens are not going to notice that the environment and all of the inhabitants are completely toxic to them.

So what hurt the aliens? They tell us right in the movie. When the daughter is asked why she won't drink the water, she says that the water is "contaminated" and that it "tastes funny" and "tastes old".

Contaminated water is not rare, and many of the contaminants are highly toxic. If you get your water from a well, you can often find arsenic, mercury, radium or a host of other toxins in trace quantities. If it's from a city supply it can also contain excessive chlorine. Many of these are essentially tasteless, so they might go unnoticed, but perhaps a young girl's sense of taste is sensitive enough that she can detect them. The family also lives on a farm, so it's possible that the water straight up contains pesticides.  They mention that the aliens may be avoiding lakes in the area, which would also make sense if the groundwater was contaminated.

At the end of the movie they also mention that some small villages in the middle east had found a "primitive method" to defeat the aliens. It's possible that the method that they came up with was to just spray the aliens with a can of Raid or some other poison. 

So that's it. It's not the water at all. It's the arsenic/RoundUp/insecticide that was dissolved in the specific water in that house that hurt them.What if the universe we live in is Thanos’ successful Endgame universe? Let’s think that Thanos was successful in defeating the Avengers in Endgame and snaps his fingers (again). If this were the case then the “Big Bang” would be Thanos’ snap that wiped out all life and created a newer grateful universe and the entity that we call “God” is Thanos himself.

"The Big Bang"
As we all know, the Big Bang is a phenomenon where a small singularity expanded throughout the known universe. But what if the singularity itself was Thanos' snap that decimated and created our known universe? In Guardians of the Galaxy, The Collector states that there were six singularities (indicating the six infinity stones) that created the universe. So it seems that the Infinity Stones are the soul source for creating/destroying a universe itself and to trigger this, all six stones need to be used at the same time to pull off such a task.

"A Grateful Universe"
For those familiar with religion, one thing that all religions have in common is this belief that an entity we call 'God' created the universe and life as we know it. What I am implying is that this entity is actually Thanos himself. Before Thanos fights the Big 3 in the ending of Endgame, he states that he will 'shred this universe down to its last atom... and create a new one. Teeming with life that knows not what it has lost but only what it's been given'. To which Cap then says "Born out of blood", Thanos responds with "They'll never know it, because you won't be alive to tell them". If you think about it, everyone values their life and are appreciative of the life they have been given. We don't blame loss of life on 'God', we usually blame that a series of unfortunate events. However, we do thank 'God' for all the good things that happen in life and grateful for the life we are given. We wouldn't know that a group of heroes fought for our lives against the tyranny of Thanos because they were never alive (or existed) long enough to tell us.

"Where is Thanos in the Aftermath?"
In the event that he was successful in snapping his fingers again, there is a good chance that he dies from having to snap twice to do two extremely demanding tasks. More demanding then destroying half the universe and then the stones themselves. But in the slightest chance that he does survive, it is safe to assume that his 'endgame' is the same as that of Infinity War, "Finally rest, and watch the sunrise on a grateful universe". 2014 Thanos might be more psychotic than 2018 Thanos, but his motive still remains consistent. Thanos is not the kind of person that looks to be worshipped, but rather fix the universe and rest.

TLDR; Thanos succeeded in Endgame and we are just living in his 'Grateful' universe.My main evidence for this theory / speculation comes from "The Potter Family" article by J.K. Rowling on Pottermore. This article by Rowling explains the origins of the Potter family, including giving us information on James Potter and his parents, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter.

>"The Potter family is a very old one, but it was never (until the birth of Harry James Potter) at the very forefront of wizarding history, contenting itself with a solid and comfortable existence in the backwaters.  
>  
>Potter is a not uncommon Muggle surname, and the family did not make the so-called ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ for this reason; the anonymous compiler of that supposedly definitive list of pure-bloods suspected that they had sprung from what he considered to be tainted blood. The wizarding Potter family had illustrious beginnings, however, some of which was hinted at in *Deathly Hallows*.  
>  
>In the Muggle world ‘Potter’ is an occupational surname, meaning a man who creates pottery. The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century (12th century / 1100’s) wizard **Linfred of Stinchcombe**, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer’, became corrupted in time to ‘Potter’. Linfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Muggle neighbours often called upon his medicinal services.  
>  
>None of them realised that Linfred’s wonderful cures for pox and ague were magical; they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants. His reputation as a well-meaning eccentric served Linfred well, for behind closed doors he was able to continue the series of experiments that laid the foundation of the Potter family’s fortune.  
>  
>Historians credit Linfred as the originator of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used to this day, including Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. His sales of such cures to fellow witches and wizards enabled him to leave a significant pile of gold to each of his seven children upon his death.  
>  
>Linfred’s eldest son, Hardwin, married a beautiful young witch by the name of Iolanthe Peverell, who came from the village of Godric’s Hollow. She was the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell.  
>  
>In the absence of male heirs, she, the eldest of her generation, had inherited her grandfather’s invisibility cloak. It was, Iolanthe explained to Hardwin, a tradition in her family that the possession of this cloak remained a secret, and her new husband respected her wishes. From this time on, the cloak was handed down to the eldest in each new generation.  
>  
>The Potters continued to marry their neighbours, occasionally Muggles, and to live in the West of England, for several generations, each one adding to the family coffers by their hard work and, it must be said, by the quiet brand of ingenuity that had characterised their forebear, Linfred.  
>  
>Occasionally, a Potter made it all the way to London, and a member of the family has twice sat on the Wizengamot: Ralston Potter, who was a member from 1612-1652, and who was a great supporter of the Statute of Secrecy (as opposed to declaring war on the Muggles, as more militant members wished to do) and Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), who was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913-1921.  
>  
>Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family’s exclusion from the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’.  
>  
>Henry’s son was called **Fleamont Potter**. Fleamont was so called because it was the dying wish of Henry’s mother that he perpetuate her maiden name, which would otherwise die out. He bore the burden remarkably well; indeed, he always attributed his dexterity at duelling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name.  
>  
>**It was Fleamont who took the family gold \[from their Potions inventions\] and quadrupled it, by creating magical Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion (** ***‘two drops tames even the most bothersome barnet’*** **).**  
>  
>**He sold the \[Potter potions\] company at a vast profit when he retired**, but no amount of riches could compensate him or his wife Euphemia for their childlessness. They had quite given up hope of a son or daughter when, to their shock and surprise, Euphemia found that she was pregnant and their beloved boy, James, was born.  
>  
>Fleamont and Euphemia lived long enough to see James marry a Muggle-born girl called Lily Evans, but not to meet their grandson, Harry. Dragon pox carried them off within days of each other, due to their advanced age, and James Potter then inherited Ignotus Peverell’s Invisibility Cloak."  
>  
>— J.K. Rowling,[ “The Potter Family” ](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-potter-family)(Pottermore)

The HP Wiki also states, based on the books:

>"James Potter was born on 27 March, 1960 to Fleamont Potter and his wife Euphemia. Fleamont was an accomplished, yet retired cosmetic potioneer and entrepreneur best known for inventing Sleekeazy's Hair Potion in 1926. Both Fleamont and Euphemia were elderly even by wizarding standards.  
>  
>**Having been conceived so late in his parents' lives, \[James\] was raised in a doting household with little material limits, and pampered a great deal.** Hence, it was no surprise that he grew to be proud, arrogant, and boastful, but deep down still a good person.  
>  
>\[...\] **James was born into a very wealthy pure-blood family. He had an excellent relationship with his parents, who loved him very much.** His father was Sorted in Gryffindor and used to tell him about how the house prized bravery and boldness above all other qualities. James' parents were on the older side when he was born, and died before he was murdered in 1981."

By contrast, Severus Snape's background, parentage, and upbringing is cited as follows by the HP Wiki:

>"Severus Snape was born 9 January, 1960 to Eileen Prince, a pure-blood witch, and Tobias Snape, a Muggle, making him a half-blood wizard. **Severus, whose father was neglectful and possibly even violent**, began to identify with his mother's family and created a secret nickname from his mother's maiden name, calling himself the "Half-Blood Prince". His unhappy relationship with his father may have been the origin of his disdain for Muggles. **It is implied that Severus was friendless and uncared for by his parents. This lack of care largely shaped Severus's bitter disposition and cruel behaviour later in his life.**  
>  
>Severus grew up at Spinner's End, a shabby suburb of Cokeworth. This area of town was near a dirty river and full of dilapidated houses, disused factories and broken down street lamps. Through the rest of his life, Severus continued to return there when he was not at school. The young Severus is depicted as being unwashed and wearing ill-fitting clothes "that were so mismatched that it looked deliberate". As a child, Severus was neglected and his parents often fought with one another. He could not wait to leave for Hogwarts at the end of the summer.  
>  
>Lily Evans and her family lived in the same town, close to Spinner's End. After watching her for some time, Severus noticed her evident magical abilities and began making friendly overtures. The two bonded quickly and it appears that he was very interested in Lily right from the beginning, though she only regarded him as a good friend. **During this time he also developed a contempt towards her older sister, Petunia. This was most likely because she made disparaging comments about his clothes and residence but may also be because she was a Muggle.**  
>  
>Information from Severus's own memories of his first interactions with Lily and Petunia suggests that he was an awkward child with poor social skills. Even when it was important to him to make a good impression, he always seemed to have trouble doing so."

While the books make it clear that one of the reasons that Snape resented James Potter so much - and, in turn, his son, Harry Potter - was because James and his friends bullied Snape while they were at Hogwarts, I think a lot of people don't realize that Snape's bitterness and resentment towards James goes far deeper than just that aspect.

For example, from the above sources, which cite Rowling's books and other writings, James had the following, which Snape did not:

* "Loving, doting parents" who cared about their son, contrasted with Snape's neglectful parents
* Pureblood blood status and heritage, contrasted with Snape's Half-blood blood status and Muggle father
* An ancient Potioneer bloodline and surname going back centuries, contrasted with Snape's Muggle surname
* A famous Potioneer, or Potions master, for a father, and likely mentor, contrasted with Snape's abusive father
* A vast amount of wealth, riches, and a lavish lifestyle, contrasted with Snape's poverty and working-class one

As Snape was Sorted into Slytherin, a House known to especially value these aspects, I see it as very likely that he resented James on principle for simply possessing them. There was also James Potter's own arrogant, elitist attitude towards Snape, caused by James's spoiled and rich status and upbringing, that caused Snape to loathe James.

According to Rowling:

>"Harry...saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked." - *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

On top of that, almost assuredly, Snape learned that James was not just snotty and rich, but that the Potter family was famous for Potions, and of James's famous father, Fleamont Potter. Unlike James, Snape not only had a father who hated magic, but no father or mentor figure in his life who he could look up to, much less learn Potions from. Instead, he had to teach himself Potions through Hogwarts classes with Horace Slughorn, relying on his own aptitude and ingenuity.

Speaking of Slughorn, it's also quite probable that Slughorn didn't just invite Severus Snape and Lily Evans to join his Slug Club - but James Potter, too. This was likely due to James being the son of the "famous" Fleamont Potter, Potions master, and James's induction - and the reasoning - would be all more reason for Snape to hate James.

>“But I don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn. “Instinctive, you know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — **why even Severus** —”  
>  
>And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them.  
>  
>\- *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*  
>  
>\[...\]  **Horace Slughorn**: "*I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles. Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?*"  
>  
>**Marcus Belby**: "*Not… not much of him, no.*"  
>  
>**Horace Slughorn**: "*Well, of course, I daresay he's busy. I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!*"  
>  
>**Marcus Belby**: "*I suppose… Er… he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about…*"

I think it’s entirely possible that Severus Snape was resentful of James not just because James bullied him for years, but because James was everything Severus wanted to be: loved by his parents, the heir to a Potions business empire, a Pureblood, handsome, talented, popular, etc…as stated above, James Potter was "the boy born with everything".

James Potter was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and still got the girl in the end. Severus, on the other hand, was born with nothing. Despite his best efforts, he - the greasy, poor, bullied, Half-blood nerd - still lost the girl he deeply cared for to the athletic, handsome, wealthy, popular Pureblood jock.

>**James Potter**: "'*Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad. Got a problem with that?*"  
>  
>**Snape**: "*No. If you'd rather be brawny instead of brainy —*"  
>  
>**Sirius Black**: "*Where are you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?*"  
>  
>"In one of Snape's memories, Lily was laughing as he attempted to mount a bucking broomstick, so perhaps he wasn't always a good flyer...James \[Potter\], \[on the other hand\], was an accomplished Quidditch player, playing Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his school years. He was noted to have excellent reflexes, as seen when playing with a Snitch he had taken from the Quidditch supplies." - HP Wiki  
>  
>\[...\] *"Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can — I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK."* \- Lily Evans to James Potter, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

To quote what Hermione Granger said to Draco Malfoy in “Chamber of Secrets”, especially since James Potter’s dialogue directly mirrors that of Draco at one point: *“At least no one on \[our\] team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.”* Indeed, the relationship between young Severus Snape and James Potter at Hogwarts seems to somewhat mirror that of Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy in the books, especially since [James's dialogue directly mirrors that of Malfoy at one point](https://imgur.com/wiQLGdl). (Discussion thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3s7q1r/draco_malfoy_and_james_potter_i_seem_to_be_more/).)

Given how Draco Malfoy treats Ron Weasley, and the Weasley family in general, as well as Rowling having James Potter echo Malfoy directly, I wouldn't say it's much of a stretch to assume that James Potter treated Snape in a similarly elitist, condescending fashion. A young Snape, after all, was clearly from a poor family, just like Ron Weasley was.

>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children **than they can afford**."  
>  
>\[...\]  “Longbottom, if brains were gold, you'd be **poorer than Weasley**, and that's saying something.”

I also posit that, while Snape quickly came to hate James Potter with a passion, resenting his popularity, Pureblood background, wealth, and more, I also feel that Snape longed to be someone like James Potter. I say this because J.K. Rowling originally intended to introduce a similar Slytherin character into the books, Mafalda, as a rival to Hermione Granger.

>"Mafalda was supposed to convey certain information about the Death Eaters to Harry, Ron and Hermione, because as **a nosy, eavesdropping Slytherin who likes to impress**, she does not keep her mouth shut when she overhears their sons and daughters talking.  
>  
>The best thing about Mafalda was that she was a match for Hermione. **To the latter's horror, Mafalda was highly gifted and a real show-off, so that Hermione was torn between deploring the rule-breaking, and longing to join in and beat her.**” - J.K. Rowling, ["Malfada - 'Goblet of Fire'"](https://web.archive.org/web/20040803113633/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=3)

On top of that, it appears that James not only had a Potions master for a father, but inherited his father’s and family’s talent for Potions as well. As per the HP Wiki:

>“James was exceptionally proficient in potion-making - at the age of fifteen, he successfully brewed an effective [Animagus Potion](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Animagus_potion), which testified to his remarkable talent in the subject, as the potion was known to be highly complex, difficult to brew, and had great consequences if done incorrectly."

This would mean that *both* James and Snape were talented at Potions, which likely heightened Snape's bitterness and ire towards James as well. James may have even been able to brew Potions that Snape was unable to, i.e. the Animagus Potion, even despite Snape being a prodigy at Potions himself.

This rivalry, especially to see who could outdo the other at Potions, would have only heightened their competition for Lily Evans's affections - since Lily herself was also skilled in the subject.

As per the HP Wiki:

>Potions: According to Slughorn, Lily was an excellent potioneer who impressed him. She had an "instinctual understanding" of the subject. ("*One of the brightest I ever taught... She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was!")*

Snape, already likely feeling inadequate and overshadowed by James - again, not unlike Ron Weasley - likely pressed himself to become as "brainy" as possible. While he couldn't compete with James Potter's natural talent in fields like sports and Quidditch - or "brawn", as noted by Sirius Black - he *was* highly intelligent, crafty, and clever, and could compete directly with James in several other fields, including Duelling, Charms, Transfiguration...and Potions.

>"Severus was extremely adept in the art of potion-making, and worked as the Potions Master at Hogwarts for about fifteen years. His prowess at potion-making extended beyond simple execution from formally documented recipes accepted and followed by the general public. **When he was still only a student, he would alter official instructions with his own variations, which usually resulted in quicker and more efficient results.**  
>  
>He was capable of brewing highly complicated potions such as Veritaserum and the Wolfsbane Potion. Snape was also able to identify Polyjuice Potion by smell, and produce fake Veritaserum that seemed real enough to fool Dolores Umbridge (though Umbridge was not portrayed as being particularly intelligent with practicality). In addition, Snape used an unidentified golden potion to help slow a curse cast by Voldemort on Dumbledore." - HP Wiki

Both James and Snape were trying to "impress" Lily - with James especially "going out of his way" to do so - but Snape, because he came from nothing, was especially motivated to "go out of his way" to do so as well, especially to outdo James. This included Snape's foray into an extremely dangerous field - spell creation - and another, the Dark Arts. Snape also learned and mastered Occlumency and Legilimency, neither of which is taught at Hogwarts, on his own.

It appears that Snape was so motivated to master spell creation, that he even risked his own life.

>"Sorted into Slytherin House upon their arrival at the school, classmates would later state that Severus excelled in the Dark Arts from an early age. At the age of eleven, he knew more curses and hexes than most of the seventh year students. He was credited with creating a good number of popular spells like *Levicorpus, Liberacorpus, Muffliato*, and curses like *Langlock*, the Toenail Growth Hex, and his signature curse, *Sectumsempra*. *Levicorpus* and *Liberacorpus* also somehow became common knowledge around the school.  
>  
>\[...\] **Spell creation is the highly dangerous and mysterious art of creating new spells. Only witches and wizards with great understanding of and skill on magic are known to be able to invent spells.** It is unknown what the exact process is to creating spells other than crafting the wand movement and the incantation.  
>  
>What is known is that it is a very difficult, even dangerous process. **If something goes wrong the results could prove fatal**; an example of this is Pandora Lovegood's experimentation." - HP Wiki

Snape's risk of his own life was also noted by James in another instance as well, in which James saved Snape's life.

>"Severus noticed that Remus kept disappearing during the full moon and once followed him past the Whomping Willow (after being tipped off on how to do so by Sirius Black) to confirm his suspicions. **This act could have cost Severus his life or his humanity (he could have been turned into a werewolf by Remus's bite) if it had not been for James.** When James found out what had happened, he went after Severus and managed to save him just before he got to the Shrieking Shack while Remus was in his wolf-form. Albus Dumbledore swore Severus to secrecy, but the true nature of Remus was clear to Severus." - HP Wiki

It was clear that Snape "longed" to not only likely be like James, but because he couldn't - and because of James's mocking and bullying of Snape - he also "longed to outdo" James.

This is inferred from how Snape's own spell creations, completed at the risk of his own life, somehow became "well-known" around Hogwarts during his school years - presumably, because Snape showed them off and taught them to others, trying to gain more recognition, respect, and popularity - among other aspects.

This is especially true of both James's and Snape's abilities in Duelling.

>"Although he rarely appeared in any known duels, Snape was shown to be a highly capable duellist...He was able to hold his own against the extremely powerful Minerva McGonagall (who was capable of duelling Voldemort along with Kingsley and Slughorn) during their brief duel, before she forced him to hide behind a shield of armour.  
>  
>\[...\] Snape also easily overwhelmed Harry Potter during his escape from the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and **defeated him without much effort, using Legilimency to read Harry's attempted moves and countered them all before they could be cast**... **Snape used Legilimency on Harry constantly**, while attempting to teach him Occlumency in their private lessons **and later used it to effortlessly deflect Harry's spells and curses**.  ("*You \[do\] as good as your father did, Harry.*")  
>  
>\[...\] Contrary to the vicious duelling styles of other Death Eaters, **Snape preferred using defensive spells and only used aggressive magic when facing a weak opponent**, such as Lockhart, or **when his foe grew frustrated and started making mistakes**. Snape was never known to battle a Death Eater or ally to Voldemort (which would've blown his cover) but no Death Eater ever dared raise a wand against him (even the notoriously powerful Bellatrix Lestrange) and showed fear towards him, indicating they must have seen him display remarkable duelling skills.  
>  
>\[...\]  His magical prowess was so great as a teenager that his bully and rival, **James Potter would never have taken him on in a one on one fight**, unless he was backed up by his three other magically proficient friends.  
>  
>\[...\]  James \[Potter\] was \[also\] a highly skillful duellist. **During his student years, he was able to humiliate Severus Snape, who was already a skilled wizard in his youth, albeit with help from Sirius Black.** During the First Wizarding War he presumably took part in battles against the Death Eaters and other dark forces, surviving until the end of the war. He and his wife, Lily, also defied Voldemort himself three times, which showcased his exceptional talent in [martial magic](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Martial_magic)." - HP Wiki

It appears while James had the upper hand in fields like Flying and Transfiguration, Snape, through his own ambition and aggressive self-training, eventually surpassed James in the fields of Potions and Duelling. However, it seems that his jealousy, resentment, and bitterness towards James Potter never abated - especially since it motivated him to mistreat James and Lily's son, Harry Potter, during Harry's years at Hogwarts.

However, if there is one aspect that is surprising - but also likely - is that James Potter was *also* jealous, bitter, and resentful of Snape. These feelings, like Snape's towards James, also likely drove James to bully, harass, and mock Snape, more so than anyone else.

>"\[James\] never grew out of his hatred for Severus — according to Sirius, Severus had always been a 'special case' with James." - HP Wiki

Why, you might ask? Because Snape was best friends with the girl that James developed romantic feelings, admiration, and love for, Lily Evans. A girl, for years, according to Rowling, outright hated and refused to even speak to James due to his bullying of others, and yet who James pined after for years. James surely wondered, many times, how Lily detested *him*, but was good friends with someone like Snape - a fact that James seemed to hate Snape for all the time.

Snape, too, was also likely smug about it, and rubbed it in James's face in order to get back at James for bullying him. There is also the possibility of James's own father, Fleamont Potter, perhaps even hearing about Snape's prodigal skill at Potions - possibly thanks to Slughorn - and that Fleamont may have even expressed interest in Snape's abilities. *Especially* if Slughorn invited Fleamont to Slug Club parties, where Slughorn could introduce Fleamont and Snape first-hand.

However, though James resented Snape, he also saved Snape's life on at least one occasion - likely because Snape was Lily's best friend. Though the two were rivals, James cared about Snape enough to do so, while Snape willfully endangered his life due to his own ambition and selfishness. We would also see this later when Snape officially joined Death Eaters and Voldemort's side - a decision that, despite James hating Snape, he would have not celebrated.

James clearly didn't want Snape dead - even though hew viewed Snape as a "git" - and likely even was jealous, and admired, Snape for his higher skill and talent in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Duelling, and Potions. Whereas Lily was hurt by Snape choosing the Death Eaters and Voldemort over her, James was likely disappointed as well - not just because Lily loved Snape as her \[former\] friend, and cared about Snape, but because James viewed Snape as a worthy, respectable, talented rival. In James view, he also likely viewed Snape ultimately choosing to join Voldemort as "a huge waste".

After all, as per Sirius, James always regarded his relationship with Snape to be "a special case" - quite likely, in more ways than one.

Yet, were it not for James to begin with, Snape may have never been nearly as driven as he was to result to such desperate measures to get back at him, or "one-up" him. Were it not for James and his bullying, Snape may not have been nearly as motivated to learn and master the Dark Arts - and Defense against them - or to ally himself with the Death Eater-leaning faction in Slytherin. I think, perhaps, that - even in spite of James's long history of bullying Snape - that, as a "good person, deep down", James likely blamed himself, out of realization and guilt, for Snape's turn to "the Dark side".

However, it seems that Snape, possibly due to his inner pain, resentment, and tendency to hold grudges, took a lot longer to see James - or, rather, James and Lily's son, Harry - in the same way. It was not until *Deathly Hallows*, and at Dumbledore's acknowledgement, that Snape even begrudgingly deigns to admit that he "cares for the boy".

The two - James and Snape - clearly had a complicated, embittered relationship with a lot of friction. Both of them liked the same girl - Lily Potter - and competed for her attention and affections, like something right out of [Lin Manuel-Miranda's "21 Chump Street"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxIT0HcAHC8), ["Avatar: The Last Airbender"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0bynrUfhG4), or even ["Megamind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca0HKixICck) (especially the latter, considering [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FbB5yZipPA), which mirrors Snape eventually rising to the occasion of good). However, it appears that, while many see their mutual resentment of one another as based solely on both of them liking Lily, it seems as though Rowling strongly implied the relationship between James and Snape to be deeper, more nuanced, and layered than what fans tend to see at face value.

Given this, I would argue that the relationship between James Potter and Severus Snape - as well as their mutual feelings, and love, for Lily - plays just as much of a role in Snape's character and development throughout the series as Snape's relationship with Lily does. While Snape always snidely seems to comment on Harry's similarities to James - both physically, and personality-wise - I feel that, ultimately, Snape learned to finally overcome years' worth of anger and jealousy towards James, in his coming to care for, and protect, for Harry.Hold up, before you crucify me, just hear me out. 

The Elder wand changes ownership when another wizard bests the weilder of the Elder wand. This makes sense because given the reputation of the Elder wand, as a powerful object, it would change its alliance only to work for the wizard who was more powerful than its current owner. Power seeks more power. This is true for wizard and wand.
In the Deathly Hallows, Harry sees through Voldemort a memory of an unknown youth stealing something from Gregorovitch. 

>"Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern's light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter."

This scene depicts Grindelwald stealing, what we later find out to be, the Elder wand. Now, as theft is a cowardly action, and because Grindelwald never forced the Wands position from Gregorovitch, but merely missed him with a stunning spell, how can we justify explaining the allegiance of the Elder wand changing to Grindelwald? 

If Gregorovitch was always the true master of the Elder wand, Dumbledore never was even though Dumbledore bested Grindelwald and claimed physical position of it. Voldemort killed Gregorovitch and became the true master of the Elder wand. He was dissatisfied with its power, not because the Elder wand was not preforming properly, but because at this point Voldemort was less of a wizard! 

More than half of Voldemort's horcruxes were already destroyed when he decided the wand wasn't functioning up to par. Of course, Voldemort is arrogant, he would rather blame the wand than his own prowess. But in truth he was less powerful because his fragmented soul was being destroyed piece meal without him realizing it. 

When Voldemort was destroyed by Harry, the Wands allegiance changed because Harry had bested its actual owner, not because Harry had bested Draco Malfoy, who was the supposed master of the Elder wand after disarming Dumbledore. 
The end result is still the same, but the path of the Elder wand Allegiance is different that Harry suspects. It’s been announced that there will be five Fantastic Beasts films. J.K. Rowling says the story will span 1926-1945. In Chamber of Secrets, the giant spider Aragog reveals to Harry and Ron that he came from a distant land and was given to Hagrid by a traveller. I think we will see Newt Scamander go to Hogwarts in the 1940s, maybe to meet with Dumbledore, and he’ll give Hagrid the egg. In one of the most memorable moments of the movie, Jules and Vincent are having an argument about the "miracle" that happened back in the appartment in the car, with Jules talking about leaving the mafia and all of that...  


Then Vincent asks Marvin for his opinion. Marvin says he doesn't have an opinion. Then Vincent turns around, finger on the trigger, and shoots Marvin on the face, which he immediatly says was not his intention. The next scenes do not dive into the question if the shot was accidental or not, but I believe it was 100% done with intent by Vincent. First, let's look at the evidences:  


1) Back in the appartment, after the guy that storms out from the bathroom shooting misses all the bullets and is killed by our beloved duo, Vincent and Jules took different actions. Jules is paralyzed, astonished for some time, while Vincent immediatly goes for Marvin in the corner and asks him why he did not warn them there was a man hidden with a gun. At this moment, Vincent probably deduces that Marvin is a traitor and not reliable, and tried to set up his and Jules demise. But since the guy in the bathroom was too nervous and messed things up by coming to their rescue too late, the plan was screwed. Before Marvin can produce an answer, Jules starts to talk about the miracles and stuff and gets Vincent attention from Marvin, so Marvin never gives Vincent an answer. As the three leaves the appartment, Vincent is still thinking about Marvin's true intentions, and now have a firm opinion that he is not to be trusted, but can't tell that to Jules, who is too focused on his miracle's argument about the previous incident.  


2) While in the car, Vincent keeps his gun on his hand, despite him and Jules usually leaving their guns on the trunk of the car. The miracle's arguments goes on, but then Vincent decides that Marvin is some sort a traitor with a personal agent. So he has to go, but he is also pissed with Jules decision of leaving the mafia and decides to do all by himself, with improvisation. When he turns to Marvin to say "Well, you got have an opinion..." he is holding the gun pointing directly at Marvin, finger on the trigger, just waiting for some opportunity to justify it as an accident, since he doesn't have much evidence that Marvin was indeed a traitor.  


3) Finally, I think the biggest evidence is his reaction. He says "Ow man, I shot Marvin in the face" like he has just noticed he forgot his keys back in home or dropped a pencil on the floor. Compare that to Jules who is all "MOTHERFUCKER, THE FUCK DID YOU THAT FOR". Vincent is too nonchalant. Of course, being a gangster used to kill people for a living, he wouldn't consider anymore killing a human being a shocking thing, but he is still too calm after killing someone apparently on his side  


TL: DR - Vincent kills Marvin on purpose because he tought him a traitor for not warning him that there was a guy hidden on the bathroom with a gun. He tells Jules it was an accident because he could not fully prove Marvin's intentionsA classic trope of  the relationship between Mr Burns and Homer is that he can never remember the name of his most incompetent employee, culminating in Homer going crazy and attacking Burns, thus becoming a suspect in the case of Who Shot Mr Burns, as seen here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E\_5E6W\_vW0E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_5E6W_vW0E) 

But I propose that, all along, Mr Burns knows Homer.

In season 2 episode 4,  Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish, the final remark from Mr Burns after Homer ruins his election campaign is that he will make it his mission to make sure Homer's dreams go unfulfilled.  See here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fj6HjCN8ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fj6HjCN8ok) 

This seems to be a considerably less abrasive reaction than we may expect of Mr Burns. Typically when under attack, he responds with threats of violence or death, such as releasing the hounds or the 'thrashing of a lifetime'. However in this case we see a much more reserved, sinister response. Instead of a one-off, catastrophic reaction, he instead decides to take the route of slowly suppressing Homer, grinding down his spirit over the years to come knowing that he has total control as his boss.

By this stage in the chronology of The Simpsons, Homer has already returned to the power plant and been presented with his 'don't forget, you're here forever' plaque. He isn't in a position to ever leave the plant and his wellness for the rest of his life depends totally on Mr Burns keeping him in the job. Rather than fire him, and risk Homer leaving to find more work, Burns keeps Homer onside in a low-paying job without hope of progression. We see in season 3 episode 11,  Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk, that Mr Burns is fond of keeping 'his friends close and his enemies closer'. We also have not yet seen Mr Burns be unaware of who Homer is, although we do later in this series twice, both in Blood Feud (episode 22) and Bart Gets Hit By A Car (episode 10).

Mr Burns clearly remembers the effect Homer has had on his life, as he always remembers other Simpson family members - not only by name but their role in his life. I believe he only pretends to not recognise Homer, both directly and indirectly, so that Homer will never progress and realise his dreams. When Homer is absent, Burns keeps up the charade in order divert any attention away from Homer - to make him seem more useless and unsuccessful than he already is.In age of ultron, the avengers take turns to attempt to pick up Mjolnir. Only Cap manages to budge it. But I believe he didn't fully pick it up because he knew how power corrupts.

Thor says who picks it up rules Asgard. Cap believed he was telling the truth. His two friends Thor and Stark have both turned arrogant because they were given immense power. Cap also knew what happened to Red Skull, whose great power led him to attempt to rule the world. 

So, I think Captain America didn't want to pick up Mjolnir because he wanted to stay as Steve Rogers and not get so much power, in case it corrupted him.In The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series, we see the adventures of Indiana Jones when he was a young man. However, each episode was bookended by an old Indy in his 90s. This old Indiana Jones always had an eye patch over his right eye, and a long scar that starts on his forehead and goes through the eye and ends on his cheek.

The show is most likely still canon because it was created and developed by Indy’s creator George Lucas. Also, Harrison Ford actually appears in one episode as a 50 year old Indiana Jones. Then, in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indy describes his adventures with Pancho Villa from the pilot of the television series to Mutt.

Considering the character’s age in the fifth installment, I think by the end of his adventure, we’ll finally see how Indiana Jones gets his scar and eye patch.Before she went through the door she told mobius she was going to "find free will" but during their argument she said the only ones who get free will are those in power. I think she is going to find Nathaniel Richards(Kang, He Who Remains). The info miss minutes gave her that "he thought would be more useful" was his location in the 31st century. She is in power with him on the new timeline and due to her personal grudge makes sure no loki ever exists. The final scene with mobius, he didn't recognize him even though he was notorious in the TVA for breaking the timeline.This is a theory as to why there is only one outcome among millions which leads to victory against Thanos.  The idea was percolating in my brain ever since first seeing Infinity War, but recently the posts about Iron Man learning and improving himself from each of his battles in the series got me to what I believe to be the proper way to understand WHY there is only one, or at least, what REALLY distinguishes this outcome from millions of others.  
  
First, some backstory on why this is a question to be asking in the first place.  It all started with my surprise at the weird statistic of only ONE success out of many millions.  I found this odd.  If there could be one success, why not more?  It should be relatively trivial, as you could make a minor insignificant change to your successful run, and thereby replicate it while still calling it different, i.e. follow the exact timeline of endgame but (as Strange) gulp twice at random at some point.  Same outcome, different universe, more than one victory.  I don't intend to answer this conundrum, and it could be as simple as Strange giving up or just accepting the one victory as sufficient (yet he still has to come back and do that reality over again? I guess?).  Doesn't matter to this theory.  What does matter is *this timeline is special*.  Having established that fact, my interest is discovering why.  
  
After IW released, my own initial explanation for this revolved around the meta knowledge that time travel was very likely to happen in End Game to bring back the dead and restage the fight against Thanos.  Knowing this, I felt somewhat cheated that all the struggles of IW would be rendered irrelevant by simply getting a do-over.  I wanted the epic moments of courage standing up to Thanos to mean something.  Thus, I came to think that maybe it was the **fact that they stood up to Thanos** that was relevant, even if they lost.  
  
Another factor to consider is that Strange's actions after viewing the future must be quite deliberate.  And yet, he fights Thanos, THEN surrenders the Time Stone.  I found this curious, as you would think knowing the outcome would make one rather decisive and not change courses midstream.  If he's going to give up the stone, why fight?  If he's going to fight, why give up the stone?  
  
These two points, that the seemingly hopeless fight was nevertheless meaningful, and that Strange must have a reason to BOTH fight AND surrender led me to this conclusion: it was a matter of timing.  Strange needed to occupy a certain amount of time in combat, but no more.  The conclusion I came to, was that it hinged upon enabling the destruction of the Mind Stone somehow.  The fight must be long just enough against Thanos to give time for the stone to be destroyed.  
  
But if you're Strange, why not just portal to earth and hasten along the stone's destruction somehow?  I decided the reason was that Thanos was already too powerful.  If Thanos got a clear indication there was a threat to the stone, he would immediately go apeshit and just crush everyone, rather than toying with them as he seems to do in IW.  I think this is plausible, but the weak point of the theory I had.  
  
Which brings me to my actual theory.  After hearing posts about Tony Stark learning from each battle, it gave me the idea that maybe **that** is the key to Strange's plan.  Not timing, but **learning**.  And that answered a question which had occured to me on my first viewing of EG: how did they assemble all the Snapped for the final battle?  What was that conversation like?  Did they have clue one what the FUCK was going on?  
  
This theory answers that as well.  The failed battle against Thanos taught them all they needed to know: who their enemy was, what was at stake, and what failure felt like.  It didn't take convincing, it didn't take negotiation, they were ready to kick ass as soon as they could be assembled.  
  
Now for my favorite sidenote to this theory.  It kind of bugged me that the Thanos defeated in the end of EG isn't "our" Thanos, notwithstanding his death earlier.  It just felt a bit hollow.  
  
But this theory highlights what it is about Strange's plan and the character of the Avengers that sets them in contrast to Thanos and enables them to succeed: **they learn from their mistakes**.  
  
Indeed, if you look at Thanos' character arc, he does the exact opposite of learning from his mistakes: at every point when a challenge faces him, he doubles down on his determination, insisting it is his "strongest will" that will grant him victory while the things he should learn from, as mistakes, are instead reframed as "the hardest choices".  When he is surprised by Quinn having the will to kill Gamora, he nevertheless proceeds with his plans, despite the fact that this (among many many other things) should indicate that his judgment of the universe is flawed, and leads to incorrect conclusions about the worth of other beings.  Similarly, when faced with Soul Stone choice, instead of learning as he should that some things are NOT worth sacrificing, he learns the exact opposite, and costs himself everything for a hollow victory.  THANOS DOES NOT LEARN.    
  
The Avengers, meanwhile, learn constantly.  I won't belabor this point, I think I'll leave it to your imagination.  Suffice it to say that the Avengers go through their various character arcs and learn from their experiences.  Perhaps more importantly, they learn what defeat FEELS like.  
  
In conclusion, I would like to point out how ironic it is that EG ends with the defeat of "not our Thanos".  Rather than this being a hollow victory, it ironically highlights what made the Avengers worthy.  Thanos' very first words in IW are:. 
  
>I know what it's like to lose.  To feel so desperately that you're right, but to fail nonetheless.  It's frightening, turns the legs to jelly.  But I ask you to what end?  Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same.  And now it's here.  Or should I say, I am.  
  
In hindsight, Thanos sacrificed his ability to learn from defeat, in order to obtain victory.  So much so, he didn't even resist death anymore.  Meanwhile, the Avengers turn back time, but keep their experience of failure, and learn from it.  
  
Past Thanos relives the events of IW through the eyes of Nebula, but he can't regain the moments of little defeat that should have instructed him to defeat the Avengers.  My favorite is the moment from IW when Cap stops Thanos' hand and Thanos looks down in surprise at the will of this insignificant being.  But there's also his realization of the cost of losing Gamora, his many moments of surprise in the battle on his homeworld, where multiple times he is almost defeated completely by the power, ingenuity, and courage of the Avengers.  He can't get these experiences from a video.  It's not the same as what the Avengers have learned.  
  
Which brings me back to why the events of IW matter.  Standing up to Thanos *matters*.  Losing to Thanos *matters*.  Experiencing defeat *matters*.  Fighting anyway *matters*.  It's how the Avengers achieve true courage and truly learn from their mistakes.  When Thanos does his slow motion march toward Vision blasting Avengers left and right, each of the Avengers attacks him without hesitation, throws themselves into the jaws of death.  THIS is why it was so hard for Strange to find victory: he needed a universe in which every hero had their chance to fight.  
   
They lose, but they learn that they CAN stand up to Thanos.  This is their victory, even in defeat.  This is Thanos' defeat, playing out before him without his awareness.  This is why the Avengers are better than Thanos, and this is why it all matters.  
  
That's it, thanks if you stuck it out to the end.  
  
TLDR the Avengers beat Thanos because they learn from failure while Thanos refuses to do so, and forgets what it's like.Like many fans of Star Wars, I have been recounting through the first Six Episodes of the saga lately as a means to 'celebrate' the release of Episode VII: The Force Awakens. During my watching, I noticed some things that I had not even accounted for in previous viewings. Get ready, this is a long one.

Throughout the Star Wars Saga, the Sith Lords have taken to naming themselves after certain aspects of their personality. Darth Sidious causes gradual decay to the Republic and those around him over time. Darth Maul is savage and brutal and prefers to, ahem, Maul his opponents. Darth Vader, when pronounced in German (actually Dutch), literally translates to Darth Father. Darth Tyranus is a tyrant of the Separatist movement. Why would the same not apply to Darth Plagueis?

When we first hear of Darth Plagueis, his 'tragedy' is being recalled by Darth Sidious, at the time Chancellor Palpatine, to Anakin Skywalker. It is implied, though no longer canonically confirmed, that Sidious was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis, though its pretty much accepted as canon. If this is true, then Sidious must have murdered Plagueis 'in his sleep'. Plagueis became so knowledgeable with the force that he could create life and keep those he loved from dying. It is implied that Anakin's 'Miraculous Birth' was due to Plagueis' manipulation of Midichlorians. Plagueis and Sidious were said to have dabbled in the answer to immortality. 

We know all this, but why does Palpatine, a man who apparently murdered Plagueis, speak so fondly of him? He recounts Plagueis' murder as a 'tragedy' and even enables him the title 'The Wise'. Is this all just a way to seduce Anakin to the Dark Side? Or is it something even darker?

During Palpatine's attempted arrest by the Jedi Council led by Jedi Master Mace Windu, Palpatine is injured by his own Force Lightning ability when it's plasma beams are reflected by Windu's lightsaber. Despite this, he seems rather untroubled by the idea that he is now a living nightmare of a man. Its as if, despite being a Sith and fueled by passion and mortal possession, he doesn't care about his own body. During his conversation with Anakin in the following scene, his eyes and voice change many times, rather drastically, something that is not seen again in the entire saga. 

Skip ahead to Episode VII and Snoke, who appears as a hologram in the film. He's visibly damaged and has melted skin, missing ears and nose, and has two distinct wounds on his left cheek and upper left scalp. According to many sources, Snoke stands around 7' tall. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/AjVY98j.png) is a broken down VFX model of Snoke. What struck me as odd is that Snoke's distinctive wounds look remarkably similar to [Vader's](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ThGde.png) in Episode VI. Its as if it is Vader just severely melted or [burned](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/dvd/ep6/pyre.jpg). During a burn, the softer tissue of the face, such as ears and nose or previous scars, will melt quicker than the skin, which would result in something very similar to Snoke, should the burning be interrupted. But it doesn't make much sense that Anakin decide to turn back to the Dark Side after death, even after he becomes one with the Force. So what then? Is Snoke just some random new villain in this case? On the contrary.

**Darth Plagueis *did* solve the problem of Immortality, and has been jumping from body to body for however long, lying to his apprentices to lure them to the Dark Side to be ideal hosts for his Dark spirit, which has become a parasitic life-form draining from the force, a Plague**. 

However, there seems to be a problem; Plagueis' current body has to die in order for him to abandon it for a new one. Its possible that the other body must be physically deceased as well. I don't think Plagueis, as powerful as he is implied to be, was simply murdered in his sleep by Palpatine. Perhaps Palpatine and Plagueis dueled after Palpatine became aware that he was being used as a future envoy for Plagueis. They fatally wound each other, and Plagueis jumps into Sidious' body, forcing his own spirit out. Or perhaps Sidious did kill Plagueis in his sleep, but was caught off guard when he was killed beyond the grave, and Plagueis hopped inside his body. 

Since Anakin is supposedly created by Plagueis, it isn't out of the realm of possibility that Plagueis created him as the 'perfect' body, one that would keep his cancerous self alive much longer than Sidious or Dooku or Maul ever could. But since his powers are intrinsically tied to his midichlorians, and therefor his body, he would not be able to create another body in a less powerful form, such as Sidious, so he would have had to create Anakin before he was murdered by Sidious. 

What Plagueis did not predict was Anakin's body succumbing to severe injury, but remaining alive. Of course, Plagueis would want his new body to have limbs that function, so he created the Vader suit in order to keep Anakin alive and fully functional. However, sensing that Anakin was indeed more powerful than himself, he intentionally made Vader's armor unwieldy and irritating.

Another thing that Plagueis could not foresee was Anakin renouncing the Dark Side to save Luke, who Plagueis wanted as his new apprentice in the light of Vader's body being as damaged and incapable as it was. However, Luke would not turn to the Dark Side, and out of Frustration Plagueis attempted to murder him. Once Anakin's more powerful (light-side) spirit had fully left his body, Plagueis took possession of it on Endor out of sheer desperation to remain alive. He was no longer concerned with having the perfect Body, he would simply have to find another. He had at least some of his new body's limbs reconstructed via cloning (which is why Snoke's limbs, or at least his arms appear biological rather than cybernetic, albeit small and deformed still) so that his body would not be as inhibited. It can be assumed that the rest of the body will be recreated piece by piece throughout Episodes VIII and IX.

After hearing about how the Jedi describe the Force and the Dark Side, which can be akin to a cancer, a sickness... or a Plague, one can safely say that Plagueis *is* the manifestation of the Dark Side of the force. If that's the case, then Plagueis must be destroyed to bring Balance to the Force.

This is where Kylo Ren comes in. As other theories state, Kylo may be a sort of 'Double Agent' for the Jedi, convincingly feigning his intentions to get close to Snoke/Plagueis. Then, when Plagueis is cornered and has no other body to possess, he will be wiped from the Universe, and the Force will finally be balanced. 'I will finish what you started.'

TL;DR: Darth Plaueis is a plague of a spirit who jumps from Apprentice to Apprentice until eventually he gets to Anakin, whom he created to be the 'perfect' body. But tragedies unforeseen made Anakin's body unfit to hold Plagueis' spirit, so he went after Luke's body, attempting to seduce Luke to the Dark Side. Out of desperation, Plagueis still went with Vader's body to prolong his life, flash-cloning biological limbs so that he could still be as in-tune with the Force. He still resides in Anakin's body, which is severely burnt, and is disguised as Supreme Leader Snoke.

EDIT: Vader is Dutch for Father, not German. In German its Vater.

EDIT: THE EDITOR STRIKES BRACKETS[/]: Wow, the response to this has been astounding so far. Thank you everyone for your feedback and your input, especially those with evidence to the contrary of my theory, for it allows me to think harder. Every comment in this thread will be getting an upvote, as its all I can do to show my appreciation. 

RETURN OF THE EDIT: Holy shit, my top submitted of all time. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and comment. Its been wild.After the loss of her lover, the vision, she becomes obsessed with wanting to bring him back. This she alters reality by:
1. Removing spiderman from the timeline (depends if sony makes another deal) 
2. Create the fantastic 4
3. Creates the xmen
4. would still have main MCU timeline the falcon and winter soldier. 
5. She would eventually alter time entirely and create the house of M.





Note: Oh and by the way I also forgot to add, this theory does tie in to doctor strange and multiverse of madness. I also think that dormammo made a deal with Wanda and that was how she was able to alter reality. Hense this theory.

But phase 6's would focus more on the skrulls. If you Have your own theories on this, comment down below. Thank youI think Gaston is actually quite educated and is just hiding it to fit in and keep his status as the coolest guy in town. The first piece of evidence is that he is the only guy in town who doesn't find Belle weird. In fact, he is infatuated with her. It stands to reason that this is because he isn't just attracted to her looks, he's also attracted to her mind, unlike the rest of the village. Secondly, we see him as smart and conniving when he needs to be. He comes up with the plan to institutionalize Maurice to blackmail Belle and also easily manipulates the townspeople to attack the Beast, just to get the competition out of the way. Lastly, [he quotes fucking Shakespeare.](https://youtu.be/xCENkwPiuU0?t=1m15s) In a town where nobody can read and their most imaginative lyrics are "raise your torch, mount your horse", this guy comes out of nowhere to quote Macbeth. All this proves that Gaston is much smarter than he lets on, and [avoids thinking](https://youtu.be/cSgQAYdEwLc?t=56s) just so that people will keep [singing his praises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0).He wasn't being flippant (made a joke about something non-existent) as he probably very well researched the personal life backgrounds of all the crime bosses present. It's reasonable to think that Gamble would be providing for his grandmother's care and well-being as this would be an age appropriate set of circumstances.

The Joker left it to "chaos" / chance as to who of those gathered would give him a problem or the most trouble to then make an example of his fearlessness - by taking the opportunity to whimsically dispatch of one of their trusted men. Gamble nearly immediately threatened the Joker when he arrived.

All this reflects the comics as the Joker possesses an obscenely high level of intelligence that unfortunately makes him an extremely brilliant short and long-term strategy tactician.

[https://youtu.be/L3oOldViIgY?t=102](https://youtu.be/L3oOldViIgY?t=102)

Note: I found that the correct spelling of the crime boss is Gambol, not Gamble - still interesting as, in the Joker's view, it was a gamble (a game of chance) as to which of the hardened career crime bosses would definitely attempt to take him out right there and then. Did he know absolutely that the meeting would end with him showing his in-suit boobytrap as a result of this and that he had to later on remove a powerful crime boss to solidify his position as Gotham's crime lord? Did he knowingly prove his fearlessness, escape the situation in an extreme way, and later establish his status all based on chance as it could've been any one of the bosses in that meeting?So originally, it seemed like plot convenient that the devils anus lead straight to Asgard in Thor Ragnarok but upon rewatching the first Thor movie the origins of the devils anus can be traced to around the hour-forty minute mark. Loki sets the Bifrost at full power and points it at Jotunheim, Thor then destroys the b ridge to the Bifrost and as it fall into space you can see a black hole start to form under Asgard. Earlier in the first Thor movie, Heimdall states that if he were to leave the Bifrost open its full force would destroy Jotunheim and everything on it, in other words a black hole. In Thor Ragnarok, Bruce Banner describes the devils anus as ,"... a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein-Rosen bridge...", in other words a black hole inside the Bifrost. 

Mostly an observations be interesting nevertheless.

In the original Spider-Man movie, he says “up up and away” and “Shazam” while trying to get his webs to work, meaning DC comics, Superman and Captain Marvel/Shazam exist in the raimiverse. In Spider-Man 2 we discover that Peter had a comic book collection growing up.

Imagine you’re a 30 year old teenage boy and you just got super powers, and coincidentally you love superheroes. You develop a guilt complex when your father figure is killed by a criminal you didn’t stop, and suddenly you realize: you’re a young white orphan male with super powers who just suffered a personal tragedy. You just went through an origin story!

And so, remembering your uncle ben’s words about power and responsibility, you decide the best way to use your power is to be like Superman! You painstakingly make a red and blue spandex costume, and decide to fight crimeThink about it.

Why are the majority of 10 yr Olds not in school? Pokemon is school.

Why have pokemon been around since the dawn of time yet humans know nothing about them? They do, but YOU don't because you are 10.

Why are some of the entries in the pokedex wildly outside the realm of physics and outlandish? Because they aren't real entries.

Why does information stay blanked out  until you catch it if we don't know about the pokemon? The info is already there, it's stored in your dex, waiting for you to log it.


And those entries in the pokedex? We are all familiar with the theory that it's written by you, or is seen through the eyes of the child player. I think really, they are just the former owner's notes on the pokemon they had found. Like how a kid doodles in the margins in your history book, some kid made up a bunch of funny facts about pokemonhttps://youtu.be/hLRSRfPfQW4It's a small thing, but it's always been something that's irked me: We're told that Adolf Hitler, Martin Bormann, Herman Goering, and Joseph Goebbels would all be at the film premiere of "Nation's Pride," but NOT Heinrich Himmler.

Himmler was one of the most powerful and most influential men in Nazi Germany. He is known as being the principal architect of the Holocaust. He was the leader of the SS and the founder of the Einsatzgruppen. So... if Tarantino was going to include ANYONE at the premiere, he'd certainly be sure to add the father of the Holocaust, right?

Well no because as it turns out, Himmler was [notoriously averse to the sight and smell of blood/death.](https://www.algemeiner.com/2016/08/02/in-newly-uncovered-diaries-notorious-nazi-himmler-recounts-nearly-fainting-when-brains-of-murdered-jew-splattered-on-his-coat/) He nearly vomited whilst attending an execution of Jews and vowed never again to witness that sort of violence (though he had no issue ordering it). And so it stands to reason that the idea of watching Friedrich Zoller blast enemy soldiers' brains out with a rifle for 2 hours straight wouldn't necessarily appeal to him.

TL;DR: Himmler was squeamish and so he flaked on the movies with his buds.Stanley Kubrick seems to be something of a magician-director. He loves making movies that are basically sleights of hand and distraction, and then later on another movie as a “reveal” of the sleight of hand movie. He did this also with clockwork orange and 2001 (both movies are in the SAME UNIVERSE), as I will explain below. 

And he does not disappoint, we get the “reveal” for the world of “2001” Right at the very beginning of clockwork orange. In that scene with the drunk man, we are told that the rundown world of clockwork orange actually had large “moon bases” and space stations “spinning around the earth“. This is an undeniable reference to 2001 space odyssey which centered around moon bases and large space stations spinning around the earth. The drunk man also tells us that all money was poured into these space projects, leaving nothing on earth, not even for simple law and order.

Now here was the genius sleight of hand Kubrick played on us. In 2001, we are led to believe that the world is utopian and shiny, full of futuristic space planes, well dressed people and gleaming technology. Although 2001 never showed us how conditions were Like on earth (clearly deliberately), we are led to believe that earth is also as utopian and shiny as space was. 

However, in clockwork orange Kubrick reveals to us the terrible truth behind all that glitzy space stuff: all that glitzy space stuff was built upon the financial neglect of earth! The governments around the world had poured every single cent into the space race, leaving nothing on earth, not even for law and order. they had created a mighty space infrastructure at the total expense of society on earth, thus the urban decay, the gangs, the general breakdown of social order seen on earth in clockwork orange. Heck, even the rubbish on the streets and buildings were not collected! A literal modern day/futurist version of the Easter island race to build megalithic statues at the expense of the islands welfare.

In essence, Kubricks 2001 and clockwork was an alternate history of earth where humans, obsessed with the extraterrestrial monoliths they discovered, poured all money into the space race to find the monolith creators in a collective, almost mass hysterical, state of destructive hubris. Again, Kubricks genius metaphor of the Easter island civilization trying so hard to reach their pagan gods that they gutted their own society. 

Note: I predict that some people will mistakenly use NADSAT (English language in clockwork orange has Russian words indicating some that there is no Cold War or at least a “warmer” Cold War between Russia and America which resulted in a bit of mixing of the two languages) to try to criticise this theory, but NADSAT is actually one of its proofs. In 2001, we find a peculiar sight: Soviet officers comfortably lounging in an American military space station and having a discussion there. Even though there was still suspicion between the two Cold War powers, having soviet agents as casual guests in an American military base would have been unthinkable unless there was truly some form of cooperation and understanding, even if cynical, between the two powers. Basically, the monoliths had forced a kind of “common enemy” scenario where the Americans and soviets had decided to put aside some of their differences and combined their strengths to pursue their space race goals (thus, the sharing of the moon base between the soviets and the americans, again unthinkable even today). This would inevitably have led to NADSAT, in the same way as japan coming into America’s sphere of influence in our own world had indeed created syncretic cultures such as the anime subculture and its terminologies flowing into the mainstream English language, among them examples like the words “Waifu”, “hikkomori” and “weeboo”.

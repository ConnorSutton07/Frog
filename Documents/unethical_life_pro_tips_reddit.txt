I work(ed) for a small, local pizza place as a manager, cook, and delivery driver. I looked at my time clock one night to find I was clocked out on a 15 minute break I never took. I asked him what happened, and he accused me of taking 15 minutes after a delivery to sit in my car without clocking out on a break, claiming he was watching me live on the security cameras. I called him out for it, and asked for camera footage. He refused to give it to me. He was nearly sued for something similar in the past, and I brought it up to him and how I wouldn't be afraid to take this to court if it continued, and the argument that followed led to my termination. 

A few employees have subsequently left the store out of fear of having their money taken illegally, and out of outrage for my termination, and how the situation was handled as a whole. The owner, fearing he would lose all of his employees, has told me he wants to rehire me. I agreed, under the agreement that something like this never happen again, and I wouldn't be afraid to take the issue to court if it did. He agreed.

How do I make his life a living hell, inside of work, and outside, without fingers being pointed towards me?So I dropped my phone a couple months ago and I’ve got the terrible inch thick line all the way down my phone screen and it’s just doing my head in at this point. To get it repaired I’m looking at £150/$200. I can find just the screen for about £100-110/$150 but I just know fitting the screen is stressful. Is there any way I can get around this? Like insurance or apple care or something? Please help your boy! ThanksBack before Christmas, my friend’s (we’ll call him Bob) girlfriend reached out to me to ask if me and my wife would see a comedy show and then possibly stay the night in the city at a hotel with them (separate room). This was Bob’s surprise Christmas present from his girlfriend. 

We’ll go to the show, that’s fine, but we REALLY don’t want to stay the night. We have a home literally 40mins from the city and we sleep like dogshit when we’re not in our own beds.

I made the mistake of initially suggesting I might have hotel points to get rooms for both us for free. She never followed up about it until today (2 weeks out from the show) and it turns out I didn’t have the points.

We’ll go to the show, that’s fine. But staying in the city is just a waste of time and a good nights sleep. At the time she reached out I was feeling a bit more extroverted and kind of forgot that sleeping in a hotel sucks. 

When she reached out earlier about it, I mentioned that I didn’t have the hotel points and then hinted that we’d be fine getting some drinks after the show and then heading home if she can’t find any hotels worthwhile. 

Unfortunately that wasn’t a big enough hint and she just sent a hotel to ask if it was okay and if we were to stay for this one stupid night it would be $300. Ugh.

I’ve left her on read because I don’t know the best way to ruin the hotel night idea. Bob is kind of a weirdo and really likes these sleepover events, I don’t know why, so I know he’ll be a bit disappointed but whatever.

Fuck, what can I say? I should’ve poo poo’d the staying the night part from the beginning but now I’m not sure besides mentioning that it’s more than we’d want to pay since I feel like that would prompt her to find a shittier hotel.

Fuck me. This is why I don’t like having friends. Please tell me what to do and how to get out of this.I currently work night shifts and have about 2-3 hours of downtime per night where I can go take a nap. My question is: what can I do to make my naps as comfortable as possible without arousing anybody’s suspicion?Edit: I am self employedSuppose you've been out of work 6 months, the gap looks bad, and you're worried about getting lowballed by employers who might think you're in desperate need of a job. Can you just say you're working for a company in your line of work, or extend the "end date" of your most recent company to "present"?

For past employers, I know they sometimes call to verify dates of employment, or get a reference if it's provided. But for a current employer, they would risk getting you fired if they called to check. So is this a safe tactic? Or will they likely double-check somewhere down the line?I’ve searched a ton of websites like libgen and none work at all anymore? I used to use them a couple years ago and now that I’m a senior I really need them.I was at Food Lion grocery store the other day buying food and I grabbed a ‘Family Sized’ box of Frosted Mini Wheats because it cost less per ounce than any of the other available sizes and times are tough.  I got to the register and as the cashier rang up the cereal, I realised my family wasn’t with me.  I held up a picture of my family on my phone, the cashier just smiled awkwardly and rang it up and bagged it.  I then suddenly realised that I could have photoshopped myself into a picture of a family off Google Images and she wouldn’t have known the difference.  Even without a picture you can probably just remark casually while at the register, “Yeah, little Jimmy and Margaret are going to love these Corn Chex!” and if the cashier is busy, you’ll probably get away with it.  I know it’s wrong to deny companies like Kellogg’s the profit they’d make if you bought 3 regular sized boxes instead but desperate times call for desperate measures.  After all this is Unethical Life Pro Tips so don’t judge me!In 2019 I bought an  hr-v but shortly after switched to a new bank for a better interest rate, and fast forward two years my bank calls asking if I know anything about a title being sent to me (I didn’t) a few months later they send me a letter saying neither the old bank nor the new bank have the title and paperwork including a power of attorney for me to fill out! 

Turns out I do in fact have the title, both the original and the copy! Now I was going to give it back since I have a perfect payment history and the bank has no idea I have the title but then I thought, why should I give it back? 

Any advice?The vent fans in bathrooms are just literally ported into the open space above suspended ceiling tiles.. this will spread the smell usually throughout the entire building because the walls don't go all the way up to the roof. Smoke in the walk-in cooler instead to safely send the smell outside.

Edit: thanks for the many helpful comments reminding me that walk-ins aren't ported outside. I'm high and didn't let y'all know that it's actually the constant recycling of cool or cold air that helps to kill the smell which some say doesn't actually work and their potatoes smell like bong water or something lol

Edit 2: so many people saying blow it in the fryer hood that I've gotta add it. It wasn't ever something I did, but I think still applies. Vaping is pretty legit too. Just please be careful and make sure there aren't cameras over your line, or in the walk-in for that matter. For all the haters saying this is shit, I counter your shit opinion with the multitudes who say it's tried and true. Those saying just go out back or whatever; newsflash- not everyone lives in legal land where they ain't got no worries and can smoke their weed in front of the law.. y'all stop pooping the party.I  stupidly took it with me on vacation, thinking I could catch up on some  work (on my own time!) when I was in the plane. I took it out of my purse, set it by  the side of my seat (next to the window) and ... of course, simply forgot about it in my haste to catch the next plane. The airline says they don't have it.

The  data was encrypted, and it wasn't a particularly expensive laptop. But I  do stand to suffer repercussions at work.

We want to pay them under the table and looking for some good ways to do this.Howdy folks,

For about a year or two I’ve been dealing with two different tenants in my apartment complex that both (a) walk their dogs off-leash exclusively and (b) don’t take their pets to the designated pet-relief area (there is an astroturf patch that gets cleaned regularly). Because of this, I have had these dogs come up to me and try and jump on me, and start barking in my face. Aside from that,  they have also caused certain areas to reek of piss because they’re just dirt patches that soak it up and then sit in the sun all day

I have had multiple civil conversations with both. Although they seem to understand, the next time I see them their dog is off leash peeing/pooping wherever they like and not getting picked up.

My proposed solution after contacting management about this a few times with no real follow up is to take matters into my own hands anonymously. I just wrote up a letter where I took the formatting from a Word document emailed directly from my management office and referenced the section in the tenant handbook regarding pet policy. I then said that there have been complaints from pedestrians walking by (one of the dogs is aggressive and has come up to randoms walking by the apartments - the owner does not seem capable of keeping it under control) I stated that at this time, they would not be charged a fee (a real fee listed in the handbook) but if we continue to receive complaints, we will take action.

Now, would printing this and posting it on their door late tonight after they’re asleep be illegal in some way? Or just slightly unethical?

Do you have a suggestion for something I could do that would actually be an ULPT?


Edit: okay, I got tired of waiting and went ahead and printed the letters. Will be posting them on their doors late tonight.TV was on sale for 2.2k December 27, delivery by costco branded costco conceirge service for the 11 of January. The delivery guys showed up saying the tv was not on the truck. Got calls from costco for past 1.5 weeks saying we are waiting for the shipping to provide a resolution. Today they said regardless of what happens in 48 hours a resolution will be issued.


Things of note:
TV is not longer in stock
TV had promotional pricing
I took a day off work unpaid 
I have had no tv for 1.5 weeks and counting
They have already charged my credit card 



I dont want a refund for the reasons listed above can I get some tips to milk this for all it's worth. I would take an upgrade or a similar tv (no sony) with a 7.2 surround sound system



Update:

After calling costco everyday, I negotiated I get to purchase a new tv with the same discount I have previously,  I also get a 300 cash card for pain and suffering aswell as a 250 cash card promoI appreciate any "ethical" tips 🙃🙃🙃🙃If you don't have a friend to help check your back turning signals and brake lights, get an oil change at a place like Valvoline and they will check all lights as included with the oil change.Basically title, I've already told them my rent was 800 which it was discounted to from it's original price of 1550 this concession was legit as they were moving us from one building to another and the new one only had like 20% occupancy plus my old neighbor was a dick (didn't mention the 25 dollar pet fee). How do I get the cheapest rate out of them or could I edit my original lease to have better terms for myself. Something small just like changing the date for my lease end date? I've played around with maybe saying I was on a 2 year lease to kick the can a bit but if I can pay less for rent I def willI posited this idea to the Annoyed Gods over in LegalAdviceOffTopic and was dismissed from the room with a wave of their mighty moderator's Cheeto-dusted paw. Long fuck the king, so I figured this sub would be better suited. Please halp

Title, essentially. This is in the US.

I wanted to get a vasectomy. You know what I did? I called my insurance and asked politely for one. You know what they did? They said, "Sure, here's a video you should watch. Appointment is in January." No problem, buddy.

It sickens me, though, it truly does, to know that in so much of our industrialized, wealthy, progressive nation, many women will get denied a tubal ligation without permission from their husbands because "what if you change your mind?" or "what if your husband wants kids?" even if having one will literally complicate your health or even kill you. It's baloney, that's what that is. Unadulterated poppycock.

So here's my inelegant solution which I would be doing for free as a volunteer because the system is restrictive and stupid. I find one of these women who want the procedure ("how do I find them?" is another question - or more specifically, "how do I advertise this service?"), I walk into their OB/GYN appointment with them with a cheap wedding band I buy on eBay to match my "wife's" most dazzling cubic zirconia, and I say, "Why yes, I am Mr. Woman's Husband, and I do solemnly swear that I give my permission to Mrs. Woman to do the little snippety snip." Boom! Done! ...right?

Obviously I have not worked most of the kinks out of this plan, but I want to help women who are struggling against our draconian American puritanism and wanna just not have to worry about getting pregnant. Do these offices do background checks? How do they even verify they got the husband's permission? Written letter? Form filled out in triplicate? Is this an insurance thing or is it a doctor thing (and thus will I have to convince one guy in a lab coat or twelve dudes in an office with my documents?) I am willing to go with the lady in question to the courthouse, pay for marriage licenses, have the procedure done, and then pay for an annulment if that helps the legal aspect.

Please help me upend this ridiculous, outdated modality. But... but how?

Update: u/WartOnTrevor banned me from r/childfree for being a "libtard cuck" when I challenged him for saying "Ovary-bearing people? Really?" What a swell chap! Lots of wonderful feelings from that one. I just love pissing off the trolls.For example, if you are taking a fake sick day at work, just say that you are feeling under the weather and can't come in. Only explain the sickness if asked. 

Like all tips, this isn't a universal rule, but I have noticed one of the big red flags when people are lying is providing an unnecessary amount of detail. Having further explanations up your sleeve is smart, but if someone wants a more thorough explanation, they will ask for one. Lies are also much easier to keep consistent when vague, as details are easy to forget or confuse.Your significant other will not only feel more loved by your “personal sentiment” but inadvertently think you are a good writer as well.


IM SO SORRY YALL! I was not my best person Saturday. While there is no excuse for my cussing, insulting and hurtful messages that I sent while extremely intoxicated. I am still grieving the loss of an individual to opiates. I was and still am very lost and that night I chose Cognac. And put focus on this post. I'm embarrassed and I will look for future opportunities to be a better and kinder Redditor.



Edit: I paid for a legal consultation to be completed this evening. On a Saturday night. This issue was bugging me. I didnt really have the very generously offered rate of $75. But he bought my drinks so who cares. Enjoy and 🖕you haters. 

Its long and  every thing I have said is 100% accurate and individuals saying it's fraud are ignorant trolls and miserable people who love to find something wrong in everything  I truly pity y'all now. If you want more than í provide below go get your own consultation. Do your own research. But I didn't have the foresight to think that the legality of first person fraud would be an issue. Im an unethical person sure. I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. Enjoy it at the bottom of the post.

Hint! Its totally a non issue and the haters are "silly and likely not attorneys  I didn't post in r/legaladvice or whatever because I wanted to pay for the privileges that come when you pay for legal advice.

This is literally printed in every advance app that is out there. They have to do this to call it an advance and not a loan. Loans require fair credit practices where as advances are still a gray area legally. You MUST revoke your Bank account's authorization AND your debit card authorization! Template email to send is below. You must send the email 3 Business days before the repayment date. Legally, they have 3 days to revoke but if you revoke in time they are required to cancel all prior Authorized Payments. Find your banks email address and CC them on to the email too. 

Here you go:

Klover, Albert, Float Me, Brigit, Earnin, and Cash App Borrow (for those lucky like me and have somehow gained access it it. Its still beta only about 1000 users currently can use it. I'm a lucky duck I guess.) Anyway,

They all have this in their T&C, Terms of Use or, Terms of Sevice. In fact you can  exercise the Revocation of ACH, Bank Account (s) and Debit/Credit Card Authorizations with anyone you've agreed to allow automatic deductions. Even those whose T&C state that authorization is "required" ...they aren't. Its just there to imply complicity with their authority. Basically they just say its required and unless you knew otherwise you'd believe them. Use this email template. CC your Bank's Contact Us email. Send before 3 days before the deduction. If repayment/payment due on Thursday you'd have to send in the email on Monday week of. If due on Friday, by Tuesday. If on Tuesday by Thursday the week before. Must get timing correct. After you rescind your authorization, DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE OF THE APP. You could accidently agree to authorization of auto payments simply by utilizing any service of the company. For example if the membership, Plus type of subscription is agreed to be be paid automatically you'd need to revoke that authorization as well.  Its best to work the apps up to get the MAX advance amount available. Then take the MAX. End use of app permanently. But if you need cash you can't pay back fast by all means do this for any qualified advance amount. 

DO NOT SEND REVOCATION EMAIL ON THE SAME BUSINESS DAY YOU REQUEST THE ADVANCE. Its the same business day and they can literally prove that on that date you consented to authorization. Empower got me on that one. 

Hope this helps. Unethical but practical. Work the system that's working us. 

Revocation Template:

Subject: 
Revocation of Authorization for ACH, Debit Card, and Bank Account Access

and

(If you allowed access to more than one account you need to list them here. For example, I'm on a family members account for convenience, you have to withdraw authorization for those accounts as well. Beà thorough. Be extra about it.)

Additionally, I am revoking any authorization for withdrawal from the following accounts as well.

Bank of America

RESULTS OF A PAID LEGAL CONSULTATION. Paid so I'd have the privileges that comes with paying an attorney so I'd know if I'm wrong I could put it back on him. He understood and respected that. 

I'm indeed correct on just about everything, as I had throughly researched the issue before posting so publicly

Advances are a form of obtaintaing funds usually from friends or family and creates a social relationship only. That's partly because the socially responsible thing to do is to repay the advance. Most people dont discuss repayment terms it's just socially responsible to assume you should give your friend the money back. 

The gray area of for-profit company making advances to just anyone is questionable. The lack of enforceable recovery that comes from the social relationship it creates has precedent mostly in small claim civil proceeding. There is a clear definition of what is a loan and what is an "advance" (GIFT) for the likes of Judge Judy  it comes down to the mutual understanding of both parties. The apps understanding, as stated in it ToS, is that there is no need for repayment. They made the understanding without consulting the borrowers therefore it is technically not mutual. Strike one.  They did that because having a mutual understanding that it Must be repaid creates a debtor/debtee relationship where the rights of loans even if just verbally agreed creates a contract and that contract of mutual understanding is that it's a loan and repayment is required. THEY DONT EVER WANT TO SAY ITS REQUIRED. THEY JUST PREY ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IT MUST BE A LOAN AND MUST BE REPAID AND ASSUME YOULL TREAT IT AS SUCH. Its not a loan though. You accepted the terms and conditions therefore you agreed that repayment is not required. They just don't advertise the fact because that's no good at generating income. And they desperately want to stay away from regulations regarding loans and debtor rights. You're not a debtor you agreed to that when you accepted the ToS. This is very very very shady. It protects them from the work and obligations that comes with loans and allows them to continue the "tip" bullshit usury rates people so generously give them in the name of being in a community that tips to support their "worthy cause" of making "advances"(GIFTS) "free". Strike two. Its straight up bullshit and there will be class action litigation in the future. Bet your ass. Regulators are very aware of what they are doing and there is work underway to reign this tragically assembled form of usury into compliance with related usury laws. 


 Loans and debtor/ee relationships creates certain rights and remedies that can be utilized to recover the debt. Like suing someone or a company collecting, garnishing, or levying the debtor for recovery if default occurs or the loan agreement is not being kept. They explicitly stated none of that loan-like recovery action will not be utilized. Again furthering themselves from being a loan. They gotcha. 

An "Advance" (GIFT) is a social contract between two parties that lack a mutually agreed requirement of repayment. Basically its like borrowing a $20 from a friend until payday. If you say to your friend "I'll pay you back on payday" and your friend says yeah or cool or sure or otherwise imply it should be paid back that's a verbal loan. Not an advance (GIFT). If it's never discussed it's an "advance" otherwise known as a "gift" to small claims judges.

They dont close your account though so your relationship with them has not been extinguished. They just won't lend to you until repaid.  There is not much, albeit there is some, precedent to refer to here. Its a new financial product and the companies are trying to push the envelope on if it's a loan or not. If it's to be considered a loan in any fashion usury laws would apply to them. They don't want that designation as they wish to continue to collect "tips" that are very much higher than can exist if a loan. 

They duped us all by sliding the provision of no repayment into the ToS and they walk a very thin line considering the relationship mutually agreed upon. You didn't agree to no repayment. You accepted that when you agreed to ToS. Its his opinion that forcing the nature of the exchange of funds into one that gladly welcomes repayment and will help you repay it but slick not tell you in a more responsible way that no repayment is attached and mutually agreed upon is (ironic and funny as fuck)......unethical. Strike three. 

LEGAILTY OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

He laughed, hard, and said it is not first person fraud because the expectation of repayment , with or without intentions to repay or not was extinguished when you accepted the ToS. The determination of intentions is MOOT when the rights to be repaid never existed. They didn't ask if it would be repair or anything else to do. You voluntarily repay them and voluntarily tip. But because the mutally agreed understanding was killed before you entered into this relationship with them there is nothing illegal about having no intentions to repay an ADVANCE(GIFT), or rather more fitting...A GIFT because it was never discussed, It was "mutually agreed upon acceptance of ToS," and their desire to remain away from the L word. They would never press charges or pursue criminal consequences for the borrower. Only someone with a loan would claim fraud by misrepresentation. If they did pursue criminal consequences they would basically kill the premise of the "advance" (GIFT) and weaken their claim they aren't loaning money. They are giving it away and dumb people who don't read the ToS of a financial  product assume it must be repaid and they complicitly repay for fear of the remedys available for loans. And hey they only help them repay because people do pay them and no one in their right mind Refuses the almighty dollar. For criminal chargea to be brought the LENDER (loan language) must file a report first. 


So basically id just like to say" F YOU" to all the turds who think they are attorneys on Reddit. Y'all really wasted your time on this shit. 


But listen don't believe or trust me. Get your own legal consultation and form your own decision. 

Having said that I very vehemently encourage you to share this information far and very very wide. They cant stay in business giving away free money. Lol. Explain to people the trickery of these scummy ass companies. Explain to them that tipping anything more than a single dollar is dumb and is really a waste of money and that they make bank on the ignorance of the borrower. Its shady as fuck that they consider tip amount when deciding if another advance should be offered for free. That practice is consequential. Shady. Bankrupt these bastards! 

Again get your own consultation please. This is not legal advice and i make no claims to the veracity of this summarization of my, and mine alone, experience and understanding of the information provided. I am not a lawyer. You should consult your own attorney if you feel it's important not to commit "First party fraud"

I have peace of mind over this post now. So while I didnt really have it, the money was well spent. 

✌️😁🤣😂🤣

Thanks for all the love Reddit!This literaly just happened to me. I was running late to return the rental and on the way someone crashed on me. Since I had hired the insurance I wans't charged anything (they didn't even care whose fault it was), the car got towed and I didnt't need to pay any extra day or late-return fee whatsoever.
I am aware that my employer could be using software that monitors my every move in real time. But I doubt it. That would take resources and it’s not a big enough concern that they’d do that. But Outlook has its own mailbox auditing feature.

1- Does it have to be turned on ahead of time to capture information, or can the decision to audit be made retroactively? I’ve clicked in there a few times “by mistake” so I’m pretty sure they’re not being notified of my actions. But it’s a different story if they one day want to review the history. Is there any way to tell if auditing is “turned on”?

2- What kind of information is captured? Opening an unread email must count as an “event”, as would then marking it unread. What about an already opened one? Or sent mail? What about things typed into the search bar? You don’t have to press enter to search either, it just filters for whatever is currently filled in. Would it be capturing every keystroke? It can’t possibly do this in my normal email could it? The number of searches would be tremendous. And I observe it only auto populates searches where I have hit enter.

3- Is there a way to circumvent it? Open the mailbox (which I’ve done several times, so not concerned about this getting me in trouble) and then go offline after its populated the emails? Restart the app/computer before going back online? Make any difference?

And I’m sure they could tear the pc apart if they really wanted answers, but that’s just not a realistic concern here. I need to cover my tracks “just enough”. In all likelihood they’ll never be tipped off to it by my doing something, but there’s a slim chance settings are reviewed, maybe once in a blue moon, and they wonder if anything was ever accessed. I just want the security of baffling that first, laziest, audit. Because I think they’ll drop it at that point.

TLDR
Does shared mailbox auditing have to be turned on ahead of time? Is there a way to know if it’s on? Does it capture my searches? What about “rereading” mail? Is there anything I can do to thwart it, however little that may be?**EDIT: thanks everyone! It’s been taken care of.**

For background: I bounce at a bar at a college town. We hit capacity fairly quickly on weekends, and so, of course, there's a line. People will pay us bouncers money to skip the line and get in early. Now, we're not supposed to accept bribes, but there's kind of this understanding with the manager about it – he's aware we take bribes, but so long as he doesn't hear about it, he doesn't care. If he comes up to tell us something and walks in on us taking money he'll yell at us, but that's a pretty uncommon occurrence. I make great money in bribes, which definitely makes the job worth it (normal pay is $9/hr + $40-50 tip out, which on it's own would NOT be worth it).

And now here comes to the problem. Next weekend, they're putting a camera up at the front door, so we won't really be able to take bribes anymore without getting caught (unless we find a way to get around the camera). This, obviously, none of the bouncers are happy about.

I might just jump ship and try to find a better job, but is there any way I could get my manager to a) take away the camera or b) make me a bartender? (It's fairly common for good bouncers to become bartenders, and they *do* make better tip money than I do bribe money). I'm pretty well-liked by the manager and bartenders, so I feel like I could have some leverage. I know some of the bouncers have been talking about quitting if they put in a camera, so once they leave I might have even more leverage, idk. So how do I deal with this Camera Problem?

I have a question regarding Amazon refund practices.

I have ordered some items from Amazon warehouse, meaning to private store is involved. All the items have arrived.

Since they arrived using different courier some of them are not marked as delivered. And according to the status on Amazon are to be delivered on X date.

How safe is for me to reach out to support a week after the delivery date has passed to ask about the status on the items. My hope is that support will assume items are lost and do a full refund.

I have no issues of scamming a company that makes employees pee in a piss bottle and uses fake social media profile to promote itself.
